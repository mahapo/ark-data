Dr. Dee named the various methods he came up with to derive angelic names after the Biblical patriarch, Enoch, who supposedly talked with God’s angels and ascended into heaven while still living. Enoch was a great inspiration to many magicians of the deeply religious Elizabethan culture, but it is John Dee’s work that has been most remembered to modern day and for good reason. The angelic language and alphabet channeled by Dee and his seer, Edward Kelly, is remarkably effective in opening up the imagination to currents of intelligence far beyond the human norm. This is still the case more than four centuries after its reception. Whether one believes in the literal existence of angelic beings living in a heavenly world or consider such visions as nothing more than products of the human mind, there is no denying the intensity and transcendent nature of the energy generated by even a casual working involving Dee’s angelic magick. i"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Of the many arrangements of Enochian letters Dee created to derive the names of angelic contacts, the two best known systems are the four elemental Watchtower tablets and the thirty aethyrs that surround them like layers of an onion. These constructs were popularized by the nineteenth century magical group called The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the primary source for most of modern magick, and its most famous member, Aleister Crowley. The tablets were prominent features of the Golden Dawn’s system of elemental initiation and provided a significant portion of their power. The thirty aethyrs, aires or planes, are best known from Crowley’s record of his initiatory visions therein as published in “The Vision and the Voice.” A great deal of personal as well as group magical work may be drawn from these challenging evocatory systems. The true power of Enochian magick comes from the angelic language, the evocative shapes of the letters as well as the pronunciation of the words they spell. Medieval ceremonial magick is replete with different magical alphabets and languages but Dee’s angelic tongue is uniquely efficacious in drawing upon the deepest levels of human consciousness. The resulting fusion of this atavistic psychic energy with the functions of waking awareness generates transcendental wonders of vision and spiritual contact. A direct access to a universal source of intelligence becomes available for the magician who is able to advance along this rigorous path of superconscious development. The way is dangerous, however, due to the torrent of unconscious contents that flood into self-awareness through the effect of Enochian usage. Some magical teachers of repute have recommended that aspirants to this mighty art undergo preliminary training and initiation into instituted schools of the ii"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" mysteries before daring even the most preliminary practices of Enochian magick. Others have suggested a thorough course of psychoanalysis beforehand. There are also those who condemn Dee’s inspirations as hopelessly destructive and unfit for use in any way. My view is that the individual operator may choose what training seems best for him or her, no one way being right for everyone. I will say that my ten years of training in two mystery schools, in addition to personal work and study with the traditional western magical system, was invaluable in helping me to deal with my adventures through the Enochian Watchtowers. As the records of my visions will show, some of the energies I encountered were overwhelming and initially harmful to an extent. My earlier preparations enabled me to adjust and eventually utilize the newly discovered currents of psychic power. A survey of the history of this uniquely powerful and wondrous magical system provides some insights into how magicians like myself have used it and what effects we’ve achieved as a result. John Dee developed his angelic evocation methods from the teachings of angels he’d contacted through traditional western ceremonial techniques, such as those of the Solomonic texts. He wanted to talk to God’s good angels as did Enoch before him. His extant diaries show many conversations he and his seer, Edward Kelly, had through the latter’s visions. They sought knowledge on more effective magick, alchemy, and even political information from other countries in order to serve their queen, Elizabeth I. The magick of the thirty aethyrs was specifically designed to wield control over lands all over the world through the agency of angelic spirits thought to preside over those areas. Their success with political magick was limited by all accounts but the work they did in assembling the Enochian systems of angelic iii"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" evocation continue to inspire many magicians centuries later. Dee’s voluminous journals and diagrams were mostly lost after his death. Remnants passed into the hands of antiquaries until finally, three hundred years later, the men who formed the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn rediscovered them. The Watchtower tablets were adapted to this order’s initiation ceremonies and inner order magick. Innovations were made to develop a full syncretistic system of meditation around each square on each tablet, complicating Dee’s original design far beyond its intended use. The system of thirty aethyrs with their ninety-one governors was less frequently worked by Golden Dawn adepti but this lore was included in the order’s teachings. In this way, reformed Hermetic magick and initiation were carried into the twentieth century, helping many magicians to grow toward union with God. The most famous and flamboyant member of the original Golden Dawn was the renowned prophet, magician, mountaineer, big game hunter, world traveler, and English spy, named Edward Alexander Crowley, better known as Aleister Crowley. His magical exploits and experiments may be read in his many books on the subject. One of his most notable workings was his scrying of the thirty aethyrs, done during a walk across the Algerian desert, accompanied by his scribe, Victor Neuberg. This record eventually became “The Vision and the Voice,” a book still available today. Quite unexpectedly, Crowley found himself initiated by the angels of the aethyrs into the magical grade called Master of the Temple. This very much surprised Crowley, since his Golden Dawn mentors had taught that no one still living could possibly attain to this grade. Only the Secret Chiefs of the order, the Ascendant Masters who guide humanity along its collective iv"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" spiritual path to enlightenment, could hold this office. The quality of Crowley’s record speaks for itself as to his magical attainment and the relevance of his expression of the new age in which humanity currently finds itself, the Aeon of Horus, the Crowned and Conquering Child. Fortunately for humanity, there were others to carry on Crowley’s legacy of new aeon magick and religion after his death. I first encountered Thelemic philosophy through his books and by practicing the ceremonies therein. It changed my entire worldview forever. Magical fantasy and science fiction stories had always fascinated me throughout my childhood. From my earliest years, it had been immediately evident that a new age was upon the world. The latest innovations of science, technology, religion, and philosophy clearly showed that a whole new consciousness of self and reality had dawned on humanity. Never before in history had it been more worthwhile to doubt and reassess the ancient traditions and attitudes held so dear and sacred by so many people. It was also evident to me that different people were at different stages of acceptance or rejection of the new mind. My parents, teachers, and most of my friends were, for the most part, oblivious to it. However, dim memories of the revolutions of the 1960s, the Flower Children and the anti war movement in particular, were still echoed in the media and by certain spokespeople who still believed. This inspired me in my quest for a new way of life and consciousness throughout my childhood but the inevitable sense of alienation from family and society was ever present as well. Sometimes, I wondered if I was the last new age radical left in suburban America. Eventually, the time came to go to college, which meant adulthood and freedom from the yoke of childhood v"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" regimentation and manipulation. A friend and I decided to come to Los Angeles and seek the new way in the land of the Flower Children, the peace and love generation. This turned out to be the best decision of my life. My new age spiritual transcendence began as soon as I stepped off the plane. A spontaneous psychic vision unfolded at that precise moment when a bright, beautiful angel appeared to me with outstretched arms, welcoming me to my new life. There were no words spoken. Only a sense of unconditional acceptance and love pervaded my psyche. It felt like I truly, finally, had come home. Within two weeks of my arrival, I’d discovered my first real occult bookstore in West Hollywood. Suddenly, all my wonderful experiences of fantasy reading and many hours of playing Dungeons and Dragons leaped to mind as I entered the premises, hoping to learn how to throw fireballs and lightning bolts. This began a long journey that led through many other bookstores and two magical orders. There were no instructions on how to throw fireballs and lightning bolts but there was Thelema. I discovered the core-defining document of Crowley’s religious philosophy, called “The Book of the Law,” otherwise known as “Liber Al vel Legis,” in a bookstore in Santa Monica. A casual reading of chapter one launched a revolution in my life that proved far more fulfilling than any of my childhood dreams. Verse three said, ‘Every man and every woman is a star.’ Suddenly, a brilliant light turned on in my psyche that has stayed with me every single moment of my life since then and has only increased in power with my subsequent magical experiences. Nothing in my life previous to that moment could have prepared me for this revelation but from then on, everything made sense. Reading the whole book vi"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" removed every last feeling of alienation and weirdness. Every last belief and attitude I’d ever held about family, religion, and society was vindicated. It was as if the universe had created a religion tailor made just for me. It was soon after the revelation of Thelema that I discovered the existence of some of Crowley’s old magical orders, continued to modern day by others like myself, who sought the new mind and magick. A whole new way of life and involvement opened up that has brought me untold joy and fulfillment. As it turns out, there are many others like myself who want something else out of life than what the traditions offer, something in accord with the new aeon and the evolution of human consciousness. Further, the magical training, classes, and initiations into the mysteries of alchemy, Thelema, and Hermetic Qabalah offered by these orders have enabled me to realize some of the grand potential that my childhood explorations had indicated. Yes, I really had come home. My own practices in this revised magical tradition furthered me along the new Path of the Wise. Desire to take my training and experiences further than what had been revealed to me by the instituted mysteries impelled me to form various magical workshops with my colleagues. None went very far until I met up with the magical partner who inspired me to take up the practice of Enochian magick for our work together. We had attempted various forms of magick not covered in the books on Golden Dawn working. The medieval tomes by occultists like Agrippa outlined operations not even hinted at in more modern lore. For instance, invocation of specific stars rather than entire zodiacal signs proved to be quite different than any of the standard systems. Adapting modern methods to these older forms turned out to be quite a vii"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" challenge but was well worth the effort. None of it, however, even approached the power and clarity of Enochian magick. What was subtle and hinted at before suddenly became overt and overwhelming. New knowledge and intensity of presence manifested through the use of the Watchtower tablets. Whole new realities and dimensionalities unfolded under the guidance of the Enochian angels. A standard magical temple setup became a reception point for cosmic and supercosmic forces, which yielded mysteries far beyond anything the orders or any of the books taught. Not even my childhood dreams of wizardry and wonder came near to what was slowly revealed by the superpower magical language channeled by John Dee four centuries ago. What impresses me most about Enochian magick is its adaptability to the needs of the user. Dee designed his angelic evocations with specific applications in mind. Yet, three hundred years later, the Golden Dawn was able to reform his magical methods for quite different purposes. Later still, Aleister Crowley adapted the latter revision for his own purposes, something he never could have suspected but which changed his entire existence permanently. Humanity as a whole will never be the same as a result of his wondrous transformation. Boundaries previously thought to be absolute were transcended so that others could follow and so usher in a new age of human development. Various practitioners throughout the twentieth century put their own spin on Enochian magick in its various revisions to achieve their own ends. Towards the end of the millennium, I developed my own method of Enochian angelic evocation to further the grand path of initiation begun in the Thelemic magical viii"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" orders in which it has been my privilege to participate. I hope that at some point, I’ll be able to follow Crowley’s journey through the thirty aethyrs and so broaden the Path he established. John Dee’s magical system stands out, then, as a particularly effective enabler of the True Will of each individual practitioner, whatever that happens to be. Anyone with the training, the means, and the determination can use this wondrous magical language, channeled straight from the deepest levels of the human collective unconscious, to accelerate their psychic and spiritual evolution far beyond the ordinary pace. All new worlds and mind spaces may be realized if the operator is willing to face their awesome presence. One may wonder about the objective nature of the entities evoked by such a protean system of magick. Can the angels be real when anyone can get what they’re after by their contact? Is there any objective reality to anything in occultism or is this all just mind play? Aleister Crowley is clear on this point in his essay on the astral plane as published in “Magick in Theory and Practice.” It doesn’t matter one bit whether or not a magician believes in the literal existence of the angels and spirits summoned by the occult art. The method of science was to be adhered to on this question. Certain results follow from certain operations. Nothing more need be considered. For my part, I don’t believe in angels, spirits, and monsters existing in heavenly or hellish worlds, independent of my existence. In all my years of experience in personal and group magick, I have never encountered entities that could be considered objectively real. Whatever is seen or felt by the mind must be processed through the personal functioning of that mind and so becomes colored by that personality. The ix"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" influence of the ceremony is unmistakable, however. Something definitely develops in the room with the practitioner. My view is that this sense of presence derives from the mind but then takes on an aspect of objectivity when evocation takes place. Magick, then, may be defined as the process of projecting psychic energy into physical reality where it can then take shape as a spirit. The higher spirits, such as angels, derive from superconsciousness, the oversoul in which the mind exists as a part, whereas the lower spirits, such as demons, derive from subconsciousness, the repressed fears and traumatic experiences of the practitioner. With magick, human consciousness may be expanded and examined more closely than with simple meditation or even psychoanalysis. The great goal of the Flower Children, to achieve expansion of consciousness, may be reached in this way but without the use of drugs. The process is safer and more controlled with the methods of occultism. I faced a conundrum in approaching the overtly theistic system of Enochian evocation with my rationalistic new aeon mindset, however. How could I call upon angels using conjurations developed in a worldview and religious paradigm centuries out of date? Could I even get a result holding a belief system so different from that of the inventor of this art? If the magick didn’t work for me because of these differences, then it was useless, nothing but wish fulfillment from a mad genius who died long ago. I decided to begin experimentation with Dee’s system anyway, considering all the fantastic reports about it. The way to bring this magick into the modern era was to establish a x"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" neutral spiritual context in the evocation ceremony. I could promote a nonreligious spirituality in my conjurations while using Hebrew and Enochian divine names, with the understanding that they referred to general metaphysical principles. No historical or cultural associations would intrude in the process of exaltation and evocation. It wasn’t necessary to learn the English translations of the Enochian calls since their power lay in the sound of their pronunciation. Whatever entities took form in imagination and reality as a result of my magick could guide further progress along these lines or warn against continued operation. I was confident that my innovations would yield worthwhile experiences since there are so many different effective magical systems in use around the world. Religious beliefs and cosmogonies appear to be optional. What seems to matter most is the operation of the psyche of the magician. Magick begins with the mind. Utilizing physical representations of archetypal symbols, like the elemental weapons, can bring up the deepest levels of the unconscious. To hold the magical wand is to literally grasp True Will. To drink from the cup or wield the dagger is to absorb intuition or impose intellectual analysis on any idea or vision. The heights and depths of the psyche may be accessed in this way, leading to the greatest adventure imaginable. The Enochian language accelerates this process a hundredfold. Occultism may regain its place among the sciences when thought of this way. It used to be considered so, hundreds of years ago. In medieval times, the endeavor to understand nature was not called science, as it is today, but rather natural philosophy. The classical Greek philosophers, who believed xi"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" that the best way to understand the workings of the world was to think about them, inspired this way of thinking. Pure reason could penetrate any mystery, deriving understanding based on first principles. One of the greatest of the ancient Greek thinkers was Aristotle. His paradigm of natural philosophy, based on the terrestrial elements and the celestial spheres, was supported for over two thousand years. It wasn’t until Isaac Newton developed his physics that science became experimentally based and gained independence from spiritual beliefs. Much of the magick practiced today was developed by the Golden Dawn, who based much of their system on ideas and methods found in remnants of manuscripts left over from medieval and earlier epochs. Natural philosophy, the inquiry into natural forces, had its correlate in occult philosophy, the study of occult or hidden forces. It was believed that every perceptible action had its occult counterpart, from tree spirits and water nymphs all the way to the One God. Magick was the endeavor to know God and all His works rationally. It was an application of the Aristotelian philosophy, the science of that era. With the rise of Newtonian physics and the Scientific Enlightenment, traditional occultism was no longer part of the contemporary intellectual scene. Its use was abandoned and mostly forgotten, except in the dark corners of antiquarian museums. The founders of the Golden Dawn reached into these mysterious recesses and brought the bits and pieces of what remained of the ancient lore back into the light of day. However, they failed to restore occultism to its once prominent place among the erudite. Not even Crowley succeeded in bringing his revised magical system of scientific illuminism to xii"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" scientific acceptance. Most people to this day still consider ceremonial magick as superstitious nonsense, if not outright Satanism. It is my view, however, that the modern understanding of depth psychology and quantum physics can help develop a hard scientific model of consciousness and its emergence out of the electrochemical processes of the brain. Ceremonial magick is the psychic microscope that can aid this research by revealing those functions of the mind that are normally hidden from human perception. The enormous potential of the mind may be tapped and harnessed for fantastic mystical and material effects. A psychomechanical technology may follow from such a science. Machines could one day receive telepathic instructions and power from human users trained to project their psychic energy into physical reality. It is my earnest hope to promote and facilitate the practice of magick in general and Enochian magick in particular so that the dreams of a futuristic society may come to pass. This path of development can benefit any interested magician eager to explore and develop the profound ancient and modern mysteries of cosmic and supercosmic consciousness. The new potentials of evolution revealed at the outset of this new aeon may fully emerge in human reality by the influence of this time transcending wisdom. If my experiences and realizations can inspire others to this wonderwork then my life will have proven worthwhile. Frater W.I.T. (Whatever It Takes) Los Angeles, CA 2005 xiii"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Chapter I A NOTE ON OCCULT PRACTICE A magical ceremony is a series of actions structured around the pattern of a spiritual cosmogony, usually derived from an occult tradition such as the Qabalah. The western magical tradition is centered on a cultural fusion between the Jewish esoteric literature and the ancient Greek Hermetic philosophy. The basis of European magical practice is therefore called Hermetic Qabalah. The primary mandala or cosmic model of this system is called The Tree of Life. It consists of ten numbers and twenty-two letters (which are also numbers) arrayed in a diagram of ten circles with twenty-two connecting lines. The circles are called Sephiroth and the lines are called Paths. The five elements, seven planets, and twelve signs of the zodiac, the powers as understood by Hermetic occult philosophy, are attributed to the various parts of this structure and so are set in certain relationships with each other. Magical ceremonies derived from the Hermetic Qabalistic Tree of Life express subsets of these interconnections. Analyses of the names and other significant words encountered in the visions and communications resulting from such workings may be "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"2  FRATER W.I.T. carried out by spelling those words in Hebrew. The numbers of those letters are then added up to derive the sum. Other Hebrew words with the same total may be compared with the word being analyzed to clarify its meaning. The total may be broken down into factors for further analysis. This branch of Qabalah is called Gematria. Generally speaking, ceremonies of the western magical tradition build up principles of power, starting from the most general and metaphysical expression and work toward the specific material energies to be generated. It is up to the magician to choose what Hermetic Qabalistic principle will accomplish the desired effect of the ceremony. Typically, there are two main motivations for practicing this kind of occultism. These are to cause some change to occur in the surrounding world of the operator or to progress on a course of spiritual development that leads the consciousness of the operator to the transcendent source of all being. Although these two endeavors lead in opposite directions, they intertwine and empower each other. Magick can be considered as applied mysticism in this way. An occult ceremony is simply an extraverted meditation wherein the principles of consciousness are expressed in material terms by objects denoting archetypal images. The more powerful and attuned the mind, the more effective the magical ceremony, projecting the potencies of that mind into physical reality. Consciousness is the power of magick. The path of spiritual transcendence can be mapped on the Tree of Life just as can the progress of an occult ceremony. The mysteries of Merkabah mysticism, the chariot ride up the Tree, charts the development of consciousness expansion from "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  3 the bottom Sephirah, called Malkuth, which means Kingdom, upward through the other Sephiroth toward the top Sephirah, called Kether, which means Crown. The anatomy of the mind, aura, and body has been mapped onto the Qabalistic mandala to establish further relationships for the mystic to follow. Thus, the Tree of Life is a roadmap to the innermost psyche as well as to the outermost experience of reality. The scope of magical and mystical practice based on this model is virtually unlimited. The interested reader may consult the bibliography of this book for more material on the Hermetic Qabalah. I have used these principles in the design of my magical temple setup and angelic evocation ceremony, as detailed in an appendix to this book. Many of the Qabalistic analyses of the visions generated by my workings can be found in the endnotes. Elucidating these mysteries with intellectual exploration helps me to broaden the significance of my experiences and relate them to each other in new ways. A greater wholeness emerges out of this process which accelerates my magical and spiritual evolution. Not every aspect of transcendent contact is susceptible to this kind of study but the intellectual growth is part of the overall process. All functions of mind must be engaged in reaching an understanding of magical experiences. The reader may judge of their value. I believe that my occult work has given my life profound and wondrous fulfillment, far beyond anything to be gained from mundane human society. This greatest of endeavors accomplishes the purpose of my existence. The structure of my evocation ceremony follows the five basic stages of ritual as recognized by the western magical tradition: banishing, purification, consecration, invocation, and evocation. The various rituals to be found in most books on "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"4  FRATER W.I.T. modern magick are pieces to be woven together on this framework to derive complete occult workings. For example, the most common ritual to be found is the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. This is an excellent first training practice in preparation for more complex ritual, but it also begins most major ceremonial work. The choice of which basic formulas to use in the development of a complex working must be decided based on the goal to be achieved and what powers are to be used. I’ve included ritual elements from the Golden Dawn Neophyte initiation ceremony, modified for Thelemic use in my angelic evocations. Building up a magical ceremony is as much a creative process as opening the mind to receive the results of its performance. I decided to insert a few preliminary visualizations to prepare for the formal ceremonial operation. The first is an imaginary journey to a cosmic temple set among the stars and galaxies. There is no floor or ceiling in this temple and the walls are formed by a circulating torus. A torus is a circle of circles, a wheel of wheels, like a donut. All my temple equipment is placed in this space, with a central shaft of light flowing down through the altar from the infinite above, an axle of the wheel. The temple is a direct projection of the mind and body of the magician. Once this visualization is built up in imagination, I charge my aura with a version of the Middle Pillar Ritual. Five orbs are visualized along a central shaft through my body at the top of my head, my neck, my chest, at the base of my torso, and my feet, all connected by a central shaft of white light. The colors are blazing white, grayish white, golden yellow, violet, and olive green, respectively. Divine names of the Hebrew Qabalah are vibrated to build up each orb: AHIH (Ehayay), "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  5 IHVH ALHIM (Yahweh Elohim), IHVH ALVH VDOT (Yahweh Eloah VaDaat), ShDI AL ChAI (Shaddai El Chai), and ADNI HARTz (Adonai Ha Aretz), respectively. Each is vibrated three times for its corresponding orb and then once in rapid succession to consolidate the entire structure as one whole shining image. Currents of energy are visualized to spread the energy of the central pillar throughout the body and aura and then out to the farthest reaches of space and time. I project these visualizations onto my physical temple and perform all subsequent operations in this setting. My subsequent visions of the angels are enhanced in this way. After performing the ceremonies of evocation, I sit down in my open temple, close my eyes, relax my body from head to foot, and regularize my breathing. My mind’s eyes and ears then open to an inner reality wherein the evoked entity may be seen, heard, and felt. After a certain point, this inner mind space expands into the physical temple where the energies impinge on my aura and nerves, just as if a physical presence was there. The angels bestow blessing and initiation, unfolding a new magical lesson and expanded psychic awareness. The more energy I channel, the more energy I can channel. My consciousness became completely transformed after performing many of these operations. I believe that changes to my cells and nerves have also occurred. Many of the old Hermetic Qabalistic grimoires recommend the use of a magical mirror or ball to skry evoked spirits. The magician is to gaze deeply into the obsidian depths, passed all reflections, to the spirit’s presence. Sometimes, for evocation of the lower spirits, the skrying device is placed within a triangle of art, surrounded by magical names that help control the entity. The magician is kept safe in a protective circle, "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"6  FRATER W.I.T. likewise surrounded by many divine names. Obsession and possession by the spirit is supposed to be prevented by these precautions. I decided to dispense with these devices in order to more intimately connect with the beautiful angels of the Enochian tablets. I’ve never needed such things to redirect my attention and allow my imagination to open up to magical energies. My psyche has proven to be the best magical mirror I could hope for. Direct and immediate contact between my self awareness and magically induced superconscious projections has provided the most intense supercharge and clearest visions, as the records of my evocatory experiences show. Enochian magick deserves its reputation for extreme power and effectiveness."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" Chapter II WHAT IS INITIATION? Initiation is the cornerstone of the western magical tradition. This core experience opens the pathways to mystical enlightenment while forging connections to the ultimate source of magical power. A great deal of occult literature is devoted to this subject and nearly all books on magick mention it in some way or other. The initiatory opening of the gates of mystery is usually bestowed on the aspiring candidate by an order or some other spiritual group but, with the advent of mass produced occult books relating many of the details of established ceremonial, the solitary practitioner may aspire to self initiation. Such a person may design and perform a magical ceremony for the purposes of entering upon the inner paths usually reserved for devotees of an authoritative institution but in an independent, detached environment. True freedom may be gained by success in this endeavor but the way is difficult. An examination of initiation as a general cultural practice will help put its magical expression into better perspective. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"8  FRATER W.I.T. Initiation means to begin something, usually a new way of life or a new phase of a journey. In traditional societies, children are typically initiated into adulthood by a rite of passage such as a vision quest, a test of intelligence and survival, or a religious dedication such as the Jewish Bar Mitzvah. In more esoteric religious settings, an aspirant to a holy order or mission would be initiated as a monk by taking holy orders or a solemn oath to adopt the monkish devotional way of life. In a military order, a man became a soldier sworn to fight for the order and its leadership in pursuit of its goals. In any case, a new way of life or spiritual devotion was embarked upon for good and all. In a magical context such as Freemasonry, the O.T.O., or the Golden Dawn, ceremonial initiation meant the beginning of a new phase of the spiritual journey taught by the order in leading its members to the pinnacles of magical adeptship. This meant a new way of spiritual life and the ability to use occult symbols in a ceremonial way to impose personal will upon impersonal existence. This lengthy path of psychospiritual development and energization had to be broken down into degrees or grades, multiple stages designed to gradually transform an ordinary individual into a powerful and spiritual magician. A more direct introduction to the most sublime magical energies would most likely overcharge the mind and nervous system of the eager candidate, doing great harm and ruining the chances for more gradual growth. A ceremonial initiation, bestowed under the auspices and rule of a magical order, involves an established temple space, complete with symbolic furniture, emblematic objects, officers that express magical principles by their dress, words, and actions, and other members of the order who witness the "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  9 raising of a candidate to the next phase of the Work. The first and most important part in the initiation ceremony is the opening. During this operation, the general energies and authority of the order are invoked to form a context in which the specific powers of the degree to be worked are called. Each participant of the ceremony contributes to the overall aura of the temple, the atmosphere or magical energy field that charges the entire space and everything therein. The sum of the experiences of the order, the general tradition of which the order is a part, the officers, and the witnesses already initiated into the degree awaits the candidate to these mysteries. It is the magical atmosphere more than anything else in the ceremony which initiates the candidate into the new phase of the order’s path. This energy inundates the candidate’s aura, psyche, and nervous system as soon as he or she enters the temple. Usually, the candidate is blindfolded upon admission. With the primary sense shut down, he or she is in a state of extreme receptivity to the unfamiliar initiatory powers imprinting their mysterious patterns deep into his or her psyche. Eventually, the blindfold is removed and the various symbols represented in the temple are explained in detail. However, all this information simply serves to put a face on the intense quickening received as soon as the candidate first enters the initiatory force field. The ritual actions taken during the ceremony help to further integrate this experience into all the layers of the candidate’s consciousness. The closing ceremony which ends the initiation finalizes the incorporation of the candidate as one of the brethren of that degree. This is a powerful metaphor for the process which the new initiate’s psyche has just undergone. The personal work he or she does after the initiation clarifies and integrates the energies of the degree into his or her life. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"10  FRATER W.I.T. The above analysis shows that the solitary magician who seeks self initiation, is in a quandary. There is no order to draw from, no experienced officers or advanced brethren to create the initiatory atmosphere, and no unpublished secrets to learn. The solitary magician is necessarily intimately familiar with every detail of his or her temple and ritual, having built them up from principles already learned. Nothing would be new or revelatory for the ambitious lone operator. This was the situation in which Aleister Crowley found himself after having split with his initiatory teacher, S.L. McGregor Mathers. He’d been trained in the magical system and methods of the Golden Dawn but suddenly he found himself without this support. Still eager for further occult knowledge and growth, he traveled the world to study and practice with teachers from a wide variety of traditions. His experiences were eventually incorporated into his reformulation of the Golden Dawn, called A.A. Yet, what ultimately enabled Crowley to surpass his previous initiations to achieve new levels of attainment were his adventures in the Enochian magical system of thirty aethyrs. These experiences are well documented in a book called, “The Vision and the Voice.” The angelic forces Crowley encountered initiated him to a higher state of being than was thought possible in the Golden Dawn, a grade known as Master of the Temple. This set the tone for the rest of his magical life. I found myself in a similar situation when I left the modern Golden Dawn offshoot that had provided me with in depth magical training and initiation for six years. The ensuing period of separation and solitude was emotionally trying. Many hidden conflicts arose from this trauma and had to be dealt with. After a long hiatus from magical practice, I "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  11 partnered with a novice student of the western mysteries and we experimented with a wide variety of magical techniques found in old occult books. Eventually, we decided to work with the Enochian elemental tablets, which the Golden Dawn had popularized, and suddenly our magick was awesomely powerful. The results surpassed all expectations, given the amount of time and energy that went into developing the Enochian temple and angelic evocation ceremony. We had stumbled upon a magical system that provided the overwhelming atmosphere which permanently raised our natural level of energy in our auras and nervous systems. The angels that appeared in the visions inspired by the ceremonial evocations taught new and surprising knowledge every bit as profound as anything I’d encountered in my initiations in the Golden Dawn offshoot or O.T.O. Every development I’d undergone in my magical career fell into place and was brought to perfection in my five years of regular practice with the Enochian angels. All the elements provided by instituted initiation were given by John Dee’s old magical system. The four Watchtower tablets, plus the Tablet of Union, established a graded system of development when worked in the Golden Dawn initiatory order of Earth, Air, Water, Fire, and Spirit. The virtue of the written and spoken Enochian angelic language was such that transcendent forces were generated and drawn from the inner mind. These currents were projected throughout the imagination and the surrounding physical space. Higher knowledge was tapped and revealed to everyone present. The innermost source of personal consciousness, became the greatest teacher and initiator. As with Crowley, I was brought far beyond myself. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"12  FRATER W.I.T. The several systems of Enochian magick are ideal for the purposes of self initiation. Anyone with the daring and wherewithal to develop a temple and ceremony dedicated to angelic evocation may achieve progress on the magical path. Of course, there are risks. The psychic energies generated by use of the language in the ceremonial context can be overwhelming and possibly damaging to someone not fully prepared to receive this kind of jolt. However, there are times when the only way forward is to perform the operation and then deal with the aftermath, come what may. This is especially likely to happen when moving from one tablet to the next. My experience has shown that the transition from Earth to Air is fairly manageable. However, the move from Air to Water is like going from the sun to Alpha Centauri. The transition from Water to Fire is like going from Alpha Centauri to the Andromeda galaxy. In this case, the only way forward is to set your insides on fire and feel the burn. The stalwart magician will recover eventually, probably. I experienced this transition twice. Fortunately, the move from the Fire tablet to the Tablet of Union for Spirit turned out to be easy. The forces of Spirit tend to be generally integrative and balancing. In conclusion, Enochian magick is the most powerful and effective occult system to be found. Whatever purposes a magician has in approaching these angels will be served in an extreme and dramatic way. Get ready for the roller coaster ride of your life. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" Chapter III VISIONS OF THE GREAT NORTHERN WATCHTOWER OF EARTH FIRST ROUND ACZINOR – Jupiter Senior of Earth Sunday, March 28, 1999 Today’s workshop1 was a smashing success. My magical partner clearly perceived the torrents of energy flowing through the elemental tablets. My impressions were more muted, being so focused on accurate performance of the evocation ceremony. I failed to observe every detail of my ritual plan but practice will make perfect. The ceremony was a success overall. My experience with the Aczinor was unusual in that there was little in the way of visual sensation. His voice was very deep, booming, and echoing throughout my psychic space. Usually, my magical experiences are primarily visual, with voices heard with some difficulty. This time, the only vision "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"14  FRATER W.I.T. was of my field of inner space, tinged throughout with rose pink (the color of the Sephirah Tiphareth in the King scale2), but vibrating as one object to the boom of the voice. It was like a speaker woofer vibrating to a powerful bass beat. Aczinor indicated that dispensing with the religious aspects of John Dee’s magical system was fine, as long as the entities involved were treated with the same respect as what Dee had. All technical questions of the system should be referred to the Mercury Senior of Air. Something feels different now as a result of this angelic contact. My psyche has acted as a lens through which higher, superconscious forces focused to communicate ideas to me. I hope this fantastic transcendence of mind strengthens my being to do even greater intensities of magical expression. In the future, the workshop will deal with the Mercury and Venus Seniors of Earth and after that, Seniors from the other tablets will be evoked. Eventually, the angels of the subelemental quadrants will be called according to John Dee’s system as presented in Geoffrey James’ book, “The Enochian Magick of Dr. John Dee.” AHMLICV – Mercury Senior of Earth ALHCTGA – Venus Senior of Earth LZINOPO – Luna Senior of Earth Sunday, April 11, 1999 I just completed a fantastic solo temple working. The Mercury, Venus, and Luna Seniors of Earth were evoked to great effect. I used the Greater Ritual of the Hexagram3 to "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  15 invoke the Mercury Senior but, after banishing him, I tried the Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram for the other two. By using the Lesser Ritual, I didn’t have to banish and reinvoke for each new Senior4 – a worthwhile shortcut. It may actually not be necessary to use a hexagram ritual at all since the Senior names are coming from the tablet already activated. The Seniors appeared to me as conventional angelic images, in white robes and with huge wings, in a black, empty space. The vision itself was not so inspiring but the conversation was revelatory. The Mercury Senior, AHMLICV, told me that I needed to pass three tests before I could evoke the servient and Kerubic angels without belief in the religious paradigm of John Dee. The first test is to find the beauty within myself. The second test is to discover the joy within myself. The third test was to get rid of the trickster that lives around my feet, which works to defeat me at every turn.5 Essentially, a magician needs to route out all sources of self doubt and shame that continually warp the mind. In order to face the more primal elemental powers without beliefs in religious ideals and protections, it is necessary to have absolute self confidence and the most sublime self image. The God that the magician inherently is, is all that is needed to command any spirit. The Venus Senior, ALHCTGA, told me to find my soul mate, my other self, and unite with this to achieve true wholeness. She told me a story about a man who was quite happy living alone, self absorbed, when one day he decided to search for a companion. He searched far and wide but couldn’t "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"16  FRATER W.I.T. find anyone who was satisfactory. Finally, he searched within himself in places he never expected to look and found the object of his search (superconsciousness6). He became whole. The Luna Senior, LZINOPO, showed me physical examples of unions of opposites to produce holistic synergy. Chemical reactions and quantum interactions are the inorganic correlates to a human’s search for fulfillment in a mate. The soul is one with matter, all deriving from one source and so interconnected. However, the nature of these connections is mysterious. Overall, the union of opposites emulates the interdimensional nature of consciousness and so expands this field to ever greater influence over its surroundings. All is one from a sufficiently transcendent perspective. This magick is so wonderful. This is how I’ll achieve higher initiation, just like Crowley did. At last, I can truly take my destiny into my own hands. Self reliance is the way to go in the Aeon of Horus. Wednesday, April 14, 1999 I’ve been carefully contemplating the parable the Venus Senior of Earth told me. The concept of other self, as opposed to not self, is profound and useful in any mystical endeavor. Indeed, there is nothing that is not of Self, merely that which is currently not recognized as such. The key, then, is to continually look in new places for self, to do things different than according to habit, and think in unusual ways. The most obvious place where consciousness is ignored and affirmed as not self is the physical world. Consciousness "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  17 is apparently confined to the central nervous system but my experiences with expansion of self awareness have revealed this to be in error. All that is, is consciousness. The nervous system is just a focuser of the omnipresent life principle. It seems I’ve already learned this vital lesson to a profound degree, indicating that my best states of awareness I’ve attained so far correspond in the Enochian system to the Seniors. Putting my mystical threshold into an organized context is of great value. My hypothesis, that magical systems like Dee’s open up avenues of superconsciousness rather than calling upon supernatural beings whose existence is entirely independent to that of the magician, has proven to be correct. It makes sense that the planetary natures inherent in material consciousness correspond to my best vision work and mystical realizations. My results have primarily been in Malkuth, the Bride7, everything being comprehensible to the intellect. According to the Qabalah, the next step beyond this involves the celestial world, Microprosopus, the realm of the planets and stars, unsullied by material reflection. To realize consciousness in these superlunary vibrations would exalt me to a significantly higher state of self realization than what I currently experience. LIIANSA – Saturn Senior of Earth LAIDROM - Mars Senior of Earth Sunday, April 25, 1999 Today’s workshop was superb. As it turns out, the hexagram ritual isn’t necessary to evoke the Seniors but it does serve as a useful amplifier of the stellar energies inherent in material nature. It’s worth doing. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"18  FRATER W.I.T. The Saturn Senior of Earth lent a feeling of purity and sanctity. I was reminded of how the nature of Babalon8 was a fusion of Saturn, Mars, and Venus. When properly understood, the power of Saturn ceases to be dark and foreboding and can be experienced as a pure but impersonal holy presence. As manifested on the plane of earth, Saturn is the process of focusing the vast potential of the universe to create a personalized, ego-centered reality. A great abyss separates the personal self from the impersonal source and so that which is beyond that self often appears as dark and overwhelming to the beginner in magick. A lot of initiation and transformation enables the more seasoned magician to penetrate that veil and look upon the sanctified inner mystery without fear. The Mars Senior of Earth claimed to be that force of evolution which drives people to form new societies when existing groups become too old fashioned for the new-oriented citizens. Normally, evolution occurs very slowly over long periods of time. However, as with both physical and psychic evolution, there are short intervals wherein very rapid change occurs. An example is the advent of the Aeon of Horus, which inaugurated the remarkable transformations of society in the 20th century and continue to this day. If humanity can survive the backlash to this extreme evolution, it can become something far beyond anything yet imagined. This intense but unknown potential seems as cataclysmic Saturnian darkness to many. Enochian magick can help us make sense of what is going on and what is to come. In this spirit, LAIDROM quoted an inspirational passage out of “Liber Al vel Legis,” Ch. 1, v. 12, “Come forth, oh children, under the stars, & take your fill of love!”9 I wonder what amazing evolutionary transformations will be brought about as a result of contacting "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  19 all six Earth Seniors. The workshop is now ready to evoke the great King of Earth, the solar being on the Watchtower of the North. After that, we’ll evoke the angels of the Air tablet, the great Eastern Quadrangle. Great adventures await! ICZHIHAL – King of Earth Sunday, May 9, 1999 I have evoked the elemental King of Earth and the North, ICZHIHAL. The vision of this great King was awesome! His force filled the entire temple space in a palpable way, stretching to the beyond region, the borderland between mind and matter, and pervading every dimension from one extreme to the other. Through his all encompassing presence, I felt myself expand beyond the confines of space and time. There is much more to physical existence than length, width, depth, and time. He was inside and outside of this reality, truly an interdimensional being. He projected himself smoothly into my mind as easily as someone walking into a room, appearing as an old, bearded man in black robes. His image, however, looked like a carefully detailed pencil drawing. The scene before my mind’s eye seemed at once unreal and more real than any experience I ever had to this point. A higher being had extended itself into my psychic domain. To bestow his blessing, he placed a portion of his being, a great spiral force that flowed through this plane and many others, over my head. I felt immense power flow through my mind and body, one dimensional state to another, and back to its source beyond physical reality. My entire being had been "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"20  FRATER W.I.T. included in a great superdimensional circuit that was everywhere, yet focused in a current I was now a part of. The influences of the Seniors were mere drops in this ocean of cosmic expansion. The great King bestowed on me the ability to command the Powers of Earth. ICZHIHAL taught me that movement through space and time is an illusion. All that is changing is the way in which the wholeness of reality focuses itself through the domain of the expanding physical universe. That potential from which it expands has many other dimensions and domains of realization. To understand how magical energy cycles through this space-time arena, the entire circuit must be perceived at once. Complete receptivity is needed to appreciate the holistic process of moment-by-moment realization of possibility. The key to influencing this course of creation is to receive it fully and then change the state of self in such a way as to impress a desired change onto the circuit, altering the way it unfolds through space over time. Much magical training is needed to integrate the magician’s psyche and nervous system to the point where such a holistic signal can be transmitted. I closed the temple, giving license to depart to any and all spirits that may have been attracted by my rite of evocation. The forces of the King of Earth were effectively banished and my living room returned to normal. The Enochian system of magick works, not only in summoning but also in banishing tremendous cosmic and psychic energies. In this way, psychedelic experiences can be enjoyed at will, without the use of illegal drugs. The legacy of John Dee and Edward Kelly is a fantastic Path of evolutionary and initiatory acceleration. "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  21 LZINOPO – Luna Senior of Earth ICZHIHAL – King of Earth Sunday, May 23, 1999 Today’s workshop was fantastic. My partner and I have finished evoking the major angels of the Earth tablet, and are ready to move on to the Air tablet next workshop. My partner mentioned during a discussion before the ceremony that her consciousness has been changing in ways similar to my own. Our visionary experiences, had by magick done outside the workshop, were producing similar breakthroughs. We’re reaching many of the same philosophical and metaphysical conclusions. Our work together is producing a remarkable synergy. My vision of the Earth King was purely metaphysical, without voice or person. I inwardly saw a great ring of pure psychic energy expand outward from my head at the level of my eyes. This became a series of concentric rings that clarified into tori. A torus is like a bagel in shape, a circle rotated around a center outside of it, forming a greater circle, a circle of circles.10 I could feel my expanded psychic energy flowing through each ring and out from my brain to each ring. From the edge of the outermost ring, the current instantly reappeared in my brain as if it moved through some higher dimension. This experience reminded me of the planet Saturn with its concentric rings. This is an important cosmic geometry that directly relates the innermost mind with celestial objects. The Luna Senior showed me another such geometry, one involving a spherical formation with energy accruing to it like the formation of a planet or a star. This was like a simple gravitational attraction. This was a female formula in "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"22  FRATER W.I.T. comparison to the King’s male formula of cosmic geometry.

The powers of Air deal with the realm of universal consciousness and universal intent. This is the cosmic mental counterpart to the Earth perspective. Much that was hidden before became revealed with the Air perspective. Thus, it is true that all that is, is consciousness. The Jupiter Senior first appeared as emanations of majestic gold sparks and currents, covering the entire vision space. The awesome life of cosmic intention was manifest. Soon, the power focused itself into an ancient male figure, dressed in regal white and gold robes. AAOZAIF bade me to join my "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"24  FRATER W.I.T. consciousness with the myriad little needles of force/form1 that constitute manifestation and learn to control them to produce magical effects. Universal intent is present everywhere, guiding all actions and determining every destiny. I was awash in the awesome being, its gestalt. The Mercury Senior of Air, AVTOTAR, first appeared as pure darkness, yet filled with potential power. Much possibility seemed ready to realize itself but nothing happened. Soon, the vision resolved into a gigantic young male figure holding me in the palm of his hand. I expanded myself to dwarf him, and held him in my hand, yet retained the image of being held in his hand.2 This double perspective was intriguing. There is much potential but little is realized by nature alone. The power of True Will causes events to occur. The angel said that the universal intent projects itself through the cosmic mind, causing this infinite instantaneous flow of realization to form a focus of coherence, even in the midst of pure transcendence, pure potential.3 The coherence of light enters physical space as a plane or volume of vast width but very little depth. I’ve witnessed such projective phenomena during other visions, especially when my brow chakra (Ajna) or my crown chakra (Sahasrara) expands.4 This manifestation of pure Will gives rise to the male formula ring structure as seen in many celestial and planetary patterns. I asked AVTOTAR how best to evoke the Kerubic and servient square angels.5 He said to activate each tablet and quarter in turn, unifying all four groups to form the gestalt that would bestow the desired power. I then asked for a boon to better enable me to perform my True Will in the world. He said that I should avail myself of the vast potential energy "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  25 inherent in every point of space and time. This subtle cosmic background is the raw stuff from which individuated consciousness is made. Existence is whole, forming matter and mind together. These are the parts of the universal mind. Much of this knowledge was communicated to me by direct understanding rather than by words. Then, I bid the Senior to depart and closed the temple. Not only do the Seniors correct my pronunciation of their names but they introduce me to new aspects of my personal search for the truth of my being. My magick has produced astounding results, not only regarding the development of my superconsciousness but initiation into transcendent planes of reality. The mysteries of my subconscious have also been revealed. A wondrous conduit to higher wisdom, specifically suited to my purposes, is at my disposal. “There is success.”6 AVTOTAR – Mercury Senior of Air AHAOZPI – Venus Senior of Air Sunday, July 4, 1999 My magical partner and I held another Enochian evocation workshop today. This time, we evoked the Mercury and Venus Seniors of Air. My partner continues to grow along a path similar to my own. We are kindred spirits on a deep philosophical and psychic level, brought into sync by the most powerful magical system known to the Western Mystery Tradition. Our work together will develop wonderful new innovations in magick and metaphysics. My AVTOTAR vision began as last week’s ended, "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"26  FRATER W.I.T. standing in the angel’s gigantic hand. He opened a door in his chest leading to his heart to reveal a golden throne. I sat down on it and suddenly found myself in a golden chariot towing the sun across a gleaming white sky. Eventually, I came upon the Senior sitting at a square table sipping tea. I joined him and sat facing him. The tea had a flavor of cinnamon. (All these symbols correspond to Tiphareth.) He told me that the magical link between mind and matter could not be known but only experienced. It was an extension of being, not a step-by-step process of concentration. The leap of the spark of consciousness across the dimensional arenas was made directly. In answer to another question, the Heptarchia angels7 could be summoned by opening the seven Bonorum tablets in a circle and then calling whatever angel and minions desired. The goal was to bring the tablets together as one and then subdivide, not unlike the process with the Watchtowers. The Venus Senior of Air, AHAOZPI, also had a dual form. The vision began with a fantastically beautiful woman with long, blonde hair full of soft curls dancing like a ballerina. The golden space was full of twinkles and dreamy ecstasy. The whole exuded an intense eroticism, an effect my magical partner also experienced. AHAOZPI began multiplying herself, coming to surround me with dancing figures. Then, across the horizon of the vision space, the gigantic face of a woman with straight, dark hair appeared. Her facial features were not quite human but seemed futuristic, a great leap ahead in evolution. Knowing better than to ask questions in such a setting, I opened myself to the erotic and expansive energies of the angelic contact. The "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  27 huge woman’s hands reached out to me and began to fold me up like a paper airplane. The more she folded me, the brighter and more golden I became, thoroughly aroused by the process. Eventually, I became like a statue of a dark brown color. The golden sparkly space gave way to the universe of stars.8 After communion with cosmic consciousness, she put me back in my body, just as AVTOTAR did by blowing me out of his hands with a thick, white mist. The understanding gained in this way became translated into words later as follows. The process of creation of individuality begins as a projective multiplication of the core self which focuses around a particular perspective. A self recursive chain of association develops over time. The relationships among the different projections and with the focus of perspective increase in complexity until the currents of psychic energy become interdimensional. They come to connect the dimensional realms of mind and matter in the body. This folding and refolding process leads to individuated consciousness and the development of an understanding of experience in space and time. Being itself is multiplied until new psychic spaces are created. Experience is a self recursive process. The core self, the True Self, is beyond these conditions, yet, interpenetrates them. The self recursion expands into the central nervous system as the aura, multiplying and extending the projections into the physical world beyond the body. A smooth progression of dimensional expansion is established connecting the inner mind with the realm of matter. The fabled magical powers such as telekinesis, teleportation, telepathy, clairvoyance, healing, longevity, etc. could be achieved by increasing the complexity of the aura enough to link the right dimensions. Very great magical work is required to impose this integration. "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"28  FRATER W.I.T. AHAOZPI – Venus Senior of Air AHMLICV – Mercury Senior of Earth Sunday, July 25, 1999 Today’s workshop went very well. Two new people showed up ready to do magick. Fortunately, they were both experienced workers of this great art. Their experiences resulting from the evocations were much appreciated. We evoked the Mercury Senior of Earth and the Venus Senior of Air, chosen as a worthy sample of the workshop’s accomplishments to date. As it turned out, however, the new participants had difficulty with the Air vision, the shift in elemental energies proving to be confusing. It is best to work with one element at a time. My visions, as usual, were revelatory. AHMLICV related that the universe was a tapestry of interwoven spiral patterns of expanding dimensions. The spirals continually unfurl as the universe as a whole expands. These dimensional unfoldments stream into this bubble of spacetime from the background reality common to many universes. In a similar way, energy enters the mind from the surrounding physical and subatomic worlds in spiral patterns, joining the self recursive chains of association. The mind expands with personal experience over time, just like the cosmos. The aura also expands under this complexification of core self expression. Truly, man is a microcosm, a little universe. The Senior told me to partake of the Communion of Saints9 to reach the next level of magical intensity. I was to do this by gathering together a group of people to join with in this communion. Then, a number of people appeared around me in "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  29 the vision space and we all received a deep sense of union with the transcendent spirit of the angel. The people surrounding me, projections of my psyche, then merged with me to complete the Communion of Saints. I became like a universe in vision, expressed as a great flower stretching across the dimensions with many petals/projections. I was the central stamen, a vertical shaft of Will intersecting the disk of circulating psychic energy, the axle of the wheel. My entire being was as one holistic eighth chakra, the lotus that contained me, superconsciousness. The Mercurial angel had given me a perspective of my being beyond my personal self. The human personality is but one set of realized possibilities amid a vast potential of consciousness that usually remains dormant, the subconscious. Transcendent magical influences help actualize and integrate this great potential with the existent ego structure, empowering the psyche with far greater than normal energy. The blessing of this communion remains with the personality permanently, even to other lives. Real progress toward higher than human evolution can take place. Eventually, we gave AHMLICV license to depart and I opened the Air tablet with the third Enochian call. The Venus Senior of Air was next to be summoned. AHAOZPI is a real angel lover. She showed me the male and female formulas of sex on the psychic plane. The male formula was imagined by my subconscious as a disk with a shaft of energy shooting through the center from above, very like the superchakra from the previous vision. The female formula was shown as a ball of continual attraction, drawing in all the energy around it like the gravity of a planet or star. The "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"30  FRATER W.I.T. phallic image suggested the uplift of the sexual energies while the attractive image showed ever increasing integration with the object of love.10 The unfoldment of mind and matter establishes the background of life and the charge of life, its impulse to become. The multiplication of the spiral association patterns is one with the general expansion of consciousness, the expansion of the universe. Evidently, the energies of the Earth angel continued to be felt even after he was given license to depart. At least for me, the Mercurial essence had more meaning. Great care needs to be taken in choosing what combination of angels is evoked during any Temple ceremony. Saturday, August 7, 1999 My day-to-day experience has been much more charged with transcendent perception than before my achievement of the Communion of Saints during the last AHMLICV vision. There have been times when my entire nervous system has felt supercharged. Holistic psychic and nerve energy patterns are becoming more and more a part of my daily life. My entire body, from my head to my toes, has been integrated in this gestalt of joy. HIPOTGA – Saturn Senior of Air HTMORDA – Luna Senior of Air Sunday, August 8, 1999 I have just taken down the magical workplace after having evoked the Saturn and Luna Seniors of Air, HIPOTGA and "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  31 HTMORDA. There were few words received, these principles being far removed from an intellectual nature. Now, I remain sexually aroused from the second angelic contact. I saw no figure of HIPOTGA but rather a dark space, pregnant with potential at every point. It was as if every single point of space in my vision was about to burst into a supernova of brilliance but not quite making it. Enormously powerful energies were waiting to realize themselves but the means to do so were absent. A male, echoing voice said that I couldn’t see the vision of HIPOTGA without dying first. I therefore relaxed and allowed ministering angels enfold me into pieces. They were nothing but white hands carrying me along. The process was at once a collapse and a discorporation. The more pressed together I became, the more pieces of myself fell away, until nothing was left but tiny bits. In this vision, I was to be purely passive in the face of a power completely beyond my consciousness. After parting finally from the pieces of what was left of my vision body, I floated freely as a small ball of fire, pure mind circulation. The hand angels eventually went away. The Will of the space then hurled me forward along a clockwise spiral path into a universe of dark stars. I then became a complex circulation of consciousness, interconnected with every other star and point of this cosmos, a true wheel of many wheels. Floating in darkness, I enjoyed the expanded being of the Saturnian space. Eventually, I returned back along the spiral path to my corporeal body, feeling more whole than ever before. The vision of HTMORDA began immediately upon "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"32  FRATER W.I.T. finishing the conjuration. The back of my head emitted a multicolored field of psychic light to my mind’s eye and I felt a gentle presence which sexually excited me. Upon entering into trance, I beheld a vast space of grayish white light, punctuated with spangles of many colors. The air seemed drenched with moisture and I flew along as a seagull. There was wind and the sound of other sea birds. Eventually, a vast, round head formulated out of the general background mist. The mouth was enormous and smiling and the eyes were full of glee. The whole reminded me of various man-in-the-moon images. I was filled with the Senior’s joy. I asked HTMORDA to teach me magick. Without a word, I felt my aura receive energy from the surrounding misty space until a coherent circulation of current formed. Becoming a human figure, I raised my vision hands to project energy and the force flowed in the opposite direction to that of my intention. The current flowed over my hands and up my arms to merge with the general circulation of my aura. Only when a sufficiently intense charge passed out of my hands did the spillover erupt from my aura to project in the intended direction. It is the aura as a whole that casts magical energy, not the hands directly. I asked for a blessing from the Senior to better enable me to carry out my True Will on earth and was filled with the angel’s joy. Then he/she said, “There are three paths to joy. One leads to darkness, another leads to fulfillment, and the other leads to pleasure. Choose a path. Choose all three paths. These three are one.”11 I was then returned to the physical world and closed the "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  33 magical temple in due form. The darkness of death yields the joy and peace of union with the All. Fulfillment generates ever greater satisfaction which soon becomes joy. Pleasure is a pursuit of self discovery that never ceases to bring joy. These are all expressions of True Will, whose accomplishment is the source of all joy. Life, death, and purpose are Its cornerstone. All the experiences of life are joy when understood to derive from this source of becoming.12 HABIORO – Mars Senior of Air HIPOTGA – Saturn Senior of Air Sunday, August 22, 1999 I have evoked the Mars and Saturn Seniors of Air in full formal temple and achieved both visions to full satisfaction. I am now ready to call the great King of the East for next week’s magical workshop. HABIORO was merry and mighty with his red armor, hair, and beard. He was boisterous and resembled an English actor I’ve seen on television. The Senior spoke with that actor’s voice. With passionate gesticulations he commanded, “Come forth, oh children, under the stars, and take your fill of love.”13 He is Love and Will, a pure expression of the spirit of Thelema. He is the passion for life, just as the Saturn Senior is the passion for death. I lacked this passion in my first attempt to evoke HIPOTGA and so failed to achieve his full vision. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"34  FRATER W.I.T. This is no longer the case. Passion is a uniting quality, built up during the Fire phase of an elementally based mystical program of spiritual transcendence. Mars is passion, the Love and Will that motivates life itself. Thus, even the smallness of incarnate life must be passionately embraced as part of the experience of the grand, impersonal Truth of life. All circumstances must be wholeheartedly accepted to realize the wholeness of reality, the source of everything. The most humiliating of ordeals must be understood as part of a seamless continuity of existence to appreciate holistic Truth. Finally, HABIORO showed me a table of pure white light and said that I must link the forces of my psyche with physical forces in order to impose my Will on that world. There is such a link but it was beyond his understanding how to find and use this link.14 I then banished this Senior and evoked HIPOTGA. As a tiny ball of burning light, I perceived a dark, stormy sky, a realm I’ve seen in previous visions from other meditations. It expresses a state of the deep subconscious on the border between life and death. I accepted this forbidding yet thrilling trance with longing and joy. I flew beyond the storm and came at length to clear, blue sky above fluffy, white clouds. Beyond the veil of death is a life free of incarnate attachment. Then, the Senior appeared as a huge hyperdimensional head composed of white light, both near and far away at the same time, occupying many positions at once. Here in the death state, Saturn is a living force. The angel was ancient, calm, and wise, projecting certitude and infinite transcendence. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  35 Eventually, this form focused to a tall, gray robed figure. He bestowed on me the blessing of death and told me to fear it no more. That which truly lives is the collective consciousness of the species, the source of incarnation, the projector of souls. All minds are one in the state beyond death.15 Dying is but a gateway to the inner mystery of Saturn. Wisely is this planet attributed to the first Path beyond Malkuth on the Tree of Life. This Path of Tav can lead up to Yesod or down to the Qlippoth, the psychic shells of the dead. Both directions express the mysteries of this often misunderstood planet. Its impersonal nature can either inspire horror or transcendent joy, depending on the spiritual state of the mystic adventurer. Saturn is that which builds and destroys, two expressions of one nature. The whole course of material events emulates the transcendent nature of the All-source in a lower dimensional state of being.16 This principle puts limits on the infinite to create spacetime, wherein life and death can occur. Binding and expansion are the twin pillars to the temple of this mystery. BATAIVAH – King of Air AAOZAIF – Jupiter Senior of Air Sunday, August 29, 1999 I evoked BATAIVAH, the King of the East, and AAOZAIF, Jupiter Senior of Air, at today’s magick workshop. The great King turned out to be far beyond my and my partner’s ability to handle, our visions involving only abstract shapes and disembodied voices. Without doubt, the Enochian system of magick has a definite set of influences that can be evoked through its language and symbols. This experience is "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"36  FRATER W.I.T. far more than subjective expectation or idle dreams. Real power focuses on the mind of the magician who uses the Watchtower tablets, producing effects of a particular kind based on the entity conjured. If the old grimoires are at all accurate in their claims of what abilities and talents may be derived by their use, real magical powers may be developed this way, true wizardry like in the old fairy tales. The road to success, however, is a long one. My vision of the Air King involved flying through long, spiraling tunnels of black and white airy force that seemed to pass through all dimensions and scales of reality, from the smallest atom to the largest galaxy, and everything in between. The differences in size and perspective afforded by these interdimensional whorls were mind boggling and dizzying. The very concept of space as a coherent set of directions became warped into an ever changing vista. A voice from everywhere and nowhere said that the full vision was beyond my understanding. In order to gain this level of transcendence, I needed to learn to see the gross in the fine, the darkness in the light, and the nature of material objects in the quantum chaos out of which they grow. It was not enough to understand the source of these pairs of opposites. Each extreme had to be conceived as involving its other. This was completely beyond my mind’s ability to grasp. As a blessing and a lesson on how to achieve this malleability of mind, the King yielded to me a vision of a white space wherein the vistas continually moved closer and then farther away from me. The horizon was broken up into segments that moved independently of each other. A very blurry visage of a manly king appeared before me in this "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  37 confused, yet strangely ordered space. Eventually, I gave up on reaching further into this bewildering vision and called AAOZAIF, the Jupiter Senior of Air. His vision was naturally far more coherent and comprehensible. The angel held me in his outstretched hands as before, as if creating me by the forces emanating from them. He lifted me up into a brilliant white space and then lowered me into a dark space wherein only vague outlines of shapes were visible. His message continued that of the King’s. A further piece of advice given to me was to make of myself a pure and perfect mirror in order to receive and reflect the truth inherent in all reality, in every aspect thereof. Such are my assignments to fulfill the curriculum of the Air angels. In a few weeks, I’ll begin evoking the angels of the Water tablet. Of course, I’ll eventually need to return to those visions not fully received but it is best to move on now. Certain lessons can only be learned from the perspective gained by later stages of the Work. At least for now, the seed of the unknown is planted.17 This culmination of Air has united the heights and the depths of the group mind of humanity as I experience it. I am humanity itself focused on an individual existence. This explains my continuing sense of being a part of a greater life than that which has developed from my personal experiences. Humanity is one. All of its potential is accessible to whoever can reach it. Once the collective unconscious is brought to self awareness, the whole complex can be developed along new lines of evolution. Ultimately, the original pattern of order that "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"38  FRATER W.I.T. began all coherent existence, including consciousness and life, will be revealed. Any change in reality will then be possible. Monday, August 30, 1999 In order to perceive the opposite of something within that something, it is first necessary to reach their common source in a transcendent state of being. The unfoldment of the pair of opposites in space and time may then be observed from this metaperspective. This unity must then be taken into both halves of the equation to know the one in the other. Such a state of consciousness is alien to the human norm. The greater whole of which I am a part, my superconsciousness, will have to guide me in this. A vital clue was given me by the Air King, my greatest superconscious projection to date. The vision of a hyperdimensional space wherein the horizons varied in distance showed me how a partial state of being can exist within a greater holistic context. It’s like a three dimensional space within a six dimensional hyperspace. This is a spatial metaphor expressing the relationship between self consciousness and superconsciousness. In this way, I am to seek the gross in the fine and the darkness in the light. The baser concepts correspond to the nearer horizons, the more familiar tracks, while their opposites refer to the farther off vistas, the less familiar experiences. They exist together as they are and in a greater reality that transcends and creates them. There is a smooth continuum that joins these states of consciousness, in their separateness and their unity, a transdimensional path that leads to the full vision "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  39 of BATAIVAH. This is how the Earth King was able to reach into my mind from without as if he had walked into another room. This is the metalevel at which the Watchtower Kings operate. I can’t even begin to imagine what the Water and Fire Kings can show me but they will likely change my life forever. That’s what magick is all about. BATAIVAH – King of Air AHAOZPI – Venus Senior of Air Sunday, September 26, 1999 I’ve evoked BATAIVAH, King of the East, and AHAOZPI, Venus Senior of Air. My visions were inferior to my usual results. My contacts were weak. Upon calling the King, only darkness and flatness of vision answered. The flatness expressed lifelessness, dullness, and mediocrity. Although the dark space seemed to contain great potential for becoming in every point, even this possibility was weak, of little consequence. Eventually, a disembodied voice said that I wasn’t ready to receive the full vision of BATAIVAH. I called out in my mind, asking how I could become ready. The answer came that I should humbly submit myself to the King. This clearly couldn’t be done. I am a human being, a complete microcosm, greater than any elemental no matter how exalted. It is I who must rule the spirits. So, I did the opposite of what was told to me and commanded that this spirit show itself to me.18 The darkness remained dull and flat for a little while longer. Eventually, a vast scene of clouds emerged that stretched farther than my mind’s eye could see. My vision body stood in midair, perfectly still, just as the fluffy white and gray clouds "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"40  FRATER W.I.T. were motionless against a dirty, tawny sky. An enormous figure coalesced from the clouds, forming into an old, white haired and bearded man in a white robe. He asked by what authority I commanded his appearance. I answered in the name of my Holy Guardian Angel. At that, a great sun of orange brilliance burst forth behind me.19 I could feel its warmth and healing rays. There was also a throne of gold directly behind me that came into being along with the sun. I sat down on the throne and commanded the King to bestow on me the power to command the spirits of Air. He complied at last. I bade him to declare his nature and mystery. He said that he ruled over the forces of Air and all expansion and contraction. It was clear to me that the vision was not going my way so I gave BATAIVAH license to depart. Next, I summoned the Venus Senior of Air to ask her what she thought of my plan to form a sexual relationship with her for the purpose of experiencing a more intimate synergy of angel and human.20 She appeared as a vast, white, round face and then as a gorgeous blonde in a sheer, white robe. In answer to my proposition, she said that I wasn’t ready for such a relationship and that I should focus on my personal magical path in accordance with my True Will. Satisfied with this, I gave her license to depart and closed the temple. Interestingly, during the banishing of the magical workplace, I caught a glimpse with my mind’s eye of a great hyperdimensional figure with thick, white, curly hair and beard. It was the Air King in full clarity. Some level of contact had definitely been achieved but only a sidewise glance was possible at this point. The image slowly faded from view as I continued the closing. "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  41 Looking back on my record, I’m doubtful of the results of today’s visions. I was off my game in general and acted foolishly towards these exalted spirits. Their messages seemed contrived, rather than inspired. Issues remain to be dealt with before I can achieve full contact with the ultimate of the Air element but I must soon move on to the Water tablet angels. This may be the only way to fulfill the lessons of the Air angels. Otherwise, I may just have to wait for another round of Watchtower evocations before reaching what is currently beyond me. For now, I’ll accept the advice of AHAOZPI and focus on my magick. It seems to me that my major outstanding issue with the Air King involves my lack of experience with religious exaltation. While I’ve been able to achieve a good deal of personal spiritual transcendence, exaltation and expansion of consciousness, I don’t worship any deity or religious ideal. I prefer to think of the ultimate source of being as who I really, truly am, beyond self identification. My previous attempts to begin straightforward religious practices resulted in physical illness and bouts of high anxiety. For me, religion is self denial and self destructive.21 I need to find a way to reconcile my personal spirituality with the impersonal transcendence that constitutes all things. This would also be in line with the Venus Senior’s advice. Later that night: I’ve just returned from a long, leisurely walk and have been inspired by an intriguing realization regarding the issues raised by today’s evocations. Evidently, some religious observance is called for in dealing with the Air King but viewing deity as a principle outside myself is a dreadful mistake for me. Indeed, my spirituality throughout my life has been based on finding transcendence within myself, "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"42  FRATER W.I.T. a purely mystical endeavor. My latest breakthrough in understanding, inspired by today’s partial contact with BATAIVAH, is to integrate my personal self with the not self, what appears to be other than self. The Earth angels gave some intimation about this but now the King of the East is demanding it. A new type of religious expression is called for. An important clue as to the nature of this new spiritual path may be found in the fact that Water is the next phase of the Watchtower magical program. I am reminded of The Hanged Man Tarot card,22 major arcana number twelve (XII), a card that figured significantly in a recent self administered reading. The Hanged Man has transcended all worldly pain and concern to fully focus on the spiritual realm, an inversion of conscious perspective shown by his inverted posture. Such a state of mind results from the union of opposites in the psyche, the ultimate of which is the fusion of self and other. Aleister Crowley describes this card as a depiction of complete dedication to True Will, which is nothing other than the cosmic force of intention within the psyche. True Will is the supreme creative and deific principle within the mind of every intelligence in the universe. It is the ultimate object of my spiritual search. Clearly, the sense of separation between self and this other is a severe error, the worst restriction. Union with Will must be the central focus of whatever religious expression I use to enhance my magick. LIIANSA – Saturn Senior of Earth HIPOTGA – Saturn Senior of Air Sunday, October 24, 199923 "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  43 Today’s workshop focused on strengthening contact with the Saturn principle inherent in the two elements covered so far. Repeated attempts are needed to achieve complete understanding of this most abstract and impersonal of the planets. Full Saturnian evocation is an effective preparation for the overwhelming impersonal contact with Water. My partner’s visions and mine were exact and detailed, opening the way for work with the Watchtower of Water. In my Earth vision, LIIANSA appeared backlit by a brilliant whirling Fylfot cross which was throwing out projections of itself. White and black swastikas were flying all over the place, spinning in a clockwise direction, the way of the sun and positive growth. The light behind the angel was so bright that he appeared in shadow. Wordless understanding came to me as to the meaning of what I was seeing. Mind and matter are two phases of consciousness, separated from one another by the interaction between the universe and the nervous systems of incarnate life forms. They are two extreme opposites of one spectrum of differentiation of possibility. Still, all that is, is consciousness. Their apparent incompatibility is an illusion based on limited awareness and understanding of both. The truth is that they are emanated from one source, the first swirlings of all existence.24 The very basis of all reality forms the background and determines the interaction between the experiencer and the experienced. All transformations are possible from this underlying perspective. Mind and matter are of one substance. In my Air vision, HIPOTGA revealed the brilliant light of the Fylfot cross, without any trace of shadow. He told me that I’d gained enough of an understanding of the proper relation between the incarnate psychic states and their transcendent "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"44  FRATER W.I.T. source to perceive the light that exists in all things. The imagination represents aspects of the not self as darkness. Appreciating the not self as other-self has enabled me to experience all psychic states as light. The Great Sea of matter has become enlightened by transcendent consciousness. The devouring nature of Saturn has become understood as the cycling of a great interdimensional circuit of being. The All-Devourer is the All-Begetter. The preparation is now complete. My magical partner and I are ready to begin performing evocations from the Watchtower of Water together. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Chapter V VISIONS OF THE GREAT WESTERN WATCHTOWER OF WATER FIRST ROUND SAIINOV – Jupiter Senior of Water SONIZNT – Mercury Senior of Water Monday, October 11, 1999 I have evoked the Jupiter and Mercury Seniors of Water, SAIINOV and SONIZNT, in due form. I still feel intense energy coursing throughout my nervous system but the effect is finally tapering off. Wow! What a leap forward in magical power! The Jupiter vision began with the appearance of a stately ancient male, with long curly hair and beard, looking very much like the Air King. The scene had the same fluffy white and gray clouds against a tawny sky, which appeared in that last vision. The old angel lifted me with giant hands over his head, to the place of his crown chakra, and introduced himself "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"46  FRATER W.I.T. as SAIINOV. He told me that the essence of Water filled the entire universe as the eternal now, the coherence that has enabled the universe to exist and grow. Each moment has three phases, the initial phase of its realization, its full becoming in existence, and its absorption into the universe of time. As he spoke, currents of bubbly water filled the vast sky scene and surrounded me with effervescence. All was contained in the coherent1 fabric of the light, bubbly currents. Suddenly, two remarkably realistic hands took hold of me and lifted me off the ancient’s head. I was taken up out of the airy/watery space and into a realm of pure, thick darkness. The impression was like newly poured tar in the process of congealing. There, in front of my mind’s eye, was the face of a woman with very long, black hair. She was more real and solid and existent than any other vision I’ve ever had. Everything before this was like a cartoon in comparison. For the first time in my life, I’d encountered something that was truly outside myself. My magick had brought something new into my psyche. To say that she was huge would be a ridiculous understatement. Her vast face was huge, like an ocean is huge compared to a pond. She filled all the varying dimensions revealed by the Earth and Air angels and introduced something new, an existence of pure reality more solid than any stone, more palpable than my own body. Her hair was larger still, filling the whole vision as one with the velvety, thick, black space. As she spoke, her hair moved about every which way, just as the trees of eternity.2 She was the real SAIINOV, the Jupiter Senior of Water, the first female figure I’ve seen so far to represent this planetary "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  47 influence among the elements. The initial personage had acted as a bridge, enabling me to pass from Air to Water, to something beyond my experience. She continued the lesson begun in the prior space. Each direction has a threefold set of currents which constitute its concept, three currents of consciousness which form its differentiation. There is the initial movement, its focus, and its culmination in its incorporation into spacetime.3 The angel told me to feel the coherence of the eternal now, the consciousness of the continuity of existence.4 I felt her hair, omnipresent and filling my being every second with love and wholeness and completeness. She enables and supports my existence by her imagining. I was experiencing the crossover from impersonal consciousness to personal, ego-based identification. The Senior then said that I needed to complete nine tasks before I could go on to achieve the ultimate in spiritual transcendence. I felt dread at the prospect of having to remember so many details, making the record of this magical working more difficult. However, the tasks were not given to me in the obvious way. A list of nine items appeared before me in vision, written in white letters of an unfamiliar alphabet against the black background. The meaning of the words was completely unknown to me but I received the gist of the message. Essentially, I am to come to a coherent understanding of the nine aspects of creation (the emergence of specific events from the vast background of possibility), how moments and settings come into being from pure potential. Here is how Yesod is converted into Malkuth. Coherence is the key to this, as to the nature of Water as well. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"48  FRATER W.I.T. I believe my visions have brought me near the threshold between the 10th and 9th Sephiroth. More than this, it seems I’ve been given a glimpse of the world of Briah as well. The image-making faculty of the mind has been transcended with the vivid experience of the foundation of physicality. Satisfied and delighted by these amazing, breakthrough results, I gave SAIINOV license to depart and summoned SONIZNT. In the same thick, black space, I entered a tunnel of whirling essence wherein suggestions of white, ever changing geometric shapes moved past me. Inherent in each shape was an eye, an intelligence. Eventually, the tunnel moved passed me and I saw the enormous face of a man with long, black hair and beard which reached through the darkness, just like SAIINOV’s hair had done. This angel spoke to me in a great, booming voice that seemed to come from my own voice within me, yet outside myself. At length, I banished and closed the temple, somewhat in a daze. Many of the details of these visions have slipped my mind now but essentially, I am to study how coherent shapes form out of the potential of being. Later that night: I just remembered the main thrust of the vision given by the Mercury Senior of Water. He showed me an image of myself as a system of intermingling currents of points of light squeezed into a narrow field of action, like a dark cylindrical bottle. SONIZNT bade me to re-image myself to expand this field, to make it extend into the general field of potential underlying all of physical reality. That way, the range of the light point circulation can extend throughout the space "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  49 surrounding the bottle, enabling the Will to reach into the world directly. Psychic currents of self recursion can extend beyond the central nervous system, propagating the impulse of True Will into the immediate physical world of ordinary human experience. It all begins with a revisioning of self, forming a new identity as a new being. SONIZNT – Mercury Senior of Water Sunday, November 21, 1999 I held another workshop today. My partner and I evoked the Mercury Senior of Water. So profound and potent was this first Water contact for her that we decided not to summon a second angel. She encountered the same expansion of consciousness experience that I had during my first evocation from this Watchtower. The higher dimension of pure being in which our personal existences were as tiny bubbles was brought to our awareness with the fullest of intensity. She also came to perceive the unitary source of all opposites that I’ve discovered in angelic vision. What a marvel is John Dee’s Enochian magical system. It introduces a profound and specific reality to any who approach this mystery. There is no subjectivity about it. Dee and Kelly reached into the very basis of the cosmos and derived the keys to its revelation. In the angelic language and tablets lay a direct Path of initiation to the ultimate transcendence.5 My experience of the Senior was somewhat less intense than last time, since I’d been able to adjust to this greater contact. He appeared to me clearly, but spread across great distances of space and time, closer to my reality than before. "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"50  FRATER W.I.T. He transported me to a great blue hyperspace along a golden spiral and there I partook of that state of consciousness beyond the image making faculty. This was the true Water, pure coherence. His teaching was to project myself astrally in order to actualize one of those points of great potential which filled my enhanced vision space. SLGAIOL – Venus Senior of Water LSRAHPM – Mars Senior of Water Saturday, November 27, 1999 I’ve evoked the Venus and Mars Seniors of Water in full magical temple. Now, my head is almost spinning with the awesome psychic forces drawn forth from the impersonal currents of consciousness from which I’m created. A major revelation has been given to me and it has already begun to transform my soul. Upon calling SLGAIOL, I saw myriad folds of space, as if I’d projected my consciousness beyond the bounds of space and time to look upon the universe from outside. Each fold seemed like an entire course of cosmic evolution, complete with all the partial evolutions of galaxies, stars, planets, and life forms, falling in toward a common center that was at the same time invested in the flow of possibilities and outside of it. The falling circulations appeared at the edges of the supercosmic system when they neared the paradoxical center. Whole realities were born and died in this way. A great head appeared in the curving, whirling spacetime flow, reflected in each fold and corner like the reflection on a pool of water into which a stone had been thrown. The effect "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  51 at this level of being was total confusion, yet, the angel himself was coherent throughout. His existence made sense out of pure chaos. The angel’s face was male, with the same black hair and beard as every other Water tablet angel I’d contacted so far. His every movement was carried throughout the spacetime folding circulations, bringing a subtle order to the inherent disorder of the reflecting material. SLGAIOL told me that the universe was created from a contradiction. Existence is totally impossible, given the transcendent nature of its source. Yet, form took shape and coherent movement became. All that is, is a lie, being a purely arbitrary pattern imposed by currents of individuated, ordered consciousness. There are no limits to existence since all is based on an impossible contradiction, a paradox. I must fully embrace the contradiction of being in order to rise beyond the limitations of my own habituated mind. True magick, realization of the impossible, may only be done from a perspective that transcends reason. Only by operative contradiction of union of opposites may human limitations be overcome. Overwhelmed by the import of the angel’s message and the ultimately expanded state of the vision, I gave SLGAIOL license to depart and pressed on with the evocation of LSRAHPM, Mars Senior of Water. His mighty form, consisting of a fine white mist, arose out of a raging whirlpool of spacetime. This was another geometry of the same supercosmic flow that had been introduced in the last vision. Great bolts of lightning sprang from the maelstrom of focusing possibility, shrouding the Senior in blazing light. The birth of possibility of becoming is brought about by these fiery emanations. "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"52  FRATER W.I.T. The angel’s lesson continued the revelation given by SLGAIOL. There is an unlimited amount of energy available at all times in all places because of the occurrence of impossibility. Anything can occur since no limitations truly exist. The focusing of pure information, relation between different states of being, provides unlimited power. Thus, all is hopeless confusion and yet receptive of any pattern imposed on it. Any creation is possible with the right state of mind. The human world is just one of an infinite variety of potential paradigms. I may wield such currents of contradiction by merging with the impossibility which creates the cosmic coherence. Sheer nonsense gives rise to all pairs of opposites and their interactions. Any event may be made to occur by influence over the creative power of contradiction in this way. It makes sense that impersonal consciousness would lead beyond all human reason and even the collective unconscious to encompass all that is unreasonable. Clearly, the universe cares nothing for human ideals. Reason is but one of a myriad of possible patterns that may be projected onto what is a completely protean reality. Realization of the creative contradiction will transcend all limits of reason. Truly, there is no God to judge humanity, no universal orderer. We are all totally free to impose whatever order onto existence we desire, just as I’ve always believed. Chaos is not ordered but is orderable. Order can be emerged therein to form the basis of the absurd impossibility which creates all things and circumstances. As a side note, I became strongly sexually aroused upon "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  53 evoking the Mars Senior of Water. The feeling was similar to that given me by the Venus Senior of Air but less romantic and more lustful. Indeed, the madness of sexual excitation helps to lift the mind beyond reason to the threshold of impossible contradiction.6 LAOAXRP – Luna Senior of Water LIGDISA – Saturn Senior of Water Sunday, December 5, 1999 I have evoked the Luna and Saturn Seniors of Water in due form and received their communion and blessing. My state of mind is peaceful and clear, having become acclimatized to the impact of the Water energies. The angelic lessons, however, are no less profound than before. LAOAXRP appeared to me as a young girl, about seventeen or eighteen, with long, straight, blonde hair and large blue eyes. The surrounding vision space was grayish white rather than the usual black, perhaps reflective of my improved adjustment to her element. She had a mischievous laugh and hugged me affectionately, touching me in various places in a friendly and sometimes sexual manner. I felt stimulation in my Mars chakra, situated a few inches above my genitals, but was not moved emotionally. This new energy was not overwhelming. She told me that I was nothing, that the oneness which I felt myself to be was a total illusion. All my thoughts and senses and conceptions were nothing except so much smoke on the surface of the ongoing coherence, which is the only reality. Truth may be found only in pure being, revealed when the "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"54  FRATER W.I.T. chaos of the mind is stilled. Then, she told me to sing. She showed me how by standing behind my vision body, putting her hands on my cheeks, and charging my entire being with glorious white light. Soon, I felt a stirring in my heart chakra, the chakra attributed to the Sun. Then, an essence of song began to emanate from there. I realized that this was how to project energy in a state of transcendence. Receive the ultimate essence of existence and then channel it through the chakra whose nature was to be projected. Such energies could be brought down to the physical level and fixed in a material basis such as a talisman. For instance, the heart chakra sings of love and harmony, imbuing all with a golden perfection and state of peace. Other chakras can produce different effects. The song of the eighth chakra, the integration of all the others with the innermost source of personal creation, projects ultimate transcendence as pure white light. After a while, my essence song finished and then LAOAXRP told me that I wasn’t who I thought I was. My current identity was a mistaken impression. My true name was Ebelijah. The meaning of the name could be found in the enumeration thereof.7 I understood that this was a fusion of the names Abel, son of Adam and brother of Cain, and Elijah, a prophet from the Old Testament. This surprised me, not being of a religious persuasion, but I immediately accepted this as my angelic assignation. I gave LAOAXRP license to depart and evoked LIGDISA, Saturn Senior of Water. There was an immediate sense of hyperspatial immensity, a hallmark of this element. I saw before my mind’s eye the Fylfot cross in whirling motion, so "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  55 fast that it appeared like a solid disk. It became clear to me that this vision would not be the usual face to face encounter, my personal identity having been negated in the previous angelic contact. So, I became the swastika and felt all manner of emanations and motions being thrown out from me. Each projection carried the stamp of my Prime Pattern, the signature of who I really am, the core ideal on which my every mental activity is based. I became aware of a union of expansive darkness and frenetic universal light, a focus of impossibility, the opposites tucked into each other in spiral configurations. This is my pattern, my personal creation, correspondent to how the cosmos came into being. Eventually, the angel appeared, springing out from my midsection, to reveal himself only from the waist up. He was a young, dark haired and bearded man, with the same puckish grin as had the Luna Senior. His communication was that this was the only reality, expression of pattern imposing itself onto other patterns and their background coherence. All else is an illusion. He also said that I should evoke the Jupiter Senior of Water again, before calling the King of the West. With that, I gave LIGDISA license to depart and closed the temple by the usual ceremonial. This is Water, the impersonal aspect of consciousness, the true pattern of Self, upon which all the airy noise of the mind is derived. This true identity is of the nature of Briah. The Prime Pattern of Self is all in all, projecting an illusion of a self, operating in a universe of space, time, matter, and energy apparently separate from that self. All is as one is a misinterpretation of experience. All meaning, then, is purely arbitrary and so of limited truth, that is, false. Any further magical development will have to involve this expanded, impersonal state of consciousness. I feel like The "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"56  FRATER W.I.T. Hanged Man of the Tarot, whose perspective is inverted, looking from the outside in. SLGAIOL – Venus Senior of Water Sunday, December 19, 1999 I held another workshop today with my magical partner. We evoked the Venus Senior of Water to receive her communion and her wisdom. Once again, my partner and I decided to set our pace at one Water Senior per session, such was the impact of their contact. I explained what I’d been learning from the angels in terms of the overall system and where these visions were leading. The element of Earth deals with coherent personal consciousness, the self consciousness of every day life. The element of Air deals with transcendent personal consciousness, the subconsciousness which underlies the ego. This is the stuff that dreams and hopes as well as nightmares and fears are made of, swirling around on a plane of constant change and mystery. The element of Water deals with coherent impersonal consciousness, the cosmic backdrop and formative principle of the entire personal experience and psychic mechanisms. The self comes together out of this great sea of potential like an iceberg freezing in an ocean. A small percentage of this enormous mass rises into the light of day while the rest of its vast bulk remains continually submerged in the darkness of its source in the watery abyss. Yet, all is Water, in one form or another, one phase or another. The element of Fire, then, deals with transcendent impersonal consciousness, that ultimate source of energy whose tiny pocket of unlikely, impossible darkness forms the basis for all life and mind. However, all energy held within the frozen possibility derives ultimately from the Fire of infinity. "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  57 Evocation of the angels of the great Watchtower of Fire would no doubt clarify what this was all about. I also described my discovery of the core contradiction at the root of my psyche, the Prime Pattern emerging out of an impossible fusion of cosmic currents of opposite natures. All that I am or can become expresses this central truth of the existence which creates me. These explanations helped my partner to make sense of what she was experiencing through the contact with the intense transpersonal energy of Water, making it easier for her to handle its impact. Knowledge and experience are effective tools in empowering the mind to grow under the influence of superconscious projection. My vision of the Venus Senior of Water was similar to my last contact with him. He taught me a mystery of the polarity between self and other. From the personal perspective, self projects other to produce a spectrum of differentiation between mind and matter. This spectrum encompasses the entire universe, yielding the experience of coherent reality as a collection of specific, ordered events in space and time. Personal reality adheres to exact and far reaching laws of nature and regular patterns by which life experience unfolds to the perceiving (and projecting) intelligence. Yet, this subset of likely occurrence is but a tiny drop in a vast arena of possibility. Much of what the mind creates for itself is based on early childhood imprints and conditioning imposed by family and society. Some of these behavioral patterns of thought and action can be destructive to the health and growth of the psyche, limiting life experience to a narrow, regularized track. Overcoming these poisonous psychic programs can greatly expand the scope of what life can bring to fruition.8 Sufficient projective power could alter manifestation "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"58  FRATER W.I.T. significantly. This is the goal of magick. The impersonal perspective, however, is far beyond any experience-based limitations. The state of self and other differentiation and interaction is only one current of realization in a greater reality of all inclusive possibility. That which is other, is understood to be an aspect of self and so one with it. The core contradiction is equally in the ego and in the non-ego, realizing self-in-other and other-in-self. This kind of paradox reveals the impersonal source as creating and being created by its projections. Time ceases to have meaning and an experience of an eternal, unchanging now results. The attained magician can shift perspective to any object in the surrounding world, making that the center of experience, leaving the original body-attached identity as other. Obsession with personal consciousness is hereby transcended and the entirety of existence can be understood as pure paradoxical contradiction. All is impossible so anything is possible.9 During this most enlightening vision, I fell into a hypnagogic state, half asleep and half awake. This had never happened to me before. My dreaming faculty was activated and I experienced a complete dream while my waking vision continued. Neither psychic function was interfered with by the other’s progress. Their impressions remained clear and distinct. In my dream, I found myself trapped in a huge, black roasting pot being heated by a flame burning below. I could feel myself inside the pot heating up, but at the same time, I was outside the pot looking at it.10 I was in two different places in my dream at the same time while also experiencing a magically enhanced waking vision. The sleeping dream expressed what the waking vision was communicating. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  59 Myself inside the pot began banging on the sides, trying to get out, but couldn’t. Myself outside the pot could only watch helplessly. The angelic vision continued unaffected by its counterpart situation. The two superphysical communications ended simultaneously, their multifaceted message having been delivered. My early childhood conditioning continues to isolate me from the true source of my being. Superconsciousness may light the way forward but the subconscious must be transformed in order to accept the transcendent inspiration to the deepest levels. Psychedelic experience is the key to revealing the truth of reality and enabling an expanded psyche to impose its pattern onto the ebb and flow of what can be. SAIINOV – Jupiter Senior of Water RAAGIOSL – King of Water Sunday, December 26, 1999 I’ve evoked SAIINOV, Jupiter Senior of Water, and RAAGIOSL, Great King of the West and Water, to great effect. Ironically, SAIINOV warned me not to proceed with the evocation of the Water King because I wasn’t ready. Too many disconcerting events had occurred today before the temple ceremony and so I was too unsettled emotionally to make an effective contact. Interestingly, she appeared in vision with a male counterpart orbiting her like a moon orbits a planet. Her counterpart remained silent throughout the conversation. Her message sounded absurd to me, perhaps to be taken in a contradictory sense considering her orbiting male "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"60  FRATER W.I.T. compliment. Perhaps this celestial pattern was meant to convey some hidden meaning to an obvious message that couldn’t be taken seriously.11 I stated my intention to proceed anyway, so she advised me to receive the King with my entire being. Only that level of wholeness could properly reach him and handle his profound energies. With that, I banished the Senior and evoked the King. After making my conjuration, I could feel myself being surrounded by white energy which streamed out of the Water tablet. My physical eyes didn’t register anything but in my mind, I saw a torrent of white light flowing from the Watchtower before me. The brilliance inundated me inside and out, flooding my every nerve, thought, and atom; every fiber of my physical and psychic being. Upon sitting down to meditate and open my inner senses more fully to the Great King, I saw a vast head, white haired and bearded, condense out of the flowing light. He was constituted of an essence beyond my imagination but was able to focus his white current into the image of a head, just as the Seniors had done from their fields of black and gray. The King’s brilliant energy, however, clearly emanated from a source far beyond that of his ministering angels. If the Seniors of the Watchtowers exist at the level of consciousness called Yetzirah or Briah in the Qabalah, their Kings exist in Atziluth, the worldview beyond the archetypes. I opened up to him with as much of my being as I could muster, including my aura and senses outside my body. The King’s mighty energies were far more intense, had far more impact on my body and mind, than any Senior could ever have, but I withstood the onslaught. With a voice that came from "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  61 everywhere and nowhere, he told me that in order to understand and manipulate the universal coherence, which is Water, I needed to incorporate the complimentary of my own being. The microcosm exists within the macrocosm, two fields of consciousness with one focused on an incarnate experience and the other an all encompassing potential of experience. Yet, by a certain perspective, the microcosm contains the macrocosm and so the individual pattern is spread throughout the wholeness of things. This cosmic self exists as more than just the presence of the individual in everything that is not that individual. It is everywhere and every when at once, while still expressing a particular person with a particular experience. Thus, self, other self, and cosmic self had to merge to realize transcendental understanding and abilities. Control over the emergence of physical reality is thereby possible. I asked him for his blessing and permission to command the forces of Water. He bestowed this upon me. The King’s blessing yielded an awareness of oneness with all and my complimentary self, omnipresent yet contained in my focused experience. I was a recognized ruler of Water, just as with Earth and Air. I then gave the Great King license to depart and closed the temple in due form. On the way to a restaurant for dinner, I felt very altered from my usual sense of self. My entire psyche seemed turned inside out, continuing the connection with my cosmic self. All the events in the universe are merely ripples across the surface of an infinite ocean of pure joyous light and peace. Eating a large dinner helped to ground me and now I’m comfortably full and tired. I feel more stabilized and adjusted to the awesome powers and revelations I’d received from the angels. I look forward to evoking the powers of Fire. "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"62  FRATER W.I.T. Monday, December 27, 1999 Based on my experiences with the elemental angels and the lessons they’ve taught me, I’m ready to make some speculations on the nature of certain concepts of alchemy. The Medicine of Metals, that which perfects the minerals, is alchemical Water, quickened into life by the impulse of Mercury, the messenger of the Gods. This is an allegory of the human aura becoming quickened by focused, individuated consciousness inspired by superconscious contact. The transcendentally connected ego becomes the conveyor of complex patterns of emergent order, communicating profound wisdom to the quantum chaos surrounding the body. The aura becomes a shining mirror of the higher worlds, reflecting Truth into the physical world. Properly manipulated, this emanation can become an effective agent of alchemical transmutation, bringing order and perfection to disordered nature. On another topic, I’ve felt a definite intensification of my mental rest state since evoking the Water King. With some concentration, I can activate the higher activity of my mind almost to the point of angelic evocation. With this acceleration, I’ve achieved a clearer perception of my complimentary self. This is the impression my self consciousness makes in the overall source field of impersonal consciousness, like a handprint in wet cement. My complimentary is a shadow to my personal light. Together, we constitute a complete self. Integrated with other self, we create the universe of experience, a whole cross section of spacetime. The function of creation lies at the core of each consciousness. There is no God but Man. With this growing Self awareness, I’ll soon be able to open up my psyche to the highest levels of superconsciousness by Will alone. "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  63 LAOAXRP – Luna Senior of Water Sunday, February 27, 2000 My magical partner and I evoked LAOAXRP, Luna Senior of Water, during today’s workshop. We both perceived action occurring in physical space on an inward level.12 Clearly, my evocation abilities are improving. Objective perception confirms it. It seems my results are enhanced as I go forward in the Enochian training program, even when returning to a prior element. My progress should be truly dramatic when I undertake Senior evocation again from the beginning. My partner’s result shows that, whether or not any objective physical energy is projected during these ceremonies, the effects of the evocation on the mind are pronounced and undeniable. There is a level of mind that seems to extend into space and can be altered by magical projection, even if this influence is caused by nothing more than a complex set of body language and voice inflections. However, if the enhanced psychic emanation is materially real, great magical effects are possible with its multiplication. If not, even if all these perceptions are nothing more than so much mental masturbation, the revelations of ecstasy and transcendental connection make the effort worthwhile. In today’s vision, I perceived a spiral current emanating from the center of the Water tablet. It was like viscous water, full of bubbles, and it was bright and shiny. Interestingly, my partner described seeing just this substance in her vision, interpenetrating every object in the room as well as her own mind. She had achieved perception of the smooth flow between her mind and the outer world, the in between dimension that I’d discovered. She perceived my magical projection! "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"64  FRATER W.I.T. The spiral turned out to be a tunnel through which LAOAXRP came to enter our world. Her form was made up of the same bright, bubbly, watery substance as the tunnel but more colored like a human. This manifestation was different from the moonfaced figure I received the last time I evoked this Senior but the demeanor was the same. It seemed my contact with Fire had refined my ability to project any angel. She led me into the tunnel and through to the in between reality. It was a dark, empty place except for a pedestal on which was a square box, open at the top. Brilliant white light shone from within. The angel told me to place my hands on this table. The light shone from between my fingers as I touched it. She said that this energy was the potential behind all coherent reality but that I wasn’t ready to tap into it because of my conscious focus on myself. I needed to loosen up and extend my sense of self to reach through other self to realize the universal potential energy. All the angels were clear on this point. So far, my contact with the other self in my mind/aura has only begun to foster a sense of overall unity of perspective. The sense of separateness between self and other remains very strong. Slowly, these barriers are becoming permeable in all my magical work. Greater success will bring greater connection and make of my whole being a conduit for the Light of Life to reach physicality. My partner’s vision remained focused on the shining Water pervading the temple and every object therein. She told me that this connecting principle was the basis for all perception. "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  65 This link of transpersonal consciousness enabled the human mind to perceive material objects. Physical signals such as light, pressure waves through the air, etc., were actually incidental, unable of themselves to promote perception. I speculate that if the frequency of an object’s consciousness conduction was significantly different from that with which the human mind normally deals, that object would be totally imperceptible by humans on any level. It would be entirely outside their reality. Indeed, all of life is an interchange of circuiting consciousness. Manipulation of that process can yield profound ability to alter personal experience. Our visions ended with LAOAXRP returning through the Water tunnel. My partner and I then closed the temple in due form. We both marveled at how real and powerful the Enochian entities are. Time after time, participants in these ceremonies report similar phenomena and appearances. The language of the angels channels an objectively real presence, whether it is from an excitation of the collective aura of the evoking magicians or an independent being from beyond the world answers the Call. The force of consciousness is real and can be manipulated at will, the ultimate occult force. Wednesday, March 1, 2000 I’ve come to a greater understanding of what LAOAXRP was telling me last Sunday and why the Jupiter Senior of Water told me I wasn’t yet ready to evoke the Water King. The expansion of consciousness involved with Water involves far more than simply becoming aware of the vast field of impersonal being from which the personal mind emerges. Remaining centered on ego identity prevents the circulation of "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"66  FRATER W.I.T. psychic relationships from encompassing the entire auric ground. To fully realize the true nature of Water is to shift identity from the personal to the impersonal perspective, from self as locked within a body to the self that freely oscillates between the ego and the non ego. Apparently, the result of this transition is to realize a sense of self that transcends mind and body to experience a cosmic participation and presence. So far, I’ve only been able to catch flashes of this vast expansion of the conscious circuit. These revelations have been relaxing, releasing, and ecstatic. I need to make many more connections between my personal mind and its auric basis before achieving smooth flow of identity from the one to the other. Then, I’ll be ready to take full advantage of contact with the Water King and reach the latent Fire within the other elements. LSRAHPM – Mars Senior of Water Sunday, March 26, 2000 Today’s workshop went exceptionally well for both my magical partner and I. Group ritual has a charm and an effectiveness that solitary working can’t match. Being in a chamber full of magicians performing highly orchestrated magical ritual is an awesome experience that nothing can compare to for sheer power and spiritual transcendence. Even with just one other person, a ceremony is enhanced to a great degree. The benefit to each participant, as well as the development of the involved group mind, is far reaching. This greater psychic acceleration improves solitary working a very great deal. My transcendent experience began during the purification of the temple as part of the opening ceremony. I suddenly "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  67 became aware of the underlying cause of my short temper in a vivid way. A vision spontaneously unfolded in my mind as I performed the ritual actions of temple purification, which clearly brought about dramatic personal cleansing. My imagination revealed a scene of raging, hot fire stabbing outward and then retreating. This activity was repeated over and over again, showing an imbalance of expression of Will. I was able to withstand the impact of this personal revelation but almost went deep into trance during the Opening by Watchtower. Fortunately, my years of experience with magically enhanced states of consciousness enabled me to keep my wits about me and finish the preliminary ritual. LSRAHPM was evoked effectively in due form. My inner vision of physical activity revealed an outpouring of the same bright, bubbly water from the Water tablet as what appeared during the last workshop evocation. This time, instead of a spiral, there were two coherent streams flooding into the temple. One current went clockwise and the other went counterclockwise. The two steams encircled the magical workplace as they crisscrossed each other in complex patterns. These patterns came to cover the whole temple. It seemed as if an object of more than three dimensions had entered physical space. The changes in pattern that occurred over time showed the object’s full extent.13 With this outer vision going on, I entered into inward trance to see a figure similar to the one from the last time I called the Mars Senior of Water. To my surprise, he called me stupid for summoning him again since I already received his full vision and message. I told him of the necessity for this, to teach my student. He readily agreed with me, changing his harsh tone immediately. This accommodating behavior made "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"68  FRATER W.I.T. me suspect that the being before my mind’s eye was not the angel I’d evoked but rather a personal projection. I exited this trance and returned to physical perception. The watery streams continued pouring out of the Western Watchtower to crisscross across my living room. Then the real angel came out of the tablet with the streams and walked to a spot in front of me, just as the Fire angels did. It seems my evocation abilities are improving as I continue this course of magical training. The angel directed the Water currents to flow through me and I was completely inundated by the force - body, mind, and spirit. This extreme purification enabled me to perceive more clearly than before the source of my short temper as a habit of defective use of my Will, my ability to assert on all levels of consciousness. My Will is my entire being focusing on one point in physical, psychic, or conceptual space and pushing, asserting, emphasizing, and then relaxing. An activation is made and then the Will is withdrawn to allow a chain reaction to continue, resulting in psychic and physical manipulation. This holistic assertion power is what the true self uses to activate the brain cells that control body movements, speech, and memory. The unconscious Will controls the autonomic nervous system with this force. Unbalanced use of the Will causes violent psychic and physical reactions which result in unhealthy behavior, such as short temper. Repeated episodes of these reactions habituate into unconscious complexes and become so regularized as to occur regardless of conscious intention. A great deal of willpower is needed to break up these unpleasant psychic programs. LSRAHPM and I did our best to wash the fire and inundate the old patterns of unbalanced forcing forward and then relaxing pattern. The flash fires eased somewhat and "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  69 eventually disappeared from vision. Healed with this blessing, I returned to the physical level of perception.14 My magical partner’s vision was even more intense than mine. Her vision began with a giant snake with a warrior woman carrying a sword riding on its head, between the eyes, appearing before her mind’s eye. She told my partner that she was the force that propelled the semen in ejaculation, which forced out the baby during birth, and other such movements that forced matter through the courses of the body. When asked to explain further, the warrior woman grabbed my partner’s hair and cut her head off with the sword. Fortunately, my partner was able to control her panic and continue with the vision after that point. Her years of yoga really paid off in this Work. My partner perceived an enormous gushing of blood through her neck and up to the ceiling, where it disappeared.15 Then, a stem grew out of her neck and her head became a lotus flower which sprouted from that stem. Her head was the centerpiece of the blossom. In this forceful way, my partner reached impersonal consciousness. Her vision directly corresponds to certain Kundalini visions I’ve had, where my entire body became the central stamen of a vast lotus, an eighth chakra, whose myriad interdimensional petals were projections of my aura. Much is shared during group magick. While I’m inducing the nature and intensity of her visions to an extent, it is her mind that is channeling and processing the energy. The lessons she’s learning are relevant to her life. She claims to be very happy with her breakthrough and continues to be eager for more. That we’ll both get when next time we evoke the Saturn Senior of Water. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"70  FRATER W.I.T. SONIZNT – Mercury Senior of Water SLGAIOL – Venus Senior of Water Sunday, April 16, 2000 I enjoyed excellent communion with the Mercury and Venus Seniors of Water. My hope in evoking more Water Seniors before returning to the Fire tablet is to continue the purification of my Will, begun by the Mars Senior. One of the great satisfactions of solitary work is the ability to chart a course independent of other people’s curricula, readjusting the order of operations at will. This should help me channel angelic Fire in a more balanced way in future. As usual, I got more than I bargained for. The angels appeared in front of me and in my mind. The inner picture of their physical and psychic manifestations was clear and bright. There was no darkness obscuring anything. I could see their entire bodies. SONIZNT instructed me in the proper use of Will. The three part process to best generate and project Will force is to transcend, receive, and call forth as the All, utilizing the entirety of existence to support the projection. Nothing short of a universal focusing of Will-force is balanced. Thus, any effort by the ego is doomed to failure. Ultimately, it’s the entire universe that conjures magick. The human part is just along for the ride. This angel’s blessing consisted of helping to connect my nervous system with the transcendent reality that underlay all existence. He said I was ready to receive the All. SLGAIOL appeared as a voluptuous blonde beauty, not at "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  71 all the incomprehensible, disembodied face I’ve perceived in previous visions of her. She entered my body and sexually aroused me every bit as intensely as the Venus Senior of Air had done. She opened up a transcendent space in my mind wherein she appeared set against a hyperintense blue background. White flowers covered the edges of the scene. I perceived myself as the great lotus, the eighth chakra, with my vision body as the stamen in the center. The angel shone life giving rays on me like a sun does on a flower. A great, gorgeous, brilliant sun she was. The angel told me that love for a woman could reveal that which I couldn’t see in myself. A whole new revelation could be realized by such contact. Romance could be a part of the Path every bit as important as the most profound vision. Sex charged with love is a special force that could readily project in the holistic way recommended by SONIZNT. Ultimately, all expressions of Will result from usage of the sex force. This is why it is vital for any magician to properly understand and channel his/her sexuality in a healthy way. To reinforce her message, she bestowed her blessing on me by intensifying her magnificent image. My every nerve and thought were inundated by the ecstasy. This beauteous, beatific vision still comes readily to mind, even after the evocation has ended.16 LIGDISA – Saturn Senior of Water Sunday, April 30, 2000 Today’s workshop went very well for both my magical partner and I. We evoked LIGDISA, Saturn Senior of Water. Surprisingly, the contact was loving and gentle, rather than cold and frightening, as one might expect from a Saturnian "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"72  FRATER W.I.T. Water power. However, our visions were awesome in scope. We each received similar teachings from this angel, although they were worded differently to suit the receiver. The message involved the primary mystery of elemental Water, the contradictory nature of the source of consciousness as creator and created in one being. My partner had difficulty grasping this paradox and was given a meditation to help her understand. I was shown a vision of the circuit of consciousness as a progression of concentric metallic cylinders, each taller and wider than the ones it contained. They were concentric vertically as well as horizontally, yielding the impression of a parabolic dish on each side of the construct. At first, LIGDISA introduced himself as the tendency which focused the patterns of the universe to form me. He was the instigator of my being, all that I know myself to be. A band of metallic light formed around my head at the level of my forehead at the same time the system of cylinders appeared to my mind’s eye. I was looking outside and inside of them at the same time. I am the instigator and result of my being, the becoming of my consciousness. The cylinders form an evergrowing system that expands as my life experiences grow and complexifies my mind. As my appreciation of the meaning and significance of these visions grew, the cylinders increased to enter an in between state, the infinite realm between pure mind and matter. Eventually, the outermost cylinders seemed to enter physical space and hovered above my head like a great helmet. My aura rose to meet them, my headband of metallic light linking with the interdimensional system of psychic projection levels. My inner visual sense became filled with metallic "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  73 colored energy and a profound sense of oneness with all being, all that was, is and shall be, came over me. The great power of that oneness was palpable to all of my physical and metaphysical senses. By sheer configuration, the synergy of all existence is supremely powerful, paradoxically creating and being created by everything everywhere every when. With my understanding complete, the transcendent connection withdrew and I returned to my normal state of waking psychic functioning. My partner and I banished and closed the temple in due form. We discussed our experiences in great detail over dinner. Overall, the intensity of this angel and his message was awesome. However, the supercharge yielded by evocation of the Fire angels was noticeably lacking in this as well as the other Water angel contacts. As complete as the nature of Water is, Fire is its necessary correlate. Water is pure being in its wholeness, diversity, and tendency to form, but Fire is the charge of Will that drives and ensouls the entire process. I now feel ready to return to the Fire tablet and am eager to face the Mars Senior of Fire. Wednesday, May 3, 2000 The full meaning of last Sunday’s evocation has come to me. I am that angel. I am LIGDISA as well as all the other angels I’ve evoked. I exist both inside and outside my body as well as the states in between. I am the instigator and resultant of my being, the image of myself. I feel the spectrum of existence and becoming, spanning the conditions from inside my mind to outside my body. Each state appears to my mind’s "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"74  FRATER W.I.T. eye as a band of force, a projection of Will that manifests some distance away from the point of emanation. The several levels of projection come together as the system of concentric cylinders as revealed during last Sunday’s vision. Integration among these bands produces profound synergy and spiritual transcendence, the revelation of new states of being, multi-state experience. Feelings of oneness with all things follow this expansion of consciousness, this psychedelic experience. My progression through the elements reflects the development of this understanding. Earth showed the material side of my being, my attachments to circumstances and personal psychic programs. The source of material being and evolution was revealed as the interdimensional cosmic spiral. Air revealed the force of my life, the vast spectrum of mental potential from personal attitudes to the human collective consciousness. Fusion of these perspectives enabled a leap in understanding and psychic functioning which revealed a greater wholeness to my existence. All that I know myself to be is but a drop in a vast field of potential for experience, impersonal consciousness, Water. This is the interdimensional field of my aura, the architect of my life and the product of all my incarnate experience. Of course, nothing happens without the impulse of pure Will to quicken the whole construct into activity, the ever flowing rush of Fire. A greater fusion involving all four elements will no doubt yield the transcendent metaconsciousness that is Spirit, the All/Naught which produces and destroys organic existence. The mystery and purpose of life will stand revealed. "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  75 RAAGIOSL – King of Water Sunday, June 4, 2000 My magical partner and I held another Enochian magical workshop today. We evoked RAAGIOSL, great King of the West and Water. My partner had a dramatic breakthrough in consciousness by her first contact with this truly awesome being. She became aware of herself as a fundamental functioning part of the universe as a whole. I believe this to be Briatic consciousness, transcending any image or concept, completely beyond the earthbound psyche of the ego and its ideals. For my part, I was told once again that I wasn’t ready to achieve the full vision of the great King. Not even my most exalted Briatic states of consciousness were enough to truly represent him in vision. No image could do justice to his majesty and might. I suspect that a whole new faculty of consciousness is needed to efficiently process this tremendous contact. The only clue RAAGIOSL could give me was an experience of my entire being, personal and impersonal, as one coherent whole. There was no vision to this. My interpretation of the King’s message is that I must learn to function at the cosmic level as efficiently as what I can now do at the personal level. I have far to go along the Path before I become able to function at such an exalted, superhuman level. The message from my first evocation of this entity has even more import for me now than ever before. Sunday, July 2, 2000 I’ve just had my last workshop with my magical partner.

The energies of this manifestation didn’t overwhelm me, as with the first contact with the Water tablet. The impression was quite different. The background Fire element appeared to my inner sense as a fiery red field of light, apparently made up of blocks of gelatinous cubes of red-orange firelight. ANODOIN himself appeared as an interdimensional current of rushing Fire that spiraled into my living room from beyond the confines of space and time. Nothing impinged on my sense of sight but the presence of the angel’s movement was very clear to me. My imagination interpreted this otherworldly contact as a spiral of Fire with a "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"78  FRATER W.I.T. face at the tip. The only other times I’ve achieved such palpable contact with higher dimensions were when I was evoking the elemental Kings. Here was an essence of pure magick, undiluted by worldly conditions, such as formed the other elements. The flow of power was noticeably outside my body, rather than entering physicality through my psyche. The sensations on my skin and aura were more distinct than with any other spiritual contact yet experienced. ANODOIN taught me that there are three types of Fire: transcendent, internal, and external. These refer to the different dimensional modalities in which the life energy may manifest: the mind, the space surrounding the physical body, and the higher dimensions beyond space and time. Unite all three to evoke magick, that is, bind together the different states of being into one continuous interdimensional flow. Projection of psychic energy into physical reality is the process of evocation, of magick itself. The angel told me to follow him and he tried to lead me out of my body to go someplace else. Try as I might, I was unable to leave my physical body behind so I prepared a psychic space in my imagination for the spirit to enter me. He took on a more complete form here, although his being remained part of the interdimensional current that spiraled outside my body and beyond the physical. His appearance was that of a conventional angelic figure but consisting totally of flames. His voice was like that of an ordinary human male. Together, we entered into a deep space scene and from there to a beach of dark sand at night. The black ocean waters spread out to the horizon, purely still and shiny like a mirror. ANODOIN said that there was no Fire here except that "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  79 everything was made of Fire, even Water. Next, we visited a stormy Air scene, an infinite sky filled with dark clouds. The angel said that Air carries Fire. Make the Air to flow smoothly to allow the Fire to be steady and coherent. We then visited a dark, waterless land. The teaching here was that Fire exists as potential within Earth but Earth was incapable of activating its internal Fire. Outside influence was needed to bring out this hidden principle.1 The next destination in our whirlwind tour of the elemental planes was the deep space scene where we started our journey. Here in the element Spirit, Fire is everywhere, free flowing and unlimitedly expansive, fully actualized, inherent in every point of space, and shining brightly from every star. The beginning of all things, all elements, was here. The angel brought me to a great pillar of flaming Fire that reached far above and below me, out of sight. Every spot in this immensity was a flame, yet all the flames were part of one coherent Fire that flowed and yet was perfectly stable in its place. The wonder of this revelation was greater than anything I’d ever experienced before. ANODOIN told me that this pillar upheld the entire universe. All things had their being by its mighty influence. I realized then that this amazing psychic manifestation was the culmination of the rise of my Kundalini, which had first occurred spontaneously back in 1991.2 What had been a tremendous magical part of my being now encompassed and contained me. I was now a part of it, a part of a new level of psyche that reached beyond the limits of the four dimensions of space and time. Connections with the universe as a whole had been forged and made strong in this fiery cosmic pillar of "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"80  FRATER W.I.T. Kundalini. My evocation of this angel of Fire had brought the process of integration of my nervous system, which focused on my spinal column, to a grand new fruition. The alchemical metals, my chakras, had been fused into a philosophical gold that carried me away to a new inner reality, far closer to the cosmos than the human norm. I was now a receiver and transmitter of interdimensional signals that revealed a new plane of existence, stamped with the face of my soul. My consciousness could now expand in this grand new direction, transmuting into an ever more perfect image of the macrocosm. Filled with this realization, I asked ANODOIN for his blessing and he put his flaming hand over my head, palm down. Flames erupted all over my psychic body, nourishing my every nerve and fiber. A sense of total peace and fulfillment imbued every thought and sensation. In this beatific state, I exited the vision and closed the temple in due form. So it is revealed that Fire is the primary interdimensional force which constitutes all space, time, matter, energy, and consciousness. The whole of existence is woven from its spiraling patterns. Space itself is a form of subtle energy that can be contacted and manipulated. By the influence of Fire, all incarnate life arises out of the background of matter, an emergence of higher order reflecting the truth of transcendent states of being. Greater assimilation of the Fire principle is the key to all mystical and magical development. So far, I have touched the transcendent and internal fires but the external fire still eludes me. Much greater psychic and auric energization is needed to enable me to contact and utilize this other-self energy. No doubt, I will learn a great deal from the angels of Fire so I’ll evoke them one at a time, with great care. The "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  81 spirits are the best teachers of magick, projections of the magician’s own superconsciousness. AAPDOCE – Venus Senior of Fire Sunday, February 13, 2000 I’ve evoked AAPDOCE, Venus Senior of Fire, in due form. Afterwards, I rushed out to a restaurant for dinner, hoping that food would help to ground the enormous magical energy charging my aura. The angel was definitely the most highly energized being I’ve ever called. The whole experience was sublime and left my aura operating at a higher level of vibration than ever before. Even after eating a solid meal, I can feel the subtle, hot energy flowing through my aura and nervous system. Eating usually does more to ground me than this. I’ll have to wait for the effect to dissipate over time. The vision began during the utterance of the Fire call. My inner spatial sense perceived the letters of the southern Watchtower distort and flow together to form a red, glowing triangular pyramid (a tetrahedron) covering the tablet. Although there was no physically visual change, my sense of the movement around me resolved an image of a vibrant, red, flaming tetrahedron, a true emblem of Fire. AAPDOCE appeared to my inner sense as soon as I sat down to contact her. She leaped in a stream of vibrant red light from the tablet, as did ANODOIN, but this time the angel appeared as a whole person in my psychic space. She had long, curly, red hair and reddish white skin. Her face was young, beautiful, and mischievous. She wore a red Grecian style gown. She was kind and gentle and instructed me in the "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"82  FRATER W.I.T. mysteries of Fire. As she began to speak, my inner hearing registered a loud vibration along with her pseudohuman voice. It was androgynous in character and of a pitch higher than my own voice. The physical space surrounding my body, my entire field of inner vision, and the spaces in between, all seemed to vibrate with this extremely reverbed utterance. The angel told me to hear the voice of Fire. I here note that sound has played little part in most of my visions to date. That inner sense has never before been properly integrated with my mind’s eye. Achieving the intensity and clarity of such an unusual audible perception was a great breakthrough. Here was a sound that connected all the dimensions of my personal experience as one space. My superconscious projection was introducing me to a whole new reality, even beyond the one revealed by the Mercury Senior of Fire. It seems these Fire angels would take me much farther into the transcendence than any previous elemental contact. Eventually, the interdimensional sound stopped. I asked the angel to teach me to project my Will into the world. Her answer was to project in three stages. The first stage is the stage of Salt, the stage of focus. The second stage is of Mercury, of transcendence. The third stage is of Sulfur, of emanation. These three processes must be integrated for successful projection of Will. I must focus my magical attention on the object that is to receive the impress of my Will, whether it is a talisman, a sigil, or some item to be consecrated. Then, I must extend my magically charged aura to encompass and interpenetrate the patient of my operation. Finally, I must project a stream of my will from my innermost "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  83 core contradiction of self through the myriad partial, fractional dimensions which separate my mind from the physical world. This stream must enter the human scale of physical reality to infuse the object. My aura bridges this multifaceted gulf and opens up paths of potential realization through which my magical projection can flow to reach the recipient of my intention. Its etheric double receives this personal psychic image and is transformed by it, subtly altering the nature of the physical object. Making this interdimensional connection is the key to effectively projecting the Fire of Will. The magical link is hereby established and a cross section of the whole of spacetime comes to be incorporated into the aurically expanded interdimensional gestalt. Mind, matter, and cosmos become more intimately connected, fulfilling the ultimate purpose, the Great Work. I asked for the angel’s blessing and she gently caressed my cheeks, producing no physical sensation but rather a feeling of comfort. A red tinge filled my aura, hot and pulsating, yet stable. My aura soon took on a more coherent and solid form and was thoroughly energized. She kissed me several times but I wasn’t sexually aroused by this, being rather a quiet receptacle for the impress of her Will. I was the patient of her magical operation. The angel said that her function was the force of Fire, whereas the function of the Mercury Senior of Fire was the form of Fire. Indeed, Fire is carried effectively in streams which create fields of Fire, such as auras. These fields in turn project the Fiery streams of which they are constituted, conditioning them and weaving them into higher states of order. The streams are then shot forth to carry more specific images of Will. The field/stream duality corresponds to the "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"84  FRATER W.I.T. complimentary natures of Nuit and Hadit, the purifying and consecrating officers in a Golden Dawn style temple, and especially the ideas conveyed by the Thelemic LVX signs of the Whirling Star and the Rising Serpent.3 These two correlate opposite perspectives of existence are integrated by symbols such as Ra Hoor Khuit and the Sign of the Triumphant One. Real transformative power is applied by the whirlings and rushings of Fire. ALNDVOD – Luna Senior of Fire Sunday, March 19, 2000 I’ve evoked ALNDVOD, Luna Senior of Fire, with somewhat disappointing results. The angel appeared from out of the tetrahedron that formed in and around the Fire tablet at a spot right in front of me, having the same intensity as the other angelic evocations of this element. My auric energy dramatically intensified with this contact. ALNDVOD was male and spoke in a very deep, raspy voice. He told me to follow the spiral of Fire through all the interdimensional spaces, which I did in my vision. This ultimate creative principle consists everything in existence, from atoms to galaxies. The whole universe on all scales is part of this infinitely complex, ever whirling spiral. Nothing else really exists except the unlimited curling pattern. The angel then attempted to reveal to me the true appearance of the physical world as made up entirely of the great spiral but all I saw was a black background with tiny red lights shining throughout the vision. He told me that I wasn’t ready to achieve this vision because I’m too centered on my "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  85 ego. My identity must be loosened from my personal experience in the body and reach out to the various other dimensions of reality before I could appreciate the full vision of the great spiral. The concept of the prime pattern was clear to me but direct contact with such transcendent truth was beyond my ability to encompass and imagine. The psychic energy was more than I could withstand, being limited by my self image as within a body. The mental complexity needed to model such metaphysical sensations was lacking. The Senior said that my expansion beyond self as ego must occur slowly, over a long time. I needed to be patient but it would happen eventually. Until then, my access of consciousness would be limited. Interestingly, there were several technical and performance problems during the temple opening. The Air and Earth votive candles went out and I was unable to get the Air candle relit. Fumbling with it resulted in my spilling wax all over my altar cloth and carpet. I had difficulty concentrating throughout the ceremony, as if I were in a daze. It was as if I was feeling the effects of the evocation before actually performing it. After banishing the angel and closing the temple, I could feel a fierce fire flowing upward through my aura, a flaming Kundalini unlike anything before experienced. Nothing came close to it for intensity or vibrancy. Eating dinner helped to ease this torrent a bit. The effect wore off in time. Once again, I’ve been told by the angels, my greatest superconscious projections, that I’m not ready to penetrate the deepest mysteries of the elements. At this stage of my development, I’m too ego bound to achieve the full vision of transcendent impersonal reality. Several repetitions of this "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"86  FRATER W.I.T. training will likely be needed to reach its full potential. For now, I’ll be patient and finish this round of Watchtower evocations, including the five Spirit angels of the Tablet of Union. Wednesday, March 22, 2000 I continue to feel the torrent of fire in my nervous system, gained during last Sunday’s evocation/initiation. The angel actually entered my aura, sitting down inside me to bestow his blessing. I must be careful not to overcharge myself. This element is more powerful than any magick I’ve ever experienced, including all the ceremonial initiations bestowed by the magical schools with which I’ve been involved. It’ll take some time for the new energy to become fully settled in my aura. Already, it has become fairly well distributed. Complete balance will bring relief from the supercharge. AAETPIO – Mars Senior of Fire Sunday, May 14, 2000 I’ve evoked AAETPIO, Mars Senior of Fire, to excellent effect. The psychic charge was awesome but I handled it well throughout the ceremony and contact. I was able to maintain my concentration and composure by willpower and discipline while the torrent of Fire charged through my mind and aura. My recent meditations on emotion control and stoic acceptance of material circumstance have enabled me to channel energies that are far more intense than I’ve ever felt before. My angelic magical projection was done at the Netzach level. "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  87 The temple opening and conjuration were more intense than usual. Visualization of the inner plane temple, the intercirculating torus of light set in a deep space setting, was remarkably vivid and tangible. The various god forms and magical sigils traced in the air during the opening rite maintained themselves clearly on the astral. The entire temple seemed to buzz with energy. The Mars Senior of Fire leapt out of the great Southern Quadrangle as soon as I completed my conjuration. The angel’s form was a vast, long, red dragon with an entire male human body for a head. This beast of energy followed me to my seat of meditation where I opened myself to the superconscious contact. The dragon’s body continued to stream out of the Fire Tablet until it encircled the entire temple space. Unimaginable expanses of this entity remained within the interdimensional vistas beyond the southern watchtower. In this state, our souls touched. AAETPIO stood over me and said, “The might of Fire is the Name of God.” I felt intense torrents of red power coming to me from all outward and inner directions. The very intensity seemed to roar like a lion but there was no impression of sound. Then, the discourse of Fire began as the red energy coalesced into a great transdimensional tetrahedron, inside my mind and outside my body as one object. The circle of cosmos focuses itself to a point. This point is a core contradiction that formulates a triangle, the projection of the circle. The triangle extends itself into a tetrahedron, passing from spacetime into space and time. This seed casts reflections of itself that form tight spiral patterns which extend throughout the cosmos that formed it. The crisscrossing "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"88  FRATER W.I.T. interconnections and interferences of these projective currents constitute all matter and energy. Everything derives from this tetrahedral seed whose central point is the source of all pattern and possibility. All changes in state, all time, begin here. The instigator of creation is the instigator of incarnate consciousness. The universe and the self is one being in different states of becoming.4 I asked for the angel’s blessing and his head/human body sat down inside mine. My entire aura shone with intense red light. Even my feet became physically hot; an effect which continued for some time after the Senior left me. I was not overwhelmed, however, but remained relaxed and endured the initiation. I channeled the fiery Mars energy fully. My attunement to angelic Fire is complete. ADOEOET – Jupiter Senior of Fire Sunday, May 28, 2000 I’ve just evoked ADOEOET, Jupiter Senior of Fire, to enlightening effect. He appeared to me as a mighty angel with a mature male face, huge white wings, and a red robe. The whole figure was colored like The Emperor card in Aleister Crowley’s Thoth tarot deck. I handled the presence of the angel well and feel calm now. I haven’t even gone to dinner yet, so at ease do I feel with the awesome forces of Fire. Grounding with food isn’t necessary. The angel told me that I wasn’t yet ready to use the knowledge that he was going to give me but he told me anyway. There is a continuing stress throughout all existence, the result of the balancing between the forces that impel "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  89 everything to return to the original state of all in all as one and the forces that maintain the current coherent state of separateness. This subtle energy gives rise to the potential of Fire. Its realization in the realms of mind and action is Fire. I must learn to tap into the source of Fire, feel that ultimately subtle, stabilizing conflict of energies and realize it by an act of Will projection, imposing my own pattern onto the background of my contact with that great potential. Circumstances of the material world conform to such magical projections when they are made with sufficient intensity. The conflicting all-existent potential is the occult force of magick. Its full utilization yields unlimited power. The visions of the spiral/cylinder configurations indicate initial contact with the source of Fire. Once again, a Jupiter Senior has told me I wasn’t yet ready to handle his message and nature. Something of the Jupiter quality must be lacking in my psychic makeup. Greater maturity can only come with time. Auric complexity must develop slowly over the long years of life. For now, I’ll learn and grow all I can. ARINNAP – Saturn Senior of Fire Sunday, June 18, 2000 I have evoked ARINNAP, Saturn Senior of Fire, to good effect. Even during the opening, I could sense the building up of extremely intense, white brilliance pervading the magical workplace. Signs and symbols that were drawn in the air took shape in physical space,5 my mindspace, and the vision of the far horizon wherein the Cosmic Temple visualization takes "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"90  FRATER W.I.T. place. Profound magical force was called and shaped by my ceremonial. Upon conjuring ARINNAP, I perceived by inner vision my own face appear within the Fire tablet. It emerged into my space, taking on three dimensions, while streams of red light poured into the subtle dimension of the temple. These currents encircled the workplace as the angel wearing my face followed me to my place of meditation. His body was very like the Jupiter Senior of Fire but without wings. He sat down inside my body and communicated to me by speech and images in my mind. He told me about Fire as the ultimate source and instigator of all being and experience. There is a constant state of power surge throughout all of space and time, like a perpetual light scintillating everywhere at each point and overall. It is the ultimate on-ness, the oneness of All. This state is the natural correlate to the state of nothingness, no existence or tendency thereto, off-ness. The perpetual flow of ever burning life and light is the source of all substance. It evolves the intelligence which causes the forces of creation to generate that substance. Human consciousness consists of an emanation from this Fire, fixed on a particular experience to produce personal consciousness. Both presences, subject and object, work to formulate the events of space and time. Each material object depends from the higher reality that produces it by myriad interconnections, those spirals within spirals I’ve seen in other interdimensional visions. These connections branch to every other object and every other connection, forming a network of links at every level of being. This describes Aleister Crowley’s star sponge vision and "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  91 explains the various phenomena of magick as action at a distance. Healing or cursing by direct influence or transplantation is also explained. Great sensitivity is needed to be able to chart the courses of these various magical links and to discern how such occult potentials can be harnessed. The tapestry woven by these most subtle webs of relationship is the main subject of ancient thaumaturgy and alchemy. It is the ethereal plane, the Plastic Mediator, the Soul of the World, the life force. Understanding the nature of these flows of pure information is the goal of the magician, the discovery of the signatures and correspondences of nature. This penetrating perception may be developed over time by following a magical training regimen that reveals the Fire interconnections of the mind and body. As the mind becomes integrated through meditation and ceremonial practice, so the nervous system becomes integrated with the mind. All the cells in the body follow suit, along with the aura as a whole. The myriad circumstances of time and space likewise follow the magical projective efforts of one so attuned to the underlying substrate of nature. The mysteries of mind, matter, and the states in between reveal themselves to the accomplished adept. As this understanding grew in my psyche, the angel took off my face like a mask to reveal his true appearance. His face was very ugly and demonic but there was no trace of evil or malice. He had taken on my appearance for the sake of my peace of mind but at this point in the evocation, I was ready to face his truth. Saturn is often ugly in its impersonal cosmic nature. It is completely inhuman. "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"92  FRATER W.I.T. With his message and blessing fully conveyed, I gave the angel license to depart and then closed the temple with all due ceremonial. I felt no particular energization after the evocation, as I sometimes do after a Fire conjuration. However, on my way to dinner, a profound sense of ARINNAP’s white fire came over me. It was very subtle but intense, on the verge of becoming overwhelming. The effect wore off over time and was completely gone by the time my dinner was served. There were no further upsurges in energy after that. My attunement to this power is accomplished. I feel ready to call the Fire King. EDLPRNAA – King of Fire Sunday, July 9, 2000 On this seventeenth anniversary of my arrival in Los Angeles, CA to start my adult life, I’ve achieved the evocation of EDLPRNAA, great King of the South, elemental King of Fire, the single most powerful magical experience of my entire life. No other ritual or ceremonial initiation bestowed by any of the magical orders in which I’ve participated has ever come close to this reality altering revelation. I have successfully taken my magical life into my own hands and surpassed everything that has gone before. This completes the higher track of Enochian angelic evocation of the Watchtower series and establishes me as a master of the elements of the creation of my own being. The next and last step of this regimen is to evoke the five angels of the Tablet of Union, whose names are read from the columns. All the elemental powers are integrated into a cohesive unity of Spirit. Once this long track of thirty-three angelic evocations is complete, an Enochian oriented Bornless Ritual to conjure the Holy Guardian Angel "},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  93 will crown all efforts. The appearance of the Fire King was truly awesome. He didn’t come out of the tablet but rather focused in from every point in the space of my magical workplace. His gigantic face, of the light red color of the Fire angels, took up the entire floor, his body extending far beyond space and time. He reached into my mind’s inner perceiver, impressing all within with a mighty presence, and said that in order to wield the powers of Fire, I had to pass three tests. First, I had to be found worthy. To do this, I would have to pass a test of courage, go somewhere and commune with all that was, is, and shall be to show my ability to call upon Fire, and be able to control what I evoke from Fire. The second test was in Will and the third test was in emotional control. As this was being told to me, I noticed that little fiery spirals began to appear all around me, perceivable by the inner sense of ambience and visual impression. They were like tiny tornadoes of fire, spinning rapidly, the currents of flame whirling in spiral patterns up and down the funnel shapes. When the King’s speech was finished, space itself erupted with these elementals. Even the in between space became filled with them. I then realized that the King’s tests had begun. The first thing I did was to control my alarm and fear of the sudden torrential manifestation. I embraced their existence and took control of my psychic functioning which was channeling these whirling elementals. This aspect of my mind had been operating unconsciously until this point but was now brought to the fore through contact with the Fire King. I confidently took control of my ability to call forth these fiery Salamanders. Their realization was an activation of "},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"94  FRATER W.I.T. potentials that exist at every point of space and time and beyond. These potentials arise from the connection between each point of existence and the wholeness of all things. The little gates open up to that which is outside of all this, a supercosmos that is the source of True Will and the birthplace of the universe. This greater Truth is the source of transcendent impersonal consciousness. Once in control of the fiery projection and summoning process, I found myself able to guide the movements of the elementals into recognizable patterns. The flame funnels were all over me and inside me but answered readily to my control. The subtle and constant expansion of the universe produced more of the Fire elementals, generating more potential everywhere every second. They were raw becoming, ever increasing with the cosmic expansion. This explains why transcendent visions involve the depiction of such huge size. The wholeness of things is realized and portrayed in actualization, a higher dimensional principle squeezed into a vision of three dimensional space. Something completely beyond normal human experience is given a dream image by subconsciousness and then merged with self consciousness to build superconsciousness. In this way, I passed all the tests of worthiness. I proved my courage in the face of the inundating torrent of the Fire elementals’ manifestation in mind and aura. I was able to raise my consciousness to a higher reality, the supercosmos, in gaining control of my psychic faculties which determined how and where the raw powers of Fire were called forth from the all potential. The Salamanders were mine to control as their king. "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  95 Upon my realization of the higher reality, home of True Will, EDLPRNAA’s booming voice came into my mind and said that Fire exists at all points, at all times, and reaches beyond to the next level of existence. I began to feel the boundaries of my being expand to encompass the Fire space and to perceive a vast fire-colored spiral, only one section of which was the universe of space and time that humanity calls home. Curling inward from the Fire was the cosmic coherence of Water, spacetime, which contained all the stars and planets and the personal levels of consciousness. The spiral also extended outward from the physical universe and I could feel my consciousness being carried along its supercosmic track. Every curl of this megacreative principle contained another universe of possible experience. Here was an ever moving spiral of Fire, in contradistinction to stable, spherical Water. It flowed against a background of the pure darkness of nonexistence, pure nonpotential, lack of tendency towards any state. However, off in the far distance, there seemed to be tiny dots of light, like stars. Perhaps they were all-creative spirals like the one creating and expanding me, but I couldn’t tell for sure. After all, the potential for becoming is unlimited in scope. My Will and emotional impulses expanded in scope as I whirled up the interdimensional creative spiral, level by level. I had passed the test of Will. I noticed that the impulse to create which propagated along the Fire spiral was similar in pattern to emotional impulses but operating on a much larger scale. Indeed, animal consciousness is the first manifestation of cosmic consciousness at the level of life on earth. Savage it is, born of the core contradiction which drives spacetime creation. Thus, emotional control may be expanded to control of the cosmic creative tendency, the cosmic connection of the Nephesh. "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"96  FRATER W.I.T. Animals are more in touch with natural forces and their own collectives than are humans. A well formed ego tends to be cut off from its cosmic source by its extreme focus on its personal experiences. Intellect is fostered by this state of mind but so is existential alienation, leading to disdain for the natural world, a true self denial. Rejoining the sense of self to the natural ground of subconsciousness, linking intellect to the dream faculty which enables spiritual vision, creates transcendent superconsciousness, which is the inherent psychic functioning of the new aeon. By using my Will to unfold megacreation intelligently, I passed the test of emotional control. I had proven myself to the great King of Fire. The scene changed as my whole being made a quantum leap in expansion. I found myself in a reality of brilliant blue, where dancing flames of blue, red, and yellow moved all around me. Here was a purity of life I’d never experienced before. All trace of coherence was lost as the ecstasy of pure transcendence registered on every subtle sense. Here was the source of all consciousness, life in its proper setting, free of all conflict and contradiction, beyond all the illusion produced by contact with the world of matter. I joined myself to this pure energy and danced with the flames. With this profound blessing fully received from the Fire King, I could feel that the time had come to return. I made my way back to the megaspiral and then to my personal section of it. Returning to the physical world, I banished the Fire elementals and their King and then closed the temple in due form. There was no residual sense of overcharge or uncontrolled torrents of energy afterwards. I had effectively channeled, controlled, and banished the Fire energy in its most intense and powerful form. The Spirit angels are next to be called.

There was no sense of anything new, any new energy or state of mind. It was as if the angels spoke from all previously discovered states at once, an integration of what already existed. Naturally, everything was dwarfed by the Fire state but all qualities were present. In truth, All is One is all. At the very first, today’s magick was more intense than usual. While waiting for the charcoal in the censor to heat up, I sat in the prepared temple and rehearsed the second Enochian call. An almost overwhelming sense of power developed "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"98  FRATER W.I.T. which disturbed my concentration. I finished with difficulty and then went into another room of my apartment to try again. No unusual power was generated there. When the time came to begin my ceremony, I neglected to take the astral journey to my inner plane cosmic temple or perform the Middle Pillar Exercise, so disconcerted was I at so early a manifestation of magical energy.1 I began with the LBRP2 and my first Qabalistic Cross brought on an intense increase in the Kundalini flow up my back, a potent counterpoise to the downward flow of energy from the Cross.3 My aura expanded into the transcendent dimension far more effectively than any Middle Pillar Exercise had ever enabled. Without trying, I was transported to my inner plane cosmic temple, complete with all interdimensional connections. In this state, I completed the rest of the temple opening rituals and was able to call the angels from every level between mind and matter. The angels appeared to me in all dimensional levels, from within my mind to outside my body and out to the cosmos, as classic angelic male figures, showing only their heads, upper torsos, arms, and wings. They seemed to have been made of pure starlight and passed through several states of absorption into and emanation from the background outer space. All is One is all. RMTO told me that he was that which caused things to be and to disappear. He upheld the being of all that is and caused their obscuration. He revealed and hid all things in due course. Indeed, all manifestation contains a purely occult aspect, being but a projection of a higher dimensional reality. The manifest world and the occult world produced by the transdimensional "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  99 projection exist side by side and are interrelated on a deep level. The world of sense cannot be understood without its occult counterpart. Matter and aethyr are mirror images, two sides of the same coin. This evocation didn’t tire me or stress me in any way so I proceeded with the next angel in the series, the Air of Spirit angel named XCAI. He expressed the mirror world of manifestation as mentioned by RMTO. The background outer space of my inner plane cosmic temple reversed color. Space became white and the stars shown black radiance. The angel was the dark star, shining in the uncomprehending darkness with the darkness that is light in its way. He was a true correlate to RMTO. Both angels told me that they had been formed by the impress of my mind onto the transcendent light, the first time any of my projections recognized and announced themselves thus. They were cooperative and spoke as other angels have to me. Tablet of Union angel evocation is truly metalevel work. I feel calm and relaxed now, after having banished and closed the temple. My nervous system withstood the angelic force perfectly. I haven’t been brought to a new level of psychic intensity but rather achieved the integration of what has gone before. I am at the level of a Golden Dawn Portal initiate. Next time, I’ll be ready for the Water and Fire of Spirit angels and maybe even complete this round of Watchtower evocations with the Spirit of Spirit angel. For now, I may contemplate the mysteries of the occult aspect of manifestation. "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"100  FRATER W.I.T.

The nature of this being/projection is so far beyond my consciousness that I failed to achieve full contact. In fact, as I sat down to commune with AONT, a voice in my head said that I’d failed to evoke the angel. My vision space opened to reveal coruscations of water that eventually formed a tunnel. This led me nowhere. There was nothing except water and darkness. At length, a voice, different from the earlier one, said that I needed to evoke AONT in the dark of night, when my mind and the psychic space were quieter. Upon asking for a message, I heard that reality arose from pure potential in an on/off fashion. There is a phase of activity, where there is existence, and a phase of nothingness, where there is silence.4 I was reminded of a light bulb flashing on and off so quickly that it gives the illusion of continuous illumination. A face on the stream of water came from off in the distance and told me to try again later. So, here is yet another duality the Spirit angels have introduced me to. To really understand human reality, one must understand the intermingling of being and nonbeing. In a psychic physics context, the flow of time moves through states of existence in a universe of order and physicality to states of nothingness as pure potential. Total oblivion awaits everything between one tick of the clock and the next. Underlying the web of conscious reality lay an infinity of a pregnant naught. In order to understand the nature of AONT, I must be able "},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  101 to include the state of nonbeing, the off phase of consciousness, in my sense of self. So many of my magical and mystical operations are focused on exciting my consciousness in some way, using its functions at ever greater levels of intensity. The Water of Spirit angel is of the nature of silence. Active mind cannot experience pure silence, true Water. I must learn to be sensitive to the periods of silence inherent in existence. Action is useless for this as all action is merely noise. I need to evoke AONT in silence and be silent, whatever that entails. I’ll try this in an informal ceremony later tonight with just the Tablet of Union and a candle as equipment. I feel unsettled now. Even during the closing and dismantling of the temple, I had trouble concentrating. It feels like my inner center has dissolved and I’ve lost my psychic footing. It seems my illusion of the continuity of reality has been shattered. A more whole consciousness is resulting, one I’m not yet fully used to. Indeed, transformation is the name of the game of magick. Later that night: I’ve undergone a transformation as a result of today’s evocation but the nature of this change has not yet been revealed to me. Such things usually become clear only over time. I may not have directly reached AONT but some result has certainly been achieved. The Work is no failure. It’s interesting that I had this kind of trouble during my evocations of the Water Seniors and King. There’s something about this element, this level of psychic operation, that remains "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"102  FRATER W.I.T. beyond me. My mind is still too concrete and chaotic to achieve true silence, one of the four powers of the Sphinx. Clearly, the Tablet of Union angels operate at a level comparable to the elemental Kings. Later still: I’ve evoked AONT again with a simplified ceremony. I just set up the Tablet of Union in the east with a candle, performed the LBRP and intoned the second Enochian call, and then conjured the Water of Spirit angel. A sense of imminent potential, ready to burst forth into actualization, came into my mind but all was dark and absolutely silent. I quieted my mind as much as possible and communed with this state of imminence, verging on becoming but not quite yet. Visions of black and white color began to splash before my mind’s eye. Eventually, a pillar-like black and white conduit of flowing force appeared in the mind space in front of me. I could feel intelligence and intent in the being of the darkness taking shape in reality through the action of the tubule but only pure stillness could properly express such holistic ideas. It felt like any moment of this flowering understanding would require thousands of words to effectively express. I didn’t receive any other kind of signals. After communing for as long as possible in my hot apartment, I banished and closed my ceremony. Now, I feel calm and well adjusted to the energies running through my psyche and aura. It seems to me that Water of Spirit communicates directly with the subconscious, both being of silent natures. Perhaps in time to come, positive ideas will arise from the silent meaning. At this point, there is no way to know for sure. "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  103 Monday, September 25, 2000 It feels like new spaces have opened up deep within my psyche, causing my personal center to shift. I am but a column of energy, one of many in the overall being of which I am but a projection, focused on a dark, hidden potential. I, the synergy of all this potential, project my Will onto this potential to actualize and integrate its currents of possibility to produce spacetime images before my psychic perception. This is the operation of imagination. Yet, my creation is not continuous but consists of quickly oscillating on/off states that yield the illusion of coherent activity. This is the operation of the mind. Yoga practices suppress this activity, promoting a continuous off state and so allowing the source of consciousness, the imminent potential, to be experienced. A positive supercharging of mental activity has the same result, fusing all phases of conscious operation. Now, the imminent potential itself seems to have more presence, more intent, than ever before. A greater being than I is coming closer to awakening. PAAM – Fire of Spirit Sunday, October 15, 2000 I’ve evoked PAAM, Fire of Spirit Angel of the Tablet of Union, to excellent effect. Even during the Opening by Watchtower segment of the temple preparation, I achieved superconscious sky visions reflecting the nature of each element of the tablet. At first, PAAM appeared before my mind’s eye as a "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"104  FRATER W.I.T. drawing in white lines on the pitch black background I encountered during evocation of the Water of Spirit angel. A greatly expanded image of my physical body rose up through the floor of the temple, seen in my imagination, like a higher dimensional object floating through a lower dimensional plane. After this self image passed through my physical surroundings and disappeared, the angel spoke to me. He said he was that which alights and flies away, he who is here and far off. He is the light in the darkness and the beyond in the light.5 I experienced a tremendous Kundalini rise of black fire reaching all the way to my head and beyond. A rise up my front also occurred but was stopped at my neck due to blockage of my aura at that point. I felt the tingling and tightening of muscles that typify an auric short circuit. PAAM told me that I needed to wait until my flame was lit and my consciousness reached to the transcendence before my aura could achieve complete efficiency in conducting Kundalini. I believe this means that my sense of self identification is still too focused on my personal experience to be able to accept the purely impersonal energies represented by the Tablet of Union angels. Only by surrendering my ego to the higher dimensional reality of superconsciousness can I fulfill the highest initiations the Enochian angels have bestowed on me. Now, my mind and body remain filled with the Fire so bright it appears as dirty black darkness. I can channel this energy only to a point. My aura still has not achieved complete integration of its circuits. More time is needed to fulfill this natural process. In the meantime, I will complete this set of Enochian operations with the evocation of EHNB, the Spirit of Spirit angel, the thirty-third and last being of this long magical track. "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  105 Later that night: Usually, eating a heavy meal grounds me after an intense magical ritual. This even worked for my Fire tablet evocations. It didn’t work tonight. I came out of the restaurant feeling full and inwardly on fire. The effect has eased up at this point but my general level of vitality is significantly increased from the norm. I love it! I’ve had trouble in the past with this kind of auric supercharge but this time I’m taking it in stride. It feels great, smooth. I feel alive, not cooked. This is what magical adventure is really all about, testing personal limits and feeling completely new sensations. Oh yes, this is new. I’m ready for more. It occurs to me that the colors of Spirit are black and white. All of my Tablet of Union visions have been black, white, or both. Now, the black is in great motion, like a fiery, dark earth. I haven’t been able to achieve the white yet. The contrast should prove interesting. Monday, October 16, 2000 The Tablet of Union angels yield an intensity of psychic energy on par with that of the elemental Kings but the feeling is qualitatively slightly different. It’s more refined, smoother. This energy really is the most spiritual expression of the element. My Kundalini flow is increasing under the influence of the new channels of auric energy I’m tapping into with my evocations. The stream of lightning up the spine has become a thick column of light. A new stream now flows up the center "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"106  FRATER W.I.T. of my body, more in tune with the chakras at the front of my body. Resistance at the neck still exists for this forward flow. I’m confident that in time my aura will polarize and the flow will clarify into a united torrent through my body and beyond to the other dimensions of reality. Tuesday, October 17, 2000 I felt the dark, blissful silence of Water of Spirit in a peak experience had during meditation earlier tonight. As my psyche expanded, outside and inside my body, I pondered how to release my focus on self and transcend to the beyond of my psychic projection. In focusing on self and other as one, One, I attained that state of fusion and then, Silence, that deafening roar of totality. Even now after the peak experience is passed, I can recall this state clearly. EHNB – Spirit of Spirit Sunday, November 5, 2000 I have evoked EHNB, Spirit of Spirit angel of the Tablet of Union, thirty-third and last evocation in this elemental series, the pinnacle of the Enochian Watchtower system. The vision was more essence than form, a ubiquitous white light filling my being with ecstasy from every point in the space of my magical workplace. A booming voice told me to be receptive to the essence of all the elements. My spine tingled under the intensity of the Kundalini field extending from the base of my spine to the base of my skull. A transdimensional space opened up before my mind’s eye "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  107 which was filled with cubes in every dimension and between them. Each cube contained an elemental, either a flame, a willowy light, a current of water, or an orange space. These were elementals of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth, respectively. I understood then that Spirit is the pure essence of the mind, the potential for personal experience. Its manifestations are the four elements which are formed out of its three phases or modifications: dimensional unfoldment as space and matter, the flow of energy and change through that arena of realization as time, and the focus of thought on specific items of matter and energy in space and time. These are the three alchemical elements of Mercury, Sulfur, and Salt, respectively. The four and the three are produced by the interaction of mind with the universe it projects and which creates it. A unique, relative perspective develops from the continuing evolution of this cocreative process. The booming voice proclaimed me for having completed the system as King of the elementals and bade me command them as my Will inspired. I addressed the elemental essences arrayed before me and pronounced us all as devoted to the transcendent Will that brings about all states of being and nonbeing and is the core of my True Will. The influence from the ubiquitous white essence became even more intense after my decree, causing my entire body to tingle and shiver. I inwardly gazed at the elementals I’d be conjuring upon calling the angels of the Kerubic and servient squares of the four Watchtowers. At this, the booming voice began to conjure me, the conjurer, just like I conjure the angels; the same words were used. I found myself drawn more deeply into the vision space, becoming even more imbued with the white essence. "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"108  FRATER W.I.T. Suddenly, an angelic form appeared before my mind’s eye, a delicate, effeminate male dressed in blue and gold, with blonde hair and blue eyes. He had no wings but wore golden slipper-like shoes with curled-up toe. EHNB told me to abide at rest in this nexus of all elements, all qualities, the balance point from which all energies emanate. Here was the state of encompassing dimensionality, energy flow, and focus of thought. This is the mystery of the center of the tripletau and the upright point of the pentagram. I could feel the potential of all qualities present in this state of being, ready to emanate into actuality at the behest of Will. Then, the angel said, “In the name of Ralpern, I constitute you ruler of the elements.” I spent some time meditating in this state, the sense of power flow through my aura ever increasing. Finally, the intensity reached a peak and the angel told me to return to the world. I closed the temple in due form and then went to dinner, very hungry. There was no sense of residual energy after the closing, as there usually is with such a powerful conjuration. The energy was pure and clean and banished completely. I now feel very good and peaceful.6 Later that night It occurs to me that the state of the secret spirit center applies to Tiphareth on the Tree of Life as well as the top point of the pentagram and the center of the tripletau. Sephirah six is the center of the Tree and from that focus of being all potential and all manifestation emanate. It causes its cause and is an effect of its effect, pure cocreative paradox. "},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" Chapter VIII VISIONS OF THE GREAT NORTHERN WATCHTOWER OF EARTH SECOND ROUND Explanatory Note: A short time after completing my whirlwind tour of the Enochian elemental tablet angels, I suffered what can only be described as a short circuit of my aura and nervous system. The occasional bouts of anxiety I’ve had since childhood suddenly became much worse, especially at night. Over the next several months, insomnia became a real problem. Also, I suffered from muscle spasms, particularly around the eyes. All of these symptoms derived from an overplus of subconscious psychic energy pouring into my personal awareness and through to my peripheral nervous system. Psychologists would call this an uncontrolled rise of unconscious contents. It became clear to me that the magical circuit I’d just completed was too much for me to handle. I pushed through the Enochian magical system, heedless of the warnings given me by those "},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"110  FRATER W.I.T. angels/projections which I charged to instruct and initiate me. I’d come too far, too fast. It was my initial intension to repeat some of the Water, Fire, and Spirit angel evocations which had given me trouble the first time around and then move on to some self initiatory ceremonies. However, after my symptoms worsened, I knew this course of action was impossible. A prolonged break from any magick was needed to properly integrate the overplus of new energies flooding into my personal being. My state of mental and physical health would indicate how to proceed after that. Eventually, my nerve shock symptoms subsided to normal and I felt ready to return to magical operation. The best course of action at this point was clearly to repeat the entire round from the beginning. To return to evocation of such powerful entities/thought forms as the Water, Fire, and Spirit angels without the gradual buildup provided by the more personal elements of consciousness would only lead me back to more auric and nervous overload. Repeating what I’d already mastered would serve to reinforce the more stable aspects of my psyche and so better enable me to withstand the tidal wave of more intense, impersonal forces. This round, however, I would strictly adhere to every warning given me and call only one angel at a time. Every aspect of the Enochian reality had to be fully understood before moving on, no matter how many times a particular angel needed to be called to be mastered. Lust of result, finishing the Watchtower course, would have to be put aside. As my subsequent results show, this was a wise policy to follow. Looking back on my ordeals, I regret none of it and am "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  111 even grateful for the extreme tests of Will and perseverance afforded by the backlash of too much magick. One of the greatest values of the magical path is the testing of personal mettle. Smashing into them head on may reveal personal limitations. The system of magical contacts pioneered by John Dee and Edward Kelly over four centuries ago remains the most powerful course of occult practice in the western world. Only the intrepid and devoted practitioner can succeed on this journey to the farthest reaches of the mind and soul. Here is what happened next. ACZINOR – Jupiter Senior of Earth ICZHIHAL – King of Earth Sunday, January 21, 2001 I’ve decided to collect the results of my Enochian evocations for this round in a journal separate from my main magical record in order to facilitate perusal of past ceremonial results. It’s difficult to search through months and years of copious diary just to find the records of particular events and operations. Everything will be ready to hand this time around. It’s been a long time since I last performed a formal temple working. I made several dumb mistakes, such as using the banishing forms of the spirit pentagrams during the Opening of the Temple by Watchtower and forgetting some of the customary speeches. I also forgot a word in the elemental call. Nonetheless, my result was successful and clear in meaning. Form is less important than effectiveness of contact and efficient usage of the essential powers of the psyche. I first evoked ACZINOR, Jupiter Senior of Earth. As little "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"112  FRATER W.I.T. vision was revealed this time as in my previous Earth Senior evocations. The angel appeared to my inner sense only, as a white outline against a black background. He told me that I’d fulfilled this stage of work and that I was ready to take the next step. He actually seemed annoyed that I’d gone back to Earth in the first place. I banished him in due form. Delighted at my progress, I decided to call ICZHIHAL, the Earth King and ultimate angel of the Northern Watchtower, to confirm my fulfillment of his element. He appeared in my mind and in my aura in vastness and majesty. The very solidity of the floor of my apartment seemed to ripple with the awesome force of him. He took shape in my imagination and told me that my previous work with the Earth tablet was enough to fulfill what I could accomplish here and that I was ready to move on to the Air tablet. He went on to say that Earth is the foundation of all action, the unchanging basis that supports all changes in form and motion. It is stability in the midst of change. My plan for next time is to evoke the Jupiter Senior of Air in order to see if I need to spend more time with that element. The Air King will be next if all is achieved there, like with Earth. Water will be next after that and if all goes well, I’ll return to the powers of Fire in no time. If this round turns out to be very quick, I’ll be ready to dare performance of an Enochian style “Liber Samekh” working. This will fully prepare me for work with the Kerubic and servient angels of the Watchtowers. "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" Chapter IX VISIONS OF THE GREAT EASTERN WATCHTOWER OF AIR SECOND ROUND AAOZAIF – Jupiter Senior of Air Sunday, February 4, 2001 I’ve evoked AAOZAIF, Jupiter Senior of Air, to good effect. He appeared before me as a general presence with a yellow tinge and then projected into my mind as a bearded man in a white robe. The scene was pure whiteness with golden spangles. He told me that Air was not about the motions of objects through space or thought through the mind but rather the action of nonlocality in coherent reality.1 The pattern of chaotic induction that leads to emergent order involves a radical expansion of energy when the underlying potential builds up to a bursting point, manifesting in actuality all at once.2 The movements of objects follow these information patterns. "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"114  FRATER W.I.T. AAOZAIF put his hands over my eyes in vision and showed me a deep space scene wherein I could feel the quantum buildup of complex information patterns and their eruption in physical space and time, evolving emergent order. This is Air. I observed the process several times under the angel’s guidance. I asked the angel if I should evoke the Air King next and then move on to Water or evoke the other Air Seniors first. AAOZAIF said that it was my choice. I’d already achieved great understanding of Air at the angelic level but I could refine my experience if I so chose. With that, I gave the angel license to depart and then closed the magical workplace. My decision is to evoke the other Air Seniors, one at a time, before the great King. This element feels so good and natural to me. There is much more I can learn. No need to rush. HTMORDA – Luna Senior of Air Sunday, February 11, 2001 I’ve evoked HTMORDA, Luna Senior of Air, in due form. The same full moonlike face with the grin all across appeared before me. She immediately began to kiss and caress me in a highly sexual way. I still feel aroused by the experience. The angel told me to realize sexual energy as a projection of the Phallus, source pattern of all creation and creativity. I was also to call her name for spirit sex as outlined in various books on sexual magick. There will be time for this later on. Indeed, the function of sex is the primary example of the pattern of creative ebb and flow, a building up of tension within the nervous system until a radical explosion of ejaculation occurs in a fountain like pattern, and then a relaxation back to "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  115 normal.3 There is a mystery here beyond the obvious physiological energy patterns, likely relating to the general process of creation. My Kundalini rose up my spine under the influence of the angel’s passion. It grew in visualization until it turned into a great white penis flowing out of my back and head. HTMORDA encompassed my entire body with her giant mouth in order to give head to this member of Fire. She soon withdrew from this and told me to close the temple. More would be revealed during the upcoming sexual tryst with her. I gave her license to depart and closed the temple in due form. Later... I lay down in my bed in the nude and called HTMORDA with my mind’s voice. She appeared to me and hovered over my body. The white Kundalini/phallus vision returned and she again gave pleasure to it as before. Pressure began to build throughout my nervous system, causing a specific flow of energy to rise from my Svadisthana (Mars) chakra to my Anahatta (Sun) chakra, which then charged outward from my body like a gushing fountain. Other flows of energy took shape in and around my aura with amazing complexity. Eventually, I brought myself to ejaculation under the angel’s influence. The phallus image suddenly appeared to mind’s eye like a shining sun. It multiplied itself until my entire vision space was filled with solar phalluses, as if the entire universe rose in response to my personal orgasm. Suddenly, the whole scene changed to small children playing in a playground. No further changes occurred after this and my aura cooled down to normal. I banished the angel and exited the vision. "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"116  FRATER W.I.T. Sex is a particular example of a projective process that works nonlocally to spawn offspring as a result of a cosmic response mechanism. The universe as a single whole comes to participate in a localized system and so spreads its patterns throughout existence all at once. It is a quantum leap of state on a cosmic scale. This type of nonlocal action is the magical principle of sympathy. The whole universe as one living mind is sensitive to certain archetypal patterns and propagates them throughout its vast expanse of space and time. The scale of the ultra small, the human, median scale, and the cosmic scale all come to share the same pattern set, a condition which mathematicians call self similarity. This is the hallmark of a fractal, a fractionally dimensional construct, created on a computer by plotting points based on the iteration of a simple seed equation very many times over. Mathematicians call this process self recursion. The development of consciousness, as well as all other patterns of growth, organic and inorganic, may be modeled this way. All is One in all. Chains of being carry natural signatures everywhere when the planes come into alignment. Universal sympathy is the source of procreation. AHAOZPI – Venus Senior of Air Sunday, February 18, 2001 I’ve evoked AHAOZPI, Venus Senior of Air, effectively. She stepped right out of the Air tablet upon being called and bade me open my mind to her as I entered into trance. I immediately got the sense that spirit sex was inappropriate here. Venus represents a more transcendent aspect of the feminine principle than does Luna and so attitudes of reverence and respect were called for. Also, a deliberate act of Will was required to allow the angel to enter my mind to engender a "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  117 vision because of my innate prejudice toward the principle of the virgin. This narrow mindedness had developed over a lifetime because she had been given connotations of helplessness and ignorance by the patristic society in which I was raised. I’m happy to report that this prejudice has been dissolved. AHAOZPI appeared to my mind’s eye as the same gorgeous blonde as seen from previous visions of this angel. She showed me a doorway and said that this led to the Palace of the Queen of Air. In order to gain entrance, I had to answer three questions. The first was who are you, to which I said that I am a dimensional unfoldment seeking fullest possible expansion to gain fullest possible understanding and knowledge. The second was why have you come, to which I declared that I was seeking truth to understand my own nature and achieve the greatest possible becoming. The third was what do I hope to gain from the Queen, to which I replied that I was seeking her knowledge and blessing. The thick, golden double doors opened to reveal a long hall with tables lining the walls on either side. Sitting at the tables were throngs of angels dressed in gossamer white robes, talking together in a festive atmosphere. A long red carpet led to a great golden throne on which an enormous brazier was burning, emitting thick, black billows of smoke. Many more angels surrounded the throne in attitudes of worship and devotion. The Venus Senior of Air walked with me to this throne. A grand, regal, matronly voice came from the brazier, asking me what I hoped to gain from an audience with the Queen of Air. I declared a desire to learn her mystery. She "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"118  FRATER W.I.T. told me that none could reach the King of Air except through her. I’d have to be prepared in order to pass through. Several angels stripped me of my magick robe, poured three cups of water over me, and dressed me in the same type of garment all the angels were wearing. Then, the Queen stepped forth from the smoke of the brazier, a towering figure who picked me up in her titan hand. I couldn’t see much of her except the myriad folds of her long motley colored dress. She set me in her enormous crown in a jewel setting surrounded by purple stones in other settings. I gazed out from my place, far above the floor of the palace. Angels came to me and laid me flat on a table there in the jewel setting. They called up fire from the surrounding air which burned me to nothing. I felt no pain but found myself carried by the smoke from the fire all around the palace as it diffused through the air. The message in all this was that the focus of mind is one with its transcendent source and that I needed to realize the ever present reality of consciousness. Then, the palace was swallowed up by thick, white mist and I found myself in a limitless space, still in a diffused state. The King of Air appeared, truly gigantic like his mate. I hovered near his face as he declared that I would soon evoke him directly and he would come to me then, as now. AHAOZPI came to me then and I coalesced back to my focused form, magick robe and all. She guided me back to my body and told me to call her again. I left the vision, banished the angel, and closed in due form. The mystery of the Virgin is one of purity.4 Will overcoming animal desire is the way to enter that state of mind "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  119 needed to understand this mystery. Such action hurts with a mindset developed in a sexually obsessive, yet repressive society but certain mysteries call for the state of purity. Only the pure in mind and body can contact the Queen of Air. She expresses the fullness of my personal subconscious, impossible for a synergistic focus of ego to grasp fully but which has its place among many other life currents therein. The source and wholeness of all personal being is the Truth that fully comprehends incarnated consciousness. A state of purity is needed to connect with this transcendent principle, the metalevel of transcendent personal consciousness. I am humbled yet elevated and blessed by contact with this totality of my being. Now, I feel slightly buzzed from my Air contacts, with a sense of the diffused perspective gained, after being sacrificed in the crown of the Queen. It seems to me that I should call AHAOZPI for spirit sex like I did with HTMORDA, Luna Senior of Air. Certain mysteries cannot be apprehended by direct observation and contemplation but only in silence so that the fullness of being may act unhindered. I must cultivate this type of operation of greater conscious action. Monday, February 19, 2001 It occurred to me that I confine myself to the use of the angelic calls and tablets only in the context of a formal open temple, whereas Dee and Kelly simply sat at a table furnished with various talismans and conjured the angels. No record of any organized ceremonial has ever been found, to my knowledge. Even the old grimoires are sketchy regarding ceremonial operation, although perhaps, they were meant only for people taught in particular schools of magick who would know the details of ritual omitted in the published material. "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"120  FRATER W.I.T. So, to experiment, I stared off in a random direction, pronounced the Air call, and summoned AHAOZPI as she requested yesterday. I lay on my bed naked and received her vision and contact with no more formality than what Dee and Kelly did centuries ago. The vision began with the beautiful angel lying on top of me but there was no initial sexual stimulation by the palpable pressure caused by this psychic projection. I achieved an inner vision of being held by the Senior as an infant held by its mother. My penis began to throb with excitation after awhile but then my neck tightened up with muscle spasms.5 She began to kiss me while I did what I could to relax the muscular tension and surrender to her. Gradually, a dark current ran all through my body from my feet to the top of my head. It completely absorbed and encompassed me and split into two halves, between which emerged a shaft of white light. The Mother is all and I am but a ray of light in her void. I brought myself to orgasm under the loving and encompassing influence of this dark Mother and then left the vision without banishing of any kind. The angel projection was a convenient device to open my awareness to the presence of the Mother archetype within me, the vast unconscious potential from which I, the ego, was born. This needn’t be confused with the mother that gave me physical birth. I love them both. Later... My neck tension has continued since today’s impromptu AHAOZPI evocation. I ritually gave the angel license to "},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  121 depart and then performed a Lesser Banishing Pentagram Ritual. This helped somewhat but not completely. Yes, formal temple ceremonial definitely helps handle the intense energies of magical evocation. Perhaps, I need a break from this Work for a while.6 AHAOZPI – Venus Senior of Air Sunday, April 1, 2001 Having fully recovered from my ill conceived sex magick experiment, I’ve again evoked AHAOZPI, Venus Senior of Air, with great effect. At the beginning of my performance of the temple opening, long before any angelic conjuration, I felt an enormous sense of power which made me giddy, a sure sign of Air influence. Here is another example of the effect of a ceremony reaching into its own past, before it is even performed. A vast hyperdimensional head of a distinguished old, bearded man moved through the temple, seen with my inner sense of the physical world around me. It was in constant motion, yet remained absolutely still, truly a projection from higher dimensions through the three dimensional space of my magical workplace, or at least my mental picture of it. This awesome impression persisted throughout the opening ceremony but faded away upon the final declaration of temple readiness. It seemed strange to me that such a masculine presence should have manifested so early in an evocation of a decidedly feminine spirit but I forged ahead with the conjuration of AHAOZPI. She appeared readily to my inner sight, looking very much like the Luna Senior of Air, with round head and huge mouth.7 She said that I wasn’t ready for the next step in my initiation "},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"122  FRATER W.I.T. and that I should return immediately. I told her of my difficulties regarding certain traumatic childhood experiences that continued to haunt me and asked for her help and advice on how to heal these emotional complexes. Suddenly, a male voice from above said in a deep, echoing voice that he would help me. He told AHAOZPI to lead me to the Gate of Light and there I would learn the answers to my personal problems. Only the great King of Air could command an angel this way. The Senior seemed apprehensive but obeyed the authoritative voice. After walking a short way through the vision space, we came to a golden double gate, behind which was a set of eight stairs leading up to a vast blue sky. The disembodied voice told me to pass through the gate and climb the stairs if I wanted to learn the answers to my personal problems. I immediately went to the top of the stairs and looked out at the sky to see a vast hyperdimensional image of my own head. The King’s voice said that I was not yet ready to receive a complete vision of him but that my answers lay ahead of me. I was then told that I had to understand myself completely as the focus of a greater consciousness. I needed to achieve the perspective of superconsciousness and effectively impose my Will on those aspects of my psyche I wanted to change. To Will on the superconscious level is to Will with wholeness, to reach into the system from without and so have control over any part thereof. This metalevel of operation is what John Lilly referred to as the metaprogrammer. I translated myself from my individual perspective, standing at the top of the stairs, to the hyperdimensional self image looking at the stairs and myself.8 The space surrounding "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  123 the stairs was black. After awhile, the Air King told me to return and so I did. I closed and banished in due form.9 I’m very intrigued to have had the Air King intercede on my behalf. AHAOZPI couldn’t give me guidance but her ruler did. My superconscious powers are working from outside my personal psyche to bestow greater health on me. My magick has become versatile enough to yield the type of projection needed to achieve my purpose, even if the particular evocation is off the mark. Ultimately, all the spirits are one, my own projections.10 The eight stairs represent Hod, the first step to superconsciousness, the level beyond the personal. The Air King told me that I’d never be able to pass on to Water without first achieving the metaprogramming level since that element is pure superconsciousness, completely impersonal. I believe the hyperdimensional image of the old man that appeared to my mind’s eye at the beginning of today’s ceremony was a shadow of the Air King, a foreshadow of the vision to come. His projection into the past was sustainable to me, although direct contact was not. The transtime nature of magically enhanced psychic energy projection could be harnessed for the development of ESP abilities such as prescience and clairvoyance. AHAOZPI – Venus Senior of Air Sunday, April 15, 2001 I have evoked AHAOZPI, Venus Senior of Air, for the third and last time on this round, having completed my Air "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"124  FRATER W.I.T. Queen initiation. At the start, the angel appeared before me and kissed me warmly. She told me that I was ready to complete my initiation and led me into vision. I was once again seated as a jewel in the crown of the Air Queen, just where I left off. A booming female voice said that I was ready to see her, the Air Queen. She introduced herself as MARDALA (seven letters like all the other Senior names). She was hyperdimensionally, interdimensionally vast, with only the top half of her projected into the palace. She had long, curly, black hair, big lips and teeth, and was regal and matronly. It was as if the entirety of reality focused itself to form her body in the palace. She then lifted me up with her titan hands beyond the palace, beyond normal space, to set me in a chariot with two great wheels. Only the inherent force of the cosmos drove this great seat as it transcended into the infinite starry space of holistic existence. MARDALA took me to a place among the stars, one star in the company of stars, all the while intoning litanies to Nuit based on passages out of chapter one of “Liber Legis.” I took my fill of love under the stars, a true child of Nuit. Inspiration came to me to realize that love is the essential mystery of MARDALA, the ultimate truth of being and projection. All phenomena are understood to be expressions of universal love from the transcendent perspective. A great feeling of love and joy filled my whole being as starlight filled me all the way through, causing me to shine as a star. I rose above my vision body as a glowing point of pure light, radiating to all points of space and united with them. I "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  125 achieved a state of pure paradox in, among, and in between all dimensional states, yet transcendent to all conditions, truly as Hadit. I am the Father, eternal consort to Nuit in all her forms and expressions. The ecstasy was indescribably sweet but I noticed that its scope was limited to the subtler levels of my psyche. Seeking integration with all states of my coherent personal consciousness, I reunited with my vision body and shed my serpentine light to all the mansions and hollows of my psyche and aura, even to the quietest motivation. My entire material being was infused with light, love, ecstasy, and paradox, in every fiber and all at once. The parts and the whole became one. This intensity quickly built to an overwhelming crescendo and I experienced a moment of auric supercharge that sent astral fire to every nerve ending in my physical body, so startling that it almost threw me out of my trance. I resisted the energy and pulled back from the ecstasy. It was just too much to handle. The effect was gone in an instant but the awesome memory of it lingers still. Only repeated experiences of such overwhelm can enable me to withstand this kind of intensity for long. Channeling such power as magical projection will surely enhance my abilities. Hadit is all states, all conditions, and makes connections among them in any and every combination possible. He is the projector (and projection) of Nuit, spacetime focusing possibilities out of itself from higher to lower dimensional states. These superpose to form all energy and the matter derived therefrom. Thus is universal consciousness. "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"126  FRATER W.I.T. At one point in my ecstasy, the voice of the great King of Air came to me and proclaimed that I’d fulfilled the initiation of love and that I was ready to move on with my evocations. I would explore light, even though some of its aspects would cause me distress. All must be persevered through because every aspect was necessary to the whole. All motivation must be experienced from the standpoint of universal love such as had been given to me in vision. Only this perspective enables understanding and unity, the ultimate superconsciousness. HABIORO – Mars Senior of Air Sunday, April 22, 2001 I’ve evoked HABIORO, Mars Senior of Air. He came out of the tablet and pushed his face into mine to commune with my psyche. He said that I was ready for the next initiation and that I should go to the skies now. The infinite sky space of previous visions opened before my mind’s eye so I went into it. The angel assumed vast, interdimensional, pandimensional proportions in my vision and told me to take my place here as the emanator and source of being. I shifted my state and became the Senior, a great field of being whose focuses of consciousness were everywhere within, unlimited potentialities of emergence of individualized perspectives. HABIORO’s disembodied voice said that I needed to take my place as a god to assert control over the forces of nature. Only a god, who encompassed all the elements and so stood outside them, could command them effectively. Then, he told me to call forth the lightning and I did so. The whole sky space was shot through with mighty bolts of white lightning, blindingly brilliant. They became steady streams of forking energy, columns of pure power. "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  127 I communed with this energy and asserted my Will as a god of being, a primary principle of creation.11 After a short time, HABIORO appeared before me in the sky and led me into a hallway that I was inspired to create as a psychic projection (a projection within a projection). We came to an altar on which was a great golden chalice. He told me to drink from the cup and undergo initiation. I drank of the black fluid and my projected vision body was swallowed up in darkness. It instantly dissolved, freeing my consciousness to attain the field perspective once more in the infinite sky.12 Then, the angel told me that it was time for him to leave so I gave him license to depart. I returned to my physical senses and closed the temple in due form. I here note that a number of fantasy movie themes appeared in today’s vision. Death by drinking poison from a golden chalice and calling the lightning were events I’ve recently seen in films depicting magical stories. The former dealt with the Holy Grail and the latter depicted a powerful wizard at the point where he could have been corrupted by temptation. These issues are compelling for a magician who is told to assert his innate godhead. Delusion and egotism are pitfalls for a wizard who loses the understanding that everything that lives, is a god in truth. To be a god is simply to channel the wholeness of being. This is the challenge I’ve been given in this vision, to rule completely over the elements of my consciousness while living in a world full of others like myself. “Every man and every woman is a star.” "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"128  FRATER W.I.T. AAOZAIF – Jupiter Senior of Air13 Monday, May 14, 2001 I’ve evoked AAOZAIF, Jupiter Senior of Air, to fantastic effect. He delivered by far the most intense magical charge of any Air angel to date, including the Air King and Queen. The vision did not deal with the usual series of psychological issues but rather began a new phase of development completely transcendent to anything to do with my personality or past experience. I’ve been initiated into a whole new way to exist. AAOZAIF stepped out of the Eastern Quadrangle as I meditated after his conjuration. Instead of entering my mind or talking to me from the other set of dimensions contiguous with the familiar space and time, he took me by the astral hand and led me to a far away dark space. I found myself in a dual state, partly inside my body and part outside it. Before us was a certain symbol of utmost secret nature floating several feet above the floor. The angel said that here was the mystery of the celestial nature. If I was ready to receive this mystery and join the Order of those who likewise keep it, I must take an oath. I readily agreed and felt an auspicious sense of occasion. I, Frater W.I.T., swore that I would keep secret the mystery of the secret symbol from everyone who was not worthy to receive it. There was no penalty clause to this oath. The responsibility belonged to those who took it, a rare selection among humanity. Upon completing the oath, the symbol leaped onto me and imprinted itself deeply into my aura, from my head to my perineum, from my Sahasrara to my Muladhara. The rush of energy and sense of presence was so intense that I almost "},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  129 collapsed and lost the vision. This was a supercharge that rivaled the flaming Kundalini experienced with the Fire tablet angels. No doubt, the symbol is a permanent addition to my aura. AAOZAIF delivered a lecture on the nature of the celestial level of existence. It was beyond the elemental world in every way. The mode of thought was different, not being based on manipulation of the elements of personality and personal experience. A truly higher state of being was called on to express consciousness. Magical technique had to be different because of this. The basis was no longer the simplicity of four but rather the complexity of seven. A whole new magical reality had been formulated. After this, the angel led me to his throne, a basic affair, gold but unadorned. He said that the Mars angel had bidden me to sit on that throne. To do so, I needed to take the transcendent perspective, the true Thelemic perspective. Only then could I rise above the pain of the roiling of the elements. He told me to sit at his right hand so I sat down next to his throne on the floor of the dark space. Soon after, I took my leave of the angel and gave him license to depart. I performed the temple closing ceremony in a fog, still feeling the charge of the imprinted auric symbol. I went to dinner after this to help ground myself. If I’m now part of another Order, it’s not an organized body but rather a shared level of consciousness, a true and invisible Order. "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"130  FRATER W.I.T. AVTOTAR – Mercury Senior of Air Sunday, May 27, 2001 I have evoked AVTOTAR, Mercury Senior of Air, in due form. Surprisingly little has happened since the glorious initiation bestowed on me by AAOZAIF, Jupiter Senior of Air, so I thought that a piece of this puzzle of Air initiations was missing, that is, Mercury. Today’s vision proved I was wrong about this. The vision began with the angel appearing to my mind’s eye as an enormous interdimensional man with the typical Air moonhead. He held a throne in his hands and set me down on it. He raised me high over his head into a dark space and a great feeling of upward motion shot through me. Upon extending his arms fully over his head, AVTOTAR sent bursts of energy through me but with each jolt, I could feel myself offer resistance to the current. The message was clear that my aura was not yet a fully efficient channeler of cosmic energy. Then the angel told me that I was not yet ready for this evocation. I had not yet finished assimilating the initiatory symbol given me by the Jupiter Senior of Air. Mercury was not a missing piece of the puzzle presented to me by the Jupiter initiation but rather a new step in the process in its own right. The angel showed me the symbol of most secret nature and said that every part therein had to be fully worked into my being before the process was complete. Furthermore, adjustment had to be made by those aspects of being beyond my mind that dwelt with me. I needed to meditate on the symbol of most secret nature in order to further this process of initiation. "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  131 With that, I gave the angel license to depart and closed the temple. However, during those ceremonies, a strange energy began to flow through my mind and aura, hampering my concentration. I’ve experienced this effect following other evocations where dramatic breakthroughs had occurred. A small voice inside my mind said, “Ha ha! I fooled you. The initiation took place.” I still feel affected but less than before. Looking back on this experience, I think that I had a reaction to the presence of AVTOTAR. Due to the fact that I wasn’t yet ready for his Work, a lying spirit/projection arose from my subconscious to taunt me. Indeed, an aspect of Mercury is the trickster. Such is the ape of Thoth. At any rate, my time wasn’t wasted.14 I know now that no pieces of the picture are missing and that my proper Work must deal with the symbol of most secret nature. I’ll evoke AVTOTAR again when fully integrated with the energies of my initiation and can channel energy more efficiently through my magically enhanced auric system. AVTOTAR – Mercury Senior of Air Sunday, August 5, 2001 I’ve successfully evoked AVTOTAR, Mercury Senior of Air. He stepped out of the eastern quadrangle and entered my mind to reveal a brightly lit idyllic scene of countryside, almost cartoon like in its beauty. The angel said, “Come and learn the mystery not yet "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"132  FRATER W.I.T. revealed.”15 We walked up a large hill and at the top I saw the brilliant sun right in front of me, shining yellow and orange.16 I greatly wondered at this magnificent revelation and was absorbed by the celestial orb come down to earth. AVTOTAR remained by my side, on the right, and told me to behold my source. The source is the One and every part of all and the All. Every piece of existence is the All-One in a particular function. Here is the source of the Light of which I am the genius, I beyond all I am, the core essence of all phenomena and the tendency to unfold as such. The glorious light of this daystar filled not only my psyche but also my nervous system and aura, too, from head to toe. The whole vision was taken up by brilliant orange-yellow light but suddenly a darker space opened up before me, like a chamber, to reveal four tablets of orange-yellow stone shaped like steles. They were arrayed in pairs, two on my left, one behind the other, and two on my right, one behind the other. Inscribed on them were letters of an alphabet of which I’m not familiar, definitely not Enochian, but somewhat like the Sanskrit alphabet.17 AVTOTAR told me to take the tablets and then led me out of the sun over to a clearing in the natural setting. We came upon a table on which was a clear glass bowl full of silvery water. The angel said that here was a mystery of Mercury and that I should meditate on this symbol. I could also return to this place whenever I wanted. Then, AVTOTAR told me it was time to leave so I exited the vision and gave the angel license to depart. "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  133 I felt strangely unaffected by the vision after leaving it but during the closing, the tremendous energy I absorbed made itself felt.18 The orange-yellow energy rose Kundalini-like from my feet to my head, encompassing my whole body and permeating every cell and space therein. Concentration was difficult at times while in this state of supercharge but I managed to close the magical workplace in due form and put away my equipment. I now feel well adjusted to this airy, mercurial force of source, having been well prepared for this ordeal by the Jupiter Senior of Air initiation. I was truly ready for contact with the Mercury Senior of Air. So, I’ve reached to the mysteries of the One that is All and in all, the only truly existing entity in its myriads of functions in the universe. Totality exists at every point, every bit of matter and energy, every thought and concept on all planes and scales, and encompasses all as a continuous holomovement.19 Each projection is truly its own source but acting in a particular function, one ray of a vast star shine. It may appear as an entity in its own right to a terrestrial sensorium but the clear sighted may recognize the One therein. The ultimate reality is the realm of commonality of all concepts and states of being and so patterns from any plane or space may be connected at that level. New realities may be developed from the ground up. Terrestrial/futique fusions of any sort may be developed at the root level. Monday, August 6, 2001 I forgot a subtle detail about yesterday’s vision but was reminded tonight by some haunting psychedelic rock music. This detail of the magical landscape was so subtle and so far in "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"134  FRATER W.I.T. the background, underlying the more obvious images, that I mistook it for interference and so ignored it. Tonight’s music stirred my emotions in exactly the same way the subtle darkness and mystery behind all the light did yesterday. It was like how the voluptuous night sky is overwhelmed by the light of day but remains nonetheless. Images such as a storm over green hills and a dark purple sky on a brisk autumn night with a cool wind blowing by, carrying the possibility of a coming rain, come to my mind under this influence. The lesson is that Mercury is a dual natured energy at every level of its expression. It is the essence of duality from the most sublime to the most dense. Suggested here is the mystery of the upward flowing versus the downward flowing Kundalini, the dove and the serpent. AVTOTAR has brought me an expansion of consciousness that stands in clear counterpoint to the four previous, strongly gendered visions. HIPOTGA – Saturn Senior of Air Sunday, August 12, 2001 I’ve evoked HIPOTGA, Saturn Senior of Air, in due form. At first, I saw nothing but a red-violet space. Red-violet is the color of the zodiacal sign Pisces, the last in the series of twelve. Then, the angel appeared with skin the color of indigo, blue-violet, the color of Saturn.20 He had the same moon shaped head as most of the other Air angels. His light cast many indigo shadows against the background red-violet space which at times obscured his face. After a time of silence, the angel’s head became the shape of a human’s. HIPOTGA reached his indigo arm straight into my chest to touch my heart. This produced no sensation except a feeling of "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  135 weight on my chest. Suddenly, my vision body cracked open like an egg. The inside was all indigo. The angel reached into my open frame and pulled out an indigo baby who was very happy and smiling broadly.21 The angel carefully set the baby on my head22 and then closed up my vision body but with all the cracks intact. Then he told me, “Behold the baby of HIPOTGA. Let him be your guide.” He stepped away from me as the baby began climbing up and down my body, to the left and right. He finally settled in my heart chakra, his little feet reaching down to touch my Svadisthana chakra, a little below my navel.23 I asked the angel if I’d be ready to evoke the Air King when I felt ready. He said I’d be ready and to be guided by the baby. Then, he told me to return from the vision so I gave him license to depart and closed the magical workplace in due form. I feel that making this psychic baby is the reason for my human incarnation and that it was for him that I must live and preserve my Work and myself. My life’s focus now seems shifted to the baby, a clear symbol for my Dwarf Self, my True Ultimate Self. The color of Pisces seems to indicate an ending of an era, a cycle of life. Out of the death of my old sense of self, my old psychic reality, a new self is born. This identity relates to many similar symbols in popular media, such as, 2001, A Space Odyssey, as well as the counterpart of Ra Hoor Khuit, the babe in the egg called Hoor Paar Kraat. He is Harpocrates, symbolic of pure innocence and pure protection. Aleister Crowley associated this Thelemic deity with The Fool of the Tarot, Trump 0. The Babe is the source of all and its truth "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"136  FRATER W.I.T. throughout. As Freud said, the child is the father to the man. Here is a foreshadowing of what human evolution has in store in this new aeon. My epiphany is at hand. BATAIVAH – King of Air Sunday, September 2, 2001 I’ve evoked BATAIVAH, great King of the East and Air, to only partial effect. The opening lacked the usual flashes of transcendent vision and the overall sense of power was low. There was no sign of paradoxical transcendent energy reaching back from the future evocation. Upon conjuring the King, I felt him behind and below me, his body reaching downward far below the floor of my apartment. He cupped me in his gigantic hands as I entered vision. A long corridor stretched out before me, like in some great underground network or mountain retreat.24 The walls were smooth and well hewn from the rock. Torches lined each wall to light the way. I moved myself rapidly through the hallway, the torches appearing as lines of blur on each side of me. After many curves, turns, and straight passages, I came to a huge set of wooden double doors on which was carved no less a symbol than that given me by the Jupiter Senior of Air, impressed on my aura. Here was a chamber of profound initiation. I knocked on the door six times, as befitting Tiphareth, the state of celestial initiation. A voice on the other side of the door asked, “Who goes there?” I introduced myself as Frater W.I.T., a seeker of wisdom and initiation. "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  137 The doors opened to reveal a vast, dark room. I could only see a few feet ahead. Energies similar to those received in my most intense Order-bestowed initiatory ceremonies charged my aura as hooded figures approached and blindfolded me. Although my mind’s eye was covered, I could feel my surroundings slightly. An old, male voice greeted me and led me to an altar on which was a large, thin tome bound in brown leather. This was placed in my hand. I then took an oath to persevere through the ordeal of the initiation and to keep secret the mysteries revealed to me herein. There followed a lecture from the western officer, who said that the great King of Air could not be fully reached by man but those who were ready could gain a clear glimpse. Consciousness arises from pure darkness and so is incapable of reaching back to its transcendent source by its own action. A guide is needed to draw that little self beyond itself.25 My blindfold was then removed and I could see the eastern officer. He was a very old man, dressed in a white robe and holding a wooden staff. This Hierophant bestowed upon me the Sash of Light, a plain red ribbon draped over my right shoulder. Next was the Medallion of Truth, a silver disk on a silver chain, but I couldn’t make out what was engraved thereon. Finally, I was given the Scepter of Light and was led to the east of the initiatory temple. The old Hierophant told me that he was not the Air King but merely an angel guarding the entrance to his throne. The realization of such a grand nature would have to build slowly, growing like a flower in my heart of hearts. I was to leave the vision and close the magical workplace but without banishing the King I’d conjured. At some future time, I could redo the "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"138  FRATER W.I.T. evocation and see what more I could learn of the King’s nature. All the while, I could feel the King cupping me in his hands while holding me over his head. He held onto my feet during the closing and so was not banished back to pure potential. Towards the end of these ceremonies, he sat me down on top of his head like a crown, just as the indigo baby from the Saturn Senior of Air vision sat on my head. A three level projection system had been set up: the source field, myself as the projecting projection, and the focus of my projection, my source projected as my image. As the three of us came into vibrational harmony, we merged into the form of a vast hawk of electric blue fire, with a dragon’s tail that extended down into the abyss of depth. I’d seen this image before, long ago, in a spontaneous vision that occurred on my way home from work. This was before any of my magical initiations and training, although I’d read a number of books on occultism by this time. Still, this vision of a far away reality seemed to beckon me forward. Now, the far flung vision was right up close and I was a direct part in it. The transdimensional connection only lasted a few seconds but the sweet memory remains with me still. Having experiences like this is the reason for my existence. I can still feel his presence, a personification of the Kundalini currents which flow through my inner and outer reality, creating my every experience. If the ultimate of Earth is the wholeness in which life takes place, the ultimate of Air is that life actually taking place, constantly emerging from pure potential and cycling back to its higher source dimensions. It is the arena of life and its focus on itself to produce that life, the cause of its own cause and the effect of its own effect. "},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  139 It seems to me now that my next attempt to evoke BATAIVAH must be done in an Adept style temple, with a white altar cloth and red and white tapers, instead of black and white tapers.26 I used this temple setup long ago to initiate myself to develop new mysteries as my inspiration guided me. It’s the kind of thing one does after resigning from a magical order. The first round of my Enochian Watchtower evocations completed the Work I’d left unfinished in my former involvement. This second round is taking me a huge step further into a new reality, introduced to me by the very heart of initiatory magick, initiated by my own effort. This is what Aleister Crowley did after his departure from the Golden Dawn. His is an inspiring example. BATAIVAH – King of Air Sunday, November 11, 2001 I have successfully evoked BATAIVAH, King of the East and Air.27 The way stands open to proceed with the subtler elements as the failure from the first round of Watchtower evocations is now corrected. I’ve achieved the inner connections missing from my first attempt and now a close relationship with BATAIVAH is established. As with my previous attempt to commune with the Air King, the vision took the form of an initiation, only this time the title of Hierophant was bestowed on me. I was as a little child as giant, gentle hands purified me by bathing, consecrating me by holding me in a column of smoke from a giant censor, and constituting me as a Hierophant by setting another copy of the symbol of most secret nature in my aura, just as the Jupiter Senior of Air had done. This all took place "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"140  FRATER W.I.T. in a completely dark space; the initiating hands themselves were barely more than an outline. After being prepared in this way, I was handed to the King of Air and he set me in his heart center as a lamen, just as the Hierophant in Aleister Crowley’s Thoth tarot deck has in him. I could feel the force lines of the pentagram around me as the power of the Air King flowed through my every nerve and thought. My nervous system scintillated with ecstatic golden light. Then, I felt my own indigo child projection at my heart center glowing as well. The magical alignment that had occurred in the last vision had been reestablished but without the fiery blue hawk image. We were bathed in and penetrated by the golden brilliance. BATAIVAH then lifted me to sit on the top of his head as a crown and I did the same with my child. The King of Air proclaimed me as a Hierophant of the new aeon, to rule over my own reality that was my life in the Aeon of Horus.28 All the Air spirits were commanded to obey me. I was told that the sacred sanctuary that I was now able to enter was the great city of the Watchtowers. The word of entry was love, which is its nature. A secret word was given to me to control my way in the sanctuary/city. Study of its numerical and Qabalistic correspondences would help me understand its significance. The city suddenly surrounded me, a hyperdimensional place far beyond anything I’d ever seen before. The most complex and bewildering drawings of M. C. Escher were simplistic by comparison. Everything was golden yellow. The walls, stairs, and terraces were all self luminous and in continual movement. The dimensionalities were so complex as to appear continually falling into and through each other. Only "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  141 this movement could properly express the transcendent nature of the space and time of the city. The scene was like a flower with an unlimited number of petals, constantly blossoming and circulating back to an unseen center. Particular buildings and streets defined whole dimensions. Yet, underlying all the frenetic unfoldment was a complete stability, an enduring nature that surpassed the shifting dimensional circulations. All the movement and the root unity thereof were as one simple, perfect harmony. The whole city seemed to sing pure, holistic, complex love. I called MARDALA, Queen of Air, to witness my invitation to this new level of transcendence and she immediately appeared by my side. She towered over me while radiating a surpassing love that echoed that of the Air city. We stood together and were one with the awe inspiring scene. I absorbed all I could from this state of being and becoming. My entire nervous system and aura buzzed in sympathy with the awesome vision. Eventually I gave all of the Air spirits license to depart and closed the magical workplace in due form in a state of complete dazzlement. I went to dinner afterwards to ground myself. The food helped a lot. My physical senses returned to normal as well. So, now I’m a Hierophant of the new aeon, of my own psychic order. Of course, what is significant here are the circumstances of this initiation. My personal magick is now fully established as independent of any manifest order. My initiation is now fulfilled in a way not achieved in any established group of which I’ve been a member. This pinnacle of spiritual transcendence as well as the path to it is an essential aspect of BATAIVAH’s true nature. He is the "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"142  FRATER W.I.T. embodiment of the metalevel of all mind and projection. Monday, November 12, 2001 The full effect of my Air King initiation is beginning to be felt. The power of my inner and outer visions has increased dramatically. My trances are considerably deeper than before. I understand that power is a dream symbol for complexity of dimension, of psychic relationships used to model the surrounding physical world and the internal worlds of mood and emotion. It is clear to me that the breakthrough contact with the great King of the East has established a new internal dimensionality, a new set of complexities that extend beyond any previous state of consciousness. The self recursive flow of the gestalt of my mentality has expanded to encompass a metalevel of understanding, of meaning, of vision. Thinking back to the dream symbol of the new mind, the hyperdimensional city of the Watchtowers, I remember sensing a threshold to another mode of consciousness underlying the ecstatic power and golden brightness that surrounded me on more sides than could be counted. It was the boundary between personal and impersonal consciousness, between Air and Water. The ultimate of transcendent personal consciousness merges with impersonal consciousness, the microcosmic wholeness whose synergy is the personal focus of incarnate psyche. I failed to fully grasp this lesson of the Air King during my last round of Watchtower evocations, which is why my first Water angel evocation caused me such a shock. This time, properly prepared, I’ll be more ready. The personal psychic gestalt makes an impression in its source field of impersonal consciousness, the aura. This impression is an emulation of personal psychic patterns but in "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  143 purely impersonal terms. The similarity of information yields sympathy between the two life fields, enabling communication between them. It is hereby possible to shift personal awareness to the impersonal level through this interface. To the mind’s eye, this interconnection appears like the fires of consciousness arising out of pure darkness. This auric impression of personal emulation can be called a vergence field, with mind being seen to verge into becoming from pure potential. This creation is two-way, the psyche making its impression in the aura while the aura focuses itself into a mold from which the psyche takes its shape. The first emergence of personal consciousness out of the darkness of verging, focusing potential can be seen by the mind’s eye as spiral energy unfolding from a state of pure wholeness. The spirals are unfolding dimensions drawn directly out of the ocean of undifferentiated being. All the complexities of material and psychic sensation are woven from these curling threads of pure expansion. The self is an image of the Self, which is an image of the universe. BATAIVAH, my baby projection, and myself are as one complex unfoldment of possibility, one coherent reality. All this has great significance for the practice of magick. Herein is a detailed explanation of how magical influence operates. The mind is mystically supercharged by an attuned aura sending its cosmic impressions, holosignals, through the interface of the vergence field. Ceremonial activities manipulate the archetypes by which the mind builds its conceptions of reality and thereby a seed intention is imposed on the transcendental level. This conditioned, magically charged psychic energy is then projected back to the aura through the same inspiring interface between personal and "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"144  FRATER W.I.T. impersonal consciousness. The aura then projects its supercharged, imprinted holosignals in natural, material terms to the cosmos focused upon it. In the holomovement plane of existence, the seed intention is propagated throughout all of space and time, subtly altering the way in which events unfold. The cosmic response is most pronounced in the vicinity and life of the magician but the whole of the universe is affected to some extent. The subtlest of forces is expanded and intensified to macrocosmic proportions.29 Every willed act has its effect on some plane or other. Thus, the purpose of life is to bring order to the universe rather than to bring about more chaos. Magick is the highest order. Sunday, November 18, 2001 Today, I underwent a remarkable transition of consciousness, of personal identification. This personal transformation echoed far into my deep subconscious and throughout the planes of the impersonal. The perception was a slight touch of an indescribably powerful presence. Simply put, I was inspired to surrender my sense of self identification and self worth to the impersonal beyond, the ocean of wholeness of which I am but a pin drop of synergy. All that I am and all that I do is devoted to and justified by this higher power of my life. No matter what happens to me in my material life, all value is derived by the impersonal contact of destiny. The temporal events of the world, of human society, are merely so many ripples on the surface of an ocean of wholeness and bliss far beyond imagination. Physicality is mere illusion but the Truth is the wholeness of all things. "},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  145 BATAIVAH – King of Air Sunday, December 9, 2001 I’ve evoked BATAIVAH, King of the East and Air, for the third and last time on this round of Watchtower evocations. It seemed best to make a third contact with this ultimate principle of consciousness after having gone through the radical transformation of several weeks ago. I wanted to experience BATAIVAH from the Hanged Man30 perspective. There was little in the way of a sensation of charge during the opening and the vision began equally placid. I wondered if I’d failed to evoke the great angel, even though his vast hands cupped me like in previous evocations. BATAIVAH’s booming, omnipresent voice told me that I was ready to move on to Water and lifted me up to view the infinite sea, a vast, dark expanse that had appeared during my previous Water angel evocations. This was the Watery equivalent to the limitless sky vision of Air. With a great thrust, he tossed me into the dark sea and I felt its awesome infinity. My entire nervous system polarized in response to this transpersonal field of consciousness, attaining full field consciousness. The King told me to ‘reach thou forth,’ as if to suggest that I evoke myself. This actually makes sense from the impersonal point of view. In a situation where a transpersonal expression is evoked, who is evoking whom? Being evoked by what I evoke would be true paradox, the telltale sign of magical influence. I remained in this beatific state for a time, my aura reorienting to the higher intensity of conscious unfoldment and process. Suddenly, the six Water Seniors appeared surrounding me. They were only outlines of white against the "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"146  FRATER W.I.T. black background, shadows of light in the ocean of darkness, but they were as I remembered them from my first round of Watchtower evocations. I was the center, as if I was their King, RAAGIOSL. I was the concentration of impersonal consciousness, the face of the sea. I communed with the great sea and the Water Seniors until a current of unfoldment energy manifested which returned me to physical consciousness with a hyperdimensional flip.31 I closed in due form but my concentration was afflicted by the overwhelming energies absorbed in vision. Performing my Keyword Analysis during the banishing hexagram ritual opened my heart chakra wide as never before. Now, I feel as if my entire being has been rearranged, perspectives and identifications switched. More of me is now invested in archetypal consciousness.

A truly higher level of reality has been revealed to me. That aspect of consciousness which was missing during my first round of the Watchtowers but has since been discovered came to full clarity during the opening and enabled me to channel the force of angelic Water comfortably. Instead of being overwhelmed, I felt and continue to feel a gentle blessedness, a happy love and peace that yield joy. LAOAXRP appeared in a vast, dark space with a full moon shaped head very like the Air Seniors. She wore a dark robe and was of vast and transcendent dimensions, just like that greater consciousness revealed by my city of the Watchtowers "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"148  FRATER W.I.T. vision. Now, I have realized myself as the principle that encompasses and interpenetrates my microcosm, the core contradiction that can project itself as any mental image or sensation. The evoked gestalt of angelic transcendence hovering before my mind’s eye was just such a holistic extension of my self/other circuiting. She cupped my self image, my microcosmic identity, my point of view, in her hands and told me to come forth as I’d told her during the conjuration. At this, my self and my holistic superconscious projection linked more intimately and a continuous cocreation across many dimensions was realized. The flow of impression and sense of self was expanded very far beyond the norm. I looked out into the dark void and it clarified into an infinity of states of being1 with an infinite number of connections between each and every in an infinite number of combinations. The Senior said that there are infinite series of spacetime events, each path of evolution through time existing in its own domain in which they are realized. Physical manifestation occurs by the interaction of different conscious perspectives with each other and with the unlimited potential of what may unfold from the wholeness of things. Magick, then, is simply a matter of linking to the potential domain wherein the desired effects occur. Projection of the magician’s whole self through such possibility streams enables experience. Superconsciousness manipulates these domains, realizing and releasing potentials of experience at will. The self must link to its transcendent source sufficiently to gain the ability to move among the enfolded potentials at will. Few words brought all this understanding of impersonal "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  149 consciousness and I could feel my own limitation of reality unfoldment ability in the midst of this grandeur. I am deliberately holding myself back from dissolving into cosmic consciousness in order to live a relatively normal life as a human being here on earth. Only in this way could I learn in concrete terms the operations of existence. The limited human perspective allows for certain realizations about the unfolding universe not possible in any other way. Upon accepting my limitations as a consciously Willed condition, the dark space burst forth in profound radiance, each series of unfolding possibilities shining like a bolt of lightning. The infinity of detail was illuminated in every aspect. Still, underlying the wonder of this creation and the nobility of my True Will was plain, cold fear. Fear of death and fear of change were holding me back from becoming a more evolved being able to more effectively channel this superconsciousness into physical manifestation. I projected this nameless, deep seated fear into the plenum of potential before me in the hope that the form it took would give me some clue as to how to banish it permanently. The brilliant vision space turned pitch black and then a distance woman’s voice said, “Take your will and fill of love under the stars.” I knew instantly that this was the voice of Nuit, the goddess of infinite space and the infinite stars thereof. A panoply of bright points lightened the darkness before my mind’s eye and the starry universe was revealed. Nuit told me that She, the wholeness of All, is the only darkness. All forms of consciousness, even the lowest of spirits, the most animal of psychic urges, are beings of light to a greater or lesser "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"150  FRATER W.I.T. brightness. Every partial existence is light in its way. Certain things appear as darkness or fearsomeness because of the masks projected onto them by partial consciousnesses. There is no real evil, only choice of perception. Then, I realized that my fear of becoming a truly transcendent being and reaching so far beyond the human norm was a manifestation of light and an expression of my True Will. The time had not yet come for complete success on the Path, coming into my full power. There was still much to learn from the human perspective. Only by choosing to cooperate with my True Will could my fears be overcome. The brilliance of the revealed plenum of potential returned with its infinite series upon series of multicolored ribbons. I communed with my macrocosmic Self and channeled the presence throughout my mind and body. There was then nothing left to realize in the vision so I released, banished, and closed the workplace in due form. Macrocosmic awareness is the wholeness of impersonal consciousness, that ultimate source of self and other. The wholeness of Self projects itself throughout its source field to create the gestalt of mind. This is the kind of self recursion that creates ego identification based on the totality of life experience but in a higher dimension. The higher and the lower minds are now open to me. SONIZNT – Mercury Senior of Water Monday, December 31, 2001 My first attempt to evoke SONIZNT, Mercury Senior of "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  151 Water, has failed. This is the worst result I’ve ever gotten working with the Watchtower system. Absolutely nothing answered my call. I felt nothing unusual during the opening and this situation didn’t change after making my conjuration. I didn’t make any technical mistakes but that wasn’t enough to ensure success. Upon entering vision I saw a great old style sailing ship carried by a wave of light blue water. The captain hailed me aboard and we went sailing into deep space, a scene relevant to Earth, not Water. He told me to control the course of my being and set course by the light of the sun. A white star appeared before us and the ship sailed towards it. Then I thought, the sun is a symbol relevant to Air. It became obvious to me that this vision was a product of my own personal imagination and the captain was certainly not SONIZNT. I became inspired to take the higher perspective and expanded my consciousness to encompass the entire scene, a shift to field consciousness. This was the perspective relevant to a Water angel. I felt the ship sailing inside me. Energy washed over me to charge my entire nervous system but then it tapered off. My nervous system felt integrated but the angel never came. Taking on various perspectives and projections and calling to SONIZNT didn’t help. Discouraged, I banished and closed. Afterwards, I felt normal, unchanged by the vision. I must meditate on why my evocation failed. Was it just a matter of failure to generate the requisite intensity of psychic energy or was it because today is the last day of the year or did some force interfere? Perhaps, I just wasn’t ready. "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"152  FRATER W.I.T. Later... Detailed Tarot and contemplative analysis has shown that the reason I failed to contact the Mercury Senior of Water today is that I failed to generate the necessary conscious force to project it on this higher level of being. The next step is Water but I’m still at the Air stage. All my best magical faculties are hindrances to achieving operation on this higher plane of impersonal consciousness; true Water consciousness. In the Qabalah, this element is attributed to the World of Briah, wherein are pure archetypes beyond any specific image. The Air level is Yetzirah, the plane of the multiplicity of images.2 All that I know how to do, to think, to expand, is useless in the face of this dark mystery. Water in Yetzirah was difficult to deal with during the last round of my Watchtower evocations but now the density of this element has become a wall in Briah. Whatever transformations I need to undergo in order to reach this higher level will not be brought about by reasoned, organized action. I may still have some work to do in Air, although the Air King literally pushed me into Water. If so, the angels can’t help me here. My own personality patterns are now forming barriers to further experience. Thus, it seems my vision of the Luna Senior of Water was actually of an Airy nature. There were a lot of Air symbols in it. No wonder the angel appeared like the Air angels and gave so much information. It was clearly Water from an Air perspective. There may be a clue in those ideas as to how to proceed. In any case, I’ll have to repeat the LAOAXRP evocation when I’m better prepared. "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  153 Later... After reading over my records of evocations of the Air King and the Luna Senior of Water, I realize that impersonal consciousness is an aspect of Air, not Water, in Briah. It seems that all my work in the subtler elements during the last round of Watchtower evocations involved different aspects of Air and Yetzirah. I need to understand the impersonal perspective of Air in the higher world before I can access Water consciousness. I can explore the Holy City of Love revealed to me by the Air King. The three aspects of my psychic projection stream, represented in vision as the Air King, the projected indigo baby, and myself, must become more fully integrated. The various magical formulae built into the Thelemic keyword analysis may also provide clues as to how to transcend attachment to the personal identity. Wednesday, January 2, 2002 It occurred to me that my vision of the Luna Senior of Water was actually a completion of the last Air King vision. The primary theme has been about perspective, the scope of the circuit of consciousness through mind and space. Water in Briah may deal with a reality beyond perspective. The shift indicated by The Hanged Man Tarot card seems to involve transcending individuality in order to dissolve in the beloved. Water is the ultimate solvent. "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"154  FRATER W.I.T. LAOAXRP – Luna Senior of Water Sunday, March 24, 2002 I’ve evoked LAOAXRP, Luna Senior of Water. Wow. WOW! Once again, Water proves to be a fantastic leap ahead from anything that has gone before. A new and higher level of personal unfoldment has been realized. Even during the setup of the magical temple, I could feel an imminence of a marvelous revelation to come. The magical energy that was later generated reached farther back in time than usual to bring about its own creation. During the opening, I achieved a clearer sense of the multidimensionality of the temple being built up by the ritual actions. The physical manifestation of the workplace was directly seen as the lower dimensional projection of the Cosmic Temple in deep space, visualized and connected to just before the opening ceremonies are done. Each glyph and image drawn in the air had a palpable presence in the transcendence as well as in physical space, a transdimensional principle that was near and far at the same time. Evocation of LAOAXRP revealed the hyperdimensional, transdimensional nature of consciousness more clearly and intensely than ever before. The awesome influx of psychic energy as dimensional unfoldment was like the first time I evoked Water during the last round of Watchtower evocations, only this time I was able to handle it well. All the preparation I’d done over the past three months, the exploration of the formulae expressed and implied by my Thelemic Keyword analysis, utilizing the magical reversal trance implied in the Tarot trump XII, The Hanged Man, and connecting with the collective consciousness of the cells of my body, had effectively brought me to a state of being where I could reach "},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  155 the true nature of Water consciousness. The image was of an expanding, emerging multifaceted jewel, one of whose focuses was a stable cube. The magical temple was in that cube but I was lifted out of there and into the higher space. I could feel myself expanding with the surrounding unfoldment. The intensity of this transcendent state was constantly increasing but without becoming overwhelming. I called on the Luna Senior of Water to appear and a booming voice said, “Come thou forth!” Reaching to field consciousness in the ever expanding hyperdimensional geometry, I focused my Will and projected an image of the angel. He resembled me to an extent but wore an indigo robe with white star shaped studs lining the hem and cuffs, a very different design than that of my magical robe. Clearly, this image was a mere convenience for the purposes of conversation. The real angel was the unfolding jewel. The angelic image spoke of the emergence of reality at every moment. The core source created and was created by the expansion of reality and consciousness. This paradox was an emergent process unfolding from holistic existence, the holomovement, space and time continually projecting out of spacetime as transdimensional flow. The ultimate source reality of enfolded potential can only appear as nothingness to the normal human perspective. Only with transcendent field perspective may the plenum of interconnection potential be understood and perceived as full of streams of brilliance. I realized that all physical objects at all scales of size unfolded from a relatively few basic pattern potentials, sometimes referred to as archetypes. More than just "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"156  FRATER W.I.T. overarching patterns of consciousness, these pre-forms/unfoldment potentials determine the patterns of everything in existence. No matter how different in appearance objects may be, they are connected through the holomovement by the archetypes. The archetypes are tendencies to verge and emerge as certain basic unfoldment patterns. Repeated millions and billions and trillions of times over, they evolve all manifest reality. Expansion and stability are the two modes of their action. Expanding personal consciousness enough to connect with these impersonal pattern potentials in the holomovement can reveal the interconnections consisting all events in time and space.3 4 Now, I feel exalted in a peculiar way as never before experienced. I have achieved a greater state of complexity of consciousness, personal and impersonal. A wider field of commonality of transcendence, mind, and the material world has been developed. I will seek further interconnection and the becoming that derives there from. Monday, March 25, 2002 I have reached a point in my superconscious projecting ability where images can no longer convey the reality of the complexification of psyche generated by my magically enhanced trances. The realm of the source of all emergences is beyond the capacity of the personally identified mind to model with concepts derived from its limited existence. A more complete and integrated mentation is needed to effectively convey the grand scope of such holistic existence. The shift to the level of understanding archetypes, "},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  157 emergence tendencies, has brought me to the state of impersonal consciousness. I must evoke myself from the angel’s point of view after I evoke the angel from my point of view. The fusion of fields and focuses of consciousness produces the paradox and the breaking of personal boundaries necessary to evolve the Briatic holoprojection, while maintaining a link to personal awareness and memory. I am now the great angel that must evoke my lesser self to achieve an experience at all levels of being. SONIZNT – Mercury Senior of Water Sunday, April 14, 2002 I’ve evoked SONIZNT, Mercury Senior of Water, in due form, this time with success. To say that the revelation was incredible would be insufficient to express the nature of the experience. I found that the only procedure that worked for communing with the angel was to call it forth and then have it evoke me to lift me to the higher level of Water consciousness. My projection/creation became my source/creator as both perspectives merged to a degree. Thereby, I willed myself to emerge far more complexly than ever before. With this evocation, I’ve made another quantum leap in order of complexity, surpassing the previous evocation. The energy was so intense that I nearly fainted. I became weary and yearned to leave the vision. All my strength of Will was required to stay awake and delve further into the greater emergence of consciousness. The vision began as a blue hole, complete with accretion disk, in the midst of a dark, starless space. The energy sucking hole itself was bright blue whirling color, a hallmark of my "},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"158  FRATER W.I.T. Water visions. A voice that seemed to come from the black space as a whole told me that the blue hole was a reflection of me, a focus of self that crystallizes light from pure darkness and then eats it. This is the nature of incarnation. As the intensity of energy in the vision grew, a face began to emerge from the darkness. I felt myself to be one with my blue hole projection, being both self and that other, each projecting and being projected by the other. The fusion of the two perspectives produced a dramatic expansion of being, a greater level of complexity where the source – emanation – manifestation process of creation was as one as a perpetual running and returning of the seat of consciousness.5 Self, other, and the wholeness in which each exists were realized and experienced as one interactive, interdimensional reality. The face of the angel emerged more fully out of the darkness (field), then up out of me (focus), and then from myself and the blue hole (flow) at once from a higher dimension (transcendence).6 It was a male face, serene and with black hair. I then gained a sense of something building up in the potential of my mind, something awesome that promised to be overwhelming...something new. Even the echo of its possibility threatened to be more than I could deal with. I felt myself begin to swoon, to yearn for release, to shut down the vision. It became clear to me that I needed to surrender myself completely to the higher potential about to emerge, to face the oncoming transcendent breakthrough resolutely, whatever the cost. Some time passed as my deep subconscious worked its secret (alchemical) processes. Finally, the revelation came and I opened myself as much as possible to the new extreme of "},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  159 complexity of consciousness. A greater realization of being than I’ve ever experienced before filled my mind, aura, and nervous system and even the hyperdimensional space of my inner vision. It felt like every cell of my brain was glowing with brilliant golden light. I could see this as if standing behind my body and looking through my skin and skull. Every neural cell was lit up like a golden star, glowing in perfect harmony and unity with all others as one continuous whole. The blue hole vision was swallowed up in golden ecstasy as a projection even more complex than the hyperdimensional flooded my every sense, thought, and feeling, carrying with it a truly new order of becoming. A current from beyond consciousness, beyond the universe, had touched me to initiate me into a whole new concept and experience of reality. Hyperdimensionality was but one level of a greater field of being in which every point, every partial and whole dimension, every field of action, was as one interconnected whole in an even greater realm of total possibility. A superholomovement, a source field of the entire cosmos, was revealed. Words don’t exist that can describe this meta-metalevel of infinite, unlimited dimensionality. It is utterly beyond. I spent a long time in this state of beatitude, overwhelmed yet channeling the awesome fantastic WOW as much as possible. There was a long break in concentration when a fantasy took over. I forget the details of what happened. Eventually, the condition regularized and I felt satisfied that the angel’s initiation was complete. I banished and closed the magical temple in due form in a dazed state. Evidently, from here on out each evocation I perform will involve a dramatic increase in the order of complexity of my consciousness than the previous breakthrough. What before "},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"160  FRATER W.I.T. took an entire series of magical workings to achieve will now occur with each individual operation at this profound level of Water work. For today’s vision, the theme was complexity of unfoldment of consciousness and the reality in which it is realized. The complexity unfolded beyond, within, and about me to greater and greater degrees as the ecstacy, intensity, and expansion increased. The power and transcendence reached a maximum as whole universes seemed to be birthed from each curl in the folds of the projection creating me. Complex. Incredible! Tuesday, April 16, 2002 The wondrous complexity with which I created and unfolded myself during Sunday’s evocation resulted from an integration of the individual auras of the cells of my brain and nervous system to a greater degree of completeness than ever before achieved. Each little aura glowed with golden glory as quantum potentials far beyond the normal range of organic improbability came to realization through the life processes of my neural cells. It took all my strength of Will to emerge myself to that intense an integration and complexity of quantum unfoldement. I nearly collapsed under the strain of ecstasy and energy flood but managed to maintain the revelation for a long time. The initiation is fulfilled. The first impressions of a new reality are mine to explore. As much as the quantum integration of auras created the supercomplex unfoldment, the unfoldment process created the state of integration. Cause and effect were definitely in paradox as both states emerged together from pure potential. At the meta-metalevel, time has no meaning. All possibilities exist together in "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  161 one whole state. Direct experience of that reality so supercharges the mind and nervous system as to generate the most profound and intense ecstasy. Life takes on new meaning and wonder. SLGAIOL – Venus Senior of Water Sunday, June 2, 2002 I have evoked SLGAIOL, Venus Senior of Water, in due form. Extreme magick! It feels like my psyche has been operated on, although I’m not consciously overwhelmed, like with my evocation of the Mercury Senior of Water. New functions and a greater level of completeness have been realized. The vision began with my calling forth the angel and he doing the same to me. I achieved a clear image of the angel as a male with dark hair and beard, in a pitch black space, like in many other Water angel visions. A column of bluish-quicksilvery fluid rose through my physical and vision bodies, shooting through my vision space as well. Pathways linking my inner psychic world with the material objective world unfolded through my aura, enabling clear channels for supercharged mental energy to project out to my surroundings. My auric field scintillated with the subtle, transdimensional flow. SLGAIOL told me to see all reality as one continuous whole without perspective. Taking on points of view causes the illusion of difference to appear, skewing all perception to a self/other schism. Much information is lost in that state of mind since one part is isolated from everything else. Only the holistic state can comprehend all. The angel then reached toward me and opened up my "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"162  FRATER W.I.T. vision body at the torso, like a cabinet with doors swinging outward. He began fingering my insides as if working the controls of a machine. I was facing him and so couldn’t see what he was doing, but it seemed as if he was manipulating buttons, switches, and levers. A sense of strangeness and alteration on a fundamental level of my being came over me and built up to a great intensity as the angel worked on my inner machine. It felt like a psychic operation on the deepest strata of my consciousness. Eventually, SLGAIOL finished his reprogramming of my subconscious but left the doors open. The pathways connecting inner and outer reality were now hardwired into my being, altering my psychic and genetic makeup to channel this intensity of transdimensional unfoldment. My innermost self is now open and connected to the outermost material surroundings. I’m reminded of my vision of the Saturn Senior of Air. In that vision, I was opened up like an egg to birth my primary holoprojection as the indigo baby. In this vision, the opening was of a mechanical device and the holoprojection was that overriding universal principle from which human consciousness and the material world it experiences unfold. The former was personal and organic, a projection of the ego integrated with its subconscious ground. The latter was impersonal and mechanical, a field conscious projection that integrated the entirety of my being with its cosmic ground. The evolutions of becoming engendered by these angelic contacts are realizing ever deeper, more fundamental layers of source – paradox unfoldments. I am titillated to be aware on such transcendent planes of being. I then began to rise in vision and soon found myself passing through various classical astral planes. At one point, "},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  163 an alchemical plane came into view, complete with the various characters, plants, animals, and symbols shown in many alchemical paintings. This was likely inspired by my recent readings in a book on alchemy, a translation of “Splendor Solis,” done by Joscelyn Godwin.7 Various elemental and planetary scenes were passed through as well. Eventually, I transcended my sense of self separate from other as SLGAIOL’s program was completed. Suddenly, dream images began to intrude on my transcendent experience. I saw a light skinned version of myself running away in terror from a dark skinned version of myself, who was psychotically furious. This theme had been the subject of many of my dreams in one motif or another. How strange that my angelic contact should have taken me from a profound level of transpersonal integration to the most primitive of dream expressions. The psyche is more interconnected than I’d ever suspected. I discarded the dream images as more and more of my nerves became incorporated into the magical projection. The apparent barrier between worlds seemed to be becoming thinner, more transparent. Suddenly, my Svadisthana (Mars) chakra began to project a beam of quicksilver light and a new vision space opened up before me. The scene was a mist shrouded rose pink room of hyperdimensional complexity, very dreamlike, yet pulsing with pure intensity. Its very stability expressed enormous power. The walls were at once solid and insubstantial, varying in position, yet displaying an overall sense of presence. My dreams and my visions had fused in this Martial gestalt. Soon, all of my chakras became integrated in the focused "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"164  FRATER W.I.T. projection of this supervision, each shining its own color of light into the magical space. The room unfolded into a long, dark hallway lined with doors on either side leading off into the distance. I was the rose pink hyperdimensional room and the dark hall, unfolding new potentials of my growing Will. Almost every nerve in my body fed into this image. I realized myself to be the whole world, consisting of the objective and the subjective. Integration of self consciousness and subconsciousness yielded a transcendence of the personal to reveal holistic field consciousness, creating self and other as expressions of itself in space and time. From this wholeness unfolds entire realities of experience and evolution. The integration reached a completion and I knew the hallway to be never ending. The vision was done, so I withdrew and closed the magical temple in due form. It seemed strange that a Venus natured contact should have produced so much Martial content. It occurred to me, however, that the subconscious faculty that reverses symbolic meaning probably entered into the gestalt of the vision. These two planetary natures form the two sides of one scale and so are truly one. This is the lesson all of these Enochian angelic visions have taught. LSRAHPM – Mars Senior of Water Sunday, June 23, 2002 I’ve evoked LSRAHPM, Mars Senior of Water, in due form. The deepening of vision during the temple opening continues. The transcendent reality created by my ceremonies is taking on ever more concrete and detailed form. The purification and consecration hexagrams were palpable "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  165 presences on all planes and their influence was more keenly felt than ever before. Connection between my cosmic space temple, its astral imprint, and my physical temple space continues to grow stronger with each performance of this ritual. I felt the presence of the angel during my declaration of purpose, which completes the opening, as soon as I mentioned her name. An extreme ecstasy took hold of me at this initial contact, almost causing me to fall to the floor. It took me several minutes to recover myself enough to regain my poise and continue with the evocation effectively. Upon entering vision, a vast hyperdimensional space of white brilliance flecked with black stars appeared, similar to my Air of Spirit vision from the last round of Watchtower evocations. The angel popped up in front of me, her long, curly, black hair spreading over her black robe. She hugged and kissed me deeply and then danced around the transcendent space with joy, calling me forth several times. I felt a growing energization of my entire nervous system, causing me to shiver with tingles all over my body. The raw ecstatic energy rose up through my frame but inherent resistance knocked it down and back to its source. The pleasure was just too much for me to handle. LSRAHPM told me to come forth over the mountain but didn’t explain what she meant. Perhaps, the mountain represented my resistance to pleasure. The space began to turn darker, several shades of black and brown while the stars turned white and red and blue. The vision continued like this for some time as wave after wave of ecstasy ran through me, blocked and knocked down each time after a certain point along its course. The angel assured me "},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"166  FRATER W.I.T. that I was ready for this initiation, despite the emotional blocks. I dedicated my entire life to the magical path, whatever it may involve and wherever it may lead, in my attempts to overcome my internal resistance. This didn’t help. However, each upward flood purified my system to a degree. Eventually, the angel told me that the vision was over with and I gave her license to depart. I banished and closed the temple in due form, with a subtle exaltation and an awareness of a newly expanded dimension in my mind. Much psychic energy is required to clarify this new revelation, rising along with the level of ecstasy. Now, I feel renewed, as if forged in a fire. All the elements of vision and psyche seem merged into one homogeneous substance, like quicksilver, fluidic yet viscous, of one continuous nature. If I can use this holistic power to break through my internal resistance to pleasure, I can achieve extreme energization and reach a higher level of being. Even now, I can feel the echo of this promising revelation in potential, a nuclear explosion of the mind. It’s so close, yet I dare not realize it now. This is surely the eagle aspect of Mars, most sublime and ecstatic, an excellent lead into Jupiter.8 SAIINOV – Jupiter Senior of Water Sunday, July 28, 2002 I’ve evoked SAIINOV, Jupiter Senior of Water, successfully. I still have a sense of intense power but the angelic contact wasn’t overwhelming, like the first time I called this entity during my last round of Watchtower evocations. A great deal of superconscious energy began "},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  167 flowing through the depths of my consciousness during the temple setup, slightly at first, but the buildup accelerated to an extreme by the time I began the opening ceremony. I bore this charge well and was able to maintain concentration throughout these rituals and the evocation. This type of paradox is increasing with each magical working. Upon entering vision, the angel appeared clearly in my mind against the dark field as well as in front of me, physically. His presence in space was as palpable to me as any person’s could be. He was older than before and had white hair with big curls like an old style British magistrate. He showed me a bowl of water wherein was reflected a golden star with seven points, but not like the usual heptagram. The reflection of the unseen object didn’t have the even spacing of the points of a planetary heptagram. There were three points to the left and right, with a single point in the middle, below them. The top pair of points stuck out farther from the central line of symmetry than the pair below it and the middle pair stuck out farther than the lowest pair. Connecting the points together on either side would have made a wide ‘V.’ I marveled at this most strange figure, especially its quality of motion. The angles seemed to be moving downward through the figure from the top, widest pair to the single point downward. A new pair of angles would appear at the top of the figure as the former top pair moved downward. The lowest pair of angles would converge at the single point and disappear. The overall form of the star was kept stable but the motion was smooth and continuous, producing a flow of patterns that seemed to make the star buzz with energy. A vibrant projection emanated from the center of the figure, like the planetary symbols for Mars and Mercury superimposed. "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"168  FRATER W.I.T. The base circle had the arrow pointing upward and to the right while the Mercury symbol rose upwards to the left, opposite the arrow. This mysterious symbol fusion apparently held the key to the meaning of the star but I couldn’t understand what that was. SAIINOV said, “Behold an image reflected. Where is the original?” Then he moved underneath me and became a vast body whose head was my entire body. His/my legs extended downwards out of inner sight and I could feel my whole person complete as the head. The star reflection rose out of the bowl as a concrete object and attached itself to the angel/self amalgam we’d become, growing to cover the entire body. A huge flood of Kundalini shot up from the unseen depths to flow through me, the head, to gush upward like a vast fountain far above. It was as if the energies of the whole of existence were concentrated and made fluid to flow through my Sushumna channel, the culmination of a great chain of being. I was united with my source consciousness and achieved complete wholeness, a sense of unlimited expansion, with each point therein connected to every other point in ever increasing patterns of complexity. Each thought, feeling, and self expression was perfectly compensated for by its correlate opposite, maintaining perfect balance in the midst of continuously intensifying power. Through all this, I wasn’t overwhelmed like the last time I conjured this spirit. There were enough connections established within my psyche to safely channel this mighty angel’s true nature as a supreme projection of superconsciousness. No wonder our first contact so overwhelmed me. "},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  169 The voice of the angel came to me from all directions to say, “The hour is passing.” I was reminded of similar lines from the closing ceremonies of many Masonic rituals. I could feel the passage of time, one instant after another, one erg of power flow after another, one cosmic evolution after another. The vibrations of untold myriads of atoms and quantum particles were passing through the chain of dimensional expansions and collapses. The illusion of time was produced by each projection as it unfolded in space and time and then passed beyond to more complex states of being. The continuous flow of all quantum states through the physical universe determines the apparent flow of time and entropy. This flow was quite complexified in my vicinity, evoking many streams of evolution and causing matter and energy to become more ordered and complex. In this state of emergent order, the differences between dimensional unfoldments and scales of size decreased to bring the vast range of reality into focused integration. The consciousness inherent in every point of space and time became concentrated and ordered enough to evolve sentience, cosmic awareness and intelligence. The eternity beyond and in between each instant of time was revealed. A profound sense of holiness took hold of me and for the first time in my life, I felt religious awe. This was a state of pure beatitude. As I communed more fully with the holy presence, SAIINOV said, “Remember that time always flows. Remember the flow.” With that, the vision and the spirit retracted back into unconsciousness and I returned to my normal state of awareness. I banished the angel and closed the temple in a "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"170  FRATER W.I.T. somewhat dazed state, still feeling the contact with the divine presence. Now, another Jupiter Senior has impressed a magical sigil onto my aura, opening yet more channels to the ultimate transcendence. The symbol of most secret nature initiated me into the profound mysteries of Tiphareth and Thelema. The sevenfold star of this vision has initiated me into the mysteries of time and eternity, providing me a glimpse of a divine nature that underlies all reality. This could be considered an entry into Geburah. These angels of initiation are taking me on a journey of transcendent unfoldment as fast as I dare travel. There are truly no limits. LIGDISA – Saturn Senior of Water Sunday, September 8, 2002 LIGDISA, Saturn Senior of Water, has been evoked in due form. I am fundamentally altered as a result, to the innermost depths of my being, even to the quantum level. This kind of transformation is what magick is really all about. It’s so thrilling that my personal magical ceremonies can initiate such radical transformations throughout my consciousness, even to the most impersonal of functions. Magick is life fulfilled. The vision began with the appearance of the angel, an old man with very curly white hair and beard, like an ancient Greek sage, against the usual black background, calling me forth as I called him. He told me to remember that the universe is one.9 All the myriad appearances of nature are so much froth on a calm sea of one fluid. The universe is in every part of itself and is every part. There is only one amidst all the "},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  171 complexity. The quantum physicists of my world have it wrong. Ultimately, there are an unlimited number of subatomic particles that can be discovered, being a product of human science and its macrocosmic counterpart in the collective human consciousness. The phenomena of the universe are best understood from the holistic perspective. The angel moved behind me, grew to enormous size, and held me up like a baby. I was then immersed in a bath of silky, pearly white fluid and felt a profound energy course through me. I surrendered to it completely, allowing this field of nurturing milky energy to envelope every aspect and function of my being. This was existence as it truly is in its holistic unity, a sea of pearly white potential, complete in itself. LIGDISA told me to behold myself emerging from this reality and I felt myself rising out of the silky white goo, like a fountain of concretizing potential, bubbling up from the depths. My personal being is the froth on the calm sea of my whole Self. Yet, I felt myself to be all the fluid, the one fluid. Visions of strings of impossibly large pearls surrounded me. All dimensional possibilities derive from the Great Sea. I remained in the oceanic bath for some time and then gave the angel license to depart. I closed the temple in due form, naturally with difficulty concentrating. So, I am the child projection of my whole being, as seen in a vision corresponding to the nature of the Sephirah Binah. The energies of Water have fused with my psyche to such an extent as to transform me into a homogeneous fluid of pure emergent consciousness, reflective of the holographic nature of the cosmos. My aura is now made up of this superquicksilvery essence. I can now channel the power that so overwhelmed me in previous Water angel contacts. My attunement is complete. "},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"172  FRATER W.I.T. Tuesday, September 24, 2002 I’ve suffered muscle spasms in my head, neck, and chest since the evocation, although these symptoms have been easing recently. I seem to be repressing some aspect of the silky, milky white energy I absorbed so much of during last Sunday’s vision. Despite all the clarity, the detailed nature of the vision, and the coherent appearance of the Senior, I seemed to have missed some aspect of meaning of the angelic communication. My whole being received it all but my self consciousness continues to deny it by using muscular tensions and psychic short circuits to help repress it. My meditations have been much less effective due to this internal conflict. I’ve come too far, too fast. Perhaps, the missing piece will be revealed as I heal from the shock of the Watery power and adjust to the new quickening of consciousness. I’ll face it when ready. There is no other choice. It’s with me now, somewhere in my subconscious. RAAGIOSL – King of Water Monday, November 5, 2002 At long last, RAAGIOSL, great King of the West and Water, has been successfully evoked in due form. It has been a difficult adjustment over the last two months, as my muscular disequilibrium warded off the ultimate truth that the cosmos and I are one. Accepting that Self awareness has been a frightful process,10 losing the illusion that I am separate from the rest of existence. Now, the King has bestowed full consciousness of the universal Oneness flowing through all of spacetime to focus on this microcosm and then projecting back to the macrocosm, carrying with it the impress of my personal "},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  173 order. I’ve never been more established on the inner planes. My personal complex pattern gestalt has made a clear imprint on the plane of pure information, the quantum basis underlying all physical existence. Even my magical workplace has focused an impression in the transcendence, an impersonal template with which I connect through my cosmic temple, built up in meditation before my ceremonies. Connecting this inner plane establishment with my physical temple space has never been easier or more effective. I felt myself to be present on both planes at once during my operations with field as well as focused consciousness. The universe and I are one. The vision began with the King evoking me. A new reality of self immediately presented itself to me. A torus made up of elliptical rings instead of perfect circles surrounded me. It had very high, narrow sides. This type of torus is called a dimpled sphere. A twisting ribbon of my personal self threaded the tiny central hole, at once the focus of all the energy flowing around the torus and the projector of all that Will power. Field consciousness revealed this focus and this flow as part of one encompassing hyperdimensional reality, source and effect of every Self/self gestalt. I exist as the two impossibly fused fields that produce the core contradiction, the center of the torus. This center is a nexus of all scales and dimensions where every unfoldment, may be linked with any other in any combination. The potential for the evolution of consciousness arising out of this all-worlds point is unlimited. Field, flow, and focused perspectives come together at this absurd nexus. At the center of the mind lay the entire universe and its source. The microcosm is a little universe, complete with enfolded potential and unfolded actualization. It is complete within itself, yet intimately entangled with the macrocosmic source. "},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"174  FRATER W.I.T. The process of continuing unfoldment, which produces ego consciousness, mirrors the objective world process of maintaining matter and energy through time. Image and object are constantly interconnected through similarity of pattern. Only the strict focus of attention on personal processes yields the illusion of separateness from the impersonal. Surrendering the false sense of self can open the mind to the greater reality of wholeness. This is a far better state of being than the isolated blindness, fulfilling all emptiness and reconnecting self with cosmic nature. The intellectual journey through darkness, begun during the last aeon of human consciousness, has reached an end in Thelema. “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.” As the significance of what I’d become set in, I began to see details of this awesome vision. The central twisting thread was black while the torus itself was white. The transcendent background, however, was sheer brilliance reaching far beyond the three dimensions of normal space. This was the great King RAAGIOSL. His omnipresent voice welcomed me to my true estate as a being of transcendence. He proclaimed me as a Lord of all the lower realms and told me to fully realize myself in all states of being. I am to be the All in all, the full holographic image at all scales. Linking the All with the specific opens up a passageway through all scales to expand quantum indeterminacy to the size of human experience. Transcendence is made focused and enduring in physical reality as the coherence of the material world becomes motile and interactive.11 The level of order and complexity increases with time instead of decreasing, as cosmic consciousness becomes focused on a particular perspective. Thus is the process of incarnation and its inherent connection with the universe, containing that which contains it. Projecting this "},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  175 paradoxical complexity to the surrounding world is magick. After a while in this communion, I left the vision, banished, and closed the temple. The experience had been ultimately fulfilling but overwhelming, which affected my concentration during the closing ceremonies. However, there were no muscle spasms as I was able to handle the profound angelic energies to some degree. Nothing was being warded off or denied. I made some mistakes but nothing of any consequence. The feeling of overwhelm grew less as my contact with the inner planes eased in intensity. I’m confident that I’ll soon be ready for the Fire angels. What that will entail, I can’t hazard a guess. Greater initiation is coming my way. I must take my time with it. The divine presence that has entered me will guide me through. The angels really want me to succeed in their Path. LSRAHPM – Mars Senior of Water Sunday, February 9, 2003 LSRAHPM, Mars Senior of Water, has been evoked efficiently and completely. All energies were manageable, without overwhelm like the last time. I figured that my attunement to this energy needed to be perfected since my previous attempt met with such difficulty. A complete initiation into all the mysteries of Water is needed to properly prepare for the awesome forces of angelic Fire. Now, I have truly mastered this element and feel ready to begin with Fire tablet evocations next time. I called forth and was called forth by the angel and was brought to an earthy scene at twilight. The Senior appeared as "},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"176  FRATER W.I.T. male this time but was definitely the same essence as encountered in previous evocations. This suggested that a more masculine, even intellectual expression of this spirit was to be conveyed. LSRAHPM explained that I was to be introduced to a special mystery of Water involved with Earth. We came to a large patch of wet ground and then to a pool of black pitch. It was shiny and I could see my reflection in the obsidian darkness. LSRAHPM said that this was the basis of all matter and energy, their source. This was that foam I’d seen in other Water angel visions. Then I realized that the watery essence of materiality was the zero point energy, the continuous vacuum fluctuations of quanta that exist throughout spacetime. I’ve just begun reading a book on harnessing this most subtle basis of the material world, its effect on matter and on consciousness. Interestingly, this hidden nature is referred to as quantum foam. It is purely random and not reachable by the usual means of working with subatomic particles. However, under the right influence, random systems may become self organizing and emerge higher levels of order. Consciousness is an extremely complex example of this phenomenon. The principle of order out of chaos could be used to harness the zero point energy technologically. Chaos theory describes this type of process, understanding that order eventually emerges from chaos when certain corresponding patterns become established on all scales of size. This polarization of energy flow across the quantum, macroscopic (human), and macrocosmic levels, is called self similarity in mathematics. All the potential for the emergence "},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  177 of order in these realms superpose together to focus a more complete level of organization in chaotic systems. Cells of self similar, self organized order come forth temporarily. The flow of time is altered locally as the tendency for energy to become reduced to its lowest possible state, called entropy in physics, is reversed. Eventually, the source chaos reasserts itself in these systems and the higher order is disbursed. All life, consciousness, and evolution derive from these basic processes. With all this lore in mind, I projected myself into the pool of dark, viscous liquid and emerged myself therefrom as a powerful whirlwind. Such manifestations of weather are examples of emergent order in the atmosphere. After a time, I withdrew myself from the funnel of dark energy potential and then it ceased to whirl. Here was Earth, Air, and Water, but no Fire. The heavy Earth could be lightened by certain natural processes to focus energy into highly ordered patterns that could evolve over time, in a continuous cycle of birth and death. These ordered patterns are never destroyed with their disbursal on the physical level. They’re preserved in the potential state and can reemerge in ever more complex forms as evolution unfolds. The collective unconscious of species is an example of such transcendent memory. I asked the Senior where the missing Fire was but he said that this was not the tablet to answer such a question. The Fire Tablet angels could answer me. The message was given and the vision was done so I gave the angel license to depart and closed the temple. Ironically, it was during the closing ceremonies that I felt the orgasmic intensity of power that had overwhelmed me during my "},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"178  FRATER W.I.T. previous evocation of LSRAHPM. This time, however, I endured the sensations calmly and maintained poise throughout the experience. I am ready for Fire intensity and mystery."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" Chapter XI VISIONS OF THE GREAT SOUTHERN WATCHTOWER OF FIRE SECOND ROUND ALNDVOD – Luna Senior of Fire Monday, February 17, 2003 I’ve evoked ALNDVOD, Luna Senior of Fire, to partial success. A whole new level of transcendent space and psychic functioning has begun to open for me. It is difficult to find words to express the unusual character of the contact, so removed from normal human experience as it is. When transcendent impersonal consciousness first makes itself felt in waking awareness, it initiates new sensations, new visions, new understandings, and a contact with an encompassing field of life that has no correspondence to earthly experience. The energy is sharper, brighter, and causes a response from the totality of individual being that is as holistic as it is ecstatic. Where Water was dark and heavy, Fire is brilliant and "},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"180  FRATER W.I.T. hyperdimensionally energetic. All of incarnate life is as a tiny flame in the vast conflagration of angelic Fire. The vision began as a scene of infinite sky, like that of Air, but with every point therein bursting forth with the essence of joy and song, although there was perfect silence throughout. Sudden bursts of fiery conflagration occurred frequently but then were reabsorbed into the sky field just as suddenly.1 The blue of the sky was tinged with orange and yellow but these colors were far brighter and more intense than anything the physical eye could register. I call these hypercolors, showing not only the hue but also the essence of the idea of color bursting out at every point. I was able to maintain this extremely transcendent vision only for brief periods. Each time, the energy became too much for me and my mind’s eye fell into total darkness and nullity. I recovered myself and built up the psychic intensity again to achieve another brief glimpse but then fell back to darkness, overwhelmed. More experience with this new level of transcendence and further transformations are needed to channel this most profound energy effectively. I called upon ALNDVOD while in one of the energized periods of vision. This effort resulted in my Ajna chakra, at the brow, radiating a ring of psychic projection around my physical head. It formed a few inches away from me and then promptly burst into curling blue and yellow flames, seen with the mind’s eye’s rendering of the space around me. My outer and inner vision spaces coexisted as one harmonious, continuous reality, with each field registering its action independent of the other. My whole nervous system surged with power as I caught glimpses of this great angel in the "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  181 winking sky of Fire. He showed himself as a great head of pure glory, androgynous and wearing a garland of fluffy white cloud. His facial expression exhibited great thrill and ecstasy. I got a clear sense of the Senior as myself projected more clearly than with any other angelic projection. I could feel myself there, being the angel in that divine setting as well as my terrestrial self. Yet, the fiction of separation was useful, just as the inner/outer vision space separation was useful, to lift myself from the mundane level to a state of uttermost transcendence. I withdrew my sense of identification with the angel and opened up to receive from that most extreme holoprojection. ALNDVOD said that I wasn’t yet ready to receive the full vision, now only glimpsed before being psychically exhausted by it. The key was to receive more completely than at any previous level of intensity. I perceived very clearly the heaviness and inertness of so much of my nervous system. Somehow, all this had to be volatilized to achieve the full vision of this angel and angelic Fire in general. This evocation was but the first step in my latest initiation. I’ll call ALNDVOD again when I’m more prepared. Even now, this angel’s first blessing is transmuting my psyche and nervous system, bringing more light to the darkness. I banished and closed the temple feeling cooked to the core. ALNDVOD – Luna Senior of Fire Monday, March 21, 2003 I’ve evoked ALNDVOD, Luna Senior of Fire, for the second time and with much greater success than before. "},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"182  FRATER W.I.T. However, I am dazed by the contact. The energy absorbed is so transcendent and so intense that my center of thought and concentration has become loosened, generalized, less focused. My psychic functioning is fuzzy, diffused. A new kind of consciousness is needed to maintain coherent action while I’m absorbed by the unearthly energies of angelic Fire. A global fusion of field consciousness must be established in order to bring coherence to pure transcendence. I discovered that the new style of evocation to be adopted for spirits of this caliber is to become the angel called forth and then project my entire enhanced nature onto my visionary/auric sphere of sensation. In doing this, my inner temple visualization became intimately connected to my innermost psyche and my physical temple space. Every object seemed imbued with its astral counterpart, making the very air seem to scintillate with activity. Every point of my vision space burst with fiery conflagration, which immediately canceled itself out. This added remarkable complexity and enhanced dimensionality to every scene and idea. This ubiquitous supercharge is the supreme manifestation of Will, the ultimate angelic Fire. In its myriad activity, all was one force, a transdimensional projection from beyond the confines of spacetime to the most specific coherent point. The world of Fire, the zero point energy flow, the state of pure Will to emerge into physicality from pure potential, opened up to absorb me. Great rolls and rivulets of brilliant white circulating flame surrounded me on all sides, like the great Watchtower city of the King of Air, but of pure fiery flow. This is the impulse that could focus the forces of nature into a state where time and entropy reverse and higher order evolves. This is the source of True Will that can alter the "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  183 cosmos in such a way as to emerge events according to individual intention, the process of magick. I called for a voice to give me a teaching and then heard out of the Fire, “...Will is pure...” Two other attributes to Will were given but the words were garbled in the rush and crash of the coiling energy. Immense power built up in my nervous system at the reception of the voice, like during my last evocation of this angel. It reached a point where I shuddered from head to toe. This muscular action released some of the tension but the supercharge remained, intense yet subtle. There is still some short circuit in my psyche/aura that is disabling my efficient channeling of the raw force of Fire. The deep, sonorous voice said that the vision was complete and about to end. The Fire dimension folded up all around me, returning to pure potential beyond the universe, and I was again in my physical temple. I banished and closed but with great difficulty concentrating and visualizing. I feel renewed, recreated, reemerged by this profound vision of another reality, the source of the source, having fulfilled the initiation of the Luna Senior of Fire. Evocation of the Mercury Senior of Fire is next. ANODOIN – Mercury Senior of Fire Sunday, April 20, 2003 I’ve evoked ANODOIN, Mercury Senior of Fire, in due form. My astral temple fit perfectly within my physical workspace, adding imminence to every object therein and a sense of energy flow throughout. The physical reached smoothly into the transcendent reality of my inner "},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"184  FRATER W.I.T. establishment. The various sigils and grams traced during the opening appeared clearly in the starry space of my torus temple, lighting up the scene with their inherent glow; reds, blues, and gold against the background of the consciousness of the continuity of cosmic existence. This is the magical auric holoprojection field in which I conjure my angels. Upon calling ANODOIN and entering vision, I immediately saw the angel projected throughout the infinite Fire sky, as encountered in my first evocation of ALNDVOD. The whole scene turned brilliant, billowy white. He called me forth and I was uplifted into the great supersky. His form was of an old man with long white hair and beard, much like clouds. There was no water anywhere, however. Every particle of white essence was zero point energy. I asked him the mystery of Fire and he told me that it was the gateway to all the worlds. All is connected by Fire. This reminded me of a contemplation I had way back in 1987, when I first began practicing ceremonial magick. It occurred to me that the flames of the candles at the four quarters formed gates through which the elemental energies could flood into physicality and through which I could skry into the spirit realm. I am now convinced that my old speculations are true, based on what the angels have taught me regarding the way psychic energy flows interdimensionally into the surrounding physical world and my own studies of the physics of chaos theory and emergent order. Burning wax is matter undergoing a phase transition, being reduced to smoke and various residual traces and with so much chemical energy being released. Other phase transitions occur, such as when ice melts into water and when water boils into vapor. Such activity is "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  185 occurring every second amid the myriad electrochemical interactions of the human brain, yielding many layers of complexity that build up into mind. The focal points of phase transitions open up the worlds of the various scales of size, such as the tiny subatomic realm, the world which is normally understood by human awareness, and the huge celestial level. Patterns at each level align to form transcale, self similar interconnections. These evolve emergent systems of all sizes as well as mental phenomena, such as evocation of spirits and expansion of consciousness. Emergent order, consciousness included, expands in such fractal (fractional) dimensional patterns. These fall in between the normally understood three spatial dimensions of length, width, and breadth.2 The process of expansion into normal space and time makes them spiral through the myriad possibilities of unfoldment potential to weave the complex structures of living systems. The fractal unfoldment of emergent order follows the organizing principle that takes shape from the aligned transcale patterns. The transdimensional interconnection and the hyperdimensional field resulting from this principle are woven into the underlying fabric of reality to guide matter and energy into complex structures. I speculate that the preceding description answers to what quantum physicists call a quantum coherence field.3 A magical auric holoprojection can interact with this phenomenon to alter its underlying pattern. The Will of the magician is hereby imposed on the emergent system to transmute it into a higher level of order. This is the magick of the Fire philosophers. Elemental Fire is the zero point energy "},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"186  FRATER W.I.T. falling into the self similar transcale patterns of emergent order. The angel went on to say that diversity was the unity of existence. The multiplication was its source. Reality is One. This is what underlies the myriad emergences that create all things. All is evoked by the interaction of the spirals, the interference of the waves of pure Fire. The chaos is the order. There is no meaningful distinction. Reality is a seamless, undivided wholeness. At that point, an enormous interdimensional spiral of reddish orange Fire erupted all around my vision body and spread throughout my outer vision space as well. My entire reality was taken up by whirling, spiraling flame, the distinction between inside my mind and outside my body dissolved in continuous energetic unfoldment. The torrent of Fire fusion eventually faded into the background of my psychic scene, giving my nervous system a much needed rest. The ecstasy and the understanding had been extreme but now my enhanced reality was cooling off. The Fire sky scene changed color under the influence of the residual transdimensional circulating current, now with hyperbrilliant reds, oranges, yellows, and amber. They were all interwoven in perpetual movement. These colors were carried by the frequent eruptions of sky Fire in continuing vibrancy, causing my nervous system to excite in sympathy. Happily, I was able to handle this spiking intensity with just a few slight bodily shudders. Overall, I was comfortable with this level of Fire. My preparation in passing from the Water tablet to the Fire tablet, as well as all my previous training and experience, had really "},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  187 come to fruition in this most potent Work of my life. My efforts to pursue this round of Watchtower evocations correctly and effectively had proven successful in opening up and strengthening the subtle channels of my consciousness and aura. Even after this peak working, the residual energy was evenly distributed throughout my psyche and aura. My Kundalini was enhanced instead of becoming a pillar of blasting Fire which painfully raged up my spine, like during last round. This capability of maintaining the most powerful magical energies in balance will enable greater intensities of supercharge to be channeled. More was certain to come. ANODOIN told me further that Fire is an infinite focus, continuing with the all-worlds gateway idea. This element focuses the whole of the universe onto specific points, states of becoming something different than before. It is the core of life and mind, connecting all states to all states, self and other. Existence is nothing but the interference of the Fiery spiral wave focusing and refocusing on itself repeatedly, under the guidance of the wholeness of the cosmos which draws it into activity from pure potential. Thus is the stamp of pure Will made manifest. The fiery scene that surrounded and interpenetrated me reminded me of the Prince of Wands card from the Thoth Tarot deck. This card depicts the human figure driving a chariot drawn by a lion. The lion is an ancient symbol of Fire and an the emblem of the zodiacal sign, Leo. Sure enough, a lion of similar coloring appeared out of the flames and stared at me. I began talking to it but the voice of the angel told me to be silent and receive the lion’s subtle, wordless message. After awhile, the lion disappeared back into the coruscating flames and I communed with the transdimensionally circulating flow "},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"188  FRATER W.I.T. of mighty force. No new messages, realizations, or power spikes occurred, so I exited the vision and closed the temple in due form. So far, nothing has consciously registered from the lion’s communication. Perhaps, it was purely subconscious in nature, never meant to register to self awareness. At any rate, I feel as if I’ve achieved an understanding of Babalon and the Beast whereon she rides, the ubiquitous spiral connectedness and the cosmic totality. AAPDOCE – Venus Senior of Fire Sunday, May 11, 2003 AAPDOCE, Venus Senior of Fire, has been evoked in due form. Words cannot express the glory and wonder of the vision. At best, I can describe the images and shapes of things and simply record that they were wondrous. This is ever the limitation of language when applied to things metaphysical. The angel appeared as enormous and hyperdimensional, coming to me from the myriad directions of enhanced inner vision, as well as below the floor of my magical temple. My astral temple was also filled with the angel’s radiance. She had fiery red hair and a matronly face, somewhat like MARDALA, the great Queen of Air. AAPDOCE called me forth and told me to behold the vision not yet seen. My inner, outer, and astral spaces became one as the blazing infinite sky I beheld towards the end of my last Fire angel vision, with passionately flashing reds, oranges, yellows, and everything in between. The color bursts were there as well, giving a frenetic quality to every point of the sky. Soon the integrated space calmed down to a continuous orange background and a dull yellow tetrahedron, a triangular pyramid, appeared before me. Its six "},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  189 edges were sharply defined and its four points were very pointy. This object began to bounce and whirl about with great energy and speed. The angel said, “Behold the core of it all.” The tetrahedron began to expand and unfold, throwing out innumerable projections of triangles and copies of itself in red, orange, and yellow profusions. The swarm of multicolored geometric progressions and flowerings increased to a degree of complexity and dimensional alteration that boggled my mind. Space itself was expanding under the operations of the core structure. Through it all, I noticed that the source of all the action remained unaffected by its activities, no matter how much it unfolded and intermingled with its projections. The projections also intermingled with each other in splashes of color and complex patterning, building the pathways for matter and energy to follow to emerge higher order in normal space. The whole vision was hypnotic and truly wondrous. This order out of chaos is the core phenomenon by which all life and mind evolve. AAPDOCE told me to approach the temple of the core and see the shrine within. Drawing nearer to the active yet stable tetrahedron, I saw at its center a shining steel sphere with a black equal armed cross jutting out from the top. My intuition understood this emblem to represent the initial emission of equal but opposite quantum particles from the vacuum of pure nothingness, the vacuum fluctuation out of which our universe was born. Each fusion of opposite projections brings those first two primal principles closer to mutual annihilation and return to the nothingness that is their source and destiny. The continuous emergence and instantaneous annihilation of this "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"190  FRATER W.I.T. zero point energy goes on all around us while our source splitting-of-zero-into-two remains eternally separate, eternally poised for reconnection, ever reaching out towards itself in a grand dance of projective interaction. When there is enough emergent order in the cosmos, enough development of consciousness, the first two will finally come together to fulfill each other as well as the destinies of countless intelligences birthed by their mutual passion. The cross is the positive side, expansive and emanating all brilliance, while the sphere is contractive and indrawing, swallowing all light and life. Their mutual interaction has caused the exchange between the metallic brightness of the cross and the darkness of the sphere. They become each other as evolution progresses. Maybe all the zero point energy pairs create universes as they reach toward ecstatic annihilation. The angel, with a huge arm, took the center device and placed it on my head like a crown. It was inside my crown chakra. I find it interesting that in my MARDALA vision, the Queen of Air placed me in her crown while in this vision, a profound alchemical device was placed in mine. Once again, I’ve experienced a trade in relationship with the angels, becoming ever more like them as their initiations take full effect. The Senior told me to wear the crown as a king of Fire, wielding power over all emergence. To control this ultimate alchemical process is to control everything that results from it, including all life and all consciousness. The sphere-cross is truly the crown of all crowns. Intriguingly, it is also an inverted Venus symbol. The Great Mother is the flip side of pure nothingness, the root of all alchemical mystery. "},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  191 I asked the angel about the nature of the ultimate nothingness out of which the cosmos-creating opposite-pair-split arose. She said that this nullity pervades all emergent order and its products. It lay at the core of each fusion/annihilation pair, which lay at the core of every system of emergent order. At the core of the core of the core of all reality is pure nothingness; nothingness to the sphere-cross to the tetrahedron to life and mind. I remained for a time beholding the chains of being, feeling the bliss and wonder of the myriad processes going on around me. The angel’s final message to me was to be the King of Fire and wield these powers to accomplish my True Will. Eventually, I gave her license to depart and closed the magical temple. So, it seems I’ve been made the King of Fire and the Sphere of Fire long before having evoked this ultimate angel of the southern tablet. Is this another time paradox, feeling the effect of a powerful ceremony long before actually doing it? It may be that the seventh Sephirah of Netzach is intended here, the sphere of Fire and Venus, or perhaps the fourth Sephirah of Chesed, to which the “Sepher Yetzirah” attributes Fire. To stand outside of and rule over the magical creative force of all things would constitute me an Exempt Adept, a grade in the Golden Dawn and A.A.4 systems of initiation which is attributed to Chesed. This will be something to explore as AAPDOCE’s initiation takes full effect. At any rate, my astral crown has been bestowed upon me and remains with me even now. "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"192  FRATER W.I.T. AAETPIO – Mars Senior of Fire Sunday, August 10, 2003 AAETPIO, Mars Senior of Fire, has been evoked to fantastic effect. I have been initiated into the next Hall of Fire5, a higher state of emergent order than I’ve ever before experienced. The subtle power that underlies all of space is more awesome than can be described in words. It is overwhelming and of such a high vibration that it feels like extreme holiness. No wonder that whole religions have developed from this reality. Usually, the Mars Senior of a given tablet initiates the evocator into a mystery involving control and mastery, in preparation for the onramp to the ultimate revelation of the element of that Watchtower. The Jupiter and Saturn Seniors gradually open the inner senses and connections so that they can receive the great power and blessing of the transcendent level, represented by the King. This time, however, there were no control issues dealt with. The whole vision was a grand introduction to a new level of being and becoming, that fused the intellectual enlightenment so many of these angels have bestowed on me with the most exalted connection to pure holiness. This begins my preparation for the grand initiation to come, the ultimate evocation of the Watchtower system. The vision began with the appearance of AAETPIO as a transdimensional curl of reddish gold light, coming from beyond the cosmos, flowing through all the dimensions of space and mind, and twisting/expanding into my field of inner sight. Each curve of his inconceivably long body passed through a set of partially realized dimensions, spaces implicit within spaces, like an ever unfolding flower. Perhaps, these "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  193 spatial modalities were created out of normal space by the spiraling effusion of the angel’s body instead of them being independently existing backgrounds through which he passed.6 Each twist was also an expansion, coming from the infinitesimal that is the immensity of the whole universe7 to my incarnate psychic imagination. His serene face was at the end of the curl. Thus, my mind was connected to a pathway through myriad worlds of possibility, out to a state beyond anything I ever before conceived. The Senior told me to prepare myself for something completely new and then hurled me with his Will in the transdimensional direction of his sinuous body of light, out to his source beyond comprehensible reality. What next struck my whole being is almost impossible to describe, at least in sensible terms. Here is my attempt. The revelation of this newly emerged state of consciousness showed itself as a brilliant white space, wherein every point shimmered and radiated gleaming white, curling snakes of flame. This great vista seemed solid with concentrated shooting, whirling bursts of pure essence of Fire, a cosmic crystal of hard flame filling all of empty space. The character as well as the intensity of this projection/contact was fundamentally different than any Fire scene I’d encountered before this. The only way to describe the impression is ever greater integration of lesser states of Fire to the point of saturation, concentrating power and activity until every spot of my vision space burst into overwhelming intensity and speed. All this was expressing my hyperactivated superconsciousness; a more complete and transcendent holoprojection than I was ever capable of emanating before. It occurred to me that each seraphic point in this vision was a sphere-cross/core zero point energy particle pair, but more energetic in emergence than "},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"194  FRATER W.I.T. those that normally extend into physical space. Here were true Hadit-father seeds reaching out from the Nuit-star mother. The psyche is a realm wherein potentials not normally realizable in physicality can emerge and be experienced by incarnate consciousness. Once the revelation is had, all that exists is forever changed. I lost sight of AAETPIO at this point and remained in that ultimate transcendence for a while. Eventually, I entered more fully into the Fiery space and suddenly the coruscations of energy turned into thick, gray mist. There was no hint of moisture in this mysterious fog. It was perfectly dry and cool to the touch. The angel’s booming voice came to me from everywhere and said that I had to pass a test to prove my worthiness to receive the Superlative. Not knowing what to do then, I waited where I was to allow the powers of the vision to guide me. After a short time, I found myself surrounded by a network of fine, white lines that appeared against the gray mist. A bright, white ball of light marked every intersection of two lines. I felt myself begin to distort and then unravel in a complex way, falling apart in myriad directions at once. My vision body was split down the middle, from head to foot, and then each half was reduced to gray mist. I found myself floating bodiless, completely formless, mist lost in mist. Time passed. Then, all of a sudden, I was whole again, in my vision body, remade from the mist that filled all of my inner space.8 So initiated and transformed to the core of my being (again), I moved forward through the mist and soon came to what seemed to be the wall of a large castle. However, the wall itself was only a thickening of the all pervasive gray mist. Eventually, the obscuration cleared up in my vicinity and I could see an entryway into a dark hall. The hall turned out to be a passage "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  195 through the mist but at the end, there was just more fog. I tried to walk out the other end of the hall but some unseen barrier prevented me from doing so. Perplexed, I walked out the way I’d come and reentered the obscuring grayness. A feeling of blindness and helplessness came over me. Suddenly, a brilliant golden key appeared floating in the mist before me. It was about half my size and glowed with warmth and life. It consisted of thick, golden lines that bent into two rounded rectangles, touching each other. One end was flat and the other bent into the classical shape of an ancient key. A new bodiless voice came echoing through the mist and said, “Can you answer the mystery of the Superlative?” Immediately, the key and I were moved into a long, dark hallway, different from the one before. At its end, there was a room that opened off to the right. Therein, I found an old man with a very long white beard and hair, wearing flowing white robes. He was in every way a classical wizard figure. I found him sitting on the floor of the empty room, in a meditative posture, facing a screen from which shown soft, white light. The wizard opened his eyes, looked up at me, and asked, “What is this key used for?” I thought for a minute in bewilderment and then was inspired to answer, “It unlocks the Superlative.” At that, he stood up, smiling broadly, and impressed the key onto my aura in the same way that the Jupiter Senior of Air had done with that symbol of utmost secret nature. These are "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"196  FRATER W.I.T. permanent fixtures in my energy body, radiating their meaning to me always. My set of astral accoutrements was expanding. At this point, I felt a rise of anxiety in the pit of my stomach but there was no discernable cause. A rush of supercharge began to spread throughout my nervous system that caused me much stress. Something was happening in my subconsciousness that was being covered by the ornate vision. Also, it was very hot in my apartment and my physical body was sweating profusely. I hoped that something in my inner experience would indicate what was happening. The old wizard beckoned toward the screen. Therein, I saw a whirlwind of might and energy, which had appeared in several of my dreams. It was like a nuclear blast, which had so overwhelmed me that I was immediately awakened by its force. Now, here it was on the screen, although somewhat muted as a two dimensional figure. It wasn’t as bright as it appeared in my dreams. I could face it fully, without panic. Here was a force beyond anything in my waking experience, magical or otherwise. It was pure, raw force but unusable and destructive.9 The wizard told me that this was the power of the Superlative and that I should strive to overcome it and use it. I gazed at the nuclear blast whirlwind of such awesome power and knew that this was the source of my rising anxiety. It also came to me that the unusual shape of the golden key modeled the dimensional twists I’d experienced during the discorporation of my vision body earlier on. The feelings of anxiety and nerve supercharge were becoming intense by this time, so the wizard told me to return to the world. Before exiting my trance, I asked the old man who he was. He said he "},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  197 was the Wizard Ebelijah. That’s my magical name! Here is a strong metaphor for self initiation. Could it be that a future self had reached back to his past to help initiate his former self? Now there’s time paradox! I returned to the world and closed the magical temple in due form but even in the aftermath of the superconscious contact, I felt as if I’d just been through a hellish experience. Deep down in my psyche, I really must have been overwhelmed by the revealed energies. Something about that nuclear blast intensity whirlwind devastates me to a great degree. Eating dinner has helped to balance me in mind and body. The analysis of today’s contact should reveal remarkable truths in the coming days. I hope that this vision will set me on the road to being able to not only conquer my fear of this profound Superlative force but also to learn how to harness it for my Will and my magick. ADOEOET – Jupiter Senior of Fire Sunday, August 31, 2003 ADOEOET, Jupiter Senior of Fire, has been successfully evoked in due form. I have experienced another revolution of consciousness, another complete transformation of being both internal and external. It used to be that an entire tablet of initiatory angels had to be evoked fully, culminating in the revelation of the King, to achieve this complete a leap in transcendence. Now, with Fire, every angel has yielded a remarkable, earth shattering, life altering initiation, beyond imagination and perhaps, beyond the universe. Such is the exploration of cosmic transcendence, transcendent impersonal consciousness. "},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"198  FRATER W.I.T. The new perfection was felt at the very outset of this working. I achieved a profound degree of clarity and intensity with all the visualizations involved in the opening ceremonies. All of my prior efforts in projecting hyperdimensional and transdimensional magical images and opening up inner plane spaces to hold them had reached an ideal issue. The composite red and blue hexagrams drawn during purification and consecration emanated the energy of the Golden Dawn tradition, filling my magical workspace with an atmosphere of holiness which could only have come from the egregore of the True and Invisible Order. I hadn’t felt this type of beatitude since my days in a Thelemic oriented Golden Dawn style order. For the first time, my personal magick had matched the power and glory of that magnificent group establishment. I had created a true temple of Golden Dawn style magick as an emissary of the True and Invisible Order. My Work has been truly blessed and justified in perfection. The Jupiter Senior of Fire emerged at every point of my vision space, the surrounding physical space, my innermost being, and the outermost extent of my holoprojections, complete at each spot and yet one continuous hyperdimensional, all encompassing person throughout. The angel appeared as an enormous, stately, old man with long, white, curly hair and beard. He called me forth by my magical name, Ebelijah, and told me to learn the mystery not yet revealed. All along, this mystery had been implied in all that had gone before but never overtly shown. Now, it was to be revealed at last. The angel led me forward into vision with a gentle impetus from all around me and beneath me. His titan hand gestured toward an object floating in space that turned out to be a "},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  199 golden rose of many petals. It shown with brilliance like the sun, so that I could barely look at it.10 ADOEOET said in a thunderous voice, “Behold the great mystery that has now been revealed. It is the Rose of Gold, the transcendence beyond the ultimate transcendence. Come and take up this Rose and fulfill the destiny of humanity.” I took the Rose in my hand and instinctively placed it on my forehead, in my brow chakra. My entire aura became supercharged with solar golden radiance but I was not overwhelmed by the energy. My inner and outer spaces became suffused with this glow, interpenetrating the interdimensional plenum that was the Senior’s presence. I felt/saw a great golden ring expand outward from my forehead to an extreme distance, both in vision space and out from my physical body, as well as all the dimensions in between. This hyperdimensional, transdimensional band carried along my sense of self as it reached through the barriers that hold existence together. By a consciously chosen act, I had taken another auric symbol unto myself and been transformed into a direct channel of the force that descends into the realm of normal space and time from the ultimate transcendence to constitute all mind, matter, and experience. The great solar golden Rose was blooming into wondrous life upon my crosslike body to lighten all the worlds of verging potential.11 Then, the scene grew very dim and even the space surrounding my body relaxed in intensity. I found myself in a dull, grayish black area pervaded by a sense of imminent potential emergence. Once again, a thick, dark veil was covering me after a transcendent revelation of brilliant light. All went quiet for a while as I floated bodiless in a null space. "},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"200  FRATER W.I.T. Then, a circle of light appeared before my mind’s eye. A long series of rapidly shifting images were flashing from inside it, including the Sun-Rose glow I just saw. The booming voice of ADOEOET came to me from all directions and said, “Behold how anything perceived is necessarily within oneself. All experience is an internal dialog but the self is always beyond it, encompassing it. There is no way to reach outside oneself since one is always beyond the perception of events. Be one, then, with that which brings perception to the mind. Merge with vergence.” I then understood that the vision space around me was the vergence field, that cosmic focusing of potential from which all actuality directly emerges. I knew myself to be the connection between vergence and emergence, the cosmic - holistic principle that is omnipresent in all experience and phenomena. All the whirls and rushing of the mind were just so much chaos before my true being, not of me at all. I am entirely beyond all such operations, aloof, alone. I am the core of the Solar-Phallus, the secret of all human life, yet, outside it, containing it. I was contained by what I contain, outside and inside at once. This was a completely new mode of consciousness, different than any mere expansion of awareness, a fusion of vergence and emergence, potential and actuality. I was one with the cosmic inspirer. Several jolts of anxiety shot through my body as I maintained this new state of being.12 I asked ADOEOET to show me the cause of the fear. The new sense of inside – outside wonder became clearer to me and I asserted this as my true and proper state of being. All fear dissolved at once. Such was the angel’s wordless answer. I remained in this "},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  201 cosmic, transcendent unity for some time longer but nothing new occurred, so I exited the vision and closed the magical temple. It is the destiny of all humanity to realize their true natures as cosmic principles of emerging life potentials, outside the world and beyond the experience of sense perceptions and mental processes. I have realized this step forward, which will make it easier for others to do the same. The circle of light wherein all my incarnate experiences continually flash in confusion is the Wheel of Samsara. The true nature of consciousness is ultimately independent of such chaos. The roar of the mind, which I noticed for the first time, having finally reached beyond it, is merely so much material energic complexity. The source of life’s becoming belongs to a different realm. Life and death are simply turns in the wheel of material emergence of biological processes, the wheel of the Gunas.13 Body consciousness wants to maintain the psyche’s attachment to it. Rising beyond this limited state of attachment to foreign processes can be frightening at first. It scared me. However, acceptance of the truth yields liberation from all fears and their causes, realizing a state of pure ease. Only the wholeness of what is, is real, the ocean of pure being. ARINNAP – Saturn Senior of Fire Sunday, September 28, 2003 ARINNAP, Saturn Senior of Fire, has been evoked in due form. The temple setup and opening were even more powerful and clear than before, the inner plane temple setting unfolding with more complex dimensionality than ever. This particular expression of my deep psyche is becoming ever more "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"202  FRATER W.I.T. integrated with my magically enhanced vision reality. The sense of holiness and transcendence were immediate and effective in providing a fitting backdrop for my ceremonial evocations. Upon entering vision, I perceived my inner plane identity as the Wizard Ebelijah surrounding me in the form of the eighth chakra, the great lotus wherein I exist as the stamen of the flower. The ancient face and body of the great wizard appeared on each petal while simultaneously encompassing the whole lotus as one continuous being. This was my whole Self complex, projected from that great source being whose head was constituted by my entire vision body. The angel ARINNAP appeared before the three expressions of me, MegaSelf, self, and projection, as a young man with thick, black, curly hair and beard. The Senior called me forth by my incarnate name and my inner plane name, summoning the fully unfolded three-in-one self complex to his reality. We stood together in the infinite starry space of Nuit and partook of the consciousness of the continuity of existence, all space and time and experience, as never ending flow and field.14 The ecstasy came from all the elements of vision at once, with myself as a small part in the overall joy. “Come to the distant star.” said the great angel, pointing out to the myriads of stars that surrounded us, splashes from the milk of the paps of Nuit and the spate of ejaculation from the great Serpent Hadit. I tried to move toward the star pointed to, instantly feeling a deep affinity for the distant glittering point, but it moved farther away the more I strove to reach it. The angel said that the distant star is who I truly am, the one star of all the stars "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  203 from which I emerge. I relaxed and allowed my sense of unity with the special star to grow and suddenly, it rushed up and collided with me with enormous force. All the spaces and images and dimensions around me erupted with brilliant white fire, every spot a blazing sun. I felt my field of self blown all over the universe to join in every part of the body of Nuit in even greater wholeness and ecstasy than before. My psyche emerged in every twinkle and shine of every star, every expanse of dark emptiness, every moment and event. The angel waved his hand and a great throne appeared in the midst of the stellar intensity. I sat down on this throne and ARINNAP placed a dark blue circlet on my head. The golden rose that I’d placed on my forehead in the previous vision moved on top of the circlet and affixed itself in place, still shining as before. The Senior said that this throne was at once made of gold and brass.15 Then, a small serpent head emerged from the center of the golden rose to complete an Egyptian style crown. The priest of the Gnostic Catholic Church wears this crown during Mass. The heart girt with the serpent and the egg surrounded by a serpent were ideas that relate to this symbolism.16 I remained like this for some time, feeling that my whole self was undergoing truly amazing transformations but I could only perceive their dimmest echoes. Eventually, ARINNAP told me to return to the world so I exited the trance and closed the magical temple in due form. My every action and word seemed clothed with holiness. Thus, I’ve now been confirmed in a high celestial office, at one with the most transcendent natures and the earthiest experience. A Priest/Wizard crown has been bestowed on me "},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"204  FRATER W.I.T. in preparation for the coming apex of this Enochian operation, the evocation of the great King of Fire. I still feel the reverberations of that stellar impact. The Path of Thelema leads truly to beyond the beyond. Later that night... I’ve become aware of my whole Self more clearly than ever before. The stars in my visions are simply so many focuses of Self’s attention. I no longer perceive myself to be the center of things but rather one among many intelligences projected by this master of being. This source of consciousness is pure impersonal being, the inspirer of emergence, truly Saturnian in nature. This state of impersonality is what the Fire King tried to introduce me to during my first evocation of him but wasn’t quite able to succeed. This time, he’ll be free to take me further. All is brilliant light in the mind of the Whole. It appears as darkness to a point consciousness still obsessed with its own centrality. Embracing its relative and common nature allows a clearer perception of the impersonal being as pure light, of a nature so far beyond the little point projection. The broader context yields understanding of True Will. EDLPRNAA – King of Fire Friday, November 28, 2003 EDLPRNAA, Great King of the South and Fire, has been evoked in due form. This was by far my greatest magical working and, happily, I am not overwhelmed by the most extreme energies generated by this most wondrous experience. "},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  205 I am completely transformed by the grand initiation, not only in psychic functioning but also in outlook and understanding. With this ultimate connection, my vision transcended time itself.17 I now feel true peace, having achieved such power, love, and wisdom. Upon entering vision I saw a field of red tetrahedral flames emerging smoothly out of a black background of space. Then, I heard a high pitched roar and saw steadily flowing streams of particulate energy explode everywhere in a great whirlwind of power. The torrent soon quickened to an extreme degree, changing color from red to the brilliant blue of the hottest possible fire. The roar sounded continuously as these flames engulfed me, sending an extreme rush through every nerve in my body. My mind and aura were supercharged as never before, surpassing even the Superlative in intensity. I was able to withstand the onslaught of this psychic nuclear blast as it enveloped every fiber and energy of my being at all levels. The angels had trained me well for this supreme ordeal of quickening. The inner and outer blazing blue flames resolved themselves before my dazzled mind’s eye into none other than the Nighthawk, first seen in a profound and mysterious spontaneous vision I had in 1986, seventeen years before, and hinted at during my evocation of the Air King.18 He was hyperdimensionally huge, filling every partial and completely unfolded space, from inside the deepest recesses of my mind, out to the world around me, and beyond to the farthest horizon. His outstretched wings extended toward me and away from me at the same time, both near and far. This creature of pure Fire was exactly that which had shown itself to me seventeen years ago but was now close and in full communion with me19. His roaring caw had a much lower pitch than before, "},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"206  FRATER W.I.T. commensurate with his expanded size. This was EDLPRNAA, the greatest King of the Southern Watchtower and the element of Fire. In a booming voice that sounded above the continuous hawk roar, the King told me to be a master of destiny, to own and affirm my life in all its circumstances. Every event must be thought of as an act of True Will and not as an unavoidable occurrence. I am never to think of myself as a helpless victim of the world around me, a slave to the appearances of life on earth. To be a real magician, I must affirm even the greatest trials and dangers as completely in accord with my True Will and not disasters tragically suffered in a harsh, unfair reality. I and the universe of space and time, events and experiences, are one. He told me to look outward in my mind and I saw the tetrahedral red flame currents in the black space that appeared at the beginning of this vision. Beyond this, I beheld my own face, interpenetrating everything and the nothing out of which it emerges. I am one in All-in-all, the master of every inner becoming and life circumstance. I am the ubiquitous principle of all emergence patterns, the stable archetype by which all multiplicity derives. I am the All-State in which every cell, thought, feeling, and energy projection is connected.20 I am one with that wholeness out of which all matter, energy, and consciousness emerge. All as each and every am I, whole and part, a true holographic existence. I am truly a focus of cosmic attention and supercosmic intent, center of the intersection of the life wave and the destiny wave which crisscross the fractal web of spacetime, its vergence field, and its null basis. I am the strange attractor and its emergent order.21 "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  207 I remained in this superconnected and holistic beatitude, a master of destiny, for a long time but then the King told me that the vision was finished.

Thus, I’ve produced the paradox of my own magical becoming, unexpectedly called to the Great Work that night long ago, before ever practicing any form of occultism but having read about it for a few years. Now, I called forth what called me forth, then and now, uniting the paradoxical impulse of destiny with today’s climactic revelation. This time warping influence was so powerful that two moments, seventeen years apart, were brought together. I live in time paradox, a future past of wonder in the mundane, workaday world of twenty-first century America. The new ultimate transcendence will now unfold in my life and mind as I work my job each day during the week.

My conjurations are more closely linked in this way. I was hit with a sudden intense burst of ecstasy just before setting up the magical temple, an immediate paradoxical future-connect to the evocation to come. These time shifts are bound to occur more frequently and powerfully now that the great King of Fire has uplifted me to the metatime state. I was able to recover from this episode of ecstatic paradox and "},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  209 assembled the magical temple with the usual detail. The actual contact with this angel turned out to be gentler than the initial time shifted burst. Perhaps, the ecstasy was more than my consciousness could register, causing me to filter the intensity to a more muted level. In any case, my vision unfolded before me as the vast cosmic space with every scale of size and every partial dimension expressed with crystal clarity. Every point therein was luminous with all the most brilliant colors imaginable. Spiral patterns surrounded and flowed through each, layer upon layer of focus and flow in a ubiquitous self referential process. Here was physical space represented in its totality, one in All as One, an interconnected holographic plenum. The global connectedness in this trance was similar to that experienced during that greatest of visions with the King of Fire but the flow of becoming lacked that scintillating quality of the most active of elements. Earth of Spirit had a stable quality in the midst of its continuous functioning, a true metalevel of physicality. Out of this ecstatic, holistic joy unfolded a giant head bathed in yellow light, whose facial expression was one of purest ecstasy. The head was of an old man with the usual long, white, curly hair and beard of an angel, very neatly quaffed and symmetrical. RMTO told me that there is perfect connection in the universe. A change to the whole system is instantly reflected in every point therein, all microcosms in and of themselves, and any change to any point is immediately emulated by every other, as well as the whole field.1 I partook of the joy of this perfect integration on all scales of size and sets of dimensions and gazed at the yellow lighted head of RMTO.2 I holoprojected my Will into the plenum and "},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"210  FRATER W.I.T. emerged wispy streams of yellow intelligence that joined in the continuous tapestry of interconnection. RMTO bestowed his blessing and initiation on me then. I felt my entire being open in a more complete way than ever before. The receiving was so total that there was nothing left of me but a bubble of concentrated becoming, in which the whole of the universe of Spirit focused itself. Every nerve and spark of individual consciousness was open to this transcendence and so transformed thereby into another kind of life, another kind of being. I abode in this pure, ecstatic beatitude for some time as a new species of consciousness. Giving the angel license to depart, I closed the temple with the same old body but controlled by a new mind. Every thought seemed like a new universe. Every feeling was a novel creation. Every second of perceived time was a revelation of wonder. Eventually, a shadow of normalcy took hold of my concrete mind so that I could continue my mundane existence, but the overall transformation was permanent. The lessons of this profound initiation manifested all at once as complete chains of ideas and understanding in my mind. To transform personal consciousness is to change the entirety of existence, if that change is complete enough. Magick demands that the entire psyche be wielded as one complete whole, not the slightest trace of psychic energy left out. Only this can make a holoprojection powerful enough to emerge a highly unlikely order in the surrounding world of chaos and entropy. The element of Spirit is the quintessential holistic integration that makes magick possible. My improved understanding, developed during this second round of Watchtower evocations, will help me to realize this metalevel of Spirit more completely than before. I will be able to "},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  211 understand the Tablet of Union angels far better this way and finally complete this system of initiation in perfection. Practical material magical work may follow. XCAI – Air of Spirit Sunday, March 28, 2004 XCAI, Air of Spirit angel of the Tablet of Union, has been evoked in due form. He appeared as a swirl of fiery white light and evoked me as well. We then united to achieve a full circuit of interdimensional paradoxical consciousness. My first clear vision was of the anticosmos of white space and black stars, just as in my first evocation of XCAI. Soon, the black suns that were submergences3 in this reality dissolved into the background whiteness. Tremendous surges of brilliant white energy then began coursing through this antispace. White flames erupted from the power flow, causing infinite movement throughout. The whole of this universe had become alive.4 A great angel head unfolded within the brilliant white cosmic scale conflagration, a truly transcale and hyperdimensional manifestation. His was the classic appearance, with white hair and beard, perhaps the same angel as RMTO but with a slightly different aspect. The nature of Spirit is unity and the Tablet of Union lacks the clear differentiation of the Watchtowers. This uniformity is bound to be reflected in the angels of this tablet. XCAI told me to partake of the mystery of joy, the mystery beyond the universe. I felt myself unfolding continually along with the Spirit angel as one comprehensive becoming. My "},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"212  FRATER W.I.T. aura opened under the influence of the vision. Especially my heart chakra expanded beyond the confines of my physical body. The other auric lotus wheels expanded as well but to a lesser extent, all except my crown center. This grandest of power processes hadn’t reached full development yet. Transdimensional curls of white fire, the zero point energy seen in my vision of the Luna Senior of Fire, poured through the open portal of my psychic/auric unfoldment to surround my body and flood the magical temple. I’d become a source/focus of supercosmic emergent unfoldment. I asked XCAI about the crossover point between the two universes, where submergence meets emergence. All the brilliance and fiery flow of my anticosmic vision darkened into a dim, twilit scene. Every point therein was charged with extreme power but was not luminous. The energy therein was potential but closer to actualization than in normal space, a more direct vergence. All the while, the zero point energy whirls continued to flow through the wide open gate of my aura and nervous system into the magical temple. I came to realize that union with my metalevel angelic holoprojection had completed my metapsychic circuit. XCAI had raised me to the state of supercosmic transcendence, the true source of Will. The whole spectrum of purpose, from cosmic intent to the individual True Will of every living system, derives from this ultimate beyond, creating and created by all manifestation. All the myriads of relationships which bind together matter and energy into bodies and intelligences are united here. Transcendence is the source of coherence. The novel states of complexity which develop out of the background possibility of the cosmos shape this All-State by bringing it into greater connectedness with the physical world. "},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  213 The holomovement is quickened into more intense life. This was the full unfoldment of transcendent impersonal consciousness that had eluded me during my first round of Enochian Watchtower evocations. I’d finally gained sufficient initiation and magical contact with the subtler states of being to become open enough to reach the source of sources, the inspirer of all action and purpose. My psyche and aura had become complex and connected enough to channel the All-State directly. The universe of my existence had been transformed into something new. With this grand realization, I exited vision, banished, and closed in due form. I remain as an open gate, although the zero point energy is no longer flowing through me. The interdimensional lotus wheel of my being has flowered to receive inspiration from a new level of life under the blessing and initiation of XCAI. Later that night... It struck me as strange that the evocation of the Air of Spirit angel revealed such a fiery and Will oriented vision. After much contemplation, I realized that the element of Active Spirit is a highly energetic principle, just as Passive Spirit is stable in its holistic connectedness, a truth revealed by the Earth of Spirit angel. It is with great insight that the elements of Fire and Spirit are attributed to the same Path of Shin on the Tree of Life. The fires in today’s vision were expressions of the hyperdimensional motion of a supercosmic principle that creates and sustains everything in existence. This reality could only appear as brilliant white flowing flames. The far reaching "},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"214  FRATER W.I.T. opening of my psyche and aura to the cosmic transcendence, especially at my heart center, is a trance of Tiphareth and corresponds to the nature of Air of Spirit. No doubt, what lay ahead with the higher elemental aspects of Spirit will echo these truths on an even more sublime and profound level. AONT – Water of Spirit Sunday, June 13, 2004 AONT, Water of Spirit angel of the Tablet of Union, has been evoked to wondrous effect. I now feel overwhelmed with a sense of joy and expansion which I’ve never known before. The Enochian system of magick never fails to yield ever greater peak experiences, ever more wondrous and intense emergences of spiritual transcendence and power. Dee and Kelly were in touch with something far beyond their imaginations, a distant future connect paradox of unlimited initiatory and transformative acceleration. This paradox reached even to today’s temple opening. The background space surrounding my inner plane temple was quickened into the white flame cosmos revealed during my last evocation. My ceremonies were able to form a pocket of order and coherence in this blazing maelstrom, a focusing of supercosmic torrent into a sensible projection. It is uttermost wonder how each peak experience serves as the backdrop for the next, each superconscious projection leaping forwards as an entire aeon of cosmic and human unfoldment. As I accelerate evolutionarily, I can accelerate ever faster. AONT appeared from out of the brilliant white, flooding flames surrounding my temple as a complete male figure of indeterminate age, both young and old, with fluffy white hair "},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  215 and beard, like clouds. He called me forth and I joined him out among the fires of joy. Streams of orange and yellow particles5, like tiny confetti, began upwelling in great spirals all around us. In their movements were purest joy and ecstasy. The angel told me to receive from all, yet be one. Here was the Elixir of Life. Mix gold with gold and silver or electrum magicum and channel this through the processes of emergent order, the totality of the psyche at all levels, to confect the Philosopher’s Stone. From this, generate the Elixir of unlimited Life. I felt my nerves open up to receive these streams of orange and yellow life. They were transmuted to purest gold, every last one. Receive from all, yet be one. A greater sense of wholeness of reality took shape in my mind that remains with me still. A new complexity of totality emerged from my enhanced and transmuted nervous system, exciting me with new sensations of transcendence and interconnectedness. A greater metalevel had been evolved. AONT told me to take this into my heart, into my mind, and into my soul. My ecstasy developed into a sense of supreme religious beatitude and holiness, the likes of which were first revealed to me during my Water angel evocations of this round. Now, however, the energy was purified and rarified and very bright. Here was pure spirituality, devoid of any doctrine or belief, direct connection to that which religion can only hint at. Be all, and yet one emerged pure godhead in heart, mind, and soul.6 Emergence and the power behind it are holy and worthy of most heartfelt love. The vision space became filled with universe bubbles similar to the one I’d become in response to RMTO’s blessing. They were each a complete reality, a complete course of "},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"216  FRATER W.I.T. evolution of matter and energy in space and time. Yet, each was a part of the Limitless Light of the true source of existence and the potential thereof. These were my coherent holoprojections in this state of ultimate transcendence. The vision was completed so I gave AONT license to depart, knowing absolutely that I was he and he was I. Mine is the flow of orange and yellow essences that transform me and uplift me to the next beyond. The closing was somewhat difficult, with so much supercharged psychic energy flooding my aura. What a brilliant success in magick this whole course has been. Much more will unfold from me in time to come. PAAM – Fire of Spirit Sunday, August 8, 2004 PAAM, Fire of Spirit angel of the Tablet of Union, has been evoked to truly wondrous effect. It’s moments like these that make life worthwhile, which make existence justified. Once again, my inner being and the universe in which I live have been transformed. The vision began in darkness, with a red pentagram far off in the distance. Then, from behind me came a deep, gruff voice that said, “Ha! You have missed the angel. I am Satan and you have got me!”7 He popped out from behind me on my left side, all grizzled and black, a beastial human like figure. I instantly recognized him as an aspect of myself, having met this negative projection in other visions. "},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  217 I said to him, “I know you, Satan, and I’m not afraid.8 Come with me and partake with me of the blessing of the angel, PAAM, you, your servitors, and your servitors’ servitors, everyone. Let no one be left behind.” A great burst of all encompassing, impersonal love entered my heart and I knew then that this test had been passed successfully. The pentagram in the distance came to me then and entered my vision body, filling every nerve with its glorious supercosmic presence. My limbs were the lines of this great star of five. My entire being had been integrated into perfectly proportional beauty (beatitude). This supreme state of transcendence called an even greater supercosmic response as a milky white ray of pure light entered my head from infinitely high above me. Every atom, every spark, was imbued with pure and perfect love. The ecstasy became overwhelming as this milk from the ultimate transcendence pushed through every resistance to its flow through my every state and focus of consciousness. I withstood the joy and grace and drank in the love as much as possible with my all and each. A voice of beauty came to me and said, “Accept the Milk of the Stars and shine it to all the worlds.” I knew then that the Fire of Spirit angel, PAAM, was with me, bestowing on me his blessing and initiation. I bade all the worlds of which I am the nexus to receive the Milk of the Stars and transmit it throughout. I am the Gate connecting many worlds and I weave my consciousness with alternate realities. I am also the Gatekeeper, a personality that guides the workings of the Gate who I am.9 "},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"218  FRATER W.I.T. Suddenly, a great and thickly cloudy darkness erupted out of me, shooting far above my head. A deep and menacing voice said, “I am the darkness and evil that always accompanies the Light. I am its inescapable correlate. There is no Good where I am not.”10 I accepted and embraced the rising darkness and continued to drink in the descending light. A hexagram formed over me, made up of a white ascending triangle and a black descending triangle. These colors were opposite to the directions of the flow of forces focusing on my vision presence and so indicated a reversal of the original relationship. The highest and the lowest aspects of my psyche had melded to generate a new complexity of holographic connectivity. This new internal reality was expressed by yet another magical figure which had been permanently impressed into my aura, just like the red pentagram described above. I took an oath then to always bring together the worlds, good, evil, or indifferent, in perfect harmony, to bestow the blessing of the Milk of the Stars. Rejection of any kind was now contrary to my spirituality and my magical formula. The element of Fire has a dark, evil side that cannot be escaped. The principle of subconscious inversion of the meaning of symbols is clearly operative here. So many of the dream symbols reported in the annals of psychology represent the opposite of their obvious meaning. Often, the appearance of a little girl or a small man indicates the presence of the Higher Self. The ultimate truth behind such fusions of opposite meanings is beyond the rational mind and pertains to a metalevel of consciousness. Light and darkness, good and evil, love and hate, are all two sides of the same transcendent coin. This metalevel understanding uplifts one from the "},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  219 obsession with culture and sectarian attachment. Truth may be more directly apprehended. In this way may I, the Gate, project my Will to my surroundings to emerge higher order in accordance therewith. I remained in this beatific ecstasy for some time, experiencing the fullness of complete being. Then, I called upon PAAM to show himself and he appeared in the center of a giant black hexagram as a black upright tau cross.11 His dark bearded face was on the left side of the vertical bar. His expression was one of pure peace and fulfillment. From this, I understood that the force of creation was the force of evolution and the inspirer of spiritual enlightenment. It is magick in its purest form. Nothing else was revealed in this vision so I gave the angel license to depart, banished, and closed the magical temple in due form. Underlying all my ritual actions was the certitude that I remain the focus of and emanator to the worlds. Thus is the action of Fire in its most sublime form. EHNB – Spirit of Spirit Saturday, October 9, 2004 I have evoked EHNB, Spirit of Spirit angel of the Tablet of Union, to excellent effect, thus completing this second round of elemental Watchtower evocations and crowing five and a half years of Work. Now I have completed and fulfilled what was done only partially during the first round. More than this, all the lessons and processes initiated during my time with the magical orders have reached a climax in this achievement. The Path of the Enochian angels is realized. "},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"220  FRATER W.I.T. The vision began in total darkness, the black of passive Spirit. The bodiless voice of EHNB came rolling through the vision space, calling me forth, and proclaiming me as having fulfilled the evocation of the Watchtowers. He congratulated me for having come this far as I moved further into the vision. I beheld a dim light off in the distance and moved towards it, as it did towards me. It grew brighter as we drew closer and finally resolved into a blazing white rose of forty-nine petals. The angel bade me to sit in the center of it, as on a throne of angelic rulership. I did so and was surrounded by wavy petals that shimmered with the light of the ultimate eighth chakra. The background space of the vision began to lighten and before me appeared another white rose, but smaller and with fewer petals. It began to fall into and through itself, each white petal rolling along the inside and outside of the flower. Then, the head of the angel EHNB unfurled out of this complex circulation made of pure, white light. He declared that I was a Lord of the Angels of the elemental Watchtowers and so was in full command of all the entities therein, including the four Kings. I felt the power and control bestowed by this coronation. All the magical devices that had been impressed into my aura intensifed and resonated in perfect harmony. The Serpent Crown around my head vibrated with this energy. All the powers and contacts that had been developed throughout my Enochian magical Work, especially the nuclear blast intensity Key of the Superlative, came to focus in one all encompassing integration. The entire vision came to shine with brilliant white light. EHNB’s head began to spin, and it unfolded into a ten pointed star. He said, “Behold how the Ten is the entire universe but also merely the pendant and outcome of all before "},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  221 it. So let all be one as a whole and in every part thereof.”12 I felt my being expand throughout the inner cosmos of brilliance, as the whole and in every point therein, emerging in every scale of size and form. Angels big and small began appearing all over the place. The entire concourse of the Watchtowers was soon arrayed before me, from the great Kings to the tiniest servients.13 I gazed at their amassed wonder as I sat on my rose throne. “Declare your Word, oh Lord of the Angels, and bring forth your Will through these angels,” said EHNB, now having fully appeared, far larger even than the Kings to express his ultimate transcendent station. I declared my Word to be “Futiquity,” the simplest of ultimate expressions of what my intensions are in my life, to encourage the realization of the awesome futuristic potential revealed to humanity in this grand new age. I commanded the angels of my magical projections to unfold this Will in all the worlds of vision, to fulfill the new consciousness of the Aeon of Horus. The angels entered into complex whirling, spiraling movements to emerge my creative impulse in their reality. I felt the power of my authority over this concourse that I’d earned through my many angelic initiations, a vital part of any phenomenological magick. My Word echoed throughout the vision space, carried by my ubiquitous presence in every scale of size and form and yet transcendent to all. This was the metalevel of my magick, a perfect fulfillment of all my personal Work as well as everything achieved through the initiatory orders in which I’d participated. Ever increasing power coursed through my "},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"222  FRATER W.I.T. physical body from head to foot, flooding every nerve and cell in a torrent of passion. Kundalini flows downward when used for magical projection. I easily adjusted to this totality power and knew that I’d come as far in transformation as this regimen of magick could take me. The angelic power and initiation had been mastered. Now, I was at the controlling metalevel as a Lord of the Angels. My aura is fully charged, functioning, and integrated. I am ready to work confidently with the lesser Kerubic and Servient angels of the subquadrants of the elemental Watchtowers. Geoffrey James’ book, “The Enochian Magick of Dr. John Dee,” has clear instructions on how to do this work. Fully satisfied with the vision and the level of mastery achieved, I gave the concourse and EHNB license to depart. I closed the magical temple in a state of calm, controlled ecstasy, fully confident as a Lord of the Angels, and looking forward to practicing new Enochian systems of magick. "},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":" Chapter XIII IN CONCLUSION My journey through the Enochian Watchtowers is complete and yet there is so much more to do. The angelic superconscious projections have taken me through the heights and depths of my mind and unveiled the human collective consciousness. It proved to be the source of all human destinies and wisdom as well as the repository of all human experience and knowledge. Even this turned out to be but a gateway to a far greater reality beyond anything recognizable as human. The spiral staircase through the various cosmic states of being led me to what is outside space and time, a megaverse of supercosmic transcendence that is the source of all True Will. Now my psyche stands as a complex hyperdimensional gateway connecting the most impersonal realms to my immediate material awareness of life on earth. I feel the ecstatic infinitude of the continuity of existence every second, although this is usually in the background of my normal waking consciousness. I still feel pain and anguish when troublesome circumstances arise but underlying every emotional state is a background of pure joy, peace profound. "},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"224  FRATER W.I.T. The metalevel of evolution that is the hallmark of the new Aeon of Horus is a constant reality for me. The future holds much more exploration and realization along the transcendent Path. Thorough practice with the Enochian version of “Liber Samekh” promises to take me farther in psychic and metapsychic integration, extending the reach of my magical holoprojections ever further into the world of matter. Scores of angels in the subquadrants of the Watchtower tablets await summoning to give their particular blessings. The Bonorum Tablets of the Heptarchia promise to reveal the ultimate transcendence on a planetary level, far beyond the terrestrial elements. An even greater Work lay ahead in the thirty aethyrs that brought Aleister Crowley beyond the Abyss to his ultimate destiny. The joy of magick is in its unlimited vistas. Let all who Will engage this Path. It is the birthright of all the new children of the stars.

For example, the tablet of elemental Earth is divided into the Earth of Earth quadrant, the Air of Earth quadrant, the Water of Earth quadrant, and the Fire of Earth quadrant. These divisions are separated by a great cross consisting of one row of twelve squares and two columns of thirteen squares each. The angelic names of the six Seniors and the King are taken from this tablet wide cross while names of the various subelemental angels may be found in the four areas bordered by it. Within each quadrant there is a smaller cross of five squares by six. Four squares are to be found above the cross and sixteen below it. Overall, there are 188 angelic powers encoded on the tablets. The squares of each tablet are colored based on the elemental and subelemental attributions. The central great cross as well as the cross in each quadrant has the spirit colors of black on white. The other squares in the quadrants have the color of the element of the tablet for their background while the letters thereon have the color of the subelement.

One is to pronounce them as if they were English words and the other is to vibrate each letter of the names as a whole syllable. John Dee and various magicians such as the author of this book have used the former method, whereas those trained in the Golden Dawn system of magick have used the latter method. The suggested pronunciations given in the above tables use English language rules. Specifically, combinations of ‘A’ and ‘O’ are pronounced like ‘Aou,’ as in house. The ‘AI’ combination is pronounced like ‘Ahee,’ as in by. Generally, follow a consonant with the vowel that makes it sound appealing. The most important consideration is that these magical names flow comfortably and rhythmically for maximum dramatic effect during conjuration. The Enochian language is magical only to the point where it opens the psyche to its source in transcendent reality. "},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"238  FRATER W.I.T. PLACEMENT OF THE SIX PLANETARY SENIORS AND THE KING There are six Senior angels for each of the four elemental Watchtower tablets, totaling twenty-four in all. These names may be found on the tablets by tracing seven letters along the central Great Cross, made up of two columns and one row, as "},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  239 indicated in the above diagram. In addition to these angel names, there is the name of an elemental King for each tablet. Tracing a spiral around the central two squares of the Great Cross may derive these eight lettered magical words. Start with the fifth square from the left as the first letter. Trace one row up and one column to the right to get the second letter. Trace one column to the right for the third letter. Trace one row down and one column to the right for the fourth letter. Trace one row down and one column to the left for the fifth letter. Trace one column to the left for the sixth letter. Trace one row up for the seventh letter. Finally, trace one column to the right for the eighth letter. This spiraling motion indicates a force transcendent to the Seniors as well as all the other angels of the tablet. Like many other eight lettered magical words, the angelic names of the Kings of the Watchtowers generate a fundamental force of creation that underlies all elemental and planetary forces. Study the Masonic Royal Arch formula for a clear example of this concept. For the purposes of attributing planets to these angels, use Sol for the Kings.

Place a pedestal in the center of each wall, marking out the four quarters of existence. Each direction is infinite and reaches into a higher than physical world. The reaches of infinity focus on the central altar from the east, south, west, north, above, and below. Thus, the altar is the center of the universe, the point of balance from which any energy may be launched to cause any effect anywhere. Each pedestal marks the nature of its quarter, indicating the frequency of magical power emanating from that particular infinity. These four currents are symbolized by the four elements of classical Greek science: Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. Mark the nature of Air in the east by placing an emblem of that which rules the airy nature, such as the Angelic Air Tablet. Place a white votive candle in front of the tablet to light the darkling, mysterious abyss of the east. Place an emblem of the element itself with the candle, such as a hand fan or rose. Place the Angelic Spirit Tablet, called the Tablet of Union, in the far east raised above the other tablets. In the south, place the symbols of Fire: the Angelic Fire Tablet, a white votive, and a red lamp, red candle, or candle in a red holder. In the west, place the symbols of Water: the Angelic Water Tablet, a white votive, and a cup or bowl of pure water. In the north, place the symbols of Earth: the Angelic Earth Tablet, a white votive, and a plate of salt.

Thus, place the Air Dagger on the eastern side of the altar, place the Fire Wand on the southern side, place the Water Cup on the western side, and place the Earth Pentacle on the northern side. In the center, the center of All, place a flask of fragrant Oil, symbolizing the ubiquitous element of Spirit. Oil of cinnamon or Abramelin oil is appropriate. A favored Holy Book may be placed underneath the flask if desired.

COMMENTARY ON THE THELEMIC KEYWORD ANALYSIS The Keyword Analysis begins and ends each hexagram ritual as performed in the traditional Golden Dawn style. It is actually the complete formula of initiation into the Greater Mysteries, which involve operations of celestial magick such as hexagram invocations. By contrast, the Lesser Mysteries involve operations of terrestrial magick and are concerned with human personality, the physical mind and body. The Golden Dawn Neophyte Ritual is an example of an initiation into the Lesser Mysteries. Beyond the Greater Mysteries are the Grand Mysteries, which involve supercelestial levels of reality, beyond the stars, planets, and even creation itself. Initiation into the Grand Mysteries involves the crossing of the Abyss on the Tree of Life. The A:. A:. Grade of Master of the Temple is the rank of one who partakes of the Grand Mysteries. The processes of entry into the Greater Mysteries are typified in the Keyword Analysis by the translation of a special Word, representing the higher nature of human aspiration, into a magical formula which elevates consciousness to that intensity. The letters of the Word are associated with certain cosmic forces according to the system of correspondences used in the Qabalah. These concepts are then related to each letter of the magical formula, thus spelling it out and so declaring the nature of the Work of the Greater Mysteries. In essence, the Keyword Analysis equates one Word with another, to declare the ultimate truth that “Deus est Homo” (God is Man). The Keyword offered as a departure from the traditional Golden Dawn formula, which is inspired by Christianity, is H.E.R.U. This is the Egyptian name for what the Greeks "},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  265 called, Horus. This Word is appropriate for a Thelemic formula of initiation into the Greater Mysteries, Horus being the primary deity from which the Thelemic dispensation was received. It is hoped that this formula will help aspiring Thelemic magicians achieve the sublime level of Adept of the Mysteries and so become independent from older formulae based on ideals from previous aeons. The first translation of the formula is into Hebrew, as He-Yod-Resh-Vav. The correspondences given are of the Tarot cards to which these letters are attributed. So, using Aleister Crowley’s innovation of reassigning the letters of Trump IV and Trump XVII, The Star card is given to express the nature of He. The initiatory nature of this new Thelemic formula thus begins with Nuit, the Star Mother, the true ground of all existence, the undivided wholeness from which all being arises. A clarifying symbol may be derived by considering that the zodiacal sign Aquarius is attributed to the Star card. The planet Saturn rules this sign and is attributed to the Tarot card called The Universe. In the Thoth deck of Aleister Crowley, the similarity of attitude and position of the central feminine figure of these trumps is self evident and speaks volumes of the inner meaning behind this first stage of the Thelemic adept initiation formula. The Hermit card is given for Yod as emblem of Hadit, the Seed Father. Hadit is the natural correlate of Nuit, he being the ultimate infinitesimal to Her infinity. All expressions of existence begin with the first focusing of infinity onto a particular point. This is the seed and root of all phases of manifestation. "},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"266  FRATER W.I.T. A related symbol is the Tarot card called The Magus, to which the planet Mercury is attributed, this ruling the zodiacal sign Virgo, which is attributed to The Hermit card. The Thoth deck version of The Magus depicts the central figure in the state of ecstasy and so is relevant to the E of H.E.R.U. Further, the serpentine nature of Mercury as symbol of Kundalini directly relates to Hadit. Not only is the power of creative visualization indicated but also the very root energies underlying all being and becoming. The Sun card is given for Resh to express the nature of Ra Hoor Khuit, Crowned and Conquering Child, an active form of Heru. This God is the natural and inevitable product of Nuit and Hadit, just as the Sun is the product of the infinite energy potential of space and the interaction of myriad manifest particles. The Sun has always been a deific emblem, the giver of all life and light, the fit object of aspiration in the Mysteries throughout the world. It is the divine nature in every human psyche. Working in reverse of the method employed with the previous two cards, it may be understood that the sun is the planet ruling the zodiacal sign Leo, attributed to the Tarot card called Lust. The design of this card in the Thoth deck depicts the Thelemic deities Babalon and the Beast whereon she rides. These are expressions of Nuit and Hadit on a lower plane of existence and their conjoining at this level shows the lion-serpent guided by the feminine wisdom. The whole gestalt relates tellingly to the nature of the Crowned and Conquering Child, Ra Hoor Khuit. The Hierophant Card is given for Vav as the Prophet of the New Aeon, To Mega Therion. This is the human incarnation of "},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  267 God, Deity and Humanity conjoined. This ultimate magician delivers a message of cosmic import to the world, furthering the process of the deification of the species. The Seed Father, Yod, has extended itself into incarnation as Vav, the Prophet, as indicated by the shape of these letters. Ra Hoor Khuit resides in His rightly fitted temple that is the magician’s mind and body, with Hadit hidden in Him under the persona of Hoor Paar Kraat, the Babe in the Egg. See Chapter 2 of “Liber Al vel Legis,” verse forty-nine in particular, for more on these themes. It may be noted that the zodiacal sign Taurus is attributed to The Hierophant, which is ruled by the planet Venus. This, in turn, is attributed to the Tarot card called The Empress. This aspect of the final stage in the formula of Thelemic Adeptship shows a return to the Great Mother, but now pregnant with the seed of the All Father. The perfectly balanced nature of The Hierophant is clearly shown in this symbol. Moreover, verse sixteen of chapter two of “Liber Al vel Legis” declares that Hadit is The Empress and The Hierophant. Along with The Fool, these cards and their associated Hebrew letter/numbers express the mystery of Hadit as being 8 and 11, the serpent and that which lay beyond manifest existence. The Father is identified with the Son hereby. The whole formula can be seen as the process of incarnation of God in the psyche of the magician, so aptly symbolized by the hexagram of interlocking triangles. The descending triangle of inspiration is firmly united with the ascending triangle of aspiration. The fusion of above and below produces a beautifully symmetric synergy with the power to channel and manipulate the very source of life, star power. Thus, each magician may be their own Prophet, determining their own way "},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"268  FRATER W.I.T. through infinite space as the cosmic star that they truly are. No intermediary is needed. The Adept is free from blind adherence to other people’s dictates forever more. The entire formula is then identified with ABRAHADABRA, the initiatory formula given by Crowley for the New Aeon. This is a three part word of eleven letters by which some have crossed the Abyss to enter the Supernal nature beyond the stars. It also aptly expresses the nature of operations of the Greater Mysteries, having five A’s or pentagrams among six other letters. The five and the six are conjoined; the human and the divine are integrated. H.E.R.U. is ABRAHADABRA. The process of incarnation of Deity in Humanity in the Aeon of Horus is the discovery of the inmost nature of consciousness as manifest on all levels. The root of consciousness is the heart of all that was, is, and shall be. For one so realized, the signs of LVX become a declaration of royalty. The signs of the cross become the signs of the King, the true partakers of the spirit of Thelema, Will. The Mother is described as the ecstatic Whirling Star whose sign is the Swastika. The Father is exulted in through His movement as the Rising Serpent. The Child is proclaimed as the Triumphant One, for whom no circumstance can diminish. LVX is the Light of the King, the emanation of the consciousness of the Prophet of His or Her own Aeon, whose movements through the cosmos form a personal covenant with Deity. H.E.R.U. -> Nuit + Hadit + Ra Hoor Khuit -> ABRAHADABRA. The King is One who has mastered this formula. A comprehensive symbol for this idea is given in Chapter Three of “Liber Legis.” It is Heru Ra Ha, Lord of the "},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  269 New Aeon. This transcendent God includes Ra Hoor Kuit and Hoor Paar Kraat as One. The Solar-Serpentine essence is the epitome of Horus Aeon consciousness, encompassing the natures of both parents and their children. Introduced here is a composite symbol to illustrate this newly realized potential in human destiny. The idea takes after the Sphinx as comprehending the four elemental Kerubic animals in one being. These are the Lion, the Serpent or Man, the Bull, and the Eagle. Rather than land based animals, mythic birds are used for this symbol of the higher level of reality. The Phoenix is the bird of the Sun and Tiphareth, representing the mystical union with the essence of Pure Will. The Hawk is the bird of Mars and Geburah, representing the active fiery nature which is the basis of magical energy. The Eagle is the bird of Jupiter and Chesed as well as the highest expression of Mars. This represents that essence which transcends the duality of matter and mind. These three symbols may be fused into what is here called The Dragon. The head of the Hawk is united with the body of the Phoenix and the wings of the Eagle. It flies throughout all manifestation and its ground, is the heart of all action and Will, and partakes of the essence of the ultimate transcendence. Thus, each of the Adept grades is comprehended herein. The Solar-Phallic creative energy is united to the highest Father. ABRA - HAD - ABRA can be identified with the Great Dragon as follows. AB-RA means Father-Sun, the life giving energies which form the basis of the higher enlightenment, hence the Phoenix. HAD is Hadit, whose motion forms the serpent which spirals through all the dimensions of reality to enable Will to take shape in the world of action, hence the "},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"270  FRATER W.I.T. Hawk. ABRA = 204 = 34*6. 34 is the fourth great number of Jupiter and so the whole may be interpreted as the eagle conjoined with the sun, which is Lord and Father. Thus, the magician who becomes conformed to the composite nature of the Great Dragon is the Adept whose being reaches to the farthest limits and the nearest confines of existence. Such a King is a Master of magick, mysticism, and divinity. He Yod Resh Vav adds in Hebrew to 221 = 17*13. The Swastika, whose number is 17 by the Fylfot Cross of Golden Dawn symbolism, is a symbol of Kether and is the Whirling Star. This is the sign used for L in the LVX signs. 13 is the number of love and unity, another number of Kether. The stellar nature which forms all matter and energy is the undivided wholeness which is the basis of all consciousness. 221 = 200+20+1 -> Resh - Kaph - Aleph -> Sun - Jupiter - Air. The shape of Aleph is the Swastika, formed of 17 squares selected from a set of 25 squares which form the square of Mars. 2+2+1 = 5 -> Mars and Geburah and He. These numerical symbols echo the analysis of the Great Dragon.

Perform a general banishing ritual such as the Lesser Banishing Pentagram ritual, the Star Ruby, or this simple method. Face east. Draw a cross of light over your body from head to toe and right shoulder to left shoulder while vibrating the name “Aiwass,” or that of your Holy Guardian Angel if you know it.

Trace a third great circle around the room while turning your body 360 degrees. All three dimensions of space are covered in this way. Say, “I banish,” while tracing each circle. After this is done, raise your hands in the air and say, “I banish all discordant spirits from this place. I banish the Shells unto their abodes and habitations. This place is clean.” Clap your hands loudly to finish. 2. Perform the Lesser Invoking Pentagram ritual, drawing in as much of this energy as possible. 3.

Place a pedestal in the center of each wall, marking out the four quarters of existence. Each direction is infinite and reaches into a higher than physical world. The reaches of infinity focus on the central altar from the east, south, west, north, above, and below. Thus, the altar is the center of the universe, the point of balance from which any energy may be launched to cause any effect anywhere. Each pedestal marks the nature of its quarter, indicating the frequency of magical power emanating from that particular infinity. These four currents are symbolized by the four elements of classical Greek science: Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. Mark the nature of Air in the east by setting up the Angelic Air Tablet. Place a white votive candle in front of the tablet to light the darkling, mysterious abyss of the east. Place an emblem of the element itself with the candle, such as a hand fan or rose.

With a little experience with this type of work, it is possible to shift perspective so as to change the apparent size and shape of the vision body. Images are malleable to the Will since they directly express mood, belief, and intent. Metaphysical dynamics can also be embodied, showing a whole new set of dimensions to reality. Different states can interweave and superimpose. 3 The cosmic mind is like a vast ocean of possibility that remains dormant until focused by the impress of a higher Will which flows into, through, and out of the pure potential. This mind is like a bubble of likely possibility floating in an even greater ocean of nullity, where nothing is likely to occur. Anything beyond this bubble of potential is transcendent to it, including the source of the Will current. That which is the synergy of all things is the instigator thereof. The first three Tarot cards of the Major Arcana, The Fool, The Magus, and The High Priestess, reveal this mystery in detail.

There are many other systems of Enochian evocation besides the Watchtowers and the Heptarchia as well. 8 A magical method of using the sex force to accelerate the process of evolution is suggested by this passage. Many books on sex magick are available. 9 See “Liber XV: The Gnostic Mass” by Aleister Crowley for the significance of the Communion of Saints in a Thelemic religious context. 10 “There is the dove, and there is the serpent.

Many subsequent visions were incomplete because I failed to come to understand the nature of the King of the East at this point. No step along the Path of the Wise can be skipped or partially accomplished. It’s like trying to build a house on a weak foundation. 18 This turned out to be one of the worst mistakes of my magical career to this point. Although the King is an angel of an element, he is a direct projection of superconsciousness and so quite beyond anything I can recognize within my personal self. Clearly, ego issues were preventing me from attaining his full contact. This failure would hamper many subsequent visions in this round of Watchtower evocations and necessitate a second attempt at the entire course. 19 Sol is an image of Tiphareth and spiritual transcendence but it also represents the ego, self absorption. This self reinforcement was almost certainly part of the veil that was blinding my vision from the true King of the East rather than a presentiment of my H.G.A. Issues of authority were also involved in this thick veil, a sensitive ego sore spot. This would be a hard lesson to learn. 20 This idea is not as audacious and absurd as it might first appear. There is a longstanding tradition of spirit sex practice. The goal is to allow greater angelic influence into the soul of humanity and, in certain instances, to actually incarnate an angel in human form. See the works of Ida Craddock for more "},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"300  FRATER W.I.T. information on this topic. 21 It’s absurd that something as basic to human experience as religious worship should affect me so adversely, but this is the way I’ve always been. Even as a child, I’ve always understood that humanity is experiencing a new age of reason and personal awareness. The old religious paradigms are no longer considered absolute and so new paths of spirituality can be explored vigorously. I’m so engrossed in the new aeon that any return to old ways is a violence to my personal formula of life. My discovery of Thelema has fully justified every spiritual and sociological sentiment I’ve ever had. 22 The element of Water and the Hebrew letter Mem are attributed to this card. 23 This workshop was done after my initial evocations from the Watchtower of Water. So intense was my result that I thought it best to undergo this final preparation before continuing with such greater energy. 24 The Fylfot cross and the First Swirlings are symbols of Kether. Water Tablet – First Round 1 The concept of coherence as a holding together of the laws of nature to allow for matter and energy to evolve into living forms is key in all my Water angel visions. A profound understanding of the nature of potential and how it becomes "},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  301 realized in space and time developed through these superconscious contacts. 2 In “Liber Al vel Legis,” Ch. 1, v.59, Nuit calls her hair the trees of eternity. 3 Essentially, a process of becoming is being described for both time and space. There is the initial crossover from a state of pure potential to one of actuality. There is the emergence into full, actualized existence, and finally, the integration with the rest of cosmic reality. These concepts will be described in other ways as the Water angel visions progress. 4 Here is another reference to “Liber Al vel Legis,” this time from Ch. 1, v. 26. The sign of Nuit’s presence is the conscious of the continuity of existence. This angel was signifying Nuit in a palpable, communicative form. 5 It is also possible that I somehow telepathically communicated my transcendent states of consciousness to my magical partner. She could have been sensitive to the magical projections I emanated in performing the evocation ceremony. This suggests that the value of the initiator is far greater than that of any magical system in bestowing new consciousness. 6 Mars is connected by Qabalistic attribution to Yesod, the ninth Sephirah, the center of human sexual and hereditary power. The Hebrew letter of Mars is Pe, whose numerical value is 80. Yesod, ISOD, enumerates to 80. It means foundation and also Yod SOD, the secret of the Yod or seed of creation.

In English, EBELIJAH = 52 = 13 * 4 = 26 * 2. 48 is associated with Mercury and Hod, while 52 is associated with Tiphareth. The hexagram is implied. 8 See the works of Dr. John Lilly for more information about the mind as conceived of as a great biocomputer with constructive and destructive psychic behaviors and imprinted programs. 9 None of this makes any logical sense, which is appropriate to a state of consciousness that transcends the intellectual faculty. Words must fail to convey the true meaning of what is experienced and understood at this level. 10 See various alchemical books for images of alchemists being cooked in bottles and other vessels. 11 Once again, I was foolish in ignoring the worthwhile warning given me by an angel. My obstinacy would prove self defeating in the long run. The angels need to be given more respect than this. 12 This intensity of evocation wasn’t realized until I began the Fire angel work. Touching such inspiring and extreme transcendence increased my overall ability to ceremonially project my magical energy, even with the most material of spirits. It is intriguing that my magical partner was able to perceive this same level of intensity, providing her with a real initiation and acceleration of her own Work.

Many such healings are necessary to fully break up an ingrained personality trait like this. 15 It’s intriguing that her gushing flow of blood was an interdimensional principle like my watery currents. Our parallel experiences speak much about the objective nature of these evocations. 16 It was difficult for me to listen to this message since I’ve always been pessimistic about romantic relationships. The peace of mind brought me by a life of confirmed bachelorhood has been a boon to my magical career. Fully focused on my life’s Work, I can operate in a direct, uninterrupted manner. I was surprised by the angel’s suggestion that I might be better off involved in a loving romantic relationship.

Great transformations may be achieved by this life action, copying the development of life itself. 2 This life changing event occurred during a continuous meditation I was doing as part of a training program given by a magical order inspired by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Of course, it espoused Thelema rather than Christianity. The object of the meditation was not to raise the Kundalini but to promote a sense of unity among the moment-by-moment sensations and experiences of life. The thought that triggered the lightning bolt that charged up my spine was, “It is good to be human.” 3 See Appendix for the Thelemic Keyword Analysis and LVX Signs to find descriptions and related symbols of these ideas. 4 What is being described here is a process of dimensional unfoldment. Space, time, and the matter and energy that exist therein, emerge out of cosmic potential as a process of ever expanding complex relationships. The most basic pattern of this process is the spiral. It weaves the tapestry of reality against which it extends from dimension to dimension. An inversion and a duplication take place with each transition. The universe and individuated consciousness emerge as higher levels of order in this way. 5 None of this appeared to my physical sense of sight but rather a sense of tangibility and presence was had, as if a new dimension expanded from nothingness to surround and interpenetrate my mind and body. This added space was right "},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  305 next to me, within me, and reached to the furthest distance. My magical tracings appeared and had presence in this confected fourth dimension. Tablet of Union – First Round 1 These preliminaries to my temple ceremonial have proven extremely useful for promoting results. Any great magical effort needs considerable development on the astral and etheric planes. Even if this is merely an ornate mental exercise, it is helpful to have all the levels of being involved in order to channel the innermost psychic power to physical or quasiphysical manifestation. Consult the works of Israel Regardie for details regarding the Middle Pillar Exercise. Students of Crowley may notice that he never mentioned this useful ritual. This is because Regardie invented the MPE. 2 The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is a standard Golden Dawn style space cleansing ritual to start off more complex ceremonial actions. It is also a useful exercise by itself for the beginner in magick. 3 See any book on Golden Dawn or A.A. magick for details on how to perform the LBRP. It consists of four main parts: the Qabalistic Cross, the drawing of pentagrams in the air along with vibration of divine names, a general angelic invocation, and a final Qabalistic Cross.

A fundemental metaphysics was being conveyed to me and developed slowly as my progress through the Enochian system continued. 5 This angel was representing the presence of higher dimensions in physical space and time, that ubiquitous, connective, transcendent principle that lay at the heart of all life and intelligence. 6 In Hebrew Qabalah, Ralpern = RLPRN = 560 = 7 * 8 * 10 = 28 * 20 => Netzach and Jupiter; reduces to 2. 560 is the total of a Greek word meaning wizard and Hebrew words meaning sorceress and dragons. Ralpern is clearly a very magical entity whose formula resembles my own. I should conjure him directly. Air Tablet – Second Round 1 Nonlocality is a concept from quantum mechanics. Two subatomic particles are said to be in nonlocal contact, entangled, when what happens to one particle instantaneously affects the other particle, no matter how far away it may be. The information travels faster than the speed of light, so the agency of connection must be somehow metaphysical. All changes in the quantum realm are discrete, jumping from one state to another without passing through any in between states. Thus, the appearance of smoothness on the human, macroscopic level of existence is an illusion, an averaging of "},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  307 myriad tiny discrete states. As previous visions have revealed, reality is a web of interaction and not a plenum. It is interesting that what is revealed by one state/element gets changed by another. 2 Refer to Wilhelm Reich’s description of the function and process of the orgasm for an organic parallel to this idea. 3 See “The Function of the Orgasm,” by Wilhelm Reich for a broad discussion of the significance of the function and patterns of sexual activity. 4 “Liber Legis” condemns virginity as a lying specter of the ages, dark and poisonous. This is an excellent expression of what happens to the psyche when sexual abstinence is imposed and enforced through fear and intimidation. No purity of mind and soul can come from such tyranny. Quite the reverse happens as obsession with the forbidden subject leads to unhealthy perversions and layer after layer of destructive neuroses. The spiritual transcendence of real purity can only come from a willing participation in abstinence, usually only for a limited period of time. The mind and body have needs which must be fulfilled for the maintenance of their health. Denial of any of these leads to nothing but destruction. The lying specter of the ages is the withered soul devastated by patristic societal cruelty. No holiness can come from such an ideal. 5 The throat chakra is considered to be the seat of Venus. 6 I consider this experiment in sexual magick to be a failure. "},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"308  FRATER W.I.T. This formula is just not appropriate for this entity. My operation was improperly performed and the results were of a debased nature. Only the innate love of the Venusian nature kept me from descending into a completely perverse state of mind. This contact does not at all qualify as having evoked the Venus Senior of Air again, as instructed. I would need time to recover from this before my next attempt. 7 This shift in form might have been a lingering imbalance resulting from my application of the Luna formula to the Venus spirit. My relationship with this principle needed perfecting, as the ensuing visionary experience would show. 8 This is an outstanding example of self reference and self recursion, the core pattern that develops complexity and self similarity with the cosmos as a whole. 9 The transformation I underwent in shifting to the metalevel image took place primarily on a subconscious level, beyond what words can express. Much time and experience is usually needed to encounter and sort out these types of deep changes. A seed is planted deep within the psyche and then grows in darkness until the flowering reaches the light of day consciousness. For the most part, the ego is just along for the ride. 10 With this type of overly Yang attitude, it’s no wonder I have so much difficulty understanding spirits of Venus. This entire vision is loaded down with testosterone, quite the opposite of this angel’s formula. While I gained an invaluable initiation and contact with a transcendent principle, this wasn’t my "},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  309 original intent. Once again, I failed to endure the Senior’s initiation. 11 See any number of books, including some physics books, to learn about theories of cocreation. The individual is as much a determining factor of how the universe came about as natural forces. 12 Here is a parable not only of the nature of death in general but of the attainment of immortality through identification with a sun god who is sacrificed. 13 I decided to evoke this Senior again, since I’d reached so much higher a level of astral and transcendent contact with the Luna and Venus Seniors of Air. This turned out to be a great idea. 14 The pace I’d set for these evocations was clearly far too fast for my own good. My zeal for the Work had become overdone. The result of too much magick too soon is uncontrolled rising of unconscious contents. Much stress and anxiety follow until adjustment is made over time. Also, important details get lost in the confusion of so many lessons and energies. Eventually, the necessity of slowing down becomes overwhelming. To ignore the warning signs is to invite disaster. 15 This is a paraphrase of the first sentence of verse 2 of chapter 2 of “Liber Legis.” The vision to come was to involve that aspect of Mercury dealing with the use of language to express high wisdom.

The interchange of symbolism between Sol and Mercury in its higher sense is prevalent in western occultism. This identification further stresses the nature of Mercury being depicted in vision. The fusion of magick as language manipulation and the core human emanative nature is central to all attempts to master the self and nature through the use of subtle forces. 17 These tablets suggest that the elements were enlightened and integrated by the All-Source. The allusion to the Enochian tablets, but with Sanskrit-like lettering indicates a magical cultural fusion of east and west, furthering the theme of fusion of opposite natures in the truth of Mercury. 18 It often takes time for a radical transformation of the whole being to register to self consciousness. The barriers separating self consciousness and the subconscious serve to shield the delicate ego from this kind of extreme upheaval. Eventually, the psychic hyperactivity reaches the little self but somewhat buffered from the raw impact experienced by the wholeness of Self. This is not always enough to avoid being overwhelmed or prevent the fall into obsession. Extensive preliminary training in a magical regimen and/or psychotherapy can be very useful in strengthening the individual to withstand these kinds of subconscious onslaughts. 19 See “Wholeness and the Implicate Order,” by David Bohm for a detailed explanation of this term. 20 According to the tropical system of astrology, my birth sign "},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  311 is Pisces and Saturn appears there in my birth chart. However, according to the sidereal system of astrology, my birth sign is Aquarius and Saturn is also located there. It is worth noting that indigo is the color of Capricorn, ruled by Saturn, and that both this sign and Pisces border Aquarius in the zodiac. Overall, my nativity is indicated. 21 It is ironic that the angel of the planet of death and the ending of things should preside over the birth of my higher self in this manner. An impersonal nature had come about, to be sure, which is in line with Saturn, but the demeanor of the baby was anything but Saturnian. It may be significant here that Jupiter rules Pisces. The antithetical playoff of Saturn and Jupiter played a large part in this vision. 22 In my Sahasrara chakra. 23 The nature of this baby involves a life/death interchange, being a symbol of new life, and yet a guide into my deep subconscious, very like a guide of the dead. Qabalistically, he connected the chakras representing Kether, Tiphareth, and Yesod, the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life above Malkuth. This new power was circulated throughout my aura by a method related to the Rousing of the Citadels ritual. My aura had extended to a life within, beyond the death of the body. 24 The literature of occultism from around the world is replete with descriptions of high mountains and deep vaults where the gods live and where those found worthy are taken for initiation into the Mysteries. In the Western Mystery Tradition, the mountain of initiation is called Mount Abiegnus, described as a "},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"312  FRATER W.I.T. mountain of caverns. The paradox of being high above the earth and yet underground is significant here, a metaphor for the unconscious and for mystery in general. 25 I believe the psychopompic baby that was hatched out of me by the Saturn Senior of Air is the guide inculcated by this lecture. All along, the Seniors have been preparing me for this grand initiation. As for swearing to keep secret these mysteries, it is the incommunicable secrets bestowed by these officers that are to be kept hidden and not the details of their lectures. 26 See appendix for a description of my temple setup. 27 My temple setup for this evocation was the same as all the others. I forgot to employ the intended changes to more closely simulate an Adept temple. As it turned out, it was just as well. Sometimes, mistakes carry real intention. 28 It is important for the reader to understand that this vision didn’t give me authority over any established group or even the authority to found my own order. This initiation was all about establishing certain connections within my own being and with the human collective consciousness, which lay at the heart of everyone’s subconscious. 29 Here is chaotic induction at its most profound, developing the greatest emergent order. See “Chaos,” by James Gleick for a thorough and readable description of chaotic induction and its significance for natural processes, such as life and consciousness.

I passed through fields of size as well as dimension until I reached the scale of the human incarnate. Water Tablet – Second Round 1 These states appeared in vision as geometric shapes of multicolored light extending through the unlimited number of partial dimensions between the familiar three of space. They were like facets of a hyperdimensional jewel with no surface, only internal complexities. The reader may compare this description with Aleister Crowley’s starsponge vision. 2 The four worlds of the Qabalah are Atziluth, the state of pure Godhead; Briah, the consciousness of pure archetypes; Yetzirah, the world of specific images expressing the archetypes; and Assiah, the material world. Any image can be said to be Yetziratic but it is possible for such visualizations to conduct the consciousness of Briah or even Atziluth, the most transcendent World of Qabalah. A vision of Briah is significantly beyond anything possible in Yetzirah. Such an experience is a true breakthrough beyond the world of mere images, pieces of a greater whole. 3 Consult the works of alchemy to study the doctrine of natural "},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"314  FRATER W.I.T. signatures and correspondences in relation to this passage. Also consult popular expositions of modern physics, such as “Quantum Reality” by Nick Herbert, to study the concept of quantum entanglement in this regard. It is compelling to note how the most modern theories of physics explain magical and mystical phenomena so clearly. Somehow, consciousness is a principle that can control quantum randomness and establish entanglement between entities by an act of Will. Archetypes are the conduits through which the mind may project its energies to link disparate events in space and time. 4 The tapestry of interconnection between and among all objects in existence can be construed as intrinsic meaning, a meaning apart from any human value. This is the language of the living universe in which all incarnate beings live. See “Godel Escher Bach,” by Douglas Hofstadter for more information. 5 Contemplate the triangular geometry of each part of the Tree of Life to study the concept of source (equilibrium), emanation (force), and manifestation (form). 6 Consult the Royal Arch formula of Freemasonry for more information regarding the discovery of the hidden fourth transcendent principle within the three. 7 This book is part of the “Magnum Opus Hermetic Sourceworks” series by Adam McLean. 8 The eagle is the bird of Jupiter as well as the highest of the three animals attributed to Mars. The scorpion, representing "},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  315 the fear of Mars, symbolizes the lowest form. The serpent, representing the severity of Mars, symbolizes the middle nature. The highflying eagle symbolizes the most sublime aspect of Mars, representing divine justice. This merges with the benevolent nature of Jupiter. 9 This is the lesson taught in many Water angel visions. The oneness described, however, is not the unity of the One God over everything else but rather the nature of the homogeneous wholeness that is the truth underlying all appearance of multiplicity. The Truth is in wholeness, not in some imagined aloof overlord or a set of mathematical equations that model the apparent movements of things. 10 Letting go of the personal sense of separation from the rest of the universe involves a surrender of identification with temporal circumstance and attachment. This surrender reaches to the very depths of the psyche. The Path of the Wise is trodden as layer after layer of personal attachment is dissolved in this transmutation. Many initiations are needed to bring this process to the crisis point that can yield real success, if madness is avoided. The feeling of loss and dissolution is worse than any expectated gain. Much of this happens in subconsciousness but the echoes of this turmoil are very much felt by personal awareness. Yet, perseverance is worthwhile since adjustment is eventually achieved and the rewards are wonderful beyond words. 11 According to alchemy, the fixed must be made volatile and the volatile must be made fixed to confect the Philosopher’s Stone.

Fire Tablet – Second Round 1 This scene reminds me of what I’ve read regarding the zero point energy, the underlying activity of the vacuum of the cosmos. Particles and antiparticles are constantly emerging out of nothing and then coming together again to mutually annihilate each other and so return to nothingness. This activity occurs so quickly that it doesn’t directly affect material processes, except on the subatomic level. Modern cosmological theory states that our cosmos began as just such a vacuum fluctuation that grew far beyond its norm. Some believe that consciousness itself derives from this zero point energy. 2 See “The Mathematical Tourist,” by Ivars Peterson and “The Beauty of Fractals,” by H. O. Peitgen and P. H. Richter for more information on the mathematical device known as fractals. 3 See “Shadows of the Mind,” by Roger Penrose for more information on quantum coherence fields and their relevance to the phenomenon of consciousness. I speculate that the human aura is a quantum coherence field that emerges not just from the action of the nerves and brain but also from the emergent chemical processes of every cell of the body. Vast is the hierarchy of emergent order that develops human consciousness. 4 Aleister Crowley reformulated the Order of the Golden Dawn after it split apart into what he called, The Astrum Argentum or Order of the Silver Star. "},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  317 5 In the initiatory system of the Aurum Solis, an order comparable to the Golden Dawn, the First Hall consists of the grades attributed to introduction, Malkuth, and Yesod. The Second Hall covers the grades of Hod, Netzach, and the Portal just outside Tiphareth. The Third Hall leads to the Adeptship of Tiphareth and beyond. To move from one hall to another is to make a quantum leap forward in consciousness, wisdom, and power. In these initiatory angelic evocations, it sometimes feels like the Luna, Mercury, and Venus angels cover one hall, the Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn angels cover the next hall of the element, and the King reveals the next, ultimate hall of the tablet. 6 The question arises as to just how consciousness interacts with physical reality and what enhanced states of mind can do this. Some physicists believe that the touch of human awareness determines the outcome of quantum experiments, called the collapsing of the wave function. Others believe that consciousness itself is an intrinsic part of reality and that the mind and body are conduits through which it flows. The angels of the Watchtowers have taught me about the cocreative nature of the relationship between the human mind and the environment experienced by it. If normal waking awareness can determine at least some aspect of apparently objective reality, it follows that supercharged hypermind can enable radical shifts in the normal course of events. It seems that in this vision, the universe, or some aspect thereof, became much more complex. The possibility of truly magical effects seems justified in this view. If, as Einstein asserted, the fate of the universe depends on its geometry, then the presence of evolved consciousness must have profound implications for the "},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"318  FRATER W.I.T. conclusions of cosmology. 7 The appearance of contradictory concepts occurs frequently in the more intense trances. Aleister Crowley wrote that in Supernal consciousness, the states of bycoming above the Abyss on the Tree of Life, nothing is true except by virtue of the contradiction included in itself. Timothy Leary’s eighth and highest neural circuit in his model of the evolution of consciousness is called quantum-gravitational, suggesting a fusion of the ultra small with the ultra large. Somehow or other, the tiniest known particles are one with waves of cosmic scope. Physicists refer to this property as nonlocality. 8 Evidently, I was not yet ready to fully partake of the marvelous source of the Mars Senior of Fire. This whole adventure in the dry mist was a veil thrown up around me to prevent too great a shock from the new emergence of consciousness revealed to me through contact with this great angel. The fairy tale vision to come served to gradually initiate me into the real meaning of the ultimate transcendence of Fire. 9 I encountered this supreme expression of primitive libido a few more times in my dreams after this vision. It appeared as a beautiful, young woman in the last one. We spoke for a short time but such was the emanation of raw force from her that I soon fled in terror, awakening after that. My meditations and trances became more effective and intense after that dream, as if this energy had finally been incorporated into my personal consciousness. This nuclear blast energy manifestation never appeared in my dreams again.

Typically, it is depicted as nailed to a cross but is blooming into life thereon. The cross is of yellow gold and the rose is ruby red, indicating a complete devotion of the passions to achieving the perfection of the alchemical Great Work. In this vision, a union of natures has occurred in the sunny golden rose. The desire nature has been completely subsumed into the radiant spiritual transcendence. 11 Psychologists have written a great deal about the archetypal image known as the solar-phallus. It has been identified with the pure libido as well as the supreme divine creative energy. It expresses a perfected vision of self, even a transcendence of the human condition. The Rosy Cross of the Western Mystery Tradition is a thin veil for this bold image of the truth of sex, human life and death, and spiritual transcendence. The root of all psychic energy and cosmic contact is expressed herein. In becoming a living embodiment of this archetype throughout the in between, partially expanded dimensions, I’d realized the goal of human religious and spiritual aspiration. 12 In retrospect, I believe that the reason why so much anxiety was generated along with these profound and transcendent states of ecstasy was that my subconsciousness interpreted them as a type of death. The fits of anxiety were brought on by simple fear of death. I am reminded of the frequently mentioned connections between sex, death, and religion in much of the occult literature. Many of the sects of eastern Tantra deal with these archetypes. Some commentators and scholars believe that sex is at the core of the meaning of all "},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"320  FRATER W.I.T. religion. If so, then what was sex a veil for? In some cultures, the orgasm is called the little death. What sex, death, and religion have in common is a transcendence of spiritual state. The sense of self is taken away from its normal context and brought to a state of high intensity dimensional connectivity, far beyond the usual context of space and time. The inherent identification of such experiences with death, the final transcendence away from normal body consciousness, yields great fear. It’s no wonder that so many people have an instinctual fear of all things occult. As with all fear, the only way to conquer it is to face it. 13 According to Hindu lore, there are three Gunas or qualities, tendencies. They are called Tamas or inertia, Rajas or energy, and Sattva or harmony. The corresponding alchemical elements are Salt, Sulfur, and Mercury, respectively. These energy types are said to be constantly revolving in a cycle, one reaching a fullness of expression and then giving way to another. A similar concept in Chinese mysticism is the wheel of Yin and Yang, two elements instead of three. Thus is the continuing emergence of order followed by the dissolution of its material components. Perhaps this cycle is actually a spiral, allowing for new and more complex expressions of emergent order as older ones dissolve and disappear from physicality. This would explain the process of evolution and how the collective consciousness of species develops. It may be that something of our individualities are preserved in the transcendence after death. A cosmic individual existence could develop after enough lives are lived. 14 In this vision, I played the part of Hadit, the simple, single "},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  321 focus of being, despite the complex unfoldment of my full Self. Nuit knows ever the simple and continuous reality that all things are, no matter how complex and emergent they may be. 15 Brass has been traditionally associated with copper and so both of these metals are attributed to Venus. 16 This fusion of symbols of Sol, Venus, and Mars expresses profound teachings of sexual magick. The highpoint of magical sexual union is when the Deity invoked becomes a third partner in the activity. In this vision, I am as Hadit mating with Nuit to project a manifestation of transcendence, our creator and the product of our love. 17 In the 1940s, the greatest mathematician of our age, Kurt Godel, discovered solutions to the equations of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity which showed that time is not an intrinsic aspect of reality. It is rather a construction of the mind to make sense of the experiences of human perception and interaction in the world of matter and energy. Time is a great psychic projection onto a holographic reality in which all times, places, and possibilities exist together at each point. The point perspective of normal human consciousness determines which of the myriad threads of occurrence are encountered and related to other such experiences. Sufficient transcendence of consciousness will break the barriers of ordinary time limitation imposed by the normal psychic structure. The psyche will reach a state of reality wherein all paths of evolution are interwoven and interconnected. Then, it takes only an act of Will to go from one time and place to another.

I had just left work and was undoing the lock on my bicycle to ride home when suddenly I beheld in my mind a great hawk of brilliant blue fire, impossibly far off. It called to me in an extremely high pitched caw and then disappeared as if it had never been. This was in my college days, before I practiced any magick or been initiated into any order. Nothing I’d read up to that point in my occult books could explain this kind of revelation. For seventeen years, I remained in wonderment as to the nature of this event. Now, in the greatest magical moment of my life, the mystery was revealed. The Nighthawk was the great King of the South and Fire, my single greatest magical projection. It had reached back in time seventeen years to reveal itself and bring about its own revelation in a supreme trance. Indeed, my entire life is involved in a time paradox, inspired from the beginning by some far future emergence of power and transcendence beyond imagination. This may be the moment of my own death. 19 I still have no idea why this revelation had reached back to that ordinary moment in 1986. Nothing unusual was going on at the time. My only thought on this matter is that I was twenty-one years old at the time. Perhaps, I’d reached a certain psychic and spiritual maturity at that moment which naturally provided a link to another high point in my life, the apex of my Enochian Watchtower evocation working. Much goes on in the unconscious that never reaches waking consciousness. Some future revelation may yet shed light on this matter. 20 I have reason to believe that the aura reaches not only every "},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  323 expression of mind and nerve but also the life of every cell in the body. Every least life process contributes to the overall emergence field that is the aura. Communing with the totality of one’s incarnation, a complete microcosm, feels like a uniting with that cosmic transcendence in which every object, energy, and event exists as one, as well as individually, throughout the time of their evolution. 21 In becoming one with the totality of my being and becoming, I’d reached to the state where the microcosm unites with the macrocosm in holographic interconnection. This awesome vision gave me profound perception but no power over anything. It was a beatific, transcendental trance but was merely an initiation, an introduction to the metalevel of life in the universe. So much more needs to be done to fulfill the great possibilities suggested by this revelation. Tablet of Union – Second Round 1 Readers interested in quantum physics are recommended to study gauge theory in relation to this passage. 2 Yellow is the King scale color of the Sephirah Malkuth. This vision depicts the wholeness of Malkuth as well as its various parts from a perspective outside of it, its metalevel. The yellow color at this level indicates the earthy expression of Spirit, the full unfoldment of the core creative pattern in all the scales of physical reality. Everything projects and expands from this prime archetype, which is the synergy of that all. The arrow of thought leads toward matter.

They are like sinkholes where energy is lost, but not due to gravity like in black holes. This anticosmos focuses to a point but then order is lost as is the ubiquitous energy of the background space. Emergence/submergence is the interaction between the two universes. 4 Evidently, the process of submergence became reversed and the ubiquitous tendency to energy increase expanded to the point of explosiveness. The fusion of opposites expressed by the union of myself and my projection, this flipside reality, completed a circuit that allowed outflowing light to return. The energy balance of all nature, was radically altered in this way. The whole situation is a wonderful metaphor for transpersonal mutation and is indicative of an integration with a deep level of the unconscious. 5 Orange and yellow are the planetary colors of Sol and Mercury, respectively, and indicate expressions of the higher life power that emerges from an attuned psyche. 6 God does not exist until you invent Him or Her and bring Him or Her into your life. 7 The symbolism of the behind direction indicates the subconscious in a contrarian sense. The deepest parts of my psyche had responded to the supreme light of the Fire of Spirit angel. 8 Dark and disturbing images in vision are always expressions "},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"ENOCHIAN INITIATION  325 of some deepseated fear. Facing the image stalwartly serves to dissolve the fear phantasm and helps to overcome the subconscious fear directly. Doing this with an archetypal image of terror can only help to heal the species of its collective disturbance. 9 It is worth noting that the individuality who was expressing his nature in this passage is far beyond my earthly identity, an impersonal Self that serves a cosmic scale function that is only remotely connected with mundane human existence. 10 As before noted, every light casts a shadow and the brighter the light, the darker the shadow. The ultimate Light of the Milk of the Stars which fills the microcosm in which I exist had provoked this unavoidable response, just as the four Princes of the Evil of the World immediately attend the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The only sane, rational way to deal with this dualistic situation is as recorded in this vision. 11 A tau cross looks like an English capital ‘T.’ The symbol of the hexagram with a central tau is used in Royal Arch Freemasonry to represent the sudden impulse that created the universe. In the Qabalah, the Lightning Flash that created the Ten Sephiroth of the Tree of Life symbolizes this idea. The great serpent coiling up the Tree from Malkuth to Kether forms the 22 Paths and represents the rising Kundalini which carries the mystic as in a chariot along the Path of Return. 12 This is a clear reference to the tenth Sephirah, Malkuth, and suggests the sublime mystery, “Kether is in Malkuth and "},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"326  FRATER W.I.T.
