Severalgood book-length studies of him have appeared,1 as well as numerous articles.2 My intent inpresenting this text is not to recap Dee’s life or present a new perspective, but to fill in an importantgap that has been generally neglected. The manuscript presented adds considerable detail for theyears 1581–1583, by most accounts the climax of his career. It sheds light on Dee’s politics, science,and occultism.For the first edition of this text, I had the simple goal of eliminating two major barriers to the studyof John Dee and Edward Kelley. These barriers are availability and legibility of the material. Withthis new edition, I hope to address two other problems as well. First, the English of Dee’s day wassomewhat different from that spoken today, so I have added many footnotes to clarify obscurities inthe language. I have also translated the frequent Latin passages. Second, the subject matter of the text,medieval and Renaissance magic, assumes a view of the universe not commonly held today. Tofurther clarify the text in this context, I have expanded the introduction and index and explainedotherwise obscure references in the footnotes. I have also added supplementary material from Dee’sdiary and other manuscripts. J.

They were discovered in a hidden compartmentof an old chest along with various magical implements. Although the angels made him swear never toreveal these doctrines to anyone not sanctioned by them, he complained, “If no man, by no means,shall perceive anything hereof by me, I would think that I should not do well.” Nevertheless, thesepages were carefully concealed, and nearly lost forever. Although this present work is concernedprimarily with his occult experiments, through it, we catch many glimpses of Elizabethan life andpolitics.Dr. Dee represents the true Renaissance man—a master of many areas of learning. He was born in1527 and lived at the height of the English Renaissance. Dee’s knowledge included astronomy,mathematics, navigation, medicine, geography, history, music, painting, astrology, and the occultsciences.In many ways, Dee lived at the center of conflicting forces and ideas—tradition vs. reformation,science vs. magic, Christianity vs. paganism (that is, Judaism, Hermeticism, and even studies ofArabic traditions). By studying Dee, we can gain insight into all these subjects and into theRenaissance as a whole. We can even throw light on our own struggle to reconcile our own conflicts.3Dee had many famous and powerful friends and was heavily involved in politics. He becamescientific advisor and astrologer to Queen Elizabeth, who occasionally visited him at his home atMortlake. He was instrumental in planning the expansion of the British Empire, exploring the NewWorld, and, with the help of angelic agents, ushering in the new age as well. One of the mainobjectives of his life’s work was to bring about religious and social reform. It has been suggested4that in this endeavor he was, to some extent, successful.Dee began his “mystical experiments” with a solid foundation in medieval and Renaissancescience, magic, Kabbalah, and the Hermetic arts. Further mysteries were revealed by the “angels”who manifested themselves, ultimately resulting in a new, unified occult system.5 This occult systemis perhaps closer to a face-lift than a new system. Most of it would have been familiar to occultists ofthe day, but with a veneer of new names and symbols.Aside from the mechanical details of Dee’s system for communicating with angels, these recordsreveal that the angels were interested in and involved with the exploration and colonization of theNew World, and in heralding in a new age or new world order. The one aspect of these writings thathas fascinated most, however, is that the angels delivered a complete book in an otherwise unknownlanguage. They claimed this book, named Loagaeth, to be of utmost importance. Its language is thetrue language of creation so sought after by Kabbalists and by Dee himself.6 This “angelic book” waslater used to extract a long series of messages (or “calls”) in yet another unknown language, calledEnochian.Interest in John Dee and his occult activities has increased tremendously in recent years. Onereason for this is the growing debate over the importance of Dee’s role in history by such eminentscholars as Francis Yates,7 Wayne Shumaker, and, more recently, William Sherman. Another reasonfor Dee’s popularity is undoubtedly the fact that his system was used and adapted by the Hermetic"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Order of the Golden Dawn, and, subsequently, by Aleister Crowley. If one examines the GoldenDawn material, its appeal soon becomes clear: It draws together various occult methods into a highlycoherent system. In adapting Dee’s system, various additions, omissions, and mistakes were made.This departure was compounded by uncritical, although imaginative, treatments of the Golden Dawnand Crowley material by some authors. The net result is a maze of misinformation.8 The materialpresented here provides us with the keys necessary for understanding Dee’s original system as awhole. Since its previous editions were very limited in availability,9 it has largely been ignored, inspite of its importance.Dee studies have created two radically different pictures of Dee—one as Magus, and the other asscientist-politician. I hope this volume will help bridge the gap. This polarization is partly caused bythe lack of availability of Dee’s writings. Those interested only in the occult have largely ignoredDee’s published output, and those who focus on his published output will find very little evidence ofoccult influences. Placing the focus on Dee’s public writings, however, can give the modern readerthe mistaken impression that occultism was not central to his thinking. This is simply because, inDee’s day, the occult was a dangerous pastime, placing you at risk, not just from hostile spirits, butfrom the frightened public. We would do well to keep in mind the fate of the less cautious magusGiordano Bruno, who was burned alive at the stake by the Inquisition only a few years after Deerecorded these accounts. Dee’s childhood idols, Roger Bacon, Trithemius, Agrippa, Paracelsus, andothers, all had suffered greatly because of their reputations as magi. Dee himself was imprisonedearly in life, an experience he was careful to avoid thereafter. His thoughts and motivations, however,centered around his “mystical experiments.” In addition, there is an “anti-manuscript” bias toovercome. Although many of Dee’s books were widely circulated, they were not intended forpublication, but rather were “directed inward, to an extremely restricted circle” for private politicalaims.10Another goal in presenting this text is to help elucidate the tradition in which Dee’s occultendeavors took place. Although it has repeatedly been observed that Henry Cornelius Agrippa was amajor influence on Dee, most have concluded that Dee’s system is highly nontraditional. This view isdistorted by the fact that most attention has centered around an isolated set of records that describe asystem that, on the surface at least, appears to be highly original.11 I hope to show that Dee and hisspirit medium, Edward Kelley, were following traditional methods, especially during their earlierefforts, and that his later methods are adaptations of traditional ones, used within a traditionalframework.Dee’s writings also are of interest in that they are a record of the most educated English ofShakespeare’s age. To some extent, Dee is even said to have influenced the English language.12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Dee’s Early Period John Dee was born in London on July 13, 1527. His father, Rowland Dee, was an official at the courtof Henry VIII. John was born shortly after Luther’s break with Rome, and immediately afterEngland’s, during a period of radical reform. The resurgence of classical Greek studies combinedwith new interest in Hebrew studies to create Renaissance Neoplatonism. Renaissance philosopherssought to integrate Greek and Hebrew traditions in an attempt to unify the rapidly disintegratingreligious factions and end the constant political strife. They were thus the forerunners or prophets ofthe Rosicrucian and Illuminati movements.By the age of 23, Dee had already established a brilliant reputation, lecturing in Paris on Euclid. Atage 31 (1558), he published his first major work, Aphoristic Introduction (PropædeumataAphoristica), and at age 37 (1564), his Monas Hieroglyphica. The Monas is a highly esoteric work.In it, he claims to be in possession of the most secret mysteries. He wrote it in twelve days, whileapparently in a peak (mystical) state: “[I am] the pen merely of [God] Whose Spirit, quickly writingthese things through me, I wish and I hope to be.”13 He claimed the work would revolutionizeastronomy, alchemy, mathematics, linguistics, mechanics, music, optics, magic, and adeptship.14Like the Monas Hieroglyphica, the angel magic in the Mysteriorum Libri Quinque seeks a higherwisdom than science, religion, or Jewish Kabbalah—one that will unite them all, convince atheists,convert Jews as well as pagans, and heal Christendom."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"John Dee, the Politician The Renaissance saw a giant leap in the evolution of the Information Age. Printed works, a recentinnovation, were becoming more and more available, and manuscript collections were threatenedwith neglect. Dee was fascinated with books and spent vast amounts of energy and money collectingthem. Eventually Dee’s library became “Elizabethan England’s greatest library,”15 attracting scholarsand dignitaries alike. It is possible that Dee’s inspiration and model for his library came fromJohannes Trithemius, one of the greatest scholars and occultists of the sixteenth century. While abbotof the monastery of Sponheim in Germany, Trithemius built a library of unparalleled importance, andturned one of the poorest monasteries in the Palatinate into an “obligatory” place of pilgrimage forscholars.16 As William Sherman has noted, “Renaissance libraries were powerful sites of intellectualcreativity, social status, and political influence.” As such, their owners “were at once empoweredand endangered by their collections and skills.”17 This must have been a source of great anxiety toDee.Dee’s library was a bustle of activity, especially in 1583, with frequent planning sessions fornautical expeditions, visitors borrowing and lending books, dignitaries, including the queen, andothers, such as Francis Bacon, who sought Dee’s advice and help.18"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Plans for the New World and the New Age Perhaps Dee’s greatest legacy is his seminal role in building Britain into a major maritime power.19He is usually credited with coining the phrase “British Empire.” Dee played a prominent role in plansto colonize the New World (involving Lord Burghley, John Davis, Adrian Gilbert, and Sir WalterRaleigh), and consulted the angels quite often about the venture. His interest was not merelypatriotic.20 He had a farsighted plan for the new (or rather restored) British Empire to compete with(or replace) the Hispano-Papal empire. Part of his justification was the same as Rome’s—to “carrythe name of Jesus among the infidells to the great glory of God.”21 The magnitude of his vision isreflected in the vast extent of the empire that Britain went on to establish.Dee associated the new empire and the New World with the new age. He was fascinated by theapocalyptic prophecies of his day, and tried his own hand at them based on his knowledge ofastrology. He believed the new age would begin in a few years, perhaps in 1583 or 1584. He basedthis on astronomical models of world history published by Trithemius (De Septem Secundeis) andCyprian Leowitz (De coniunctionibus magnis).22 The fact that Dee dated two of his works23 using hiscalculation of the “world year” allows us to calculate where he thought the world was in thecycle.These works place the start of the cycles at 3763 B.C.24 Nevertheless, Dee felt the end of theworld was immanent, largely based on astronomical observations.25 The coming great conjunctionwas foreshadowed by the appearance of a supernova in 1572, a comet in 1577, and a solar eclipse in1582.In his scrying experiments,26 the angels tell Dee and Kelley that “the tyme of God’s visitation” was“8.” Dee’s speculation that this might mean 1588 seemed to be confirmed in later scrying sessions.27Dee found political authority for the British Empire in the accounts of King Arthur and OwenMadoc, a legendary Welsh prince said to have discovered America in 1170.28 To compete with thespiritual authority of Rome, however, Dee sought divine authority from the angels and God himself.The angels told him what he wanted to hear—that “the World begynnes with thy doings.”29 Thus hisscrying, publications, and political activities were all part of his grand scheme to unify the peoples,religions, and languages of the world through universal knowledge. An element of this plan was toconvert the pagans of the New World, and the Jews.30The angels revealed details of the New World and new age on several occasions. For example:“What I speak hath not byn reuealed, no not in these last tymes, of the second last world. But Ibegynne new worldes, new people, new kings, & new knowledge of a new Gouernment.” “Newworlds, shall spring of these. New manners: strange men:” “The old ways cease, the new begin.”31After the appearance of the Polish prince, Albrecht (or Albertus) Laski, Dee shifted his hope for aroyal patron to Europe. In the end, Dee failed to convince any of his would-be royal patrons of thecosmic plan. He was also thwarted by the papal nuncio (ambassador) who managed to have him andKelley expelled by Rudolf. Dee was wise enough to decline an “invitation” to Rome.32"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Renaissance Magic By the Renaissance, magic had developed a complex theoretical and philosophical foundation. Therewas also a considerable amount of practical literature in circulation. Dee’s public and secret writingsshow the remarkable depth and breadth of his studies of magical literature. The classicalphilosophers, especially Plato and Aristotle, were the foundation on which the so-called Neoplatonicphilosophers built. Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus, Iamblicus, and the Christian Pseudo-Dionysius wereall familiar to Dee, as were the Italian Neoplatonic revivalists Ficino, Pico, and others.The practical literature largely relies on knowing the secret names of God (mostly from theHebrew Old Testament)33 and of the angels or spirits themselves. The more cautious methods involvepraying to God directly to send his angels.34 The less cautious methods involve appealing to thespirits directly. The use of consecrated tools in ceremonial magic reflects their use in religiousceremonies. Most of the literature also deals with the use of talismans or symbols of some kind, andoften with squares of letters or numbers.35The object of these practices, often called “experiments,” is sometimes as sublime as the vision ofGod, but frequently as base as the recovery of stolen goods or the discovery of treasure. The mentionof treasure during a scrying session with Barnabas Saul (22 December 1581) probably reflects thegrimoire he is using more than a specific inquiry by Dee."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"John Dee, The Magus Dee’s reputation as a magus, or rather a conjurer, started fairly early in his life and has continued tothis day.36 While he was highly respected as a man of great learning within the scholarly communityand court circles, the less educated came to fear him. He was even briefly imprisoned in 1555 oncharges that he tried to enchant Queen Mary. He is said to have been the model for Prospero inShakespeare’s play The Tempest.In his explanatory note to the present work, Dee writes that his interest shifted more toward theoccult after becoming convinced of the hopelessness of human endeavors as paths to wisdom. Sloane3188 records his earliest occult experiments centered around scrying. These early methods wereremarkably consistent with the occultism prevalent at the time, and Dee seems to be as widely readhere as he was in science. He mentions the famous occultists Cornelius Agrippa and Johann Reuchlin.The widely known Heptameron of Peter de Abano and Arbatel’s Of Magic are also mentioned, eventhough he did not include them in his externa bibliotheca.Dee’s interest in angelology is indicated by his heavy annotations of such works as Pseudo-Dionysius’ Coelestis hierarchia, Richard of St. Victor’s De superdivina trinitate (1510), Scalinger’sExotericarum exercitationum liber decimus (1557), Pompilius Azalus’ De omnium rebusnaturalibus (1554), and J. Rivius’ Opera theologica (1562).37Although Dee was careful not to catalog his more dangerous volumes, other sources can beidentified or deduced. One of these is Liber Juratus, or the Sworne Book of Honorius. Sloane 313(late fourteenth or early fifteenth century) is known to have been in his collection and containsmarginal notes in his handwriting.38 Liber Juratus contains detailed instructions for communicatingwith spirits, as well as obtaining the sight of God through the use of an elaborate sigil, named theSigillum Dei Aemeth. Dee is directed by the angels to use this sigil “which is allready perfected in aboke of thyne.” Dee is also promised the sight of God (“videbis Deum”).39 Another source that Deementions is the magical text Aldaraia sive Soyga (discussed below), which has squares of magicalletters and heavy astrological elements.In addition to these, I believe that two other magical texts can be identified as having been used byDee. The first is Sloane 3849 article 1, “Manner of proceding in order to discover in the crystall,”inwhich the three angels Anchor, Anachor, and Anilos are central. This, or a similar text, seems to bebehind Dee’s first scrying session with Kelley, in which they try to call forth these three spirits.Another magical text I believe may have been used is Sloane 3854. The first part includes article 4(“Book of Consecrations”)40 and article 5 (“Experimenta de Speculo”). In the blank space betweenthese two articles (folio 75r) a second hand, which I believe can be identified as Edward Kelley’s,has written some notes. This manuscript is also bound with the most complete and correct manuscriptof Liber Juratus that I have seen.There are many examples of medieval and Renaissance magic texts with similar methods. I includesome examples in the appendices.Dee’s system started with some Hebrew-centered Kabbalah like that he found in the writings ofReuchlin. Kabbalistic concepts abound, including his use of Hebrew etymology, traditional Hebrewnames of God and angels, and extracting names from tables of letters à la Abulafia. Dee had a largeHebrew collection in his library, and took many of the volumes with him to the continent in 1583,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"showing sustained interest.Nevertheless, in the end his Sigillum Dei Aemeth replaced the traditional Hebrew names with newnames, and his angelic book was not in Hebrew, but a new (or unknown old) language. This mayreflect Dee’s (or Kelley’s) mistrust of Jews,41 or perhaps it may have been a way to compensate forKelley’s lack of knowledge of Hebrew and traditional Kabbalah. In any event, it is interesting to notethat what Dee found in these actions is exactly what he expected to discover. Instead of the confusingmaze of corruptions and variants found in the grimoires, he found an uncorrupted way ofcommunicating with angels based on their own language, and on mathematics.The first angels to make their appearance at the scrying sessions all belong to the Judeo-Christiantradition. They are later supplemented with otherwise unknown names, derived mathematically fromletter squares. Dee is careful to catalog their jurisdictions, apparel, and symbols for future use. Therevealed method of invoking their help is described in detail in the action of 17 November 1582.In addition to the seals of the spirits, the ritual apparatus included several other items: variousscrying stones, sometimes set in a frame; a “holy table” on which was painted or engraved varioussymbols; wax seals called Æmeth; a ring and lamin to be worn by the practitioner; and the rod “el,”divided into three parts, the ends painted black, the middle red."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Mysterious Book of Soyga As mentioned above, Dee refers in several places to a magical text named Aldaraia sive Soyga.Since Roberts’ and Watson’s 1990 book, John Dee’s Library Catalogue,42 two manuscripts of thiswork have been identified by Deborah E. Harkness. One is Sloane 8 in the British Library, and theother is Bodley 908 in the Bodleian library. It is possible that Sloane 8 was, in fact, the manuscript towhich Dee refers in his records.43In their very first scrying session with Kelley, Dee asks the angels, “Ys my book, of Soyga, of anyexcellency?” (10 March 1582). He laments at that time, “Oh, my great and long desyre hath byn to behable to read those Tables of Soyga.” Liber Loagaeth (Sloane 3189) has several tables fromAldaraia/Soyga appended (in Dee’s handwriting—not Kelley’s, as in the rest of the manuscript). Inaddition, Dee’s statement, “Soyga: otherwise named ysoga, and Agyos, literis transpositis” is, in fact,a direct quote from the Aldaraia.44 The angel Il responds, “Soyga signifieth not Agyos,” in directcontradiction. This makes it probable that Kelley was not familiar with the text, and is possiblyevidence that he was in fact carrying out a deception. I do not believe the Book of Soyga is the sameas the “Arabick book” mentioned several times by Dee. The latter was apparently the same as thatprized by Pontois and described as having “cost doctor dye £ 600 ready money as he the deponent didhear himself the said doctor afferme. . .”45 There is nothing about either Soyga manuscript to justifysuch a vast sum.46"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Scrying and Dee’s Earliest Attempts The premise behind Dee’s mystical experiments is the veracity of scrying, or visions seen in a crystalball or other shining surface. Today, the crystal ball has become an icon for superstition, but scryinghas been widely used and respected for divination throughout history. It even has biblical authority.47According to psychiatrist and researcher Raymond A. Moody, “That certain individuals do seevisions—specifically, hypnagogic images—when gazing into a transparent or reflective surface is awell-established fact that can be regarded as an item of psychological knowledge.”48 The realquestion is the value of these visions, or their interpretation.Scrying instructions can be found widely in occult literature, in particular in manuscripts that it wasdangerous to possess.49 The published sources, such as Agrippa, make scant mention of scrying.Scrying also appears in popular legends, such as the legends of Roger Bacon’s scrying glass in whichanyone could see anything they wished within fifty miles.With few exceptions, Dee did not use scrying to see far-off happenings, or to divine the future. Hisaim was to see into the spiritual realms to receive wisdom from higher beings. The spiritual realmswere thought to resemble, in many respects, the physical world.It was common for scrying practices to be accompanied by religious and occult symbols andceremonies. These served to ensure the spiritual purity of the practice, but also to focus concentrationon the intent, much as techniques for lucid dreaming do. They also served to give form, context, andmeaning to the images seen by the scryer. For example, surrounding the scrying table with the symbolsof the seven planets provided a means of organizing and remembering the otherwise bewilderingmaze of images. This integration of magic with the art of memory was developed to a high degree inRenaissance occultism.50Symbols and ceremonies also provided a means of controlling or manipulating the images (or, touse Couliano’s term, “phantasms”). For example, the scryer might place a talisman of Venus under thestone when he wanted to focus on affairs of the heart. This is essentially an attempt to facilitatecommunication between body and soul: “body and soul speak two languages, which are not onlydifferent, even inconsistent, but also inaudible to each other. The inner sense alone is able to hear andcomprehend them both, also having the role of translating one into the other.”51 The use of sacredsymbols and ceremonies also helped the scryer summon courage to face the possible confrontationwith demonic presences.Dee’s interest in scrying clearly goes back far earlier than the records of his scrying experiments.52Although he may have begun to experiment much earlier, the earliest records of Dee’s scrying begin in1581. On 8 March 1581, and several times during 1581, Dee records strange knocking and rapping inhis chamber, and a voice like an owl’s shriek. These events were clearly regarded as supernaturaland may have been related to early experiments.His private diary records: “May 25th, I had sight in χρυσταλλω [Crystallo] offerd me, and I saw.”Generally, however, Dee relied on the scrying abilities of others, as prescribed by tradition. Hementions that he employed two seers around this time.53Late in 1581, Dee began to employ Barnabas Saul as a scryer. Saul was a minister who washeavily involved with magic. Dee’s diary records additional details regarding his dealings with Saul:"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Oct. 9th, Barnabas Saul, lying in the ........ hall was strangely trubled by a spiritual creatureabowt mydnight.

They wereintroduced by Dee’s friend Mr. Clerkson. Kelley began to scry regularly with Dee two days later.From Dee’s records, it is apparent that Kelley had a highly unstable personality. The relationshipbetween the two men was often strained, and Kelley would storm off for months at a time. Aside fromtheir conflicts, however, Dee regarded their sessions as highly successful."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Scrying Methods Dee used various media for scrying—several crystal balls and the famous obsidian mirror are nowpreserved in the British Museum.56 Dee drew a picture of one of them in the record of the first scryingsession (see below).

This is probably the stonethat William Lilly described as the size of a large orange, “set in silver, with a cross on the top, andanother on the handle; and round about engraved the names of these angels, Raphael, Gabriel,Uriel.”57 After intense prayer, the stone was placed in a frame and set on a specially prepared table.The angels were then called to appear in the stone to answer questions.Nicholas Clulee has argued that Dee did not seem to consider these actions magical, but rather avariety of religious experience. He based this partly on the observation that they do not seem toinvoke the angels directly, as directed by the magical books. Rather, they start off with prayers toGod, and petitions that God send his angels.58 This is consistent with the method found in the Arbatel,which Dee mentions by name in the text. In his first action with Kelley, Dee is very careful todistinguish between “spirituall practise” and what is “vulgarly accownted Magik.” On the other hand,Dee and Kelley immediately proceed to “call for the good Angel Anchor, to appere in that stone tomy owne sight.” Dee states that he “make[s] motion to god, and his good Creatures.” Also, Dee’ssynopsis of his instructions for communicating with angels (Heptarchia Mystica and Tabula bonorumangelorum invocationes, bound in Sloane 3191) contains numerous invocations or “invitations”addressed directly to individual angels. These were based on the records Dee kept in Sloane 3188.It does not appear that God or the angels obliged Dee’s request that they appear to his own sight,but Kelley experiences vivid and detailed apparitions. As soon as the angels appear in the stone, they“give thanks to God, and Wellcome to the good Creature.” Then they demand the angel’s name. Thesesteps are all consistent with the texts of ritual magic. In the second action, Dee is told that the methodof invoking the archangel Michael is by “the Seven psalmes.” This is also consistent with thegrimoires.59 The apparitions do not always seem confined to the crystal.60"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Edward Kelley, the Magician Edward Kelley was born on 1 August 1555. He was thus 28 years younger than Dee. He attendedOxford under the alias of Edward Talbot, but left after some trouble. He was later pilloried inLancaster for forgery. He was 26 when he arrived at Dee’s door on 10 March 1582.61 By this time,Kelley was well versed in the occult arts, including Agrippa’s works. He also possessed varioustexts on magic, at least some of which were regarded as “devilish.” Kelley was also an alchemist.His only book is on alchemy, and his final months were occupied with alchemical experiments forRudolph II. Elias Ashmole says, “Mr. Lilly told me that John Evans informed him that he wasacquainted with Kelly’s sister in Worchester, that she shewed him some of the gold her brother hadtransmuted, and that Kelly was first an apothecary in Worcester.”62 Kelley later married Jane Cooper.He also had a brother, Thomas."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Sigillum Aemeth and Its Variations The use of the Sigillum Aemeth (or Emeth) is central to Dee’s system, as well as to other forms ofmagic. The earliest examples of the Sigillum Aemeth are found in the Liber Juratus (see appendix 1).Most manuscripts describe the seal in great detail, but don’t actually draw it out. The versions that doexist vary, probably because they were based on the written description. Liber Juratus calls this sealthe “seal of God . . . which is the beginning,in this art.”63 Between the outer circles is to be writtenthe 72–letter name of God, or Schemhamphoras. Both Agrippa and Reuchlin refer to a seal by thisname, although I have been unable to find any descriptions or drawings of it in their writings. Deewas well aware of the fact that variations existed, since he asks the angels to provide a definitiveversion for his works. The version by Athanasius Kircher, which appears many years later in hismonumental work Oedipus Aegyptiacus, is highly corrupt.64Dee was originally told by the angels to use a version found in one of his books. He thereuponconsulted several sources and asked the angels to resolve the discrepancies. This prompted them todeliver a radically new version of the sigil.An examination of Dee’s original wax sigil (see figure 1, page 42), now preserved in the BritishMuseum, shows differences from that found in Sloane 3188."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Holy Table and Its Variations Dee’s scrying was conducted on a specially constructed table, two versions of which were describedto him by the angels. The first, whose design is now lost, was later declared by the angels to be false.The second design is apparently similar to the first. It consists of a large hexagram containing asquare of letters. Surrounding the hexagram is a border containing additional letters. Although theoriginal table does not appear to have survived, it was described in detail by Elias Ashmole, whosaw it in John Cotton’s library. It was “composed of 3 boards broad-waies besides the borderings; ofa fine grained wood & very heavy, but the scent now lost.” He described the Enochian letters aspainted in red on a gold background, between two blue lines. The seven sigils, or “ensigns ofCreation” were also painted with red letters and blue lines. The lines of the hexagon were gold, andthe central square had gold letters and blue lines.65 (The engraving found in Dee’s True and FaithfulRelation . . . does not correspond exactly with the description in Sloane 3188. See figure 3, page 43.)As with the Sigillum Aemeth described above, this design is a variation of designs found in magictexts. It is likely that Dee employed one of the conventional designs in his early scrying before theangels revealed their version.The instructions given in the grimoires concerning the holy table probably give a fairly accurateidea of how Dee proceeded in these experiments. In appendices 3, 4, and 5, I present excerpts fromthe Theurgia Goetia, Art Pauline, and Ars Almadel. The Art Pauline seems particularly close toDee’s method. The table contains a hexagram with the seven planetary seals arranged around it (seefigure 5, page 44). The spirit’s seal is placed on the appropriate planetary seal. Dee was instructedthat the seven seals could be constructed separately and arranged around the table, or they could bepainted onto the table.The third example is from the Ars Almadel. This gives a method for calling forth the spirits thatgovern the four directions, north, south, east, and west. Here, we also find a hexagram on the holytable, and the use of wax sigils. This time, there is a border around the table with holy names drawnaround it. In the center of the hexagram is a small triangular seal with more names (see figures 6 and7, pages 45–46). Aldaraia sive Soyga also contains diagrams reminiscent of Dee’s (see figure 4, page44)."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Other Ritual Implements According to the Key of Solomon,66 Heptameron, Lemegeton,67 and other magical texts, the mastershould wear on his chest a lamin with a hexagram. Dee is likewise told to prepare a lamin to be usedfor this purpose, but his was triangular, thus symbolizing his name (∆ = Dee). He is later given a newversion, the original version having been declared false. The final version has Enochian lettering.Dee is also instructed to prepare another ritual implement, the ring of Solomon. Solomon’s magicalring appears in early magical literature. For example, in the Testament of Solomon (first to thirdcentury A.D.), Solomon is given the magical ring by the archangel Michael.68 He uses it to call andcontrol the demons. The archangel Michael likewise reveals Solomon’s ring to Dee, stating that itwas by it that Solomon worked all his wonders. The Testament of Solomon was known in medievalmanuscripts and could have been known to Dee.69"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Spirits Five archangels are central to Dee’s actions: Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, and Annael. Thisgrouping is common in medieval and Renaissance occult works. In Liber Juratus, the first four areknown as the “Angels of the 4 winds.” Agrippa calls them the “four angels ruling over the corners ofthe world.”70 The Magical Calendar gives the same.71 The names of the first four are also foundwritten on the frame that holds the scrying crystal in Trithemius’ method of calling angels into acrystal.72 Michael and Gabriel are the only two angels mentioned by name in the Old Testament.Raphael is mentioned in the Apocryphal Book of Tobit, and Uriel is well known in noncanonical lore.Annael is relatively unknown.The meanings of the Hebrew names and their compass allocations are: During their first scrying session, Dee and Kelley called three angels: Anchor, Anachor, and Anilos.These names also occur in mainstream occult sources. In the Heptameron or Magical Elements ofPeter de Abano, they are mentioned in the oration to be said when the vesture is put on.73 It is knownthat Dee made use of that book, but he must have been following another source here, since the namesare not exactly the same. A likely source is Sloane 3849, article 1, “Manner of preceding in order todiscover in the crystall,” where these three angels are central.It would be interesting to try to trace the development of this oration. The Heptameron version isas follows:Ancor, Amacor, Amides, Theodonias, Anitor, by the merits of thy Angel, O Lord, I will put onthe Garments of Salvation, that this which I desire I may bring to effect: through thee the mostholy Adonay, whose kingdom endureth for ever and ever. Amen74 The Clavicula Salomonis gives the following:Amor, Amator, Amides, Ideodaniach, Pamor, Plaior, Anitor; through the merits of these holyAngels will I robe and indue myself with the vestments of Power, through which may I conductunto the desired end those things which I ardently wish, through Thee, O most Holy ADONAI,whose Kingdom and Empire endureth forever.

It is numbered oration 17:O Jesu the sonne of the incomprehensible god,hancor hanacor hamylos iehorna theodonos heliothos phagor corphandonos norizane corithicohanosae helsezope phagora.ELEMINATOR candones helos helee resphaga thephagayn theundyn thahonos micemyahehortahonas nelos behebos belhores hacaphagan belehothol ortophagon corphandonos born in theshape of a man for us sinners and yow holy angells heliothos phagnoraherken and teche me andgouerne me [hic oic petitionem tuam sed p visione diuina dic ut sequitr] that I may come toobtayne the visyon of the deyte throwgh thee glorious and moste gentle and moste almightiecreator oure lyuyng lorde holy infinite godely and euerlastinge to whome be prayse honor andglorye worlde withowt ende.

The first is: Zaphiel, Zadkiel, Cumael,Raphael, Haniel, Michael, and Gabriel. The second is: Zedekieil, Madimiel, Semeliel, Nogahel,Corabiel, and Leuenael. Most of these names are identical to those given by Agrippa in his “Scale ofthe number seven.” The first list corresponds to the “seven angels which stand in the presence ofGod.” This also corresponds to the list of seven archangels according to Geonic lore, as well as thatof Pseudo-Dionysius.79 The second list corresponds to the Hebrew names for the seven planets, withthe name of God, “EL,” added to each. It is also found in Agrippa, book 3."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Description of the Manuscript One of the most remarkable things about Dee, as exemplified by these records, is his meticulousattention to detail. In fact, Dee’s are probably the most detailed records of the actual practice ofceremonial magic extant.The title of the book is slightly ambiguous. “Mysteriorum,” as in Mysteriorum Libri, can meaneither mysteries or secret rites. Both meanings seem fitting in this context.The manuscript consists of 104 folios, mostly in Dee’s hand. It measures approximately 320mm by205mm. It contains a short preface by Elias Ashmole, and is bound with notes by Ashmole, many ofwhich are in his stenographic notation.80"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Synopsis of Dee’s “Mystical Experiments” (1581–1583) In his Mysteriorum Libri Quinque, Dee records prophetic visions (e.g., the Spanish Armada),visions of angels, magical instruction, and religious teachings. A few of the key messages of theangels include:• Flesh is vile and corrupt (Gnostic or Neoplatonic attitude);• Mercy for the repentant is necessary;• Temptation of the faithful is necessary in order to show God’s mercy;• The immanent coming of the antichrist;• The immanent fall of existing political and religious establishments as punishment formankind’s corruption, to be replaced by new, righteous ones. Although a lot of material remains obscure, especially passages from the “holy book,” I believeChristopher Whitby is correct in dismissing the theory of cryptographic messages hidden in theserecords.81There is suprisingly little discussion of alchemy in these records, especially in view of the fact thatDee pursued it actively during this period.82 Perhaps Dee did not mention it here because he didn’twant to reveal his alchemical work to Kelley, who probably came to Dee for that purpose. Perhapsthis helps explain Kelley’s bouts of anger at Dee. One might also wonder if Kelley brought the scroll,book, and red powder in order to entice Dee into letting him in on Dee’s own secret alchemical work.The evidence that there was more to the visions than simply conscious deception from Kelley will bediscussed later."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Book of Angelic Wisdom Dee seems to have had an almost obsessive facination with the lost Apocrypha, especially the Bookof Enoch, which is mentioned and even quoted in the Bible (Jude 14), and Esdras. He is told by theangels that the Apocrypha are not lost, but in the keeping of the Jews.83 Most of his mystical exercisesare focused on recovery of the lost wisdom that these books represented to him.The core of this book describes the revelation of a book of angelic wisdom, Liber Loagaeth (sonamed by Dee in A True and Faithful Relation . . . ). It is reported to be in the tongue of the angels.Only a few angelic words are translated in these manuscripts. The first parts of this book weredictated by Kelley and recorded meticulously by Dee in Sloane 3188. Later parts were written byKelley directly and are now found in Sloane 3189. The latter manuscript is incomplete in that it doesnot repeat the earlier material. It is also bound with four tables from the Book of Soyga, written inDee’s handwriting. Since the angels state that the angelic book contains forty-nine leaves (one ofwhich cannot be revealed), it is clear that the four tables from Soyga do not belong to it.Dee was instructed to rewrite the book in the delivered script, but this does not seem to have beendone. One copy was to be bound in blue. Another, “whose skin shall bear Silver,” was to be “inlength; 8 [inches], in breadth 7. ”84The importance of Liber Loagaeth cannot be overemphasized. From it would “be restored the holybokes, which haue perished euen from the begynning, and from the first that liued.” The truths itcontains will end religious disputes and restore religious unity. “Which when it hath spread a while,THEN COMMETH THE ENDE.”85 In short, it will usher in the new age. Since the book is so centralto these angelic communications, it is amazing that it has remained unpublished."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Synopsis of Dee’s True & Faithful Relation The record of Dee’s experiments continues in later manuscripts. The bulk of the later material waspublished in 1659 by Meric Casaubon as A True & Faithful Relation . . . Between Dr. John Dee . . .and some Spirits. These records were published by Casaubon with the intent of discrediting Dee andKelley. The Casaubon edition, it should be noted, is full of typographic errors. Reliance on it alone,without the manuscript sources, has sadly resulted in the perpetuation of many errors.A True & Faithful Relation takes up where Mysteriorum Libri Quinque left off. It goes on todescribe their six-year missionary journey to the continent. The revelations of the mystical heptarchywere followed by that of the 30 “Aethyrs,” the “48 Claves Angelicae,” and the four “EnochianTables.” The later material included a second language popularly known as “Enochian.”Dee’s mission to the court of Rudolph II in Prague cannot be considered a success. An occultisthimself, Rudolph proved very unsupportive. In fact, Dee and Kelley narrowly escaped the papalnuncio and the possibility of facing the deadly Inquisition. Dee returned to England in 1589. Kelleyremained behind and had limited success in alchemical experiments for Rudolph. He died trying toescape in 1595."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Dee’s Later Life The final period of Dee’s life and career have been judged variously as one of disgrace and failure,or as one of continued success and renown. I think William Sherman has made a credible case for thelatter view.86 While it is clear that his mission to the continent cost him politically, Dee continued tomaintain his contacts and influence, and even served in an official capacity to King James I when hesucceeded Queen Elizabeth in 1603. He continued his scrying experiments, but never again achievedthe dramatic results he had seen with Kelley. While the promised new age never materialized in thedramatic and apocalyptic way he had visualized, history has acknowledged Dee’s vital role inshaping our modern world."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Adaptation of Dee’s System by Later Occultists Dee’s activities and writings have made a deep impact on later occult movements. Among the fruits ofhis labor is a heavy influence on the German Rosicrucian movement, whose manifestos began toappear around 1610.87As mentioned above, Dee’s experiments also had a great influence on the Golden Dawn.Unfortunately, the process of adapting and assimilating Dee’s system was undertaken with uncriticalmethods and incomplete materials. In particular, these efforts have been based almost entirely onCasaubon’s True & Faithful Relation, with all its typographic errors. In many particulars, theCasaubon edition is impossible to understand without the Mysteriorum Libri Quinque."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Four Angelic Tablets Four tables of letters were produced during the later conferences.88 These tables served two differentpurposes: the production of ninety-one names that correspond to the ninety-one parts of the world (ascatalogued by Agrippa in his Occult Philosophy I, chap. 31), and the production of invocations(“Tabula Bonorum”) to be used with the names. The Golden Dawn adaptation of Dee’s system placesheavy emphasis of these tables.Christian Wilby has written an excellent article on the four angelic tablets. There he states:Unfortunately for later day occultists, the so-called synthetic genius—I prefer to call it rampanteclecticism—of McGregor Mathers has obscured the field of vision on this problem for toolong. For some reason best known to himself, Mathers was content to use the originally receivedtablets and ALL of the emmendations of the “corrected” version. This has produced, to thedetriment of everybody, one of the biggest mish-mashes ever to grace the Tradition.89 Another inaccuracy in the Golden Dawn system is the compass allocations used for the four angelictablets. The original allocations given to Dee were later corrected by the angels.90 The correctallocations are also given by Dee in his synopsis of his magical system (see Sloane 3191).

It was poorly reproduced from his typewrittenthesis, making it completely illegible in many spots.

Also unfortunate is the fact that Whitby doesn’t compare Sloane 3188 with Dee’smanuscript Heptarchia Mystica, where Dee collects excerpts from the Mysteriorum LibriQunique.93 These compensate greatly for much of the damage and illegibility of the latter, much moreso than Ashmole’s transcriptions. Although Whitby makes note of its importance, he doesn’t makemuch use of it."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Conclusions: The Evidence Colin Wilson has written: “Dee is one of the few great magical adepts of the past who can present uswith some practical evidence of the existence of non-human entities.”94 How solid is this evidence?The most convincing evidence is perhaps the “Enochian” language revealed by the angels. Enochianhas been extensively studied by Donald Laycock, a prominent linguist. His comments indicate that he,for one, is not entirely convinced.95The second body of evidence is the word and credibility of John Dee. It must be remembered thathe was regarded as one of the most educated people of his age, acknowledged to have impressivescientific credentials. In at least two places, he reports firsthand experience of supernatural events. Inhis diary, he writes, “I had sight in Crystallo offerd me, and I saw.”96 And in the Mysteriorum LibriQuinque, he reports, “I fele: and (by a great thundring noyce, thumming thuning myne eares) Iperceyue the presence of some spirituall creature abowt me.”97 He also witnessed the seeminglymiraculous materialization of the stone (21 November 1582). On the other hand, it must be admittedthat Dee was highly motivated to believe, and thus was more likely to misinterpret events.The largest body of evidence comes in the form of the word and credibility of Edward Kelley.Views of him range from that of a highly gifted scryer to an outright charlatan. I am inclined to believethat the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Clulee concluded that Kelley. . . may well have consciously fabricated everything to deceive Dee, but his bouts of emotionalanxiety and arguments with the spirits in the course of his visions, his reluctance to continueexcept for Dee’s desperate pleadings, and his admission of the visions to religious authorities inPrague when that might have had serious consequences all suggest that more than consciousdeception was involved (TFR, 64, 102, 370).98 Although Kelley often questioned the divinecharacter of the angels, he seems to have believed in their reality as firmly as Dee, and while itis clear that the revelations of the angels through Kelley were often prejudiced in favor ofKelley’s interests in particular circumstances, they also reflect what Kelley knew of Dee’sinterests. In a number of places in the minutes Dee has noted the similarity of the angelicrevelations to material in Agrippa, Reuchlin, Trithemius, and Peter of Abano, and since Kelleylived with Dee and had access to his library, the revelations are very likely the joint product ofKelley’s imagination and stock of knowledge and what he knew of Dee’s thinking from theirdiscussions and his reading among books of current interest to Dee.99Dee and Kelley’s actions may be compared with so-called UFO abductees’ recovered memories,wherein a “hypnotist” puts the “witness” into a suggestible state, and, through leading questions,manages to arrive at all sorts of “memories.” The process may not be unlike the art of taking politicalpolls. Of course, the better therapists and pollsters are trained to avoid biased results.Another similarity with the UFO phenomena is the apparent trickster nature of the entities. Theyseem to combine convincing elements with apparent nonsense in a way that has led some researchersto theorize deep psychological manipulation.100 Uri Geller’s suspicion that there was just some“goddam little clown that is playing with us” sounds hauntingly similar to many of Kelley’scomplaints."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Other significant evidence lies in the various accurate predictions (e.g., Mary’s beheading, theSpanish Armada, the homecoming of the Jews). These must, however, be weighed against thosepredictions that weren’t accurate (e.g., prophecies of doom, Laski’s future).101 Another event thatdeserves mention is a secret conversation between Dee and the angels, held in Greek in order toprevent Kelley from understanding it. Aside from this incident, the angels’ use of Latin seems toreflect Kelley’s limited schooling in that language. When using Latin, they tend to deliver fixedspeeches and avoid discourse. Also, as noticed by Calder, the angels “increase in fluency through theyears.”102A quick survey of how practical the angel magic was to Dee is even less convincing. AlthoughDee’s aims were not only practical, but mystical as well, the results do not seem to be very reliable:Some of the instructions, such as those concerning etymology and geography, are straight out oftextbooks. This is also true of the names of angels, their descriptions, offices, and so forth. The"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"episode of the dictation of the table can easily be seen as evidence that Kelley was fabricating the“revelations.” First Dee is told that the sigil Aemeth was correct in his books, but when confronted byconflicting versions, the “angels” produce yet another version. At one point, Kelley takes the sigil tohis room to correct it. Later, he frequently interrupts sessions when the extraction methods fail. Thismay mean that Kelley needed time to figure out where his mistakes were. And what are we to make ofthe episode in which Kelley produces a drawing in his own handwriting that appears to be aprototype of one of the diagrams? He proclaimed it a counterfeit, and Dee congratulated himself innot succumbing to doubt, but trusting God.Indeed, the angels often seem to be telling Dee and Kelley what they want to hear to gain theircooperation, but their reasons are not apparent.

The master of the shop told them it had ben parcell of the goods of Mr:John Woodall Chirurgeon (father to Mr: Thomas Woodall late Serjant Chirurgeon to his now MaiestieKing Charles the 2nd: (my intimate friend) and tis very probable he bought it after Dr: Dee’s death,when his goods were exposed to sale.Twenty yeares after this (& about 4 yeares before the fatall fire of London) she & her said husbandoccasionally removing this chest out of its usuall place, thought they heard some loose thing ratle in it,toward the right hand end, under the box or till112 thereof, & by shaking it, were fully satisfied it wasso: Hereupon her husband thrust a peece of iron into a small crevice at the bottome of the Chest, &thereupon appeared a private drawer, which being drawne out, therein were found divers bookes inmanuscript, & papers, together with a litle box, & therein a chaplet of olive beades, & a cross of thesame wood, hanging at the end of them.They made no great matter of these bookes &c: because they understood them not, whichoccasioned their servant maide to wast about one halfe of them under pyes & other like uses, whichwhen discovered, they kept the rest more safe.About two yeares after the discovery of these bookes, Mr: Jones died, & when the fire of London"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"hapned, though the chest perished in the flames, because not easily to be removed, yet the bookeswere taken out & carried with the rest of Mrs: Jones her goods into Moorefields, & being broughtsafely back, she tooke care to preserve them; and after marrying with the foresaid Mr: Wale, he cameto the knowledge of them, & thereupon, with her consent, sent them to me, as I haue before set downe.E.

The power and office of those angels is tomake all things fruitful and increase, both animals and vegetables, in creation and generation,advancing the birth of the children, and making barren women fruitful, &c. Their names are these:Alimiel, Gabriel, Borachiel, Lebes and Hellison.Note you must not pray for any angels but those that belong to the same altitude you have a desire tocall forth. And when you operate, set the four candles upon four candle sticks, but be careful you donot light them before you begin to operate. Then lay the Almadel between the four candles upon thewaxen feet that cometh from the candles, and lay the golden seal upon the Almadel. Then, having theinvocation ready written on virgin parchment, light the candles and read the invocation as is set downat the latter end of this part.And when he appeareth, he appeareth in the form of an angel carrying in his hand a fan or flag,having the picture of a white cross upon it.

He descends first upon thesuperscription of the Almadel, as if it were a mist or fog.Then must the exorcist must have in readiness a vessel of earth, of the same colour that the Almadelis of, and the other of his furniture, it being in the form of a basin, and put therein a few hot ashes orcoals, but not too much, lest it should melt the wax of the Almadel, and put therein three little grainsof mastic in powder, so that it fumeth, and the smell may go upwards through the holes of theAlmadel, when it is under it, and as soon as the angel smells it he beginneth to speak with a lowvoice, asking what your desire is and why you have called the princes and governers of his Altitude.Then you must answer him, saying, I desire that all my requests may be granted, and what I pray formay be accomplished, for your office maketh appear and declareth that such is to be fulfilled by you ifit pleases God, &c, adding further the particulars of your requests, praying with sincerity and humilityfor what is lawful and just, and that you shalt indeed obtain from him.But if he doth not appear presently, you must then take the golden seal, and make with it three orfour marks upon the candles, by which means the angel will presently appear as aforesaid, and whenthe angel departeth he will fill the whole place with a sweet and pleasant smell, which will be smelta long time.Note the golden seal will serve, and is to be used in the operation of all the altitudes. The colour ofthe Almadel belonging to the first chora is lily white; to the second chora a perfect red rose colour;the third chora is to be a green mixt with a white silver colour; the fourth chora is to be a black mixtwith a little green of a sad colour."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Of the Second Chora or Altitude Note that all the other three altitudes, with their signs and princes have power over goods and riches,and can make any man rich or poor, and as the first Chora giveth increase and maketh fruitful, so tothese giveth decrease and barrenness, &c.And if any have a desire to operate in any of the other three Choras or Altitudes, they must do it onSundays in the manner as above is shewed, but do not pray for anything that is contrary to the natureof their office, or against God and his laws, but what God giveth according to the course of nature,that you may desire and obtain.All the furniture that is to be used is to be of the same colour as the Almadel is of, and the princesof this Second Chora are named as followeth: Alphariza, Genon, Geror, Armon, Gereinin.When you operate, kneel before the Almadel with clothes of the same colour in a closet hung withthe same colours also, for the holy apparation will be of the same colour.

As, for example, suppose I would callthe two first of those five that belong to the first Chora. Then choose the first Sunday on March, thatis, after the Sun is entered Aries, and then I make my experiment. And so do the like if you will thenext Sunday after again. But if you will call the two second that belong to the first Chora, then youmust take the Sundays that are in April, after the Sun is entered Taurus.But if you call the last of the five, then you must take those Sundays that are in May, after the Sun isentered Gemini, to make your experiment in: do the like in the other Altitudes, for they have all oneway of working. But the Altitudes have a name formed severally in the substance of heaven even as acharacter, for when the angels hear the names of God that are attributed to them they hear it by thevertue of that character.

Charles Tart, Body Mind Spirit(Charlottesville: Hampton Roads, 1997), observes that Scientism, a belief that scoffs at anything thatdoesn’t fit our supposedly scientific beliefs, has become “the world’s most powerful (and negative)religion.” It is interesting to note that most modern religious studies carefully avoid Scientism.4Frances A. Yates, The Rosicrucian Enlightenment (Boulder: Shambhala, 1978), p. xii.5Some have argued there are actually two systems: the Heptarchic system (represented by thismanuscript and Dee’s Heptarchia Mystica), and the Enochian system, represented by later records,especially TFR.6See C. H. Josten’s translation of Dee’s Monas Hieroglyphica (AMBIX, XII, 1964, 84–221), andNicholas Clulee’s analysis in John Dee’s Natural Philosophy (London: Routledge, 1988), p. 77ff.7Although there has been some criticism of Dr. Yates’ work in recent years, I have found the views ofRoberts and Watson to be the most balanced: “The influence of the later work of Yates herself will bewidely apparent for although that often seems hasty and over-enthusiastic, our own research hasfrequently confirmed rather than contradicted hers. . . .” Julian Roberts and Andrew Watson, JohnDee’s Library Catalogue (London: The Bibliographical Society, 1990), p. 26.8R. Turner writes, “Mistakes abound in both the Crowley and Regardie printed Enochian texts. Icounted 91 in the first Call alone when comparing these with Dee’s original manuscript (see Sloane3191, British Museum).” Cited by Colin Wilson, “Introduction to the Necronomicon,” Gnostica, 48,Nov. 1978, p. 62.9The first edition was limited to 500 copies. Another version was produced by Christopher Whitby ashis doctoral thesis. This had a small reprinting as John Dee’s Actions with Spirits, 2 vols. (New"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"York: Garland, 1991).10William Sherman, John Dee, p. 149.11These records were published in 1659 by Meric Casaubon as A True & Faithful Relation . . .Between Dr. John Dee . . . and Some Spirits (TFR). Casaubon’s main intent in publishing thismaterial was to discredit Dee’s reputation.12For example, he is credited with coining the word “unit,” which he used to translate the Greek“monas.” He also coined the word “Britannia.”13Monas, Theorem 23.14Monas, dedication to King Maximilian, passim, pp. 115 ff.15Peter J. French, John Dee, The World of an Elizabethan Magus, 1972, pp. 40 ff.16Hans Ankwicz-Kleehoven observes, “Just as no distinguished foreigner at the beginning of thenineteenth century omitted to pay his respects to Goethe in Weimar, so it was good form in theGermany of circa 1500 to have called on Trithemius at Sponheim.” Cited in loan P. Couliano, Erosand Magic in the Renaissance (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), p. 166.17William Sherman, John Dee, p. 51.18William Sherman has given us an excellent sense of it in his book; see especially p. 40.19“Dee could hardly have held a more prominent place in . . . the genesis of the British Empire.” SeeWilliam Sherman, John Dee, pp. 148 ff and passim.20A large element of Dee’s patriotism was his fascination with the Arthurian legends. He was largelyresponsible for reviving interest in them. Dee believed himself to be of royal descent.21British Library, Sloane manuscript 3188, fol. 65a.

The angels told Dee that “the 7 Governours have almost ended their Government”(TFR, p. 4). Dee’s copy of Cyprian Leowitz, De Conjunctionibus Magnis Insignioribus SuperiorumPlanetarum (Leuingen, 1564), has “underlinings and a few notes” (item 631, R&W).23GRM (1577) is dated 5540, and A Playne Discourse . . . concerning the needful reformation of yevulgar kallender (Oxford: Bodleian Library, Ashmole MS 1789, article 3, 1582) is dated 5545.24The title page for Dee’s General and Rare Memorials shows a timeline of history of something over6,000 years. If 6,000 years is significant to him as it was to others, his calculations would put the endat A.D. 2037.25See also I. R. F.
