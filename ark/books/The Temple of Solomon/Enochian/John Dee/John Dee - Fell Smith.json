Surely it is time that thecause of all this universal condemnation should be examined in the light of reasonand science; and perhaps it will be found to exist mainly in the fact that he was toofar advanced in speculative thought for his own age to understand. For more thanfifty years out of the eighty-one of his life, Dee was famous, even if suspected andlooked askance at as clever beyond human interpretation. Then his Queen died.With the narrow-minded Scotsman who succeeded her came a change in thefashion of men’s minds. The reign of the devil and his handmaidens — the witchesand possessed persons- -was set up in order to be piously overthrown, and the verybigotry of the times gave birth to independent and rational thought — to Newton,Bacon, Locke.But Dee was already labelled once and for all. Every succeeding writer whohas touched upon his career, has followed the leaders blindly, and has only castanother, and yet another, stone to the heap of obloquy piled upon his name. Thefascination of his psychic projections has always led the critic to ignore his moresolid achievements in the realms of history and science, while at the same time,these are the only cited to be loudly condemned. The learned Dr. Meric Casaubon,who, fifty years after Dee’s death, edited his Book of Mysteries — the absorbingrecital of four out of the six or seven years of his crystal gazing — was perhaps thefairest critic he yet has had. Although he calls Dee’s spiritual revelations a “sadrecord,” and a “work of darkness,” he confesses that he himself, and other learnedand holy men (including an archbishop), read it with avidity to the end, and wereeager to see it printed. He felt certain, as he remarks in his preface, that men’scuriosity would lead them to devour what seems to him “not parallelled in thatkind, by any book that hath been set out in any age to read.” And yet on no accountwas he publishing it to satisfy curiosity, but only “to do good and promote Religion.”For Dee, he is persuaded, was a true, sincere Christian, his Relation made in themost absolute good faith, although undoubtedly he was imposed upon and deludedby the evil spirits whom he sometimes mistook for good ones.It may be well here to remark that this voluminous Book of Mysteries orTrue and Faithful Relation (fol. 1659), from which in the following pages there willbe found many extracts, abounds in tedious and unintelligible pages of whatCasaubon calls “sermon-like stuff,” interspersed with passages of extraordinarybeauty. Some of the figures and parables, as well as the language used, are full of a"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"rare poetic imagery, singularly free from any coarse or sensual symbolism. Likejewels embedded in dull settings, here and there a gem of loftiest religious thoughtshines and sparkles. There are descriptive touches of costume and appearance thatpossess considerable dramatic value. As the story is unfolded in a kind of spiritualdrama, the sense of a gradual moving development, and the choice of a fittingvehicle in which to clothe it, is striking. The dramatis personae, too, the “spiritualcreatures” who, as Dee believed, influence the destinies of man, become living andreal, as of course they were to the seer. In many respects these “actions” were anexact counterpart of the dealings inaugurated by psychical scientists 275 years later, ifwe omit the close investigation for fraud.Casaubon’s successor in dealing with the shunned and avoided subject ofJohn Dee was Thomas Smith, Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, who, in 1707,wrote the first connected Life of him, in a book of the Lives of Learned Men. It wasbased upon some of Dee’s autobiographical papers, and out of a total of a hundredpages, gave fifty to letters already printed by Casaubon.After this no sustained account of Dee’s romantic career is to be found outsidethe pages of biographical dictionaries and magazine articles, or among writers uponnecromancy, hermetic philosophy, and alchemy. Many of these decorate theircollections with apocryphal marvels culled from the well-worn traditional stories ofDee and his companion, Edward Kelley. Thus, throughout his lifetime and since,he has continued to run the gauntlet of criticism. “Old imposturing juggler,”“fanatic,” “quack,” are mild terms: in the Biographia Britannica he is called“extremely credulous, extravagantly vain, and a most deluded enthusiast.” Eventhe writer on Dee in the Dictionary of National Biography says his conferences withthe angels are “such a tissue of blasphemy and absurdity that they might suggestinsanity.” Many more such summary verdicts might be quoted, but these willsuffice for the present.It has been said that no Life of Dee exists. And yet the materials for such a Lifeare so abundant that only a selection can be here used. His private diary, forinstance, if properly edited, would supply much supplementary, useful, andinteresting historical information.It is the object of this work to present the facts of John Dee’s life as calmly andimpartially as possible, and to let them speak for themselves. In the course ofwriting it, many false assertions have disentangled themselves from truth, manydoubts have been resolved, and a mass of information sees the light for the firsttime. The subject is of course hedged about with innumerable difficulties; but inspite of the temptations to stray into a hundred bypaths, an endeavour has beenstrictly made to do no more than throw a little dim light on the point where thepaths break off from the main road. If, at the end of the way, any who havepersevered so far, feel they have followed a magnetic and interesting personality,the labour expended will not have been in vain. With a word of apology to serioushistorical readers for the incorrigibly romantic tendency of much of the narrative,which, in spite of the stern sentinel of a literary conscience, would continuallyreassert itself, the story of our astrologer’s strange life may now begin.John Dee was the son of Rowland Dee; he was born in London, according tothe horoscope of his own drawing, on July 13, 1527."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"His mother was Jane, daughter of William Wild. Various Welsh writershave assigned to Dee a genealogical descent of the highest antiquity, and thepedigree which he drew up for himself in later life traces back his family historyfrom his grandfather, Bedo Dee, to Roderick the Great, Prince of Wales. Allauthorities agree that Radnor was the county from whence the Dees sprang.Rowland Dee, the father, held an appointment at Court, as gentleman serverto Henry VIII., but was very indifferently treated by the King. This may partlyaccount for the persistence with which Dee exhibited before Queen Elizabeth hisclaims to preferment at her hands. To be in habitual attendance at Court in thosedays, however, bred in men a great desire for place, and a courtier was but amendicant on a grand scale.The boy, John Dee, was early bred in “grammar learning,” and was inured toLatin from his tender years. Perhaps he was not more than nine or ten when hewas sent to Chelmsford, to the chantry school founded there seven years before thegreat school at Winchester came into existence. The master who presided overDee’s school hours in Essex was Peter Wilegh, whom the chantry commissioners in1548 reported as a man “of good conversation” who had kept the school there forsixteen years. Dee has always been claimed by the Grammar School at Chelmsfordas one of their most famous alumni, whose extraordinary career with its halo ofmystery and marvel they perhaps feel little qualified to explore. Dee’s testimonythat at Chelmsford he was “metely well furnished with understanding of the Latintongue” is an unconscious tribute to Peter Wilegh’s teaching.In November, 1542, Dee, being then fifteen years and four months old, leftChelmsford to enter at St. John’s College, Cambridge, where, as he tells us in hisautobiography, he soon became a most assiduous student. “In the years 1543, 1544,1545, I was so vehemently bent to studie, that for those years I did inviolably keepthis order: only to sleep four houres every night; to allow to meate and drink (andsome refreshing after) two houres every day; and of the other eighteen houres all(except the tyme of going to and being at divine service) was spent in my studies andlearning.” Early in 1546 he graduated B.A. from St. John’s College. At the close ofthe same year, Trinity College was founded by Henry VIII., and Dee was selected oneof the original Fellows. He was also appointed under-reader in Greek to TrinityCollege, the principal Greek reader being then Robert Pember. The young Fellowcreated the first sensation of his sensational career soon after this by arranging someof the (Eirene — Peace) of Aristophanes, in which he apparently acted as stagemanager and carpenter.For this play he devised a clever mechanical and very spectacular effect.Trygaeus, the Attic vine-dresser, carrying a large basket of food for himself, andmounted on his gigantic beetle or scarab (which ate only dung), was seen ascendingfrom his dwelling on the stage to enter the palace of Zeus in the clouds above. Onehas only to think of the scenic effects presented by Faust and Mephistopheles at Mr.Tree’s theatre, for instance, to realise how crude and ineffective these attempts musthave been; but thirty or forty years before Shakespeare’s plays were written, sounusual an exhibition was enough to excite wild rumours of supernatural powers.We hear no more of theatrical performances, although several references in hisafter-life serve to show that his interest in the English drama, about to be born,lagged not far behind that of his greater contemporaries. He does mention,however, a Christmas pastime in St. John’s College, which seems to have been"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"inspired by this same dramatic spirit. Of details we are totally ignorant; he onlyrelates that the custom of electing a “Christmas Magistrate” was varied at hissuggestion by crowning the chosen victim as Emperor. The first imperial presidentof the Christmas revels in St. John’s College “was one Mr. Thomas Dunne, a verygoodly man of person, stature and complexion, and well learned also,” evidently apresence fit for a throne. Dee adds: “They which yet live and were hearers andbeholders, they can testifie more than is meete here to be written of these my boyishattempts and exploites scholasticall.”He turned to sterner studies, and became a skilful astronomer, taking“thousands of observations (very many to the hour and minute) of the heavenlyinfluences and operations actual in this elementall portion of the world.” These heafterwards published in various “Ephemerides.”In May, 1547, Dee made his first journey abroad, to confer with learned menof the Dutch Universities upon the science of mathematics, to which he had alreadybegun to devote his serious attention. He spent several months in the LowCountries, formed close friendships with Gerard Mercator, Gemma Frisius, JoannesCaspar Myricaeus, the Orientalist Antonius Gogava, and other philosophers ofworld-wide fame. Upon his return to Cambridge, he brought with him two greatglobes of Mercator’s making, and an astronomer’s armillary ring and staff of brass,“such as Frisius had newly devised and was in the habit of using.” These heafterwards gave to the Fellows and students of Trinity College; he cites a letter ofacknowledgment from John Christopherson (afterwards Bishop of Chichester), butupon search being made for the objects recently, through the kindness of the Master,it appears they are not now to be found. Dee returned to Cambridge in the year 1548to take his degree of M.A., and soon after went abroad. “And never after that was Iany more student in Cambridge.” Before he left, he obtained under the seal of theVice-Chancellor and Convocation, April 14, 1548, a testimonial to his learning andgood conduct, which he proposed to take with him abroad. Many times did heprove it to be of some value.In Midsummer Term, 1548, he entered as a student at the University ofLouvain, which had been founded more than a hundred years before in this quaintold Brabantian town of mediaeval ramparts and textile industries. At Louvain, Deecontinued his studies for two years, and here he soon acquired a reputation forlearning quite beyond his years. It has been presumed that he here graduated doctor,to account for the title that has always been given him. “Doctor Dee” certainlypossesses an alliterative value not to be neglected. At Cambridge he was only M.A.Long after, when he had passed middle life, and when his remarkable geniusin every branch of science had carried him so far beyond the dull wit of the peoplewho surrounded him that they could only explain his manifestations by the old cryof “sorcery and magic,” Dee made a passionate appeal to the Queen, his constantpatron and employer, to send two emissaries of her own choosing to his house atMortlake, and bid them examine everything they could find, that his charactermight be cleared from the damaging charges laid against him. He prepared for thesetwo commissioners, to whose visit we shall revert in its proper place, anautobiographical document of the greatest value, which he calls “The CompendiousRehearsal of John Dee: his dutiful declaration and proofe of the course and race ofhis studious life, for the space of half an hundred years, now (by God’s favour andhelp) fully spent.” It is from this narrative that the facts of his early life are"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ascertainable. Perhaps we discern them through a faint mist of retrospectiveglorification for which the strange streak of vanity almost inseparable fromattainments like Dee’s was accountable. But there is every reason to reply upon theaccuracy of the mathematician’s story.“Beyond the seas, far and nere, was a good opinion conceived of my studiesphilosophicall and mathematicall.” People of all ranks began to flock to see thiswonderful young man. He gives the names of those who came to Louvain, a fewhours’ journey from Brussels, where the brilliant court of Charles V. was assembled,with evident pride. Italian and Spanish nobles; the dukes of Mantua and MedinaCeli; the Danish king’s mathematician, Mathias Hacus; and his physician, JoannesCapito; Bohemian students, all arrived to put his reputation to the test. Adistinguished Englishman, Sir William Pickering, afterwards ambassador to France,came as his pupil to study astronomy “by the light of Mercator’s globes, the astrolabe,and the astronomer’s ring of brass that Frisius had invented.” For his recreation,the teacher “looked into the method of civil law,” and mastered easily the points ofjurisprudence, even “those accounted very intricate and dark.” It was at Louvain,no doubt, that his interest in the subject of alchemy became strengthened and fixed.Stories were rife of course of the famous alchemist, Henricus Cornelius Agrippa,who had died there, in the service of Margaret of Austria, only a dozen years or sobefore. Agrippa had been secretary to the Emperor Maximilian, had lived in France,London, and Italy, and Louvain, no doubt, was bursting with his extraordinary featsof magic.The two years soon came to an end, and a couple of days after his twenty-thirdbirthday, young Dee left the Low Countries for Paris, where he arrived on July 20,1550. His fame had preceded him, and within a few days, at the request of someEnglish gentlemen and for the honour of his country, he began a course of freepublic lectures or readings in Euclid, “Mathematice, Physice et Pythagorice,” at theCollege of Rheims, in Paris, a thing, he says, which had never been done before inany university in Christendom. His audience (most of them older than himself)was so large that the mathematical schools would not hold them, and many of thestudents were forced in their eagerness to climb up outside the windows, where, ifthey could not hear the lecturer, they could at least see him. He demonstrated uponevery proposition, and gave dictation and exposition. A greater astonishment wascreated, he says, than even at his scarabaeus mounting up to the top of Trinity Hallin Cambridge. The members of the University in Paris at the time numbered over4,000 students, who came from every part of the known world. He made manyfriends among the professors and graduates, friends of “all estates and professions,”several of whose names he gives; among them, the learned writers and theologiansof the day, Orontius, Mizaldus, Petrus Montaureus, Ranconetus (Ranconnet),Fernelius, and Francis Silvius.The fruit of these years spent in Louvain and Paris was that Dee afterwardsmaintained throughout his life a lively correspondence with professors and doctorsin almost every university of note upon the Continent. He names especially hiscorrespondents in the universities of Orleans, Cologne, Heidelberg, Strasburg,Verona, Padua, Ferrara, Bologna, Urbino, Rome, and many others, whose letters layopen for the inspection of the commissioners on that later visit already alluded to.An offer was made him to become a King’s Reader in mathematics in ParisUniversity, with a stipend of two hundred French crowns yearly, but he had made"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"up his mind to return to England, and nothing would tempt him to stay. Hereceived other proposals, promising enough, to enter the service of M. Babeu, M. deRohan, and M. de Monluc, who was starting as special ambassador to the GreatTurk, but his thoughts turned back to England, and thither, in 1551, he bent hissteps.CHAPTER IIIMPRISONMENT AND AUTHORSHIP“A man is but what he knoweth.” — BaconIn December, 1551, Dee obtained, through the offices of Mr. (afterwards Sir)John Cheke, an introduction to Secretary Cecil and to King Edward VI. He hadalready written for and dedicated to the King two books (in manuscript): De usiGlobi Coelestis, 1550, and De nubium, solis, lunae, ac reliquorum planetarum, etc.,1551. These perhaps had been sent to Cheke, the King’s tutor, in the hope that theymight prove useful lesson books. The pleasing result of the dedication was the giftof an annual royal pension of a hundred crowns. This allowance was afterwardsexchanged for the rectory of Upton-upon-Severn, in Worcestershire, which Deefound an extremely bad bargain.From the Beacon Hill above West Malvern Priory, the visitor may turn frominspection of the ancient British camp of Caractacus to admire the magnificent view;and across the level fields where the Severn winds, the tower of Upton church willbe seen rising in the middle distance. Further west, if the day be clear, the moreimposing towers of Tewkesbury and Cloucester may be discerned, while half a turneastward will show Worcester Cathedral, not far away. Dee never lived in thisbeautiful place, although he was presented to the living on May 19, 1553. Evenwhen the rectory of Long Leadenham, in Lincolnshire, was added to Upton, the twotogether were worth only about eighty pounds a year. Next year he declined aninvitation to become Lecturer on Mathematical Science at Oxford, conveyed to himthrough “Mr. Doctor Smith” (Richard, D.C.L., 1528, the reformer), of Oriel College,and “Mr. du Bruarne,” of Christ Church. He was occupied with literary work, andin 1553 produced, among other things, a couple of works on The Cause of Floodsand Ebbs, and The Philosophical and Political Occasions and Names of the HeavenlyAsterismes, both written at the request of Jane, Duchess of Northumberland.When Mary Tudor succeeded her young brother as queen in 1553, Dee wasinvited to calculate her nativity. He began soon after to open up a correspondencewith the Princess Elizabeth, who was then living at Woodstock, and he cast herhoroscope also. Before long he was arrested on the plea of an informant namedGeorge Ferrys, who alleged that oneof his children had been struck blind andanother killed by Dee’s “magic.” Ferrys also declared that Dee was directing hisenchantments against the Queen’s life. Dee’s lodgings in London were searched andsealed up, and he himself was sent to prison. He was examined before the Secretaryof State, afterwards upon eighteen articles by the Privy Council, and at last broughtinto the Star Chamber for trial. There he was cleared of all suspicion of treason, andliberated by an Order in Council. August 29, 1555, but handed over to BishopBonner for examination in matters of religion. Bonner was apparently equallysatisfied. Dee was certainly enjoined by him, at John Philpot’s examination on"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"November 19, 1555, to put questions as a test of his orthodoxy. He quoted St.Cyprian to Philpot, who replied: “Master Dee, you are too young in divinity to teachme in the matters of my faith, though you be more learned in other things.”Dee deserves well of all writers and students for time everlasting because ofhis most praiseworthy efforts to found a State National Library of books andmanuscripts, with copies of foreign treasures, wherever they might be. On January15, 1556, he presented to Queen Mary “a Supplication for the recovery andpreservation of ancient writers and monuments.” Within a few years he had seenthe monasteries dissolved and the priceless collections of these houses lamentablydispersed, some burned and others buried. He drew up a very remarkable address tothe Queen dwelling on the calamity of thus distributing “the treasure of all antiquityand the everlasting seeds of continual excellency within this your Grace’s realm.”Many precious jewels, he knows, have already perished, but in time there may besaved and recovered the remnants of a store of theological and scientific writingswhich are now being scattered up and down the kingdom, some in unlearned men’shands, some walled up or buried in the ground. Dee uses powerful arguments toenforce his plea, choosing such as would make the most direct appeal to both Queenand people. She will build for herself a lasting name and monument; they will beable all in common to enjoy what is now only the privilege of a few scholars, andeven these have to depend on the goodwill of private owners. He proposes first thata commission shall be appointed to inquire what valuable manuscripts exist; thatthose reported on shall be borrowed (on demand), a fair copy made, and if the ownerwill not relinquish it, the original be returned. Secondly, he points out that thecommission should get to work at once, lest some owners, hearing of it, should hideaway or convey away their treasures, and so, he pithily adds, “prove by a certaintoken that they are not sincere lovers of good learning because they will not sharethem with others.” The expenses of the commission and of the copying, etc., heproposed should be borne by the Lord Cardinal and the Synod of the province ofCanterbury, who should also be charged to oversee the manuscripts and bookscollected until a library “apt in all points” is made redy for their reception.Finally, Dee suggests that to him be committed the procuring of copies ofmany famous manuscript volumes to be found in the great libraries abroad: theVatican Library at Rome, St. Mark’s at Venice, and in Bologna, Florence, Vienna, etc.He offers to set to work to obtain these, the expenses only of transcription andcarriage to England to be charged to the State. As to printed books, they are to “begotten in wonderfull abundance.” In this generous offer of his life to be spent intranscribing crabbed manuscripts, we cannot see the restless genius of John Dee longsatisfied, but at any rate he proved himself not seeking for private gain.Thus was the germ of a great National Library first started by the Cambridgemathematician, nearly fifty years before Thomas Bodley opened his uniquecollection at Oxford, and close upon 200 years before there was founded in the capitalthe vast and indispensable book-mine known to all scholars at home and abroad asthe British Museum. The Historical Manuscripts Commission, whose labours incataloguing private collections of archives are also foreshadowed in Dee’ssupplication, only came into being with the appointment of Keepers of the PublicRecords, by an Act signalising the first and second years of Queen Victoria’s reign.It is needless to say that nothing came of Dee’s very disinterested proposition.So he bacame the more industrious in collecting a library of his own, which soon"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"consisted of more than 4,000 volumes, which were always at the disposal of thefriends who came often to see him.They came also for another reason.Astrology was a very essential part of astronomy in the sixteenth century, andthe belief in the controlling power of the stars over human destinies is almost as oldas man himself. The relative positions of the planets in the firmament, theirsituations amongst the constellations, at the hour of a man’s birth, were consideredby the ancients to be dominant factors and influences throughout his whole life. Itis not too much to say that a belief in the truth of horoscopes cast by a skilledcalculator still survives in our Western civilisation as well as in the East. Medicalscience today pays its due respect to astrology in the sign, little altered from theastrological figure for Jupiter, with which all prescriptions are still headed.Dee, as one of the foremost mathematicians and astronomers of the time, andone employed by the Queen, became continually in request to calculate the nativityand cast a horoscope for men and women in all ranks of life. He has left many notesof people’s births; his own children’s are entered with the greatest precision, forwhich a biographer has to thank him.When Elizabeth mounted with firm steps the throne that her unhappy sisterhad found so precarious and uneasy a heritage, Dee was very quickly sought for atCourt. His first commission was entirely sui generis. He was commanded by RobertDudley to name an auspicious day for the coronation, and hs astrologicalcalculations thereupon seem to have impressed the Queen and all her courtiers.Whether or no we believe in the future auguries of such a combination ofinfluences as presided over the selection of the 14th of January, 1559, for the day ofcrowning Elizabeth in Westminster Abbey, we must acknowledge that Dee’s choiceof a date was succeeded by benign and happy destinies.He was then living in London. We do not know where his lodging was, butseveral of the books belonging to his library have come down to us with hisautograph, “Joannes Dee, Londini,” and the dates of the years 1555, 1557, and 1558.Elizabeth sent for him soon after her accession, and invited him to herservice at Whitehall with all fair promises. He was introduced by Dudley, then andlong afterwards her first favourite; so he was likely to stand well. “Where mybrother hath given him a crown,” she said to Dudley, or to Dee’s other sponsor, theEarl of Pembroke, “I will give him a noble.” This was the first of innumerablevague promises made, but it was long indeed before any real and tangible gift wasconferred on the astrologer, although he was continually busied about one thingand another at the fancy of the Queen. The reversion of the Mastership of St.Catherine’s Hospital was promised him, but “Dr. Willson politickly prevented me.”One morning the whole Court and the Privy Council were put into a terribleflutter by a simple piece of what was common enough in ancient times and in Egypt— sympathetic magic. A wax image of the Queen had been found lying in Lincoln’sInn Fields, with a great pin stuck through its breast, and it was supposedundoubtedly to portend the wasting away and death of her Majesty, or some otherdreadful omen. Messenger after messenger was despatched to summon Dee, andbid him make haste. He hurried off, satisfied himself apparently of the harmlessnature of the practical joke, and repaired, with Mr. Secretary Wilson as a witness ofthe whole proceedings and a proof of all good faith, to Richmond, where the Queenwas. The Queen sat in that part of her private garden that sloped down to the river,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"near the steps of the royal landing-place at Hampton Court; the Earl of Leicester (asDudley had now become) was in attendance, gorgeous and insolent as ever; theLords of the Privy Council had also been summoned, when Dee and Mr. Secretaryexpounded the inner meaning of this untoward circumstance, and satisfied andallayed all their fears. Something about the calm attributes of this seasoned andtravelled scholar seemed always to give moral support to the Queen and herhousehold; this is only the first of many occasions when he had to allay theirsuperstitous fright. That she felt it essential to keep him within reach of herself mayhave been one reason for not giving him the appointments for which he, andothers for him, constantly sued. Dee was not an easy person to fit into a living: herequired one with no cure of souls attached; for this, he says, “a cura animarumannexa, did terrfie me to deal with them.” He is called a bachelor of divinity by Foxein 1555, and as a matter of fact he does, both in 1558 and in 1564, add the letters S. D.T. to his name in his printed works. This degree also was not from Cambridge. Atlast he grew tired of waiting, and a certain restlessness in his character, notincompatible with the long patience of the true follower of science, drove him againabroad. His intention was to arrange for printing works already prepared inmanuscript. To search among out-of-the-way bookmongers and book-lovers inhgh- walled German towns, for rare treasures wherewith to enrich ihs nativecountry, was another magnet that drew his feet. In February, 1563, after he had beenthus employed for more than a year, he wrote from the sign of the Golden Angel, inAntwerp, to Cecil, to ask if he was expected to return to England, or if he mightremain to oversee the printing of his books, and continue his researches amongDutch books and scholars. He had intended, he says, to return before Easter, but thiswas now impossible, owing to printer’s delays. When we remember that a hundredyears had barely elapsed since the first metal types had been cast and used in a handpress, it is not wonderful that Dee’s treatise, with its hieroglyphic and cabalisticsigns, took long to print. He announces in the letter to Cecil a great bargain he haspicked up, a work, “for which many a learned man hath long sought and dayley yetdoth seek,” upon cipher writing, viz. Steganographia, by the famous AbbotTrithemius of Wurzburg. It is the earliest elaborate treatise upon shorthand andcipher, a subject in which Cecil was particularly interested. It was then inmanuscript (first printed, Frankfort, 1606). Dee continues that he knows hiscorrespondent will be well acquainted with the name of the book, for the authormentions it in his Epistles, and in both the editions of his Polygraphia. He urges itsclaims upon the future Lord Treasurer, already a statesman of ripe experience, in thefollowing words: “A boke for your honor or a Prince, so meet, so nedefull andcommodious, as in human knowledge none can be meeter or more behovefull. Ofthis boke, either as I now have yt, or hereafter shall have yt, fully wholl and perfect,(yf it peas you to accept my present) I give unto your Honor as the most preciousjuell that I have yet of other mens travailes recovered.”He then goes on to beg the minister and Secretary of State to procure for himthat “learned leisure (dulcia illa ocia) the fruit whereof my country and all therepublic of letters shall justly ascribe to your wisdom and honorable zeal toward theadvancement of good letters and wonderful, divine, and secret sciences.” Dee hadcopied in ten days, “by continual labour,” about half of the book: a Hungariannobleman there has offered to finish the rest, if Dee will remain in Antwerp anddirect his studies for a time."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"“Of this boke the one half (with contynual labour and watch, the most part of10 days) have I copyed oute. and now I stand at the curtesye of a nobleman ofHungary for writing furth the rest; who hath promised me leave thereto, after heshall perceyve that I may remayne by him longer (with the leave of my Prince) topleasure him also with such pointes of science as at my handes he requireth.“I assure you the meanes that I used to cumpas the knowledge where thisman and other such are, and likewise of such book as this, as for this present I haveadvertisement of, have cost me all that ever I could here with honesty borrow,besydes that which (for so short a time intended) I thowght needefull to bring withme, to the value of xxlib. God knoweth my zeale to honest and true knowledg; forwhich my flesh, blud, and bones should make the marchandize, if the case sorequired.”Dee did remain in the Low Countries; he completed his MonasHieroglyphica, dated its prefatory dedication to the Emperor Maximilian II., atAntwerp, January 29, 1564, and added an address to the typographer, his “singulargood friend, Gulielmo Silvio,” dated the following day. the book appeared in April,and he at once journeyed to Presburg, to present a copy to Maximilian. Its twenty-four theorems deal with the variations of the figure represented on our title-page,which may be roughly explained as the moon, the sun, the elements (the cross), andfire as represented by the waving line below. Dee says that many “universitiegraduates of high degree, and other gentlemen, dispraised it because theyunderstood it not,” but “Her Majestie graciously defended my credit in my absencebeyond the seas.” On his return in June she sent for him to Court and desired himto read the book with her. Dee’s account of his regal pupil is given with muchquaintness. “She vouchsafed to account herself my schollar in my book...and saidwhereas I had prefixed in the forefront of the book: Qui non intelligit aut taceat, autdiscat: if I would disclose to her the secrets of that book she would et discere etfacere. Whereupon her Majestie had a little perusion of the same with me, andthen in most heroicall and princely wise did comfort and encourage me in mystudies philosophicall and mathematicall.”[His escort had been required for theMarchioness of Northampton, who was returning from Antwerp to Greenwich. Inreturn for this assistance the lady begged the Queen’s favour for her cavalier.elizabeth was always Dee’s very good friend, and she made a grant to him onDecember 8, 1564, of the Deanery of Gloucester, then void, but other counselsprevailed, and it was soon bestowed on some other man. No doubt theappointment would have given great offence, for the popular eye was alreadybeginning to see in Dee no highly equipped mathematician, geographer andastronomer, but a conjuror and magisian of doubtful reputation, in fact, in thecurrent jargon, one who “had dealings with the devil.” What there had been at thistime to excite these suspicions beyond the fact that Dee was always ready to expounda comet or an eclipse, to cast a horoscope, or explain that the Queen would notimmediately expire because a wax doll with a stiletto in its heart was found under atree, it is hard to say. But that these rumours were extremely persistent is seen bythe astrologer’s defence of himself in the “very fruitfull” preface which he, as thefirst mathematician of the day, was asked to write to Henry Billingsley’s first Englishtranslation of Euclid’s Elements, in February, 1570. This preface must be reckoned as"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"one of Dee’s best achievements, although, as he says, in writing it, “he was sopinched with straightness of time that he could not pen down the matter as hewould.” He points out that Euclid has already appeared in Italian, German, HighDutch, French, Spanish and Portuguese dress, and now at last comes to England.[In spite of its ex parte nature, a study of this preface alone must convince anyreader that thte author was no charlatan or pretender, but a true devotee of learning,gifted with a far insight into human progress. He covers in review every art andscience then known, and some “until these our daies greatly missed” (his commentson music and harmony are truly remarkable), and comes back to his ownpredilection — arithmetic, “which next to theologie is most divine, most pure, mostample and generall, most profound, most subtele, most commodious and mostnecessary.” He quotes Plato to show how “it lifts the heart above the heavens byinvisible lines, and by its immortal beams melteth the reflection of lightincomprehensible, and so procureth joy and perfection unspeakable.” Speaking ofthe refraction of light, he foreshadows the telescope as he describes how the captainof either foot or horsemen should emply “an astronomical staffe commodiouslyframed for carriage and use, and may wonderfully help himself by perspectiveglasses; in which I trust our posterity will prove more skilfull and expert and togreater purpose than in these days can almost be credited to be possible.” Then healludes to a wonderful glass belonging to Sir William P., famous for his skill inmathematics, who will let the glass be seen. The passage seems to show thatlooking-glasses were not common, or that this particular one was a convex mirror.“A man,” he says, “may be curstly afraid of his own shadow, yea, so much tofeare, that you being alone nere a certain glasse, and proffer with dagger or sword tofoyne at the glasse, you shall suddenly be moved to give back (in maner) by reasonof an image appearing in the ayre betweeene you and the glasse, with like hand,sword or dagger, and with like quickness foyning at your very eye, like as you do atthe glasse. Strange this is to heare of, but more mervailous to behold than these mywordes can signifie, nevertheless by demonstration opticall the order and causethereof is certified, even so the effect is consequent.”This mirror was given to Dee not long afterwards.From optics he passes on to mechanics, and mentions having seen at Praguemills worked by water, sawing “great and long deale bordes, no man being by.” Hedescribes accurately a diving chamber supplied with air, and sums up some of themechanical marvels of the world: — the brazen head made by Albertus Magnus,which seemed to speak; a strange “self-moving” which he saw at St. Denis in 1551;images seen in the air by means of a perspective glass; Archimedes’ sphere; thedove of Archytas; and the wheel of Vulcan, spoken of by Aristotle; and comes downto recent workmanship in Nuremberg, where an artificer let fly an insect of iron,that buzzed about the guests at table, and then returned “to his master’s hand agayneas though it were weary.” All these things are easily achieved he says, by “skill, willindustry and ability duly applied to proof.” “But is any honest student, or a modestChristian philosopher, to be, for such like feats, mathematically and mechanicallywrought, counted and called a conjuror? Shall the folly of idiots and the mallice ofthe scornfull so much prevaile that he who seeketh no worldly gaine or glory attheir hands, but onely of God the Threasor of heavenly wisdom and knowledge of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"pure veritie, shall he, I say, in the mean space, be robbed and spoiled of his honestname and fame? He that seeketh, by S. Paul’s advertisement in the creatures’properties and wonderfull vertues, to find juste cause to glorifie the eternall andAlmightie Creator by, shall that man be condemned as a companion of Hell-houndsand a caller and conjuror of wicked damned spirits?” Then he recounts his years ofstudy, and asks, “Should I have fished with so large and costly a nett, and been solong time drawing, even with the helpe of Lady Philosophie and Queen Theologie,and at length have catched but a frog, nay a Devill?...How great is the blindness andboldness of the multitude in things above their capacitie!”[Then he refers tosome who have appeared against him in print.“O my unkind countrymen. O unnatural Countrymen, O unthankfullcountrymen, O brainsicke, Rashe, spitefull and disdainfull countrymen. Whyoppresse you me thus violently with your slaundering of me, contrary to veritie,and contrary to your own conscience? And I, to this hower, neither by worde, deedeor thought, have bene anyway hurtfull, damageable, or injurious to you or yours!Have I so long, so dearly, so farre, so carefully, so painfully, so dangerously foughtand travailed for the learning of wisedome and atteyning of vertue, and in the endam I become worse than when I began? Worse than a madman, a dangerousmember in teh Commonwelath and no Member of the Church of Christ? Call youthis to be learned? Call you this to be a philosopher and a lover of wisdome?”He goes on to speak of examples before his time to whom in godliness andlearning he is not worthy to be compared: — ”patient Socrates,” Apuleius, JoannesPicus and Trithemius, Roger Bacon, “the flower of whose worthy fame can neverdye nor wither,” and ends by summing up the people who can conceive nothingoutside the compass of their capacity as of four sorts: — ”vain prattling busybodies,fond friends, imperfectly zealous, and malicious ignorant.” Of these he is inclinedto think the fond friends the most damaging, for they overshoot the mark and relatemarvels and wonderful feats which were never done, or had any spark of likelihoodto be done, in order that other men may marvel at their hap to have such a learnedfriend.[The eloquent irony of this passage seems equalled only by itsextraordinary universality, its knowledge of human character and its highphilosophic spirit. At what a cost did a seeker after scientific truths follow hiscalling in the sixteenth century!CHAPTER IIIMORTLAKE“In her princely countenance I never perceived frown toward me, ordiscontented regard or view on me, but at all times favourable and gracious, to thejoy and comfort of my true, faithful and loyal heart.” — DEE, of Queen Elizabeth.The promised benefice did not yet come, although Dee’s friends at Court wereall busy on his behalf. Either now or later, he was actually mentioned as Provost ofEton, and the Queen “answered favourably.” Mistress Blanche Parry and MistressScudamore, lady-in-waiting to Anne, Countess of Warwick, urged his claims for the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Mastership of St. Cross at Winchester, which it was thought Dr. Watson would soonvacate. But all he seems to have obtained was a fresh dispensation from MatthewParker, Archbishop of Canterbury, to enjoy the two Midland rectories for ten years.[He continued his literary work, and beside writing new manuscript treatises,bethought himself of an old one, which although printed had not received greatattention. This was the Propoedeumata Aphoristica (London, 1558), dedicated to hisold and dear friend and fellow-student at Louvain, Mercator, “my Gerard,” as heaffectionately calls him. In January, 1568, Dee presented a copy of a new edition,with an address to the studious and sincere philosophical reader, dated December 24,1567, from “our museum” at Mortlake, to “Mr. Secretary Cecil, now LordTreasurer.” Two copies were given at the same time to the Earl of Pembroke, onefor him to use or give away at his pleasure, the other, by Cecil’s advice, to bepresented by him to the Queen. Within three days, Dee heard from Pembroke thatshe had graciously accepted and well liked his book. This gratifying informationwas rendered acceptable by a gift: — ”He gave me very bountifully in his ownebehalf xxlib. to requite such my reverent regard of his honour.”[An interview withthe Queen followed on February 16, at 2 o’clock, when there was talk between themin the gallery at Westminster “of the great secret for my sake to be disclosed unto herMajesty by Nicholas Grudius, sometime one of the secretaries to the EmperorCharles V.” Of this alchemical secret, no doubt concerning transmutation, Deewrites after, “What was the hinderance of the perfecting of that purpose, God bestknoweth.”[He was now over forty, and had a natural desire to range himself andhouse his library. Before 1570 he took up his abode with his mother, in a housebelonging to her at Mortlake, on the river Thames. It was an old rambling place,standing west of the church between it and the river. Dee added to it by degrees,purchasing small tenements adjoining, so that at length it comprised laboratoriesfor his experiments, libraries and rooms for a busy hive of workers and servants.Mrs. Dee occupied a set of rooms of her own. Nothing of the old premises nowremains, unless it be an ancient gateway leading from the garden towards the river.After Dee’s death the house passed through an interesting phase of existence, beingadapted by Sir Francis Crane for the Royal tapestry works, where, encouraged by ahandsome grant of money and orders from the parsimonious James, suits ofhangings of beautiful workmanship were executed under the eye of Francis Cleyne,a “limner,” who was brought over from Flanders to undertake the designs. At theend of the eighteenth century, a large panelled room with red and white roses,carved and coloured, was still in existence. Early in the nineteenth century thehouse was used for a girls’ school, kept by a Mrs. Dubois.[Here Dee took up hisabode. Its nearness to London and to the favourite places of Elizabeth’s residence —Greenwich, Hampton Court, Sion House, Isleworth, and Nonsuch — was at firstconsidered a great advantage, and the journey to and from London was almostinvariably made by water. The Queen desired her astrologer to be near at hand.When he fell dangerously ill at Mortlake in 1571, after a tedious journey abroad intothe duchy of Lorraine on some mysterious errand, Elizabeth sent down two of herown physicians, Doctors Atslowe and Balthorp, to attend him. Lady Sidney was alsodespatched with kind, and gracious, and “pithy” messages from the sovereign, anddelicacies, “divers raretiess,” were supplied from the royal table to supplement hismother’s provision for the invalid. The Queen seems to have felt a specialobligation to look after him, as she had sent him on some mission of her own,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"which probably we shall not be far wrong in thinking connected with Dee’salchemistic experiments. Every Court in Europe at this time had astrologers andalchemists in its employ, and the Queen and Burleigh were as anxious as Dee thathe should really attain the ever-elusive secret of transmutation. Dee had of coursecarried the Queen’s passport for himself and a couple of servants, with horses, andhad obtained permits through foreign ambassadors in London to travel freelythrough various countries.[Dee was now bent on rather a strange form ofpublic service. On October 3, 1574, he wrote a very remarkable letter to LordBurleigh of four and a half folio pages in that best printed hand of his which offersno excuse for skipping. His own paramount deserts are very naturally one of themain subjects. He has spent all his money and all his life in attaining knowledge.“Certes, by due conference with all that ever I yet met with in Europe, the poorEnglish Bryttaine (Il favorita di vostra Excellentia) hath carried the Bell away. GodAlmighty have the glory.” If he had only a sufficiency of two or three hundredpounds a year, he could pursue science with ease. Failing that, there is another way.Treasure trouve is a very casual thing, and the Queen is little enriched thereby, inspite of her royal prerogative. No one knows this better than the Lord Treasurer.Now, if her Majesty will grant him, but Letters Patent under her hand and seal, theright for life to all treasure he can find, he promises to give Burleigh one half, and ofcourse to render to the Queen and Commonwealth the proportion that is theirs. Itis not the gold, as wealth, that appeals to this man of books and stars: —“The value of a mine is matter for King’s Treasure, but a pott of two or threehundred pounds hid in the ground, wall, or tree, is but the price of a good book, orinstrument for perspective astronomy, or some feat of importance.”He has spent twenty years in considering the subject; people from all partshave consulted him about dreams, visions, attractions and demonstrations ofsympathia et antipathia rerum;” but it is not likley he would counsel them toproceed without permission from the State. Yet what a loss is here!“Obscure persons, as hosiers or tanners, can, under color of seeking assays ofmetalls for the Saymaster, enojoy libertie to dig after dreamish demonstrations ofplaces. May not I then, in respect of my payns, cost, and credit in mattersphilosophical and mathematicall, if no better or easier turn will fall to my Lot fromher Majestie’s hands, may I not then be thought to mean and intend good servicetoward the Queen and this realm, yf I will do the best I can at my own cost andcharge to discover and deliver true proofe of a myne, vayn, or ore of gold or silver,in some place of her Grace’s kingdom, for her Grace’s only use?”The Society of Royal Mines had been incorporated May 28, 1565, and theQueen had granted patents to Germans and others to dig for mines and ores. It waswell known that the country abounded in hidden treasure. The valuables of themonasteries had been, in many cases, hastily buried before the last abbot was ejectedat the dissolution. The subject had a special fascination for Dee, who was consciousof a “divining rod” power to discover the hiding places. He made a curious diagramof ten localities, in various counties, marked by crosses, near which he believedtreasure to lie concealed. He ends his letter to Burleigh with a more practical and"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"much more congenial request. He has been lately at Wigmore Castle, and has seen aquantity of parchments and papers from which he has copied accounts, obligations,acquittances. Will the Treasurer give him a letter to Mr. Harley, keeper of therecords there, asking permission to examine them and report as to the contents?“My fantasy is I can get from them, at my leisure, matter for chronicle or pedigree, byway of recreation.” So he ends with an apology for his long letter and is “youLordship’s most bownden John Dee.”Nothing seems to have resulted from this letter at the time; later he didreceive a grant of royalties from a mine.in 1575 Dee married. He seems to have had no time for such an event before.He was now in his forty-eighth year, and did not execute the fatal folly (which, in hisCourt life, he had seen many times exemplified) of commiting the indiscretion firstand informing the Queen after. He duly laid before her his intention, and receivedin return a “very gracious letter of credit for my marriage.” He also hadcongratulatory epistles from Leicester and from Christopher Hatton.The Queen, when out riding in Richmond Park with her lords and ladies,would sometimes pass through the East Sheen Gate, down the hill towards theriver, and would stop at the house between Mortlake Church and the Thames,desiring to be shown the latest invention of her astrologer, or the newest acquisitionof his library. On the afternoon of one such windy day in march, 1576, she arrived ata slightly unlucky moment, for Dee’s young wife, after a year of marriage, had justdied, and not four hours earlier had been carried out of the house for burial in thechurchyard opposite. Hearing this, Elizabeth refused to enter, but bade Dee fetch hisfamous glass and explain its properties to her outside in the field. SummoningLeicester to her assistance, she alighted from her horse by the church wall, wasshown the wonderful convex mirror, admired the distorted image of herself, andfinally rode away amused and merry, leaving the philosopher’s distress at his recentbereavement assuaged for the moment by such gracious marks of royal interest andfavour. And so this wraith of Dee’s first wife fades away in the courtly picture, andwe do not even know her name.He turned more than ever to literary work and followed up the scholasticbooks dedicated to the young King Edward VI. and the studies of astrologicalhieroglyphs with books of another kind. To this year of historical labours, perhaps,belongs a letter from Dee to his “loving friend,” Stow, the historian. Contrary toDee’s careful practice, it is undated, save for day and month, “this 5th of December.”He has evidently been the means of introducing a fellow-author in influentialquarters, for he says, “My friend, Mr. Dyer, did deliver your books to the two Earls,who took them thankfully, but, as he noted, there was no reward commanded ofthem. What shall be hereafter, God knoweth. So could not I have done.” Then headjures Stow to “hope as well as I,” and turns from considering fruits to the sourcesof their toil. He sends a list of the varius ports, including the Cinque Ports, thathave a mayor or bailey, all except Gravesend, which has a portreeve. Stow may getfuller information, “the very true plat,” from Lord Cobham’s secretary. He returns amanuscript of Asser’s Saxon Chronicle; “it is not of the best and perfectest copy. Ihad done iwth it in an hour. If you have Floriacensis Wigornensis [the Chronicle ofFlorence of Worcester] I would gladly see him a little.”"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Stow, like Dee, was a Londoner and, within a year or two, of the same age. Hehad already published his Annals of England, which had then gone through foureditions.Dee now began to keep a diary of his doings, written in the pages and marginsof three fat quarto almanacs, bound in sheepskin and clasped. Quotations haveperhaps already shown that his style, his spelling, his use of words, is that we expectfrom a man of his wide culture and reading. He was of the new learning, thoughbefore Shakespeare and Bacon. He had also two or more distinct handwritings, aroman hand with neat printed letters, and a scribbling hand. In the former all hismanuscript works and his letters are written; his diary is in the last. This diary wasquite unnoticed until about 1835, when the almanacs were discovered at Oxford inthe Ashmolean Library, having been acquired by Elias Ashmole, a devout believerin hermetic philosophy and collector of all alchemical writings. They weretranscribed (very inaccurately) by J.O. Halliwell and printed by the Camden Societyin 1842.The books contain a strange medley of borrowings and lendings, births anddeaths, illnesses, lawsuits, dreams and bickerings; observations of stars, eclipses andcomets, above all of the weather (for Dee was a great meteorologist), of horoscopes,experiments in alchemy and topographical notes. Here are some of the earliestentries: —“1577. Jan. 16. The Earl of Leicester, Mr. Philip Sidney, and Mr. Dyer, etc.,came to my house.” This was Edward Dyer, Sidney’s friend, afterwards to bedramatically associated with Dee and kelley in their reputed discovery of the secretof makig gold. “Feb. 19th. great wynde S.W., close, clowdy. March 11. My fall uponmy right knucklebone about 9 o’clock. Wyth oyle of Hypericon in 24 hours easedabove all hope. God be thanked for such his goodness to his creatures! March 12.Abrahamus Ortelius me invisit Mortlakii.” This interesting visit from the greatDutch map-maker is entirely omitted in the printed diary. “May 20. I hyred thebarber of Chyswick, Walter Hooper, to kepe my hedges and knots in as good order ashe seed them then, and that to be done with twise cutting in the year, at the least,and he to have yearlly five shillings and meat and drink.”Then he speaks of a visitor, Alexander Simon, who comes from persia, andhas promised his “service” on his return, probably to assist with information onEastern lore and wisdom. His friend and neighbour, William Herbert, sends himnotes upon his already published Monas. Another work is ready for press, and he isconstrained to raise money, whether for the printing or other expenses. In June heborrowed 40 pounds from one, 20 pounds from another, and 27 pounds upon “thechayn of gold.” On August 19, his new book is put to printing (one hundred copies)at John Day’s press in Aldersgate.This was another of those works, so pithy and so alive in their remarkableapplication to the future, which have fallen with their author into undeservedneglect. Dee had made suggestions about supplying officers of the army withperspective glasses as part of their equipment. Now his friendship with the Gilberts,Davis, Hawkins, Frobisher, and others off the great sea-captains, drew his attentionto the sister service and the sea power of “this blessed isle of Albion.” He had spentmost of the previous year (1576) in writing a series of volumes to be entitled“General and Rare Memorials pertayning to the perfect art of Navigation.” The first"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"volume, The British Monarchy, or Hexameron Brytannicum, was finished inAugust. It was dedicated to Christopher Hatton in some verses beginning: —“If privat wealth be leef and deereTo any wight on British soyl,Ought public weale have any peere?To that is due all wealth and toyle.Whereof such lore as I of lateHave lern’d, and for security,By godly means to Garde this state,To you I now send carefully.”The intention is better than the lines. Dee was no poet, and even a badversifier, but he would not have been a true Elizabethan had he not on specialoccasions dropped into rhyme, like the rest of his peers.The second volume, The British Complement, “larger in bulk than theEnglish Bible,” was written in the next four months and finished in December. Itwas never published; its author tells us it would cost many hundreds of pounds toprint, because of the tables and figures requisite, and he must first have a“comfortable and sufficient opportunity or supply thereto.” The necessary fundswere never forthcoming, and the book remained in manuscript. A considerablepart of it is devoted to an exposition of the “paradoxall” compass which its authorhad invented in 1557.The third volume was mysterious; it wsa to be “utterly suppressed ordelivered to Vulcan his custody.” The fourth was Famous and Rich Discoveries, abook, he thinks, “for British Honour and Wealth, of as great godly pleasure asworldly profit and delight.” It was a work of great historical research which neversaw the light.The prejudice against Dee was so strong, and he was so much misunderstood,some persons openly attributing his works to other writers, others accusing him ofselfishly keeping all his knowledge to himself, many perverting his meaningthrough ignorance, and again one, a Dutch philosopher, publishing a treatise whichwas in substance a repetition of his, that he determined to withhold his name fromthe publication. The anonymity is not, however, very well maintained, for Deeused the flimsy device of a preface to the reader by an “unknown friend,” in whichall the griefs and ill usages of that “harmless and courteous gentleman,” “thatextraordinary studious gentleman,” the author, are freely aired. Under the thindisguise, Dee’s high opinion of his own merits peeps, nay stares, out. Slanders havebeen spread against him, a damaging letter counterfeited by Vincent Murphy, hisname and fame injured; he has been called “the arch-conjurer of the wholekingdom.” “Oh, a damnable sklander,” he bursts out, “utterly untrue in the wholeand in every worde and part thereof, as before the King of Kings will appear at thedreadful day.” It is no conceit on Dee’s part, with his European reputation, to saythat he “had at God his most mercifull handes received a great Talent of knowledgeand sciences, after long and painful and costly travails.” And he goes on to say thathe is both warned by God and of of his own disposition to enlarge the same and tocommunicate it to others, but now he finds himself discouraged; he cannot “sayl"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"against the winds eye,” or pen any more treatises for his disdainful and unthankfulcountrymen to use or abuse, or put his name to any writing. The unknown friendhas no desire to flatter the studious gentleman, but considering all his contributionsto learning, he may honestly say, without arrogancy and with great modesty, that “ifin the foresaid whole course of his tyme he had found a constant and assistantChristian Alexander, Brytain should now now have been destitute of a ChristianAristotle”!But he soon gets engrossed in his subject, whichis to urge the importance ofestablishing “a Petty Navy Royall, of three score tall ships or more, but in no casefewer,” of 80 to 200 tons burden, to be thoroughly equipped and manned “as a cinfirtabd safeguard to the Realme.” He shows the security it would give to or merchants,the usefulness in “deciphering our coasts,” sounding channels and harbours,observing of tides. Thousands of soldiers, he says, “will thus be hardened and wellbroke to the rage and disturbance of the sea, so that in time of need we shall not beforced to use all fresh-water Soldyers,” but we shall have a crew of “hardy sea-soldyers” ready to hand. This is interesting as showing that the word “sailor” wasnot yet in use. Then he touches on the question of unemployment: “hundreds oflusty handsome men will this way be well occupied and have needful maintenance,which now are idle or want sustenance, or both.” “These skilful sea-soldyers will bemore traynable to martiall exploits, more quick-eyed and nimble [he quotes Periclesfor this], than the landsmen.” The Petty Navy Royall, as apart from the Grand NavyRoyall, will look after pirates, will protest our valuable fisheries, and generally serveus in better stead than four such forts as “Callys or Bulleyn.” Coming to thefinancial side, he asserts that every natural born subject of this “British Empire” willwillingly contribute towards this “perpetual benevolence for sea security” thehundredth penny of his rents and revenues, the five hundredth penny of his goodsvaluation, for the first seven years, and for the second seven the hundred andfiftieth penny and the seven hundred and fiftieth penny of goods valuation, thesame, after fourteen years, to be commuted for ever to half the original contribution.He calculated this tax would amount to 100,000 pounds or over. If that is notsufficient, he would exact a second tax (exempting all such counties, towns, and thefive ports, as have Letters Patent for such immunity) of the six hundredth penny ofevery one’s goods and revenues. He would have twenty victualling ports, in everypart of the kingdom, “the incredible abuses of purveyors duly reformed.” He wouldhave a stop put to carrying our gunpowder and saltpetre out of the realm. “GoodGod,” he cries, “who knoweth not what proviso is made and kept in other CommonWeales against armour carrying out of their Limits?” He speaks of many hundredpieces of ordnance lately carried out of the kingdom, so that we must make new;and deplores the wholesale destruction of our forests and timber (which is neededfor ships) to keep the iron works going. Then he foreshadows the Trinity House byasking for a “Grand Pilot generall of England.” He outlines a scheme of navypensions, and in relation to the fisheries quotes sanitary statutes of Richard II. Hedevotes a chapter to the history of “that peaceable and provident Saxon, KingEdgar,” his “yearly pastime of sailing round this island in summer, guarded by hisfleet of 4,000 sail,” and speaks of the efficiency of Edgar’s navy and the maintenanceof his forts upon the coast. Then he passes to his final argument. We must attainthis “incredible political mystery” — the supermacy of our sea power. We must be“Lords of the Seas” in order that out “wits and travayles” may be employed at home"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"for the enriching of the kingdom, that “our commodities (with due store reserve)may be carried abroad,” and that peace and justice may reign. “For we must keepour own hands and hearts from doing or intending injury to any foreigner on sea orland.”Enough has been said of this book, perhaps, to show that it is a remarkablecontribution towards the history of the navy and the fishing industries of Britain. Itmay be contended that if within twelve years England could offer a crushing defeatto the greatest sea power of the world, and establish herself mistress of the seas, shewas not in need of theoretical advice from a landsman on the subject, but at any rateDee’s treatise voices the ideals of the times, the hopes that inspired all true lovers oftheir country and of their Queen in the sixteenth century. In the thunders of theArmada they were to be realised.CHAPTER IVJANE DEE“Content I live, this is my stay,I seek no more than may suffice;I press to bear no haughty sway,Look, what I lack my mind supplies:Lo! thus I triumph like a king,Content with that my mind doth bring.” — Sir Edward Dyer.That October the Queen and the whole Court were thrown into a perturbedstate of mind by a strange appearance in the heavens. This was the comet which theSwedish astronomer, Kepler, declared to predict the appearance in the north ofEurope of a prince who should lay waste all Germany, and should vanish in 1632. Itwas lucky for his prognostications that Gustavus Adolphus was really borninFinland, did embroil Central Europe in the Thirty Years’ War, and did die in 1632.What the “blazing star,” as they called it, foreboded, no one at Court couldtell; Dee was summoned forthwith to expound the phenomenon. “Her Majestietook great pleasure to hear my opinion, for the judgment of some had unduly bredgreat fear and doubt in many of the Court, being men of no small account. For threediverse dayes she did use me.” Dee did not forget to urge his suit to the Queen, notso much this time for preferment but for protection.“Her Majestie promised unto me great security against any of her kingdomthat would by reason of any my rare studies and philosophical exercises unduly seekmy overthrow. Whereupon I again to her Majestie made a very faithful andinviolable promise of great importance. The first part whereof, God is my witness Ihave truely and sincerely performed; tho’ it be not yet evident, how truely, or ofwhat incredible value. The second part, by God his great mercies and helps, may indue time be performed, if my plat for the meanes be not misused or defaced.”Nearly two years passed before Dee married his second wife,Jane Fromond, of East Cheam, Surrey. She was a lady-in-waiting"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"at the Court to Lady Howard of Effingham, wife of the LordAdmiral (Charles Howard) who was afterwards in command of thefleet victorious against the “invincible” Spanish Armada. LadyHoward proved a true friend both to Jane and her elderly butlearned husband throughout the rest of her life.He paid a long visit to the Court at Windsor a couple of months before themarriage, staying there from November 22 to December 1, 1577, and recordsinterviews with the Queen on various days, and with “Mr. Secretary Walsingham.”It may be presumed that the marriage was then arranged, for without the Queen’sconsent it could never have taken place. Just before leaving, he had a conversationwith Sir Christopher Hatton, the newly-made knight of that day (December 1).The marriage took place on February 5, 1578, at one o’clock, as the bridegroomtells in his diary, but at what church he omits to say. Perhaps it took place in a RoyalChapel at Court. The young bride was twenty-two. She was a clever, well-bornwoman, hasty and quick-tempered, but of a steadfast and thorough faithfulness. Itwas no easy task to be the wife of a brilliant and erudite mathematician nearly thirtyyears her senior, but to the end of her days Jane proved herself a true and fittinghelpmate, a most careful and devoted mother to her eight children. Little could shehave foreseen at this bridal hour into what strange paths the coming years wouldlead her. Dee’s devotion to his Jane, his growing respect for her force of character, isfaithfully reflected in his diary, where every detail of her doings and her health isstudiously entered.Before the end of the year, he had to leave home and undertake a suddenjourney abroad at the command of the Queen’s ministers. Elizabeth, in spite of aniron constitution, was ill and distracted with toothache and rheumatic pains. Shehad come to Richmond from Greenwich on September 25, and the next day the fineweather broke up. “The first rayn that came for many a day,” says Dee, “all pastureabout us was withered. Rayn in afternone like Aprile showres.” A week or twoafter this he was summoned to Hampton Court, and had a conference of two hourswith the Queen, from nine to eleven in the morning. Dr. Bayly, the Queen’sphysician, came to Mortlake on October 16 to consult with him, for his profoundhermetic studies gave him all the prestige of a super-doctor. On the 22nd Jane (Deestill writes of her as “Jane Fromonds,” probably to distinguish her from his mother,Jane Dee) went to Hampton Court. She found the Queen no better, in fact a worsefit of paint than ever occurred on the 25th, lasting from nine in the evening till aftermidnight. On the 28th, Leicester and Walsingham decided to send Dee abroad toconsult with some foreign physician about the malady. He was given hisinstructions at nine o’clock on November 4th; on the 7th he reached Gravesend,and sailed from Lee onthe 9th. By three o’clock on the 14th, he was in Hamburg; inBerlin on December 6; and on the 11th at Frankfurt-upon-Oder. The entry on the15th, “newes of Turnifer’s comming, 8 o’clock, by a speciall messenger,” looks as ifthe object of his journey was attained. There are no more details of the business.The diary is resumed in March, 1579, with some trivial entries about hisshowing Mr. John Lewis and his son, the physician, how to draw aromatical oils,and a note of his cat getting a young fledgling sparrow that `had never had but one— the right — wing, naturally.”Dee’s mother surrendered to him on June 15, 1579, the house and lands atMortlake, with reversion to his wife Jane, and to his heirs and assigns after him, for"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"ever. The document was delivered to him by a surveyor from Wimbledon (inwhich parish Mortlake was included) under the tree by the church. The fine for thesurrender — twenty shillings — was paid to the Queen, as Lady of the Manor, onOctober 31.A month later, on his fifty-second birthday, July 13, 1579, Dee’s eldest son,Arthur, was born. The event was coincident with another, for that same night, atten o’clock, Jane’s father, Mr. Fromond (Dee always adds an “s” to the name), wasseized with a fit and rendered speechless; he died on Tuesday, the 14th, at four in themorning. Arthur was christened at three o’clock on the 16th; Edward Dyer and “Mr.Doctor Lewis, judge of the Admiralty,” were his godfathers; his godmother was oneof Dee’s Welsh relations, “my cosen, Mistress Blanche Parry, of the Queen’s PrivyChamber.” She was represented by another cousin, Mistress Aubrey, from Kew.“August 9. Jane Dee churched,” is almost the next thing recorded.Dyer was already a person in considerable favour with the Queen. He wasSidney’s great friend, and after the poet’s death on the field of Zutphen, was legateeof half his books. Dyer was no mean poet himself, even among his greatercompeers. He is the author of those immortal verses on “Contentment,” beginning“My mind to me a kingdom is,” which were set to music in 1588 by William Byrd.We shall meet him again in these pages.Dee of course knew all about Elizabeth’s long flirtation with the King ofFrance’s brother, Duc d’Alencon, and her diplomatic holding off from the match.He notes Mr. Stafford’s arrival as an emissary from “Monsieur.” The Queen kept avery tender spot in her heart for this ugly little deformed suitor, and Dee has aremarkable note of a call from her at Mortlake as she returned from Walsingham’son February 11, 1583: “Her Majesty axed me obscurely of Monsieur’s state. I said hewas “ (dead-alive).Pupils now began to resort to Dee. “John Elmeston, student of Oxford, cam tome for dialling.” “Mr. Lock brought Benjamin his sonne to me: his eldest sonnealso, called Zacharie, cam then with him.” This was Michael Lock, the traveller.Zachary was the eldest of Lock’s fifteen children; Benjamin afterwards wrote onalchemy — A Picklock for Ripley’s Castle.It was a stormy October, of continuous rains and floods for three or four daysand nights, and a “raging wynde at west and southerly.” Six persons were drownedin the Kew ferry boat, “by reason of the vehement and high waters overwhelmingthe boat aupon the roap, but the negligens of the ferryman set there to help.” Mrs.Dee had a strange dream that “one cam to her and touched her, saying, `MistressDee, you are conceived of child, whose name must be Zacharias; be of good chere, hesal do well, as this doth.’“ This, meaning Arthur, had a sharp illness soon after,however, and when the next child arrived, in two years’ time, it chanced to be a girl,who was named Katherine. So the dream went by contraries after all. Arthur wasweaned in August, and his nurse discharged, with her wages, ten shillings, for thequarter ending at Michaelmas, paid in full. Dee is an exact accountant as well asdiarist, and enters every payment with precise care.The Queen came riding down from Richmond in her coach, to see what herastrologer was doing, on Septermber 17, 1580, and put the household in a flutter.She took"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"“The higher way of Mortlake field, and when she came right against thechurch, she turned down toward my house. And when she was against my gardenin the field, her Majestie stayed there a good while, and then came into the field atthe great gate of the field, where her Majestie espied me at the door, makingreverent and dutiful obeysance unto her; and with her hand, her Majestie beckonedfor me to come to her, and I came to her coach side; her Majesty then very speedilypulled off her glove and gave me her hand to kiss; and to be short, her Majestiewilled me to resort oftener to her Court, and by some of her Privy Chamber to giveher to weete when I am there.”One can picture the gorgeously dressed and pearl-bedecked Queen, herauburn hair glistening in the sun, beckoning majestically to her astrologer, biddinghim attend and swell the troops of courtiers and admirers, demanding imperiouslyto be let know when he came, and to be kept informed of all he did. Dee was ahandsome man, tall and slender; he wore a beard, pointed and rather long. Amongthe crowd of personable courtiers in their rich and most becoming suits, he wouldbe no inconspicuous figure.It was perhaps the publication of the first volume of the “General and RareMemorials pertayning to the art of perfect Navigation” that brought Dee intointimate relations with the navigators of the time. Or it may have been hisintimacy with them that suggested the work. the Hexameron appeared inSeptember, 1577, and in November the diarist first records a visit from one of them:“Sir Umfrey Gilbert cam to me at Mortlake.” Gilbert was then living at Limehouse,engaged in writing discourses on naval strategy and discovery. A few months later,Dee mentions a suggestion he gave to Richard Hakluyt, the author of the fascinatinghistories of the voyages: “I told Mr. Daniel Rogers, Mr. Hakluyt of the MiddleTemple being by, that Kyng Arthur and King Mary, both of them, did conquerGelindia, lately called Friseland, which he so noted presently in his written copy ofMonumenthensis, for he had no printed book thereof.” On August 5, one ofGilbert’s company, “Mr. Reynolds of Bridewell, tok his leave of me as he passedtoward Dartmouth to go with Sir Umfrey Gilbert toward Hochelaga.” Theexpedition sailed from Dartmouth on September 23, Sir Humphrey having obtainedhis long-coveted charter to plant a colony in the New World in June. All his moneywas sunk in this unfortunate expedition, which only met diasaster at the hands of aSpanish fleet. Undaunted, however, Sir Humphrey set to work to collect morefunds and information to pursue his end. With the first Dee could not help himmuch; with the last he believed he could, and in return he exacted a stake in theresults: “1580, Aug. 28th. my dealing with Sir Humfrey Gilbert graunted me myrequest to him made by letter, for the royalties of discovery all to the north abovethe parallell of the 50 degree of latitude, in the presence of Stoner, Sir John Gilberthis servant or reteiner; and thereupon took me by the hand with faithful promises,in his lodging of Cooke’s house in Wichcross Streete, where we dyned, onely usthree together, being Satterday.”It was more than two years before Gilbert succeeded in getting enough otherpersons to embark their capital in his project, and then he set out on his finalvoyage, the second to Newfoundland (the first having been assisted by Raleigh, hishalf-brother, in 1578). We all know the end, how, after he had planted “his raw"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"colony of lazy landsmen, prison birds and sailors,” he set out in his little vessel, TheSquirrel, to explore the coast and sandbanks between Cape Breton Island andNewfoundland, and then headed for England. In a storm off the Azores, the littleship foundered and ws lost, its captain’s last words being, “We are as near Heaven bysea as by land.”With another brother, Adrian Gilbert, Dee had much closer relations, as weshall shortly see. This younger half-brother of Sir Walter Raleigh was reputed “agreat chemist in those days,” which of course meant something of an alchemist. Heis associated in one’s mind with “Sidney’s sister, Pembroke’s mother,” thataccomplished and beautiful inspirer of the most exquisite epitaph ever penned, forhe was one of the “ingenious and learned men” who filled her house at Wilton “sothat it ws like a college.” The Countess of Pembroke spent a great deal yearly in thestudy of alchemy, and kept Adrian as a laborant for a time. He is described as abuffoon who cared not what he said to man or woman of any quality. BringingJohn Davis, another of the breezy Devon sea captains, Adrian came to Mortlake toeffect a reconciliation after some uncomfortable passages caused, as they found, bydishonest dealings on the part of William Emery, whom they now exposed. “JohnDavis say’d that he might curse the tyme that ever he knew Emery, and so muchfollowed his wicked counsayle and advyse. So just is God!” Here again we suspectDee’s reputation for “magic” had been the trouble.With the discovery of so many new coasts and islands across in the Westernseas, the Queen was anxious to know what right she had to call them hers, and whatearlier navigators had sailed to them before. After Frobisher’s three voyages insearch of the North-West Passage, she sent for the author of the Hexameron andbade him set forth her title to Greenland, Estoteland (Newfoundland) and Friseland.This document he calls “Her Majestie’s commandment — Anno 1578.” Either heprepared another, or did not present this to the Queen for two years.1580. — ”On Monday Oct. 3, at 11 of the clock before none, I delivered my twoRolls of the Queene’s Majestie’s title unto herself in the garden at Richmond, whoappointed after dynner to heare fuder of the matter. Therfore betweene one and twoafternone, I was sent for into her highness Pryvy Chamber, where the LordThreasurer allso was, who having the matter slightly then in consultation, did semeto doubt much that I had or could make the argument probable for her highnes’ titleso as I pretended. Wheruppon I was to declare to his honor more playnely, and athis leyser, what I had sayd and could say therein, which I did on Tuesday andWensday following, at his chamber, where he used me very honorably on hisbehalf.”The next day Dee fancied that Burleigh slighted him. He called to see him,and was not admitted; he stood in the ante- chamber when the great man came out,but the Lord Treasurer swept by and “did not or would not speak to me.” Probablyhe was pondering deeply on important matters of state. Dee’s hopes of prefermentfell to the ground, and he was persuaded that “some new grief was conceyved.” Deewas ambitious; he was not yet surfeited with fame; of wealth he had none, hardlyeven a competency; he was vain, and he knew that he had gifts which few of hiscountrymen could rival or even understand; and he was no longer young. Such"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"advantages as he could attain must be secured quickly, if they were to be enjoyed atall.“On the 10th, at four o’clock in the morning my mother Jane Dee dyed atMortlake; she made a godlye ende: God be praysed therfore! She was 77 yere old.”News of this event quickly travelled to the Court at Richmond, and theQueen determined to signalise her favour to Dee and her gratification at Burleigh’sreport of his geographical labours, which reached her on the same day as the news ofhis loss, by a personal visit of condolence.“Oct. 10th. The Quene’s Majestie, to my great cumfort (hora quinta), camwith her trayn from the court, and at my dore graciously calling me to her, onhorsbak, exhorted me briefly to take my mother’s death patiently, and withall toldme that the Lord Threasurer had greatly commended my doings for her title, whichhe had to examyn, which title in two rolls he had brought home two hours before;and delivered to Mr. Hudson for me to receive at my coming from my mother’sburial at church. Her Majestie remembered allso how at my wive’s death, it was herfortune likewise to call uppon me.”So the fancied slight was nothing. The Queen’s second remarkably-timedvisit was followed up by an haunch of venison from my Lord Treasurer, and anatmosphere of satisfaction reigned. One of the rolls of which Dee writes is still inexistence. It has on one side of the parchment a large map of “Atlantis,” or America,drawn with the skill of a practised cartographer. At the top is his name, “JoannesDee,” and the date, “Anno 1580.” Among his papers is a smaller map, upon whichlarge tracts in the Polar regions are marked “Infinite yse.” Thge other side of the rollis devoted to proving the Queen’s title to lands she would never see or hear of,under the four following heads: “1. The Clayme in Particular. 2. The Reason of theClayme. 3. The Credit of the Reason. 4. The value of that Credit by Force of Law.”Dee was also busied this summer attending at the Muscovy House andwriting instructions and drawing a chart for the two captains, Charles Jackson andArthur Pett, for their North-East voyage to “Cathay,” or China.He had perhaps joined the Company of the Merchant Venturers, for inMarch, 1579, he had signed a letter with Sir Thomas Gresham, Martin Frobisher (asevery one knows, he was knighted in the thick of the Armada fight), and others, tothe Council of State, desiring that those Adventurers who have not paid shall beadmonished to send in contributions without delay. Another very interestingremark tells how “Young Mr. Hawkins, who had byn with Sir Francis Drake, cameto me to Mortlake, in June, 1581; also Hugh Smith, who had just returned from theStraits of Magellan.” In November, Dee is observing “the blasing star,” or comet, ofwhich, with its long tail, he makes a drawing on the margin of his diary. By the22nd it had disappeared: “Although it were a cler night, I could see it no more.”On June 7, 1581, at half-past seven in the morning, Dee’s second child andeldest daughter, Katherine, was born. She was christened on the 10th, her sponsorsbeing Lady Katherine Crofts, wife of Sir James Crofts, Controller of the Queen’sHousehold; Mistress Mary Scudamore, of the Privy Chamber, the Queen’s cousin;"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"and Mr. Packington, also a court gentleman. The infant was put out to nurse, first atBarnes with Nurse Maspely, then transferred to Goodwife Bennett. On August 11“Katherine Dee was shifted to nurse Garrett at Petersham, on Fryday, the nextday after St. Lawrence day, being the 11th day of the month. My wife went on footwith her, and Ellen Cole, my mayd, George and Benjamin, in very great showers ofrain.”Nevertheless the little Katherine seemed to flourish, and there are entries ofmonthly payments of six shillings to her nurse, with allowance for candles andsoap, up to August 8 of the following year, when “Kate is sickly,” and on the 20th isreported as “still diseased.” Four or five days after, she ws taken from nurse Garret,of Petersham, and weaned at home. The mother had several times been over to seethe child, sometimes on foot, attended by George or Benjamin, the servants, andonce by water with “Mistress Lee in Robyn Jackes bote.” The children seemed introuble at this time, for about seven weeks before Arthur “fell from the top of theWatergate Stayres, down to the fote from the top, and cut his forhed on the righteyebrow.” This was at the old landing-place at Mortlake. Their childish ailmentsare always most carefully recorded in the diary, even when the cause is a box on theears — probably well earned — from their quick-tempered mother. Jane’s friendsMr. and Mrs. Scudamore, and their daughter, and the Queen’s dwarf, Mrs. Tomasin,all came for a night to Mortlake. Jane went back with Mistress Scudamore to theCourt at Oatlands. A number of other visitors are named, including “Mr. Fosker ofthe wardrobe.”CHAPTER VTHE SEARCH FOR A MEDIUM“Truth is within ourselves; it takes no riseFrom outward things, whate’er you may believeThere is an inmost centre in us allWhere truth abides in fulness; and aroundWall upon wall, the gross flesh hems it in,This perfect clear perception, which is truth.A baffling and perverting carnal meshBinds it and makes all error; and to KNOWRather consists in opening out a wayWhence the imprisoned splendour may escapeThan in effecting entry for a lightSupposed to be without.” — Browning, Paracelsus.Dee had always, working with and under him, a number of young studentsand assistants, who were admitted more or less to his inner counsels. If they provedapt and diligent, he would reward them with promises of alchemical secrets,“whereby they might honestly live”; once he promised 100 pounds, “to be paid assoon of my own clere hability, I myght spare so much.” This was a very safe"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"provison. Generous as he was, lavish to a fault, money never stuck near him, norwas it of the least value in his eyes, except as a means of advancing science andenriching others.Naturally, jealousies arose among the assistants. They would suddenlydepart from his service, and spread ignorant and perverted reports of hisexperiments. Roger Cook, who had been with his master fourteen years, tookumbrage “on finding himself barred from vew of my philosophical dealing withMr. Henrick.” He had imagined himself the chosen confidant, for to him Dee hadrevealed, December 28, 1579, what he considered a great alchemical secret “of theaction of the elixir of salt, one upon a hundred.” Roger was now twenty-eight, “of amelancholik nature, and had been pycking and devising occasions of just cause todepart on the sudden,” for he was jealous of a newer apprentice. “On September7th, 1581, Roger went for alltogether from me.” But it was not “alltogether,” forRoger returned when Dee was old and inform and poor, and remained serving himalmost to the end. There was always something patriarchal in Dee’s care for themembers of his large household, evidenced abundantly in his diary. No doubt theirloyalty to him was often severely tried by harsh and cruel outside rumours, but asthey knew and loved his real nature they only drew closer towards him.A new phase of his character is now forced upon us. He has appearedhitherto as the man of learning, astronomer and mathematician, a brilliant lecturerand demonstrator, diligent in probing the chemical and alchemical secrets of whichhis vast reading, his foreign correspondence, and his unique library gave himcognisance. Interested in geographical discovery and history, a bibliographical andmathematical writer, his genuine contributions to science had been considerable.He had written upon navigation and history, logic, travel, geometry, astrology,heraldry, genealogy, and many other subjects. He had essayed to found a NationalLibrary, and was contemplating a great work upon the reformation of the Calendar.But these purely legitimate efforts of his genius were discounted in the eyes of hiscontemporaries by the absurd suspicions with which his name had been associatedever since his college days. After his arrest and trial by Bonner, he never reallysucceeded in shaking off this savour of something magical. The popular idea of Deein league with evil powers was, of course, the natural result of ignorance and dullunderstanding. To a public reared in superstition, untrained in reasoning,unacquainted with the simple laws of gravitation, the power to raise heavy bodiesin the air at will, to see pictures in a simple crystal globe, or converse withprojections of the air, to forecast a man’s life by geometric or planetary calculations,and to discern the influence of one chemical or mineral substance upon another,seemed diabolically clever and quite beyond human agency. Even to study Natureand her secrets was to lay oneself open to the suspicion of being a magician. Wemust remember that in the early years of Queen Elizabeth’s reign it was thoughtnecessary to pass an Act of Parliament decreeing that all who practised sorcerycausing death should suffer death; if only injury was caused, imprisonment and thepillory whould be the punishment. Any conjuration of an evil spirit was to bepunished by death as a felon, without benefit of clergy or sanctuary. Any discoveryof hidden treasure by magical means was punishable by death for a second offence.But if “magic” was tottering on its throne, the reign of alchemy was stilluncontested. Belief in it was universal, its great votaries in the past were of allnations. St. Dunstan of Glastonbury, Roger Bacon, Raymond Lully, Canon George"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Ripley of Bridlington, Albertus Magnus, Cornelius Agrippa, Arnold de Villa Novaand Paracelsus, all their writings, and hundreds of others, Dee had in his library andconstantly upon his tongue. Alchemy was not only a science, it was a religion and aromance. It was even then enduring the birth-throes and sickly infancy of modernchemistry, and the alchemists’ long search for the secret of making gold has beencalled one of its crises. Long after this it was still an article of faith, that such a manas Robert Boyle did not deny. We cannot forget that even that great chemist, SirHumphry Davy, reverenced the possibility, and refused to say that the alchemist’sbelief in the power to make gold was erroneous. How unlike Dante’s keen irony ofthe dark and groping men who seek for “peltro,” or tin whitened with mercury. Butalchemy was bursting with many other secrets beyond the manufacture of gold. Thespiritual element abounding in all minerals, and the symbolism underlying everyactual substance, were deeply imbedded in it. It was a scienceof ideals. It ever led itsfollowers on to scale illimitable heights of knowledge, for in order to surpass allmaterial and rational nature, and attain the crowning end, did not God delegate Hisown powers to the sage? So the art of healing was thought the noblest, the mostGodlike task, and no means of attaining hermetic wisdom were untried. Thepsychical world became every bit as real to these religious mystics as the physical andrational, which they understood so vaguely. Even the strange shapes which escapedfrom the retorts of the old alchemists were known to them as “souls.” Theirsuccessors called them spirits. Paracelsus named them as mercury, and it was left tohis pupil, Van Helmont, the true founder of all modern chemistry, to give thename of gas.It is easy to see how Dee, the astrologer, grew into close touch with thosepsychic phenomena which, though they have become extremely familiar to us, asyet continue to baffle our most scientific researches. When he first becameconscious of his psychic powers, and how far he himself was mediumistic, is harderto discern. It is on May 25, 1581, that he makes in his diary the momentous entry: —”I had sightin Chrystallo offered me, and I saw.” We may take it that he “saw”through a medium, for he never afterwards seems to have been able to skry withoutone. Perhaps his first crystal had then been given him, although, as we have seen,he already owned several curious mirrors, one said to be of Mexican obsidian suchas was used for toilet purposes by that ancient race. He had made a study of optics,and in his catalogue of the manuscripts of his library are many famous writings onthe spectrum, perspective and burning glasses, etc. Then came the trouble withRoger, “his incredible doggedness and ungratefulness against me to my face, almostready to lay violent hands on me.” Dee hears strange rappings and knockings in hischamber. A gentleman came from Lewisham to consult him about a dream manytimes repeated. Dee prays with him, and “his dream is confirmed and betterinstruction given.” A mysterious fire breaks out for the second time in “themaydens” chamber at night. The knocking is heard again, this time accompaniedwith a voice repeated ten times. No words apparently, but a sound like “the schrichof an owl, but more longly drawn and more softly, as it were in my chamber.” Hehas a strange “dream of being naked and my skyn all over wrought with work likesome kinde of tuft mockado, with crosses blew and red; and on my left arm, abowtthe arm in a wreath, these words I read: — `Sine me nihil potestis facere.’ Andanother the same night of Mr. Secretary Walsingham, Mr. Candish and myself.”Then he was ten days from home, at “Snedgreene, with John Browne, to hear and"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"see the manner of the doings.” Evidently some remarkable manifestation. he wasbecoming more interested in psychic problems, but he was not able to proceedwithout a medium, and the right one had not yet appeared.Meanwhile, he fills his diary with all manner of interesting news. VincentMurphy, the “cosener” who had defamed him, and against whom in September,1580, he had instituted a troublesome law-suit, was condemned by a jury at theGuildhall to pay 100 pounds damages. “With much adoe, I had judgment againsthim.” Five or six months later, he agreed with Mr. Godolphin to release thecosener. Jean Bodin, the famous French writer on witches, and publicist, had cometo England with “Monsieur,” and Dee was introduced to him by Castelnau, theFrench ambassador, in the “Chamber of Presence at Westminster.” Letters camefrom Doctor Andreas Hess, the occult philosopher, sent through Dee’s friend,Richard Hesketh, agent at Antwerp. There are also letters from Rome. JohnLeonard Haller, of Hallerstein by Worms, came to him to say he had receivedinstructions for his journey into “Quinsay [or Northern china], which jorney Imoved him unto, and instructed him plentifully for observing the variation of thecompassin all places as he passed.” He notes, as if it were a common occurrence, a“fowl falling out” between two earls at Court, Leicester and Sussex [the LordChamberlain], tells how they “called each other traytor, wheruppon both werecommanded to keepe to theyre chambers at Greenwich, wher the Court was.” Itsounds like a schoolboys’ quarrel, but the royal schoolmistress would have themboth know that they were in disgrace for a time. In July, there was an eclipse of themoon, but it was “clowdy, so as I could not perceyve it.” In August, about half-pasteight on the night of the 26th, “a strange Meteore in forme of a white clowdecrossing galaxium, lay north and sowth over our zenith. This clowde was at lengthfrom the S.E. to the S.W., sharp at both ends, and in the West it was forked for awhile. It was about sixty degrees high, it lasted an howr, all the skye clere abowt andfayr star-shyne.”Dee made a journey into Huntingdonshire, by St. Neots, to Mr. Hickman’s atShugborough, in the county of Warwick. Young Bartholomew Hickman wasafterwards to become the companion and servant of his old age, and manifestedsome slight mediumistic powers. On the way home, a month or two later, Dee rodeinto Sussex to Chailey, probably to the glass workds there. The Queen and“Monsieur” were at Whitehall.A pretty little scene was enacted at Mortlake at the New Year, when “ArthurDee and Mary Herbert, they being but 3 yere old, the eldest of them, did mak as itwere a shew of childish marriage, of calling each other husband and wife.” ThenDee essays a harmless little play upon words. “The first day Mary Herbert cam to herfather’s house at Mortlake, the second day she came to her father’s hosue at EastShene.” Mrs. Dee went the same day to see the baby Katherine at Nurse Garret’s,and Mistress Herbert went with her. So the two families were in great unity.Sir George Peckham, who sailed with Sir Humphrey Gilbert, came to consultDee about exploration in North America, and promised a share in his patent of thenew lands. He also sent down his sea-master, Mr. Clement, and another gentleman,Mr. Ingram, to see the mathematician. For Sir John Killigrew, Dee devised “a wayof protestation to save him harmless for compounding for the Spaniard who wasrobbed: he promised me fish against Lent.” Haller came again to get instructionshow to transfer his money to Nuremburg, and to get letters of introduction to"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Constantinople. By him, Dee sent letters to correspondents in Venice, where theGerman explorer was to winter.Mr. Newbury, who had been in India, came early in the New Year. Deerecounts how the stage in that well-known old London place of amusement, theParis Garden, on Bankside, Southwark, fell down suddenly while it was crammedwith people beholding the bear-baiting. “Many people were killed thereby, morehurt, and all amazed. The godly expound it as a due plague of God for thewickedness there used, and teh Sabbath day so profanely spent.” Sunday was thegreat day for the bear-fights.“1583. — Jan. 23. Mr. Secretarie Walsingham cam to my howse, where bygood luk he found Mr. Awdrian Gilbert, and so talk was begonne of NorthwestStraights discovery.“Jan. 24.

The Queene went from Richmond toward Greenwich, and at hergoing on horsbak, being new up, she called for me by Mr. Rawly his putting her inmynde, and she sayd `quod defertur non aufertur,’ and gave me her right hand tokisse.”While these every-day events were going on and being chronicled, Dee wasalso occupying himself with the search for a medium. He first tried one namedBarnabas Saul (he seems to have been a licensed preacher), who professed himselfan occultist. Saul gives news of buried treasure — great chests of precious bookshidden somewhere near Oundle in Northamptonshire, but the disappointed book-lover finds the hoard an illusion. Then Saul, who slept in a chamber over the hallat Mortlake, is visited at midnight by “a spiritual creature.” The first real seance thatDee records, “Actio Saulina,” took place on December 21, 1581. The skryer wasbidden to look into the “great crystalline globe,” and a message was transmitted bythe angel Annael through the percipient to the effect that many things should bedeclared to Dee, not by the present worker, “but by him that is assigned to the stone.”After New Year’s tide, on any day but the Sabbath, the stone was to be set inthe sun,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"the brighter the day the better, and sight should be given. The sitters might “dealboth kneeling and sitting.” When we consider how very real to a devout person inthe Middle Ages apparitions of the devil and of evil spirits were, there seemsnothing at all extraordinary in Dee’s belief that good spirits also might be permittedto come to his call, for purposes of good. A month or two after this, Saul wasindicted on some charge and tried in Westminster Hall, but, thanks to Mr. SerjeantWalmesley and a couple of clever lawyers, he was acquitted. There was an end ofhis clairvoyance, however: “he confessed he neyther herd or saw any spirituallcrature any more.” If the accusation against him had been that of sorcery, he waswise to risk no further appearances in Westminster Hall. He seems to have spreadabroad many false reports about Dee, who reproached him bitterly when he called atMortlake a few months later. Dee had, however, gained psychical experience bythese early and tentative experiments. The field was now open for a maturerapplicant. When he arrived, he was to change the whole current of Dee’s life andoutlook, to become at once a helper and a stumbling-block, a servant and a master,loving as a son, treacherous as only a jealous foe. It was a strange fate that sentEdward Kelley to Dee at this moment, when everything was ripe for his appearance.And it was characteristic of the man that he was ushered into Dee’s life under afeigned name. On March 8, two days after Saul had confessed he saw and heard nomore of the spirits, Dee writes in his diary, “Mr. Clerkson and his frende cam to myhowse.” He makes the visit very emphatic by repeating the information: “Barnabaswent home abowt 2 or 3 o’clock, he lay not at my howse now; he went, I say, onThursday, and Mr. Clerkson came.” At nine o’clock the same night, there was awonderful exhibition of the aurora in the northern and eastern heavens, which Deedescribes minutely in Latin in the diary. The next day, March 9, he mentionsClerkson’s friend by name as “Mr. Talbot,” and shows how that individual appearsto have begun ingratiating himself with his new patron by telling him what a badman his predecessor was. Barnabas had said that Dee would mock at the newmedium; Barnabas had “cosened” both Clerkson and Dee. This, Talbot professed tohave been told by “a spiritual creature.” The pair proceeded at once to business. Onthe 10th, they sat downto gaze into “my stone in a frame given me of a friend,” withvery remarkable results. Information was vouchsafed that they should jointlytogether have knowledge of the angels, if the will of God, viz., conjunction of mindand prayer between them, be performed. They were bidden to “abuse not thisexcellency nor overshadow it with vanity, but stick firmly, absolutely and perfectlyin the love of God for his honour, together.” There were forty-nine good angels, alltheir names beginning with B, who were to be answerable to their call. The firstentry that Dee makes in his Book of Mysteries concerning Talbot is as follows: —“One Mr. Edward Talbot cam to my howse, and he being willing and desyrousto see or shew something in spirituall practise, wold have had me to have donesomething therein. And I truely excused myself therein: as not, in the vulgarlyaccownted magik, neyther studied or exercised. But confessed myself long tyme tohave byn desyrous to have help in my philosophicall studies through the cumpanyand information of the blessed Angels of God. And thereuppon, I brought furth tohim my stonein the frame (which was given me of a frende), and I sayd unto himthat I was credibly informed that to it (after a sort) were answerable Aliqui Angeliboni. And also that I was once willed by a skryer to call for the good Angel Annael"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"to appere in that stone in my owne sight. And therefore I desyred him to call him,and (if he would) Anachor and Anilos likewise, accounted good angels, for I was notprepared thereto.“He [Talbot] settled himself to the Action, and on his knees at my desk, settingthe stone before him, fell to prayer and entreaty, etc. In the mean space, I in myOratory did pray and make motion to God and his good creatures for the furderingof this Action. And within one quarter of an hour (or less) he had sight of one inthe stone.”The one to appear was Uriel, the Spirit of Light. On the 14th, the angelMichael appeared, and gave Dee a ring with a seal. Only on two other occasionsdoes a tangible object pass between them. Dee was overjoyed at the success of hisnew “speculator” or “skryer”; the sittings were daily conducted until March 21,when the medium was overcome with faintness and giddiness, and Michael, whowas conversing with him, bade them rest and wait for a quarter of an hour. Thenext day, Talbot departed from Mortlake, being bidden by Michael to go fetch somebooks of Lord Monteagle’s which were at Lancaster, or thereby, and which wouldelse perish.He returned before long, and all through April, instructions were being givenat the sittings for the future revelations. elaborate preparations were needed, andthey were describedin minute detail.By April 29, a square table, “the table of practice,” was complete. It was madeof sweet wood, and was about two cubits high (“by two cubits I mean our usualyard”), with four legs. On its sides certain characters, as revealed, were to be writtenwith sacred yellow oil, such as is used in chruches. Each leg was to be set upon a sealof wax made in the same pattern as the larger seal, “Sigilla AEmeth,” which was tobe placed upon the centre of the table, this seal to be made of perfect, that is, cleanpurified wax, 9 inches in diameter, 27 inches or more in circumference. It was to bean inch and half a quarter of an inch thick, and upon the under-side was to be afigure as below.It was a mystical sign, similar to those in use in the East, and also used by contemporary astrologers[INSERT ILLUSTRATION]The four letters in the centre are the initials of the Hebrew words, “Thou art great for ever, O Lord,”which were considered a charm in the Middle Ages.The upper side of the seal was engraved with an elaborate figure obtained inthe following manner. First, a table of forty-nine squares was drawn and filled upwith the seven names of God — ”names not known to the angels, neither can theybe spoken or read of man. These names bring forth seven angels, the governors ofthe heavens next unto us. Every letter of the angels’ names bringeth forth sevendaughters. Every daughter bringeth forth seven daughters. Every daughter herdaughter bringeth forth a son. Every son hath his son.”The seal “was not to be looked upon without great reverence and devotion.”It is extremely curious and interesting to relate that two of these tablets ofwax, “Sigillum Dei,” and one of the smaller seals for the feet of the table, with acrystal globe, all formerly belonging to Dee, are still preserved in the British"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Museum, having come there from Sir Thomas Cotton’s library, where the table ofpractice was also long preserved.The spirits were kind enough to say: “We have no respect of cullours,” butthe table was to be set upon a square of red silk as changeable (i.e., shot) as may be,two yards square, and a red silk cover, with “knops or tassels” at the four corners,was to be laid over the seal, and to hang below the edge of the table. The crystalglove in its frame was then to be set upon the centre of the cover, resting on the sealwith the silk between.The skryer seated himself in “the green chair” at the table, Dee at his desk towrite down the conversations. These were noted by him then and there at the time,and he is careful to particularise any remark or addition told him by the Ckryerafterwards. Once a spirit tells him: “There is time enough, and we may takeleisure.” Whereupon Dee conversed directly with the visitant; sometimesapparently only Talbot hears and repeats to him what is said. A golden curtain wasusually first seen in the stone, and occasionally there was a long pause before it waswithdrawn. Once Dee writes: “He taketh the darkness and wrappeth it up, andcasteth it into the middle of the earthen globe.” The spirits generally appeared inthe stone, but sometimes they stept down into a dazzling beam of light from it, andmoved about the room. On some occasions a voice only is heard. At the close ofthe action, the “black cloth of silence is drawn,” and they leave off for the present.There are very few comments or general impressions of the actions left byDee, but on one occasion he does use expressions that show his analytical powers tohave been actively at work to account for the phenomena. He brought his reason tobear upon the means of communication with the unseen world in a remarkablemanner. In speaking to the angels one day he said: “I do think you have no organsor Instruments apt for voyce, but are meere spirituall and nothing corporall, buthave the power and property from God to insinuate your message or meaning to earor eye [so that] man’s imagination shall be that they hear and see you sensibly.”As Plotinus says, “Not everything whichis in the soul is now sensible, but itarrives to us when it proceeds as far as sense.”The minute descriptions of the figures seen are of course characteristic ofclairvoyant or mediumistic visions. In the case of Bobogel, the account of his “sageand grave” attire — the common dress of a serious gentleman of the time — may bequoted.“They that now come in are jolly fellows, all trymmed after the manner ofNobilities now-a-dayes, with gylt rapiers and curled haire, and they bragged up anddowne. Bobogel standeth in a black velvet coat, and his hose, close round hose ofvelvet upperstocks, over layd with gold lace. He hath a velvet hat cap with a blackfeather in it, with a cape on one of his shoulders; his purse hanging at his neck, andso put under his girdell. His beard long. He had pantoffolls and pynsons. Sevenothers are apparelled like Bobogel, sagely and gravely.”CHAPTER VIEDWARD KELLEY“Kelley did all his feats upon"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Devil’s looking-glass, a stoneWhere, playing with him at bo-peep,He solv’d all problems ne’er so deep.” — Butler, HudibrasIt is now time to inquire who this Talbot, this seer and medium, was. Wheredid he come from, and what was his previous history?That he came to the Mortlake philosopher under a feigned name is perhapsnot so damning an accusation as might at first sight appear. There was in his case,certainly, every reason why he should change his identity, if possible, but an alias inthose days was so common a thing that perhaps more stress has been laid uponKelley’s than is strictly fair.The whole of Kelley’s story is so wildly and romantically coloured, it is soincredible, and so full of marvels, that it is extremely difficult to know what tobelieve. There is no disentangling the sober facts of his life from the romanceattributed to him; indeed, there are no sober facts, as the reader will see when theaccepted traditions of this extraordinary man’s career are laid down.From March 8 to November, 1582, Edward Talbot, the skryer, came and wentin the Mortlake establishment, gazed in the crystal, and ingratiated himself into hisemployer’s liking. Then he disappeared, and Edward Kelley took his place. Therehad been a quarrel of some kind, precursor of many others, and Dee opens hisfourth Book of Mysteries, on November 15, “after the reconciliation with Kelley.”Henceforth “E.K.” is his name.Kelley was born at Worcester, on August 1, 1555, as appears by the horoscopedrawn for him by the astrologer. He began life as an apothecary’s apprentice, andshowed some aptitude for his calling. It has been stated that, under the name ofTalbot, he studied for a short time at Oxford, but left abruptly under a cloud. A fewyears later, he was exposed in the pillory in Lancaster for having either forgedancient title deeds or coined base money. Both feats are accounted to him. The nextincident in his career is a charge of having dug up a newly buried “caitiff’s” corpse inWalton-le-Dale churchyard, Lancashire, for the purpose of questioning the dead, or“an evil spirit speaking through his organs,” respecting the future of “a noble younggentleman,” then a minor. After this savoury episode, Kelley is reported to havebeen wandering in Wales (it is suggested that he was hiding from justice), when hestumbled accidentally upon an old alchemical manuscript and two caskets or phialscontaining a mysterious red and white powder. Another version of this discovery isthat Dee and Kelley together found the powder at Glastonbury. This we maydismiss. Wherever he procured it, Kelley undoubtedly owned a small quantity ofsome substance which he regarded as of priceless value, inasmuch as, if properlyunderstood and manipulated, it could be used for transmuting baser metals intogold.The reputation of the learned doctor of Mortlake, who was known all overthe Continent, was a favourite at Court, and in touch with every adventure by sea orland, had of course reached Kelley. Dee’s parsonage of Upton-on-Severn, nearWorcester, did not trouble him much with responsibility, but it must have been onone occasional visit to it that he received from the Dean of Worcester Catherdral aLatin volume, in which he inscribed the gift thus: “Joannes Dee, 1565, Februarii 21.Wigorniae, ex dono decani ecclesiae magistri Beddar.”"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"With the powder that he did not know how to use, and the alchemicalmanuscript which he could not decipher, and which yet might contain theinvaluable secret (if indeed there is any truth in the story of his find), Kelley, theadventurer, sought out some means of introduction to the man so likely to helphim. He had dabbled in alchemy, and came to Mortlake with something of areputation, for Dee speaks of him as “that lerned man.” It is utterly unlikely thatDee had heard anything of Kelley’s exploits in the north. Such doings wouldscarcely penetrate the solmen recesses of the laboratory on the Thames side. SoKelley arrived, and was recieved in all good faith. He told Dee that the last seer,Barnabas, had “cosened” him, and seems to have at once impressed himselffavourably upon the astrologer, who at the moment was without a reliable assistant.The sittings began, as we have seen, in March, and were successful immediately. InMay the message comes that “none shall enter into the knowledge of thesemysteries but this worker,” and Kelley’s position is secured.Kelley was now about twenty-seven years old, and unmarried. He was biddenby the spirits on April 20 to take a wife, “which thing to do,” he told Dee, “I have nonatural inclination, neither with a safe conscience may I do it.” but Michael hadmade him swear on his sword to follow his counsel, so he married reluctantly, notlong after, Joan, or Johanna, Cooper, of Chipping Norton, who was eight years hisjunior, and about nineteen.There was little love on his side apparently, but the girl seems at any rate tohave essayed to do her duty as a wife. She was apparently a complete stranger to theDees, although soon to become part of their household. What were Jane’s feelingsat the thought of this invasion of her domestic peace we can only guess from anentry in Dee’s diary made two days after one of these first sittings. Dee does notwrite much about his wife in his diary, save only entries relating to her health, andthis one he has carefully erased, as if he thought some disloyalty to her wasinvolved in it. It is, however, possible to make it out almost entirely. “1582, 6 May.Jane in a merveylous rage at 8 of the cloke at night, and all that night, and nextmorning till 8 of the cloke, melancholike and ch[?ided me] terribly for....”Something illegible follows, and then this: “that come to me only honest andlerned men.” Finally, “by Mr. Clerkson his help was [?pacified].” What canthismean save that she had takena violent dislike to, and disapproval of, Kelley; thatshe mistrusted his honesty and wished they might have no more to do with him;that it was only by his friend Clerkson’s help that she was at last quieted? Herwoman’s intuition was scarcely at fault; however kindly she came to treat herhusband’s medium afterwards, however charitable she showed herself, she wasright in suspecting no good to come to Dee through association with Kelley.The accounts of the actions with the spirits which took place under Kelley’scontrol were minutely written down by Dee, as we have seen, mostly during thetimeof the sittings. The papers had a romantic history. The last thirteen books,which were in Sir Thomas Cotton’s library, were printed by Dr. Meric Casaubonabout fifty years after Dee’s death, under the title of A True and Faithful Relation ofwhat passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee, a Mathematician of Great Famein Q. Elizabeth and K. James their Reigns, and some Spirits: Tending (had itsucceeded) To a General Alteration of most States and Kingdomes in theWorld...With a Preface confirming the reality (as to the Point of Spirits) of thisRelation; and shewing the several good Uses that a sober Christian may make of all”"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"(folio 1659). Casaubon in his learned preface maintains stoutly that the visions wereno distempered fancy, that Dee acted throughout with all sincerity, but that he wasdeluded. His book sold with great rapidity; it excited so much controversy, andincurred such disapproval from Owen, Pye, and the other Puritan divines, that itcame near being suppressed; only the excellent demand for it prevented itsconfiscation, for not a copy could be found. The True Relation contains the recordof all actions after the beginning of June, 1583. The earlier conversations, from thefirst with Barnabas, and Talbot’s appearance on the scene, are still to be found inmanuscript, they having in some way parted company from those of which Cottonhad possession.These earlier papers were acquired by the antiquary, Elias Ashmole, in arather romantic way. Ashmole had been visiting William Lilly, the astrologer, atHorsham, in August, 1672, when on his return his servant brought him a largebundle of Dee’s autograph MSS. which a few days before he had received from oneof the warders of the Tower. The warder called on Ashmole at the Excise Office, andoffered to give them in exchange for one of Ashmole’s own printed works. TheWindsor Herald cheerfully agreed, and sent him a volume “fairly bound and gilt onthe back,” of which of his works we know not.Now for the history of the papers. Mrs. Wale, the warder’s wife, had broughtthem with her dower from her lamented first husband, Mr. Jones, confectioner, ofthe Plow, Lombard Street. While courting, these young people had picked upamong the “joyners in Adle STreet” a large chest whose “very good lock and hingesof extraordinary neat work” took their fancy. It had belonged, said the shopman, toMr. John Woodall, surgeon, father of Thomas Woodall, surgeon to King Charles II.and Ashmole’s friend. He had bought it probably at the sale of Dee’s effects in 1609,after his death. The Joneses owned the chest for twenty years without a suspicion ofits contents. Then, on moving it one day, they heard a rattle inside. Jones prizedopen the space below the till, and discovered a large secret drawer stuffed full ofpapers, and a rosary of olive-wood beads with a cross, which had caused the rattle.The papers proved to be the conferences with angels from December 22, 1581, downto the time of the printed volume; the original manuscripts of the (unprinted)books entitled, “48 Claves Angelicae,” “De Heptarchia Mystica,” and “Liber ScientiaeAuxiliis et Victoriae Terrestris.” We may imagine Ashmole’s excitement when hefound he had in his hand the earlier chapters of the very remarkable book that wasstil in every one’s mouth, published only thirteen years before.We may now briefly examine this remarkable and voluminous Book ofMysteries. In view of the fact that it is perhaps the earliest record of mediumistictransactions, the first attempt to relate consecutive psychic transmissions, in fact asort of sixteenth century Proceedings of a Society for Psychical Research, it seems towarrant investigation at some length.The first book (still in manuscript) opens with a Latin invocation to theAlmighty, and an attribution of all wisdom and philosophy to their divine originalsource. It ends “O beata et super benedicta omnipotens Trinitas, concedas mihi(Joanni Dee) petitionem hane modo tali, qui tibi maxime placebit, Amen.” Thencomes a table of the four angels — Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel, theirparticular attributes, and their descent from Annael. A long prayer in Englishfollows, which gives a remarkable insight into Dee’s attitude of mind. Unfeignedhumility towards God, a certain unconsciousness of self and of his own particular"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"acquirements, are mingled with a calm assumption of authority and power to enterinto the heart of knowledge. This was perhaps the chief characterisitic of the exaltedmysticism so prevalent at the time in a small section of alchemists, especially on theContinent. Dee was its representative in England, having, of course, imbibed muchof it during his residence abroad. Paracelsus had been dead but forty years. Hisdisciples everywhere were seeking three secrets which were to fulfil his teaching —the secret of transmutation, the elixir of life, and the philosophic stone, key to allwisdom. Bruno was still alive, developing hs theories of God as the great unitybehind the world and humanity. Copernicus was not long dead, and his newtheories of the solar system were gradually becoming accepted. Galileo was still astudent at Pisa, his inventions as yet slumbering in his brain. Montaigne waswriting his getle satires on humanity. Everywhere and in every sphere newthought was beginning to stir.Dee did not scruple to claim in his prayer gifts like those bestowed upon theprophets. He deprecates any kind of traffic with unauthorised or unreliable spirits,and acknowledges again the only Source of wisdom. But since he has so long andfaithfully followed learning, he does think it of importanc ethat he should knowmore. The blessed angels, for instance, could impart to him things of at least asmuch consequence as when the prophet told Saul, the son of Kish, where to find alost ass or two! A spirit afterwards told him that ignorance was the nakednesswherewith he was first tormented, and “the first plague that fell unto man was thewant of science.”He had reached that state of mind when he seemed unable to discern anyboundary line between finite and infinite. His hope and his confidence were alikefixed on nothing less than wresting all the secrets of the universe from the abyss ofknowledge, or, at any rate, as many of them as God willed. he explains how from hisyouth up he has prayed for pure and sound wisdom and understanding,“such as might be brought, under the talent of my capacitie, to God’s honour andglory and the benefit of his servaents, my brethren and sisters. And forasmuch asfor many yeres, in many places, far and nere, in many bokes and sundry languages, Ihave wrought and studyed, and with sundry men conferred, and with my ownereasonable discourse Laboured, whereby to fynde or get some yinkling, glimpse, orbeame, of such the aforesaid radicall truthes:...And seeing I have read in they bokesand records how Enoch enjoyed thy favor and conversation, with Moses thou wastfamiliar, And also that to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Josua, Gedeon, Esdras, Daniel,Tobias, and sundry other, the good angels were sent, by they disposition, to instructthem, informe them, help them, yea in worldly and domesticall affairs; yea andsometimes to satisfy theyr desyres, doubts and questions of thy secrets; andfurdermore, considering the Shewstone which the high priests did use by thy owneorderinge, wherein they had lighte and judgments in their great doutes, andconsidering allso that thou (O God) didst not refuse to instruct the prophets (thencalled seers), to give answers to common people of things oeconomicall, as Samuelfor Saul, seeking for his father’s asses, being gon astray: and as other things, vulgartrue predictions, whereby to wyn credit unto ther waightier affayres. And thinkingwithin myself the lack of thy wisdom to me to be of more importance than thevalue of an Asse or two could be to Cis (Saul his father): And remembering whatgood counsayle they apostle James giveth, saying Si quies autem vestrumetc. And"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"that Solomon the wise, did so, even immediately by thyselfe, atteyne to hiswonderfull sidome: Therefore, Seeing I was sufficiently taught and confirmed thatthis wisdome could not be come by at mans hand, or by human powre, but onelyfrom thee (O God) mediately or immediately. And having allwayes a great regardeand care to beware of the filthy abuse of such as willingly and wittingly did invocateand consult (in divers sorte) Spirituall Creatures of the damned sort: Angels ofdarknes, forgers and patrons of lies and untruths; I did fly unto thee by harty prayer,full oft, and in sundry manners: sometymes cryinge unto thee Mittas Lucem tuamet veritatem, tuam quoe me ducant, etc.”Then he goes on to say that his slight experience with two different personshas convinced him of God’s wish to enlighten him through His angels. He hasheard of a man accounted a good seer and skryer, a master of arts and preachger ofthe Word, and through his means he has seen spiritual apparitions “either in thechristalline receptab\\cle, or in open ayre.” He hopes to have help from this personuntil “some after man or meanes are sent him from on high.” But Saul — for it isSaul he means — is not devout, sincere and honest. Evil spirits have come to him,much to Dee’s terror “but that thou didst pitch thy holy tent to my defence andcomfort.” He has quoted to Saul Roger Bacon’s warning to wicked devil-callers; butthe man cannot brook rebuke, and is angry at being further debarred from themysteries “which were the only things I desired, through thy grace.” He begs, mosthumbly and deprecatingly for leave to note down the actions, and asks that Annaelmay come to his help.Barnabas having proved so unreliable, he rejoiced at having found anotherskryer. The one accessory wanting, when all the table and seals were comlete, was a“shewstone.” Dee seems already to have owned several. He had used a crystalbefore this time, but a new one was desirable. One evening, towards sunset, a littlechild angel appears standing in the sunbeams from the western window of thestudy, holding in its hand a thing “most bright, most clere and clorius, of the bignessof an egg.” Michael with his fiery sword appeared and bade Dee “Go forward, take itup, and let no mortall hand touch it but thine own.”Michael tells them, too, that he and Kelley are to be joined in the holy work,united as if one man. But one is to be master, the other minister; one the hand, theother the finger. They are to be contented with their calling, for vessels are not all ofone bigness, yet all can be full. Dee is reminded that all his knowledge is “morewonderful than profitable, unless thou art led to a true use of the same.”Another spirit, Medicus Dei, or Medicina, says, “Great are the purposes ofhim whose medecine I carry,” and on one of the early march days utters someremarkable words on the precious doctrine of the universality of the Light: —“Your voices are but shadows of the voices that understand all things. Thethings you look on because you see them not indeed, you also do name amiss...“We are fully understanding. We open the eyes from the sun in the morningto the sun at night. Distance is nothing withus, unless it be the distance whichseparateth the wicked from His mercy. Secrets there arenone, but that are buried inthe shaddow of man’s sould....Iniquitie shall not range where the fire of his piercingjudgment and election doth light.”"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Calvin had been dead but twenty years, but with his scheme of election andeternal reprobation Dee had no affinity. His mind was far more in harmony withthe ancient hermetic teaching that medicine, healing, was the true road to allphilosophy.CHAPTER VIITHE CRYSTAL GAZERS“To follow knowledge like a sinking starBeyond the utmost bound of human thought.” — Tennyson, UlyssesIt is a curious picture to call up, that of the strangely assorted pair seated in theinner room at Mortlake, acting out this spiritual drama. Dee had asked forinstructions about the room for the sittings: “May my little fartherest chamberserve, if the bed be taken down?” The table, covered with its cloth stood in thecentre upon the seals. Kelley, perhaps with the black cap he is credited with havingalways worn, pulled close over his cropped ears, was seated at it. Dee at his desk satwriting in the great folio book. He was now fifty-six years old; his beard was long,but perhaps not yet “as white as milk,” as Aubrey describes it. He did not apparentlyever see the visions himself. Once he reproachfully said, “You know I cannot see orskry.” He conversed with the spirits and sometimes heard what they said; but to theeye and ear of his body they were invisible; hence his dependence upon a skryer.The sole object of his ambition was the attainment of legitimate wisdom.When conversing with the angels, how near within his grasp it seemed! Michael’sexposition seemed almost to promise it to him: —“`Wilt thou have witt and wisdom? Here it is.’“Michael points each time to a figure of seven squares shown within a circleof light.“`The exaltation and government of princes is in my hand.“`In counsayle and Nobilitie, I prevayle.“`The Gayne and Trade of Merchandise is in my hand. Lo! here it is.“The Qualitie of the Earth and Waters is my knowledge, and I know them.And here it is.“`The motion of the Ayre and those that move in it, are all known to me. Lo!here they are.“`I signifie wisdom. In fire is my government. I was in the beginning andshall be to the end.“`Mark these mysteries. For this knowne, the state of the whole earth isknowne, and all that is thereon. Mighty is God, yea, mighty is he who hathcomposed for ever. Give diligent eye. Be wise, merry and pleasant in the Lord.’“Quite early in the actions, it was told them that a third person was necessaryto the complete work. Adrian Gilbert was the first selected, and permission wasgiven for him to be made “privie of the mysteries, but not to be a practiser.”Gilbert was making ready for a voyage to the North-West. Dee and the spiritsseem to think it may be a kind of missionary enterprise, and Dee asks for (but does"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"not actually obtain) a geographical description of the country he is going to. Theanswer is that Dee knows about it, as indeed he did, sufficiently well, as we haveseen, to draw very good charts of North America and the Frozen Seas. An angelnamed Me tells him he must counsel A.G. and be his father. “Who made the sun ofnothing? Who set Nature to thrust up her shoulder amongst trees and herbs like agentle fire? How great is his power in those in whom he kindleth a soul ofunderstanding.”In Dee’s absence in London, at the Muscovy House, on Maundy Thursday(March 28), Kelley tried to summon Medicina again, but was only visited by an“illuder.” Next day Dee asks for “the veritie of his doings,” and is told that darknesshas presumed to put itself in place of light. Kelley will not be overthrown, but he isto brag not. “When I yoked your feathers together, I joined them not for a while.”The illuder is made to confess deception and is consumed by fire, and Dee turns tohis skryer with “Master Kelley, is your doubt of the spirit taken away?”Dee had been requested to prepare a calculation for the reformation of theCalendar, or at any rate to give his opinion on the scheme propounded by PopeGregory. His calculations were approved by all the English mathematicians of thetime, but the Queen, advised by the bishops, did not see her way to adopt them ineffect. Dee tells his angel friends how “grieved” he is that “Her Majestie will notreform the Kalendar in the best terms of veritie.” He desires counsel what to do.Easter Day passed, and the crystal gazing still went on. The sittings were oftenlong. On April 3, Dee ventured to tell his visitor that “it will be dark soon, and ourcompany will expect our coming down to supper. If without offence we might nowleave off, it might seem good to do so.” Three days after, he again offered a slightremonstrance, asking why they had not been warned of Mistress Frances Howard’scoming, a gentlewoman of Her Majestie’s Privy Chamber. She had causedinterruption of their exercise for a full hour, or two. Was this to be forgiven herbecause of her great charity, and goodness in procuring the Queen’s alms for manyneedy people?The Queen was then at Richmond, and Dee was several times at Court. Heseems to have been there to bid her adieu when she left for Greenwich on the 18th:— ”At her going on horseback, being new up, she called for me, by Mr. Rawly hisputting her in mynde, and she sayd, `quod defertur non aufertur,’ and gave me herright hande to kisse.”Dee was now puzzling over some mysterious papers brought him by Kelley,whether those he is reported to have found in Wales of Glastonbury we can scarcelydecide, but they seem to concern ten places in England where treasure was supposedto be hid. There is a curious drawing of them in the MS. diary: “After coming fromthe Court, I thought I would try to discover the cipher of the paper E.K. brought meas willed to do, found at Huets Cross, with a book of magic and alchemy, to which aspiritual creature led them.” Dee was by no means the easy dupe of Kelley that hehas been called. Two or three months after he first knoew him he writes in hisdiary of his “abominable lyes”; and he here makes a very telling remark, an aside, soto speak: “Of this K., I doubt yet.”Kelley’s hot, uncontrollable nature and his overbearing ways had alreadybegun to appear. There was an outbreak at supper one night because Charles Sledhad “done him an injurie in speeche at my table.” Probably some story of his early"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"career had been raked up. A voice next morning says to him appropriately: “ServeGod and take hold of nettles.”The manuscript in crabbed signs puzzled the astrologer desperately, and hewas unhappy at the delay. An angel tells him they are to be “rocks in faith.” “Whilesorrow be meansured thou shalt bind up thy fardell.” He is not to seek to know themysteries till the very hour he is called. “Can you bow to Nature and not honourthe workman?”A new spirit visits them, Il, “a merie creature, apparelled like a Vyce in a[morality] play. He skipped here and there.” Dee asks where is his Arabic book oftables that he has lent and lost. Il says it is in Scotland and is nothing worth. ThenDee asks about the Lord Treasurer’s books, for he had not seen Burleigh’s library,and had all the rival collector’s jealousy over his own treasures. He was never quitesure that Burleigh was his friend; there semed always a suspicion in his mind wherethe Lord Treasurer was concerned. The feeling was reflected in a curious dream thathe had soon after the beginning of his partner ship with Kelley: “I dreamed onSaturday night that I was deade, and afterwards my bowels wer taken out. I walkedand talked with divers, and among other with the Lord Thresorer, who was cum tomy howse to burn my bookes when I was dead. I thought he looked sourely onme.” Now, Il tells him that Burleigh has no books “belonging to Soyga,” andexplains that name as in “the language of Paradise, before Babel’s aery tower.” Deetakes up a lexicon to look for the word, but Il points to another book on “themysteries of Greek, Latin and Hebrew.” Then Il becomes very practical, and says:“Your chimney will speak against you anon,” and Dee remembers that he hadhidden there “in a cap-case” the records of his doings with Saul and the others. Iladvises Kelley to communicate to his employer the book and the powder, and allthe rest of the roll. “True friends arenot to hide anything each from the other.”This was perhaps the cause of the “great and eager pangs” that now took placebetween Dee and Kelley. The medium pretends to fear they are dealing with evilspirits. He bursts into a passion, declares he is a cumber to the house, and dwellsthere as in a prison. He had better be far away in the open country, where he canwalk abroad, and not be troubled with slanderous tongues. He is wasting his timethere, and must follow some study whereby he may live. As for these spiritmysteries, Adam and Enoch knew them before the Flood. Dee responds gfravely tothis tirade: He will wait God’s time, and he will not believe a stone will be giventhem and no bread. As to Kelley’s necessities, are not his own far greater? At thepresent moment, he owes 300 pounds, and does not know how to pay it. He hasspent forty years, and travelled thousands of miles, in incredible forcing of his wit instudy, to learn, or bowel out, some good thing, yet he would willingly go up anddown England in a blanket, begging his bread, for a year or more, if at the end hemight be sure of attaining to godly wisdom, whereby to do God service for His glory.He was resolved either willingly to leave this worlk, to enjoy the fountain of allwisdom, or to pass his days on earth in the enjoyment of its blessings and mysteries.Another violent scene occurred before long; this time the mistress of thehouse was the one offended. Dee says: “By A[drian] G[ilbert] and Providence, E.K.’svehement passions were pacified. He came back again to my house, and my wifewas willing and quiet in mind and friendly to E.K. in word and countenance. Anew pacification in all parts confirmed and all upon the confidence of God hisservice faithfully performed.” Kelley’s wife had not yet joined him at Mortlake, but"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"he had occasional letters from her. One found him in a tender religious mood,about to “pray in his bedchamber, on a little prayer book which Mr. Adrian Gilberthad left here, ad it lay on the table during the action.” It was Seven Sobbes of aSorrowful Soul for Sinne, in English metre, “made by Mr. William Harris.” Whenhe opened it, he found some automatic script in the end, or, as he calls it, acounterfeit ofhis own hand. He took it to Dee, who saw in it the work of a wickedspirit trying to shake their confidence. The next evening, both prayed against theirenemy, Kelley on his knees before the green chair standing at the chimney. Urielappeared and said temptation was requisite. “If it were not, how should men knowGod to be merciful?” He speaks to Kelley: — ”Thou, O yongling, but old sinner, whydost thou suffer thy blindness to increase? Why not yield thy Limbs to the serviceand fulfilling of an eternal veritie? Pluck up thy heart, and follow the way thatleadeth to the knowledge of the end.” He explains how the trouble is caused byBelmagel, “the firebrand who hath followed thy soul from the beginning.”The whole of this spring, the pair of partners had been busily engaged inpreparing the various things — the table, the wax seals, the ring and lamin —required for use. Most complicated diagrams of letters and figures had also beendictated to them, and Kelley, whose mathematical training had been slight, wassometimes very exhausted. Once fire shoots out of the crystal into his eyes, andwhen it is taken back, he can read no more. As Dee remarks one day to a spirit,apologising for his many questions: “For my parte I could finde it in my heart tocontynue whole days and nights in this manner of doing, even tyll my body shouldbe ready to synk down for weariness before I could give over, but I feare I havecaused weariness to my friends here.” A journey is foretold, but first of all Kelley isto go to the places of hidden treasure, and bring earth, that it may be tested. He maybe away ten days. He bought a “pretty dun mare” for the journey, of “good man“Penticost,” for which he paid three pounds ready money in angels. A day or twoafter, he took boat to London to buy a saddle, bridle, and “boote-hose.”At supper the night before he started, in a clairvoyant state, he had anextraordinary prophetic sight of the execution of Mary Queen of Scots, a beautifulwoman having her head cut off by a tall black man. He also speaks of seeing the sea,covered with many ships. Uriel warns them that foreign Powers are providingships “against the welfare of England, which shall shortly be put in practice.” It ishardly necessary to remind the reader that the Queen of Scots’ execution and thedefeat of the Spanish Armada took place in two following years, 1587, 1588, fouryears after this vision.CHAPTER VIIIMADIMI“Therefore for spirits I am so far from denying their existence that I couldeasily believe that not only whole countries but particular persons have theirtutelary and guardian angels. It is not a new opinion, but an old one of Pythagorasand Plato. There is no heresy in it, and if not manifestly defined in Scripture, yet itis an opinion of good and wholesome use in the cours and actions of a man’s life,and would serve as an hypothesis to solve many doubts whereof commonphilosophy affordeth no solution.”"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" — Sir Thomas Browne, Religio Medici.Dee’s costly apparatus and experiments, his large establishment and generoustreatment of his servants and assistants, his entertainment of great folk, were allheavy drains upon his resources. He spent lavish amounts upon books andmanuscripts for his library; he contributed as able to some of the Adventurers’funds. He borrowed freely, and he had sometimes to run long bills. Beside the rentof the two livings (about eighty pounds a year) he had no fixed income. The Queenwas ever promising him benefices which either never fell vacant, or when they did,had to be bestowed elsewhere. At the time he first fell in with Kelley, he knew notwhere to turn for money. Almost at this very moment, however, a rich patronappeared unexpectedly on the horizon and changed Dee’s outlook for severalyears.On March 18, 1583, Mr. North came to Mortlake bringing a “salutation” fromAlbert or Adelbert Laski, Count Palatine of Siradia, a Polish Prince then about toarrive on a visit to the Queen. He wished to make Dee’s acquaintance, to see hislibrary, and discuss magic, of which he had made a study. Laski was one of the mostpowerful of the Polish nobles reconverted to Catholicism. He had taken a veryprominent part in the patriotic movement of a few years before in Poland, whenalmost every European sovereign had made a bid for the Polish crown. Elizabeth’sold suitor, the Duc d’Alencon, had actually worn it a month or two before escapingin the night to his brother of France. Laski was a dashing adventurer of heroiccourage, quite unscrupulous as to cost; and although he had favoured the claims ofthe Emperor of Austria, he had, openly at least, agreed in the people’s victoriouschoice of Stephan Bathory. When that Transylvanian Prince had been elected Kingin 1576, Laski had taken a prominent part in affairs. He was popular and ambitious,not without aspiration towards the Polish crown himself. Burleigh, in writing ofhim to Hatton, called him “a personage of great estimation, few in the Empire of thegreatest exceed him in sovereignty and power.” He is described by contemporarywriters as a most learned man, handsome in stature and lineaments, richly clothed,“of very comely and decent apparel,” and of graceful behaviour. He wore his beardvery long, not clipped close like the English courtiers. He arrived in London byHarwich on May Day, and proceeded to Winchester House, Southwark, where hemade his headquarters during his stay. There seemed some doubt about how hewas to be received, whether he was actually in favour or in disgrace with KingStephan. Burleigh desired Hatton to get some Essex nobleman — Lord Rich or LordDarcy — to meet him at Harwich with proper state, “if he is the very Count Palatineof the House of Laski.” Hatton replied that he must wait to hear more fromLeicester, for in his letter to the Queen the visitor has called her “the refuge of thedisconsolate and afflicted,” so perhaps he is out of favour after all.Dee first saw Laski on May 13, at half-past seven in the evening, in the Earl ofLeicester’s apartments at the Court at Greenwich, when he was introduced byLeicester himself.Five days after the first meeting, Laski “came to me at Mortlake withonly twomen. He cam at afternone and tarryed supper, and [till] after sone set.” Near amonth elapsed before his next visit, when he made a sort of royal progress down theThames from Oxford to Mortlake."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"“June 15 about 5 of the clok, cam the Polonian Prince, Lord Albert Lasky,down from Bissham, where he had lodged the night before, being returned formOxford, whither he had gon of purpose to see the universitye, wher he was veryhonorably used and enterteyned. He had in his company Lord Russell, Sir PhilipSydney and other gentlemen: he was rowed by the Queene’s men, he had the bargecovered with the Queene’s cloth, the Queene’s trumpeters, etc. He cam of purposeto do me honor, for which God be praysed!”The visit was repeated on the 19th, when the distinguished foreigner washospitably entertained for the night. The Queen was then at Greenwich, but on July30 she and her court proceeded in great splendour up the river to Sion House. Shepassed by Dee’s door, and probably paused as usual for a greeting. Next morningLeicester rode over to Mortlake, and put the household in commotion byannouncing that Laski and others would come to dine at Mortlake on the next daybut one. These festivities were a great tax on the astrologer’s means, and heconfessed sincerely that he was “not able to prepare them a convenient dinner,unless I should sell some of my plate or some of my pewter for it. Whereupon herMajestie sent unto me very royally, within one hour after, forty angells of gold [20pounds] from Sion, whither her Majestie was now come from Greenwich.”Leicester’s secretary, Mr. Lloyd, was despatched post-haste with the gift, prompted, asDee adds, “through the Erle his speech to the Queene.” One imagine Leicester’ssomewhat peremptory suggestion and the Queen’s impulsive acquiescence. Inminor matters she was woman enough to relish being sometimes dictated to. Thesecretary also brought what was hardly less acceptable to Dee, viz., “Mr. Rawligh hisletter unto me of her Majestie’s good disposition unto me.” Raleigh was then ingreat favour with the Queen.In the intervals between these visits of the Prince, the spirits had beenconsulted about Laski’s prospects. They had at once interested themselves in him,and Madimi, one of the most fascinating of these psychical projections, hadvouchsafed some kind of genealogical information, connecting him with the Lacysand Richard, Duke of York. She was the first of the female angels who appeared toDee, as it seemed in answer to his arguments reproving Trithemius, who hadasserted that no good spirits ever took the shape of women. Madimi, who suddenlyappeared on May 28, was “like a pretty girle of 7 or 9 years, attired ina gown of Sey,changeable green and red, with a train”; her hair was “rowled up before and hangingdown very long behind.” She came into the study and played by herself; “sheseemed to go in and out behind my books;...the books semed to give placesufficiently, one heap with the other, while she passed between them.” Sheannounced that her elder sister would come presently, and corrected Dee’spronunciation fo her name. “My sister is not so short as you make her: Esemeli notEsemeli.” Madimi was a very clever and accomplished little fairy. She learnedGreek, Arabic, and Syrian on purpose to be useful to Dee. On June 14 Dee asked thespirit Galvah, or Finis, what she had to say about the “Polandish Lord AlbertusLaski.” The reply came, “Ask me these things to-morrow.” But when the next daycame, Kelley, the seer, “spent all that afternoon (almost) in angling, when I was verydesirous to have had his company and helping hand in this action.” So at the nextsitting Galvah administers to Kelley a sharply pointed reproof: “You, sir, were bestto hunt and fish after Verity.” Dee adds that “she spake so to E.K. because he spent"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"too much time in Fishing and Angling.” Then he asked if Laski should return toPoland in August, if his relation with the Prince should bring him credit, and howshould he “use himself therin to God’s liking, his country’s honour, and his owncredit.” Galvah replied oracularly: “He shall want no direction in anything hedesireth.” “Whom God hath armed, no man can prevaile against.” Again, on June19, Dee asked if it would be best for the Prince to take the first opportunity of goinghomeward.“It shall be answered soon,” replied Galvah.“May he be present at the action?”“Those that are of this house are not to be denied the Banquets therein.”“May I request you to cause some sensible apparition to appear to him, tocomfort him and establish his minde more abundantly in the godly intent of Godhis service?”“If he follow us, let him be governed by us. But whatsoever is of flesh is notof us.”“You perceive how he understandeth of the Lord Treasurer his grudgeagainst him. And perhaps some others also are of like malicious nature. Whatdanger may follow hereof, or encombrance?”“The sum of his life is already appointed; one jot cannot bediminished. But he that is Almighty can augment at his pleasure.Let him rejoice in poverty, be sorry for his enemies, and do theworks of justice.”Then the “cloud of invisibility” — a drop scene between the acts — came overGalvah, and she disappeared.Next day Laski was present at the action. An angel named Jubanladecappeared, and said he was appointed the Prince’s “good governour or Angel,” “thekeeper and defender of this man present.” He bade him “look to the steps of hisyouth, measure the length of his body, live better and see himself inwardly.”Excellent advice, which might have been continued had not a man named Tanfield,attached to the Prince, arrived suddenly at Mortlake, with a message from the Court,and, contrary to all good manners, burst into the study. Laski had gone out anotherway through the oratory to meet him. The angel was annoyed, and prophesiedrather unkindly that in five months the rash interrupter should be devoured byfishes of the sea. Was he drowned then or ever? Then the thread was resumed.“What do ye seek after? Do ye hunt after the swiftness of the winds? Or areyou imagining a form unto the coulds? Or go ye forth to hear the braying of anAsse, which passeth away with the swiftness of the air? Seek for true wisdom, for itbeholdeth the highest and appeareth unto the lowest.”Then Laski’s guardian angel becomes extremely practical and interesting:“Cecil hateth him [Laski] to the heart, and desireth he were gone hence. Manyothers do privily sting at him.”Dee endeavours to keep him to the point."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"“For his return, what is your advice? Perhaps he wanteth necessaryprovision, and money.”“He shall be helpen, perhaps miraculously. Let him go so soon as he canconveniently.”“I say again, perhaps he wanteth money; but the Treasures of the Lord are notsent to them whom he favoureth.”“His help shall be strange. The Queen loveth him faithfully and hath fallenout with Cecil about him. Leicester flattereth him. His doings are looked intonarrowly. But I alwayes inwardly direct him. I will minister such comfort to him asshall be necessary in the midst of all his doings.”Mingled with these sayings were some prophetical utterances about Laskiovercoming the Saracens and Paynims with a bloody cross shown in his hand, andabout Dee’s passing to his country and aiding him to establish his kingdom. Thenthe familiar spirit sank through the table like a spark of fire, “seeming to make hasteto his charge, I mean the Lord Laski.”On Wednesday, the 26th, Laski again being present, the good angel Il appearedwith a besom in his hand. The Prince’s pedigree was then barely begun, but on June29 the clever little Madimi promised to finish the book exactly as Dee would havewritten it. It was no matter where the book was left, she told him, locked up or lyingabout. “Your locks are no hindrance to us.”“You have eased my heart of a thousand pound weight,” ejaculated Dee,fervently. “Now I shall have leisure to follow my sute, and to do all Mr. Gilbert’sbusinesse.”Madimi was much too learned a scholar for Kelley, who on this same daygrew very angry with her for speaking to him in Greek, of which he knew nothing,not even the alphabet. As an alternative she gave him Arabic. “Unless you speaksome language which I understand, I will expresse no more of this Gibberish,” hesaid, rudely.Poor Dee! His skryer was a constant anxiety to him. Like every mediumsince known, he would sometimes apply himself and sometimes not, was oftenhonest and yet frequently a cheat.Dee writes: —“My heart did throb oftentimes this day, and I thought E.K. did intend toabsent himself from me, and now upon this warning, I was confirmed, and moreassured that it was so. Whereupon seeing him make such haste to ride to Islington,I asked him why he so hasted to ride thither. And I said if it were to ride to Mr.harry Lee, I would go thither also, to be acquainted with him; seeing now I had sogood leisure, being eased of the book writing [through Madimi’s good offices]. Thenhe said that one told him the other day that the Duke did but flatter him, and toldhim other things, both against the Duke and me. I answered for the Duke andmyself, and also said that if the forty pound annuity which Mr. Lee did offer himwas the chief cause of his mind feeling that way (contrary to some of his formerpromises to me), that then I would assure him of fifty pounds yearly, and would domy best by following of my sute [with the Queen] to bring it to passe as soon aspossibly I could, and thereupon did make him promise upon the Bible. Then E.K.again, upon the same Bible, did swear unto me constant friendship and never to"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"forsake me: And moreover said that unless this had so faln out, he would havegone beyond the Seas, taking ship at Newcastle, within eight days next. And so wedid plight our faith to one another, taking each other by the hands upon thesepoints of brotherly and friendly fidelity during life, which Covenant I beseech Godto turn to his honour, glorie and service, and the comfort of our brethren (hischildren) here on earth.”This reconciliation was not for long, in spite of the promised salary, and soonanother scene occurred. On June 5 Dee write that from nine in the morning Kelleywas “in a marvellous great disquietness of mind, fury and rage,” because his brotherThomas Kelley brought him word, first, that a commission was out to attach andapprehend him as a felon for coining money; second, that his wife, whom he hadleft at Mistress Freeman’s house at Blockley, having heard from Mr. Hussey that hewas a cosener, had gone home to her mother, Mrs. Cooper, at Chipping Norton.Dee is “touched with a great pang of compassion,” grieved that any Christian shoulduse such speeches and be of so revenging a mind, even more than he is distressedthat his own credit shall be endangered for embracing the company of such adisorderly person, especially if he be arreseted at Mortlake, “which will be no smallgrief and disgrace.” But he so generously resolves to stand by his friend. Kelley, itseems, had been met coming from Islington with his scroll, book and powder, andhad been threatened to “be pulled in pieces” if he brought them to Dee. A drawingin the margin of the MS. shows the book to have had a cross on the cover, one clasp,and deep metal bands across its two sides. Presumably these were some of thetreasures reported to have been found at Glastonbury.A day or two after, June 18, Kelley again simulated great fear and distress atseeing evil spirits. He protested he would skry no more, and was so excited that hebrought on himself the wise rebuke from Galvah: “He that is angry cannot seewell.” He seems to have wished to show Laski some reprobate spirits in Dee’s study,but the older man wisely kept the crystal and teh “table of communion” under hisown control. It was, perhaps, partly cunning that made Kelley, although he reallypossessed extraordinary mediumistic powers, so sceptical. “I am Thomas Didymus,”he says to the spirits. “How can ye persuade me ye are no deluders?”Three days after this, Dee was writing letters to Adrian Gilbert, in Devonshire,when Madimi suddenly appeared to Kelley, who was seated in the green chair.Dee said, “How is the mind of Mr. Secretary toward me? Methinketh it isalienated marvellously.”Dee had long been on neighbourly terms with Sir Francis and LadyWalsingham. If any cause existed for supposing both Burleigh’s and Walsingham’sattitude toward him was changed, it may have been that the Lord Treasurer, thegreat finanacier of the time, resented his constant applications for a salary from theexchequer, while Walsingham, with his intimate knowledge of foreign affairs,perhaps misdoubted this intimacy between Dee and the scheming Polish Prince.Curiously enough, it was through this very intimacy with Laski that both Burleighand Walsingham came later to regard the alchemists in the light of a valuablenational asset.Madimi replied —"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"“The Lord Treasurer and he are joyned together, and they hate thee. I heardthem when they both said, thou wouldst go mad shortly. Whatever they can doagainst thee, assure thyself of. They will shortly lay a bait for thee, but eschewthem.”D. — ”Lord have mercy upon me, what bait, I beseech you, and by whom?”M. — ”They have determined to search thy house, but they stay untill theDuke be gone.”D. — ”What would they search it for?”M. — ”They hate the Duke, both, unto death.”Then with a sharp caution to Kelley to deal uprightly with Dee, and aprotestation from him of his “faithful mind” to his master, she goes on to reveal thesuspicions attached to Laski: —M. — ”Look unto the kind of people about the Duke in the manner of theirdiligence.”D. — ”What mean you by that? His own people? Or who?”M. — ”The espies.”D. — ”Which be those?”M. — ”All. There is not one true.”D. — ”You mean the Englishmen.”M. — ”You are very grosse if you understand not my sayings.”D. — ”Lord! what is thy counsel to prevent all?”M. — ”The speech is general. The wicked shall not prevail.”D. — ”But will they enter to search my house or no?”M. — ”Immediately after the Duke his going, they will.”D. — ”To what intent? What do they hope to find?”M. — ”They suspect the Duke is inwardly a traitor.”Dee replies with sincerity, “They can by no means charge me, no not so muchas with a traitorous thought.”M. — ”Though thy thoughts be good, they cannot comprehend the doings ofthe wicked. In summe, they hate thee. Trust them not. They shall go about shortlyto offer thee friendship. But be thou a worm in a heap of straw.”D. — ”I pray you expound that parable.”M. — ”A heap of straw being never so great, is no weight upon a worm.Notwithstanding every straw hindereth the worm’s passage. See them and be notseen of them; dost thou understand it?”It now seemed certain that Dee and his skryer were to embark their fortuneswith Laski. Dee begs for particular instructions when they had better take ship, whatshall be done with all the furniture prepared and standing in the chamber ofpractice? Is it best for the Pole to resort hither oft, or to stay quiet at his house inLondon?Madimi retorts —“Thou hast no faith. He is your friend greatly and intendeth to do much foryou. He is prepared to do thee good, and thou art prepared to do him service. Those"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"who are not faithful shall die a most miserable death, and shall drink of sleepeverlasting.”A couple of days after, on July 4, Dee returning from Court, found Kelleymaking preparation to go away for five days, having fixed to met some companionsin Mortlake, others in Brentford. Doubtless he found all this mystical and angelicsociety somewhat of a bore, and was yearning for an outburst a little more to histaste. Dee, who had seen Laski in London, knew that he intended to come down toMortlake within a day or two, “who also,” he says, “delighted in E.K. his company.”So he wrote a short note in very polite Latin to the “Nobilissimi Princeps,” biddinghim put off his visit, as “our Edward” was about to take a journey, and would not behome for five days, or so he says: “Quid sit ipsa veritas.”He showed Kelley the letter. Kelley took great offence at these words,suspecting some secret understanding between the two against him. Dee gentlyreferred to Kelley’s own words that his return might be within, or at the end of, fivedays. Kelley, angry and suspicious, seized the letter and tore it up.Soon after, Kelley beholds “a spiritual creature” by his right shoulder, tellinghim to go clean away, for if he stays there he will be hanged. If he goes with thePrince, he will cut off his head, and (to Dee)“You mean not to keep promise with me. And therefore if I might have athousand pound to tarry, yea, a kingdom, I cannot. Therefore I release you of yourpromise of 50 pounds yearly stipend to me, and you need not doubt but God willdefend you and prosper you, and can of the very stones raise up children untoAbraham. And again, I cannot abide my wife, I love her not, nay, I abhor her, andhere in the house I am misliked because I favour her no better.”Dee endeavoured to calm this turbulent young man, spoke of his confidencein him in his dealings with their spiritual friends, but such doings and sayings asthese, he points out, are not meet and fitting.Kelley flung out of the room in a passion, mounted his mare, and rode offfuriously towards Brentford, clattering out of the house with such commotion thatJane came running up to her husband’s study to know what was the matter. It wasabout seven o’clock in the evening.“`Jane,’ I said, `this man is marvellously out of quiet against his wife, for herfriends their bitter reports against him behind his back, and her silence thereat, etc.He is gone,’ said I, `but I beseech the Almighty God to guide him and defend himfrom danger and shame. I doubt not but God will be merciful to him, and bring himat length to such order as he shall be a faithful servant unto God.’“Then a remarkable thing happened. By ten o’clock that night (the longmidsummer twilight barely over), the prodigal returned, and mounted softly up thestudy stairs, “unbooted, for he was come in a boat from Brentford. When I saw him,I was very glad inwardly. But I remained writing of those records as I had yet towrite, of last Tuesday’s action.“`I have lent my mare,’ he said, `and so am returned.’“`It is well done,’ said I."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"“Thereupon he sate down in the chair by my table where he was wont to sit.He took up in his hand the books which I had brought from London, of the LordLaskie, written to him in his commendations.” Evidently books sent to Kelley byway of compliment.Almost immediately, Madimi, who seemed to have a special wardship overbooks, appeared. She patted the parchment cover of one and would have taken itout of Kelley’s hand. Dee heard the strokes, he says. He took a paper and, greetinghis visitor, noted the conversation.D. — ”Mistresse Madimi, you are welcome in God for good, as I hope. Whatis the cause of your coming now?”M. — ”To see how you do.”D. — I know you see me often, but I see you onely by faith and imagination.”M. (who is always more personal than the other spirits) —“That sight is perfecter than his,” pointing to Kelley.D. (with emotion) — ”O Madimi, shall I have any more of these grievouspangs?”M. (oracularly) — ”Curst wives and great Devils are sore companions.”D. — ”In respect of the Lord Treasurer, Mr. Secretary and Mr. Rawly, I prayyou, what worldly comfort is there to be looked for? Besides that I do principally putmy trust in God.”M. — ”Madder will staine, wicked men will offend, and are easie to beoffended.”D. — ”And being offended, will do wickedly, to the persecution of them thatmean simply.”M. — ”Or else they were not to be called wicked.”D. — ”As concerning Alb. Laski, his pedigree, you said your sister would tellall.”M. — ”I told you more than all your Dog painters and Cat painters can do.”Kelley interrupts Dee’s questions about Laski’s pedigree and parentage,impatiently, withK. — ”Will you, Madimi, lend me a hundred pounds for a fortnight?”M. — ”I have swept all my money out of doors.”D. — As for money, we shall have that which is necessary when God seethtime.”Then Madimi, becoming serious, addresses to Kelley a beautiful exposition ofthe unity of all things: “Love is the spirit of God uniting and knitting thingstogether in a laudable proportion.” She turns sharply to him, with“What dost thou hunt after? Speak, man, what doest though huntafter?...Thou lovest not God. Lo, behold, thou breakest his commandments: thybragging words are confounded...If thou hast none of these [faith, hope, love] thouhast hate. Dost thou love Silver and Gold? The one is a Thief; the other is aMurderer. Wilt thou seek honour? So did Cain. But thou hast a just God that"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"loveth thee, just and virtuous men that delight in thee. Therefore be thouvirtuous.”Next follows a remarkable scene. Madimi summons Barma and his fourteenevil companions, who have assumed possession of Kelley, with the words “VeniteTenebrae fugite spirito meo,” and orders them to return to the Prince of Darkness:“Depart unto the last cry. Go you thither....The hand of the Lord is like a strong oak.When it falleth it cutteth in sunder many bushes. The light of His eyes shall expeldarkness.”Kelley sees the whole crew sink down through the floor of the chamber: “Athing like a wind came and pluckt them by the feet away.” He professes hisdeliverance: “Methinketh I am lighter than I was, and I seem to be empty and to bereturned from a great amazing. For this fortnight, I do not well remember what Ihave done or said.”“Thou art eased of a great burden. Love God. Love thy friends. Love thywife.”And with this parting injunction, and a psalm of thanksgiving from Dee, thestory of Kelley’s wild attack of temper, or as it was regarded in teh sixteenth century,his possession, for the present ends. Nor is there any record of further dealings withspirits for more than two months.CHAPTER IXA FOREIGN JOURNEY“Friends are everywhere to him that behave himself well, and a prophet isnot esteemed in his country.” — Robert BurtonThere is a hiatus in the Liber Mysteriorum after this tempestuous scene withKelley. We can, however, slightly fill it up from Dee’s other diary. It seems as if theskryer went away, leaving behind at Mortlake the poor slighted wife, who musthave joined him there, for Dee notes on July 7 payment of wages to a servant hedismissed, “in the presens of Goodman Hilton and Mistress Kelley in my study.”On the 30th, as we have seen, the Queen came in grand procession, heraldedwith music and song, down the river to Sion. The next day, Leicester’s secretarybrought letters and gifts. On August I, John Halton, a London minister, called; also aWorcestershire man, “a wicked spy came to my howse, whom I used as an honestman, and found nothing wrong, as I thought. He was sent to E.K.”This entry is characteristic of the philosopher who, in spite of all his learning,was, as regards men, of so confiding and innocent a nature that he ended by beinginfinitely more deceived by another Worcestershire man — Kelley, for whom heentertained to the last a most faithful friendship.Then we come on a very entertaining remark in the diary: “Aug. 18. A greattempest of wynde at midnight. Maxima era E. K. cum uxore ejus.” Kelley had"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"returned, and his wife was treated to another of his outbreaks, by comparison withwhich the gale outside was slight.This is the last entry in the diary before Dee’s departure for Poland with Laski.The Prince proposed to take the whole party from Mortlake back with him tothe Continent. He was reputed to be deeply in debt, and seems to have entertainedwild hopes that they, aided by the spirits, would provide him with gold, and secureto him the crown of Poland. Kelley foresaw an easy and luxurious life, plenty ofchange and variety suited to his restless, impetuous nature. He hadn ot as yet beenout of England. There were very obvious reasons that he should quit the countrynow if he would escape a prison. Dee had been a great traveller, as we know, andthese were not the attractions to a man of his years. He went in obedience to asupposed call, in the hope of furthering his own knowledge and the Prince’s good.The notion of providing for himself and his family lay doubtless at the back of hismind also, but he had all a genius’s disregard for thrift and economy, and thoughvery precise and practical about small details, as his diary proves, his mind refusedto contemplate these larger considerations of ways and means.He disposed of the house at Mortlake to his brother-in-law, NicholasFromond, but in such a loose and casual way that before his return he foundhimself compelled to make a new agreement with him. He took no steps aboutappointing a receiver of the rents of his two livings, and when he came back thewhole six years were owing, nor did he ever obtain the money. He says he intendedat the most to be absent one year and eight months. It was more than six yearsbefore he again set foot in England.So, unprepared, he left Mortlake about three in the afternoon of Saturday,September 21, 1583. He met the Prince by appointment on the river, and travelledup after dark to London. A certain secrecy was observed about the journey. laski, aswe have seen, was under some suspicion of Walsingham and Burleigh, whosebusiness it had become to learn news from every Court in Europe. He was suspectedof plots against the King of Poland.In the dead of night, Dee and Laski went by wherries to Greenwich, “to myfriend Goodman Fern, the Potter, his house, where we refreshed ourselves.”Probably a man whom Dee had employed to make retorts and other vessels for hischemical work. Perhaps they met there the rest of the party, but on the whole itseems more probable that all started together from Mortlake. The exit of such acompany from the riverside house must have been quite an event. At Gravesend, a“great Tylte-boat” rowed up to Fern’s house, on the quay, and took them out to thetwo vessels arranged to convey them abroad. These ships, which Dee had hired,were lying seven or eight miles down stream — a Danish double fly-boat, in whichLaski, Dee, Kelley, Mrs. Dee and Mrs. Kelley and the three children, Arthur,Katherine and Rowland Dee, embarked at sunrise on Sunday morning; and a boyer,“a pretty ship,” which conveyed the Prince’s men, some servants of Dee, and acouple of horses. They sailed at once, but the wind coming from N.W., theyanchored on the Spits. The fly-boat dragged her anchor, and the wind suddenlychanging to N.E., they were in danger of grounding. However, next morning theymade Queenborough Haven, and landed in small fishing boats. On the landing, theboat in which the party were seated was nearly upset. Water came in up to theirknees, an oar was lost, and they were in considerable peril, but Kelley seems to haverisen to the occasion by baling water out of the bottom with a great gauntlet. Dee"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"thinks he saved their lives. Dee, poor man, was dropped from the captain’s back onlanding into ooze and mud, so that he was “foule arrayed” on reaching“Queenborough town, up the crooked creek.” “God be praised for ever that all thatdanger was ended with so small grief or hurt,” is his cheerful comment.After three nights ashore, they again embarked, and at daybreak on the 27thsailed out into the Channel. On the 29th they landed at Brill. Here Laski’s guardianangel, Jubanladec, seems to have granted them an interview. They only paused fortwo or three days, and hurried on, travelling forward each day by the sluggish Dutchcanals, having exchanged their vessel for a hoy of Amsterdam at Rotterdam. Theypassed through Tergowd and Haarlem to Amsterdam; here they stayed three days,and Dee despatched Edmond Hilton with his heavy goods by sea to Dantzic. ByEnkhuisen they sailed up the Zuyder Zee to Harlingen, then took the canals again inlittle “scuts,” or small boats, to Leewarden, thence to Dokkum, in West Friesland, insomestill smaller craft. On the Sunday spent at Dokkum, Gabriel appeared in thecrystal, and delivered to them the most searching and exalted code of ideals for theconduct of their lives. Everything was laid bare before his relentless and unerringeyes. They were bidden to live in brotherly charity, the imperfections of each to beby the other “perfectly shadowed in charity.”“Bear your own infirmities, and so the infirmities of others, with quiet andhidden minde...The Cross of Christ is the comparison in mildness over thybrethren...He that forsaketh the world for the love of God in Christ shall have hisreward, but he that forsaketh himself shall be crowned with a diadem of glory.Bridle the flesh. Riotousness is the sleep of death and the slumber to destruction.Feed the soul, but bridle the flesh, for it is insolent. Look to your servants. Makethem clean. Let your friendship be for the service of God. All frienship else is vainand of no account. Persevere to the end. Many men begin, but few end. He thatleaveth off is a damned soul.”From Dokkum the travellers put out to sea again, beyond the islands, andsailed up the Western Ems to Embden. They arrived after dusk, and found the citygates shut, so they lay all night on shipboard. Next morning, the 18th October, Laskitook up his quarters at “The White Swan,” on the quay, for he was to remain thereto see the Landgrave, and obtain money. The others “lay at `The Three GoldenKeys,’ by the English House,” and left early next morning by a small boat to sail upthe river Ems to Leer, and thence by a little tributary to Stickhuysen and Apen — ”avery simple village,” and so on to Oldenburg. A night there, and then on byDelmenhorst to Bremen, where they lodged at “an old widow, her house, at thesigne of the Crown.”Here Il, the jaunty spirit who was like a Vice in a morality play, againappeared to them, clad in a white satin jerkin, ragged below the girdle. The curtainlifted, and his first words were theatrically light.“Room for a player! Jesus! who would have thought I should have met youhere?”D. (solemnly). — ”By the mercies of God we are here. And by your will andpropriety and the power of God, you are here.”Il. “Tush, doubt not of me, for I am Il.”"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Kelley (with rebuke). — ”My thinketh that the gravity of this action requiretha more grave gesture, and more grave speeches.”Il. — ”If I must bear with thee for speaking foolishly, which art but flesh andspeakest of thy own wisdom, how much more oughtest thou to be contented withmy gesture, which is appointed of Him which regardeth not the outward form, butthe fulfilling of His will and the keeping of His commandments, etc., etc.”Kelley. — ”I do not understand your words. I do only repeat your sayings.”Il. — ”It is the part of a servant to do his duty, of him that watcheth to lookthat he seeth...Do that which is appointed, for he that doeth more is not a trueservant.”Il turns from Kelley to Dee. “Sir, here is money, but I have it very hardly.Bear with me, for I can help thee with no more. Come on, Andras; where are you,Andras?” he calls.Andras, in a bare and shabby gown, “like a London ‘prentice,” appears, butempty-handed.Il. — ”This is one of those that forgetteth his businesse so soon as it is toldhim.”Andras. — ”Sir, I went half-way.”Il. — ”And how then? Speak on. Speak on.”Andras. — ”Then, being somewhat weary, I stayed, the rather because I metmy friends. The third day, I came thither, but I found them not at home. His familytold me he had gone forth.”Il. — ”And you returned a coxcomb. Well, thus it is. I placed thee above myservants, and did what I could to promote thee. But I am rewarded with loytringand have brought up an idle person. Go thy way, the officer shall deliver thee toprison, and there thou shalt be rewarded. For such as do that they are commandeddeserve freedom; but unto those that loytre and are idle, vengeance and hungerbelongeth.”Then Dee questions Il about Laski, and whether he is having any success inhis efforts to obtain money, about Laski’s brother-in-law, Vincent Seve, whoseerrand in England is not yet completed, and whether they shall all arrive safe atCracow, or the place appointed.Kelley has a sight of Master Vincent in a black satin doublet, “cut with crosscuts,” a ruff and a long cloak, edged with black or blue. Then Il goes off into amystical rhapsody, at the end of which he suddenly falls “all in pieces as small asashes.”Next day, Kelley sees Master Vincent again, walking down by Charing Cross,accompanied by “a tall man with a cutberd, a sword and skie-coloured cloack.” Hepasses on towards Westminster and overtakes a gentleman on horseback with fivefollowers in short cape-cloaks and long moustaches. The rider is a lean-visagedman in a short cloak and with a gold rapier. His horse wears a velvet foot cloth. (Itsounds like a vision of Raleigh.)They are merry. Vincent laughs heartily and shows two broad front teeth. Hehas a little stick in his crooked fingers. The scar on his left hand is plainly seen. Hehas very high straight close boots. They arrive at Westminster Church (the Abbey).Many people are coming out. A number of boats lie in the river, and in the gardensat Whitehall a man is grafting fruit trees. The lean-visaged man on horseback"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"alights, and goes down towards, and up, the steps of Westminster Hall, Vincentwith him. His companion walks outside and accosts a waterman. The watermanasks if that is the Polish bishop? The servant wants to know what business it is ofhis. A messenger comes down the steps of the Hall and says to Vincent’s man thathis master shall be despatched to-morrow. The servant saith he is glad of it. “Thenall that shew is vanished away.”There are one or two allusions here to an emissary from Denmark who hasbrought a bag of amber. Il also says he has much business in Denmark. Frederick,the King of Denmakr, was in frequent correspondence with Queen Elizabeth at thistime.At Bremen, where they stayed a week, Dee says that Kelley, when skrying byhimself, was given a kind of rambling prophetical verse of thirty-two lines, whichhe prints, foretelling the downfall of England, Spain, France and Poland. In fact, ageneral debacle of nations. It is very bad prophecy and still worse poetry, butevidently inspired by the highly diplomatic foreign relations of Elizabeth and hertwo ministers.On leaving Bremen, the party travelled by Osterholz to Harburg, on the leftbank of the Elbe. They crossed the river and went on by coach to Hamburg. Laskihad then rejoined them, but stayed behind in Hamburg, at “the English house,”probably the consul’s. Dee and the rest reached Lubeck on November 7.CHAPTER XPROMISES AND VISIONS“Search while thou wilt; and let thy reason goTo ransom truth, e’en to th’abyss below;Rally the scattered causes; and that lineWhich nature twists be able to untwine.It is thy Maker’s will; for unto noneBut unto reason can He e’er be known.” — Sir Thomas BrowneThe dealings which Kelley had in Lubeck with the spirits seem to throw alight on all his relations with Dee. Kelley is gaining confidence; he sees that he isalready able to dupe his employer considerably. He has only to manipulate theconversations a little to show up often his so-called sincerity. He can pretend he isaghast at Il’s levity, and he seems to have been cunning enough when the spiritsvery often blamed him.Buthis dreams of advancement in wealth and fame were no neareraccomplishment. He had seen through Dee’s ambition. It was very different fromhis own, but he thought he could use it to his own advantage. Dee was nowflattered without stint.So at the sitting in November 15 he sees eleven noblemen in rich sables.One, wearing a regal cap trimmed with sable, is seated on a chair beset with preciousstones. “He is a goodlier man than the Lord A.L.” He addresses Dee with glitteringpromises. He is the King or the Emperor, and is represented in the margin of thediary by a crown. He says to Dee: —"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"“Pluck up thy heart and be merry, pine not thy Soul away with inwardgroanings, for I will open unto thee the secrets of Nature and the riches of theworld, and withal give thee such direction that shall deliver thee from manyinfirmities both of body and mind, ease thee of they tedious labours and settle theewhere thou shalt have comfort.“Thanks be given unto the Highest now and ever.“Why doest thou [hesitate] within thy thought? Hast thou not need ofcomfort?”“Yes, God knows, for I am half confounded.”“Then first determine within thyself to rest thee for this winter. Secondly,open thy mind to desire such things as may advance thy credit and enrich thyfamily, reap unto thee many friends and lift thee up to honour. For I will stir up themindes of learned men, the profoundest in the world, that they shall visit thee.And I will disclose unto you such things as shall be wonderful and of exceedingprofit. Moreover I will put to my hands and help your proceedings, that the worldmay talk of your wisdom hereafter. Therefore wander not farther into unknownplaces: contagious, the very seats of death for thee and thy children and such as arethy friends. If thou enquire of me where and how, I answer, everywhere, or howthou wilt. Thou shalt forthwith become rich, and thou shalt be able to enrich kingsand help such as are needy. Wast thou not born to use the commodity of thisworld? were not all things made for man’s use?”Here are the old dreams of the philosopher’s stone, the elixir of life, thetransmutation of metals and all the works of alchemy, for which both thesetravellers were adventuring their lives in a foreign land. Dee does not seem exactlydazzled by these allurements. He only begs leave to ask questions, and seeks to keepthe speaker to the point. “Are they to stay there and not to go on with Laski?Where are they to spend the winter?”“Where you will,” comes the answer. “Are you so unwise as to go with himnow? Let him go before, and provide for himself and the better for you. In theSummer, when it is more fair, you can follow. The weather now will be hard andthe travel unfit for children. Heap not up thy wife’s sorrow.”“I desire to live in quiet that my spirit may the better attend to the service ofGod.”“Well, you are contented?”Dee asks again, are they to part from Laski? Will it not be prejudicial to theirarrangement, they having entered into a kind of covenant with him? “Are you notcontent?” the visitor repeats.Then he did impart some remarkable information to Dee, in which there wascertainly a grain of telepathically conveyed truth.“Your brother is clapped up in prison. How like you that? Your house-keeper I mean.”This evidently refers to Nicholas Fromond."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"“They examine him. They say that thou hast hid divers secret things. As forthy books, thou mayst go look at them at leasure. It may be that thy house may beburnt for a remembrance of thee, too. Well, if they do, so it is. I have given thee mycounsel, and desired to do thee good. The choice is thine.”There is no evidence that Fromond was imprisoned, but he was a poorprotector of his brother-in-law’s valuable effects. He was powerless against a mobwho broke into Dee’s house not long after his departure from Mortlake, made havocof his priceless books and instruments, and wrought irreparable damage. It was notnearly two months since Dee had left Mortlake, and, moving from place to place, itwas unlikely that he had heard any news from thence. No date has ever beenassigned to this action of the mob. It is quite conceivable that it actually took placeon this day, November 15, and that by Kelley’s clairvoyant or telepathic power thenews was communicated across the sea and continent to Dee.The poor astrologer was torn with doubts and misgivings. He fell upon hisknees, uttering a piercing supplication to the “Author of all truth and direction ofsuch as put their trust in him.”“I most humbly beseech thee consider these promises thus to mepropounded. If they be true and from thee, confirm them. If they be illusions andnot from thee, disprove them. For hardly in my judgment they do or can agree withour former precepts and order taken by thee.”And again, in an agony:“O Lord, I doubt of these promises of ease, wealth, and honour: I suspect thewhole apparition of the eleven to be an illusion. O confirm my judgment ordisprove it.”So he seeks for a revelation of guidance, writes letters to Laski, and waits.Soon he perceives these temptations to have come from “a very foolish devil.” Hedecides that they will continue to throw in their lot with Laski, who rejoined themin Lubeck. He left again to visit the Duke of Mecklenburg, they meanwhile going byWismar to Rostock and Stettin, which place they reached at ten o’clock onChristmas morning. Laski joined them in a fortnight. They passed on by Stayard toPosen, where Dee adds an antiquarian note that the cathedral church was foundedin 1025, and that the tomb of Wenceslaus, the Christian king, is of one huge stone.It was here that Dee began to enter curous notes about Kelley in the LiberPeregrinationis, written in Greek characters, but the words are Latin words, or morefrequently English. The supposition is that Kelley was unacquainted even with theGreek alphabet. Dee kept his other foreign diary, written in an EphemeridesCoelestium (printed in Venice, 1582), secret from his partner, for Kelley hadobtained possession of an earlier one kept in England and had written in itunfavourable comments, as well as erased things, about himself. Dee had the lastword, and has added above Kelley’s “shameful lye,” “This is Mr. Talbot’s, his ownwriting in my boke, very unduely as he came by it.” The various diaries sound,perhaps, confusing to the reader, but are really quite simple. By the private diary ismeant the scraps in the Bodleian Almanacs, edited by Halliwell for the Camden"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Society, in which he seldom alludes to psychic affairs. The Book of Mysteries is thediary in which he relates all the history of the crystal gazing. The printed version(True Relation) begins with Laski’s visit to Mortlake on May 28, 1583.Winter had now set in with unwonted rigour, and one is amazed at thecelerity with which this great caravanserai of people and goods pushed on fromplace to place. From Stettin to Posen, for instance, is more than 200 miles, and it wsaccomplished within four days and apparently with only one stop. Thensouthwards into the watery district between the Oder and the Warthe, where thecountry was so icebound that they had to employ five-and-twenty men to cut the icefor their coaches for a distance as long as two English miles. On February 3 theyreached Lask, on the Prince’s own property, and at last were comfortably housed inthe Provost’s “fair house by the Church.” Here Dee was ill with ague, but the tablewas set up, and a new spirit called Nalvage appeared in teh globe. Nalvage’s“pysiognomy was like the picture of King Edward the Sixth. His hair hangethdowna quarter of the length of the cap, somewhat curling, yellow.” Dee, of course,had seen the young King when he presented his books, so this is a first-handreminiscence. Nalvage stood upon a round table of mother-of-pearl, and revealedto them many cabalistic mysteries, tables of letters and names. There was a terriblevision of Mrs. Dee lying dead, with her face all battered in, and of the maid Marybeing pulled our of a pool of water half drowned. But it seems to portent no morethan did another piece of ill news conveyed at the same time: “Sir Harry Sidneydied upon Wednesday last. A privy enemy of yours.” Dee says, “I ever took him forone of my chief friends,” and adds, with unconscious humour:“Note. At Prague, Aug. 24, I understood that Sir H. Sidney was not dead inFebruary nor March, no, not in May last. Therefore this must be considered. DoctorHagek, his son, told me.”This note makes us realise for a moment how slowly news travelled fromEngland to the Continent in this year of grace 1584.The informant, Madimi, “a little wench in white,” told Dee that she had beenin England at his house, and all there were well. The Queen said she was sorry shehad lost her philosopher. But the Lord Treasurer answered, “He will come homeshortly a begging to you.” “Truly,” adds Madimi, “none can turn the Queen’s heartfrom you.” Then, recurring to Mortlake, she says: “I could not come into yourstudy. The Queen hath caused it to be sealed.” This no doubt after the breaking inof the rioters. Dee was counselled to go and live at Cracow. He would like to be ledstep by step, and begs to know what house “is in God’s determination for me andmine.” Madimi answers, “As wise as I am, I cannot yet tell what to say.” Deedemurs to the expense, and reproaches her for not telling them sooner. Needlesscost would have been saved, and he does not know if Laski will have enoughmoney for yet another move. He had rather Kesmark had been redeemed beforeLaski went to Cracow. Perhaps then his credit with the people would be greater.Laski had heavily mortgaged his estates in Poland; he was in debt, and he hadapparently raised a loan on his Kesmark property for a large sum of money. Thebond was to expire on St. George’s Day, April 23 next, and without the Emperor’shelp Dee did not see how it could be met. Kelley recurs to the Danish treasure hehad found in England, hidden in ten places, which they would fain have"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"transported to Poland now, very speedily, for Laski’s use. Dee is anxious to kowfrom Madimi whether his rents are being duly received in England by his deputy ornot, “whether Her Majesty or the Council do intend to send for me again or no.”They ask instructions from Gabriel about Kelley’s red powder, and how they shalluse it. Dee seeks for information about the Prince’s wife, whom they have not yetseen, but they doubt she is not their sound friend. He begs for medicine for his ague.And again, shall he take the pedestal, being made in Lask for the holy table, on toCracow when they go, “rather than make a new one there, both to save time and tohave our doings the more secret”? This pedestal was for the crystal to rest in uponthe table. Three iron hasps and padlocks were also made at Lask for the table. If anyanswer to these questions was vouchsafed by the spirits, it was in the usual enigmas.Part of Dee’s baggage, a chest left at Toon on their way out, not havingarrived, they did not immediately obey the injunction to move on to Cracow, butafter about five weeks in Lask, they again journeyed forward.CHAPTER XICRACOW“Sir, to a wise man all the world’s his soil:It is not Italy, nor France, nor EuropeThat must bound me if my fates call me forth.Yet, I protest it is no salt desireOf seeing countries, shifting a religion;Nor any disaffection to the StateWhere I was bred, and unto which I oweMy dearest plots, hath brought me out: much lessThat idle, antique, stale, grey-headed projectOf knowing men’s minds and manners.” — Jonson, Volpone, or The FoxAt the close of the sixteenth century, Cracow was at the height of its fame andprosperity. It was still the capital of POland, and the residence of her kings, as wellas the seat of the university founded two hundred years before by Casimir the Great.The Gothic cathedral erected under the same king, the burial place of Polishmonarchs, was already adorned with sculptures and bronzes, the work ofRenaissance artists from Florence and Siena. The visitor of today will find himselfsurrounded by churches and other buildings dating from the twelfth, fourteenth,and sixteenth centuries. Amid the ramparts of the Austrian fortress can still betraced here and there the older fortifications.The city lies in the centre of a vast plain, almost at the confluence of tworivers, the Vistula and Rudowa. Across this plain from the north-west thetravellers came, and reached Cracow in the afternoon of March 13, 1584.“We were lodged in the suburbs by the church, where we reamained a sevennight, and then we (I and my wife) removed to the house in St. Stephen Street,which I had hired for a year for 80 gylders of 30 groschen. And Master EdwardKelley came to us on Fryday in the Easter week by the new Gregorian Kalendar,"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"being the 27 day of March by the old Kalendar, but the sixth day of April by the newKalendar, Easter Day being the first day of April in Poland, by the new Gregorianinstitution.”From the time of arriving in Poland Dee is careful to enter the dates in bothold and new styles. The New Style was then extremely new, it having beenintroduced by Pope Gregory XIII. only a couple of years before, and universallyadopted by all Roman Catholic countries. England, in all the fervour of her recentlyestablished Protestantism, would have none of it, but still desired not to lag behindin needful reforms. Dee, as already stated, had been commissioned before he leftEngland to make calculations by which the calendar could be suitably adopted in thiscountry. The Roman Church had assumed the chronology adopted by the Councilof Nice to be strictly correct. But Dee desired to ascertain the actual position of theearth in relation to the sun at the birth of Christ, as a bsais on which to rectify thecalendar. The result of his calculations would have omitted eleven instead of tendays.Dee’s book (which was never printed, but remains in manuscript among theAshmolean MSS.) was entitled “A Playne discourse and humble advise for ourgratious Queene Elizabeth, her most Excellent Majestie, to peruse and consider asconcerning the needful Reformation of the Vulgar Kalendar for the civile yeres anddaies accompting or verifying, according to the tyme truely spent.” It was finishedand delivered to Burleigh on February 26, 1583. To him it was inscribed with theserather playful verses: —“and I shew the thing and reason why,At large, in briefe, in middle wiseI humbly give a playne advise;For want of tyme, the tyme untrewIf I have must, command anewYour honour may, so shall you seeThat love of truth doth govern me.”Burleigh proposed that skilful men in science, as Mr. Digges, be called fromthe universities to peruse the work and confer. But the Council of State consultedArchbishop Grindal and three of the bishops who recommended the rejection ofDee’s scheme, chiefly on the ground that it emanated from Rome, and so theiropposition delayed this desirable public reform in England for 170 years. Dee agreedto grant the ten days for the sake of conformity with the rest of the world, if hiscalculation that eleven were strictly accurate was publicly announced. It will beremembered that in 1742, when the change was made, eleven days were omittedfrom the calendar.The household at Cracow now consisted of Mrs. Dee, Arthur, Katherine,Rowland and his nurse, and the mand Mary, Mrs. Kelley and her husband, aservant named John Crocker and a boy. It was augmented before long.The actions with the spirits soon recommenced. Kelley began very unfairlyby trying sittings alone, for he was importunate to know how the Prince was going"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"to treat them as regards money. But he seems only to have drawn reproof andmuch excellent counsel on himself from Nalvage.The next few weeks were taken up with instructions from Gabriel andNalvage, consisting of letters, numbers and words ina strange Eastern or angeliclanguage, to which Dee probably had some key, though they appear unintelligible.The partners were bidden to keep the Sabbath, and Dee resolves to go always tochurch. Kelley seems to have turned restive once again. On April 17 he declared hewould sit no more to receive these A.B.C. messages unless they were betterexplained. “There is your boy, John,” he said; “he can well enough give you thesesimple signs. You need me no longer. I will be gone.” As Casaubon remarks, “hewas ever and anon upon projects to break with Dee.”Two days after, Dee heard him come upstairs to his own study, and calledhim in. Dee’s study was an inner room through one that opened on to the stairs, atthe foot of which was a door. He explained that he had now a distinct clue to themeaning of the tables of letters on which he had long been puzzling; dwelt on howessential it was to miss not a single letter, or else the words would err. He askedhim, in fact, to resume his skrying, and encouraged him by saying that he knew he“would come to like better this due and methodical manner of our friends’proceeding,” if only he would continue. Kelley scornfully replied that their teacherswere mere deluders, and no good or sufficient teachers. In two years they had notmade them able to understand, or do anything. “In two years,” he said boastingly, “Icould have learned all the seven liberal arts and sciences, if I had first learnedLogick.” He protested he would have no more to do with the spirits in any manneror way, wished himself in England, and vowed if the books were his he would burnthem all. “These spiritual creatures are not bound to me. Take John for yourskryer.”Dee pathetically recapitulated his long desire for wisdom, his faith that moreknowledge will be granted him. Kelley went out leaving Dee buried in prayer.In two days, Kelley was again submissive to the spirits, who bade him notmistrust. “Let him that is a servant and is commanded to go, go. And let not theearth rise up and strive against the plowman.” So they go on again with theircabalistic letters and signs. In the beginning of May, Dee notes: “E.K. is very wellpersuaded of these actions now, thanked be the Highest.”Later in the month he says: “There happened a great storm or temptation toE.K. of doubting and mistaking our instructors and their doings, and of contemningand condemning anything that I knew or could do. I bare all things patiently forGod his sake.” Kelley at the same time says: “I am contented to see and to maketrue report of what they will show, but my heart standeth against them.”That night after the sitting, he again swore he would not go on skrying. Themorning after, Dee knocked at his study door, and bade him come, for Nalvage hadleft off the previous day in the middle of an interesting geographical lesson aboutunknown parts of the earth, and had told them to be ready to continue it nextmorning. Kelley was obdurate, and Dee retired to prayer. In half an hour, the skryerburst in with a volume of Cornelius Agrippa’s in his hand, where he said all thecountries they were told about yesterday were described and written down. “What isthe use,” he said, “in going on with this farce, if they tell us nothing new?” Deereplied that he was glad to see Kelley had such a book of his own; that Nalvage ingiving those ninety-one new names of countries, all of seven letters, was answering"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"his particular request; that he had verified the lands in the charts of GerardusMercator and Pomponius Mela, which he had at hand and produced, “and now,” hesaid triumphantly, “we know exactly what angels govern which countries, in casewe are ever called to practise there.” Nalvage had described the natives of thecountries and the products, suggesting that in Greenland a vein of gold might befound. “Your wilful phantasie,” Dee ended to Kelley, “perverts your reason; andwhereas you find fault with our instructors, I, who much more narrowly perusetheir words, know that they give direct answers to my questions, except indeedwhen you misreport them, or I make a mistake in hearing or writing.” So threedays were lost, as Dee bemoans in the margin, and then Kelley was again induced toresume his skrying.On the 25th, Laski arrived and left again for Kesmark. He now intended toredeem his property there. But King Stephan and his Chancellor were both setagainst him, and he wished Dee to go with him to the Emperor of Austria, RudolphII.Instructions were now given that they must be ready to go with Laski to theEmperor, must make themselves apt and meet, for until no remembrance ofwickedness is left among them they cannot forward the Lord’s expeditions. Gabrieltells Kelley at some length of his many faults. Dee did not hear this, butconsiderately does not ask for a repetition of the catalogue. He only bids Kelleylisten well. Gabriel says if any will be God’s minister, he must sweep his houseclean, without spot. He must not let his life be a scandal to the will of the Lord.“God finds thee, as he passes by in his Angel, fit in matter, but, my brother,God knows, far unfit in life. O consider the Dignity of thy creation. See how Godbeareth with thy infirmity fromtime to time. Consider how thou art now at aTurning where there lieth two wayes. One shall be to thy comfort, the other toperpetual woe.”Gabriel’s dart, like a flame of fire, is upright in his hand. He pleads withKelley in such adorable gentleness and with such tender and ecstatic weeping, thatboth his hearers cannot withhold their tears. Gabriel’s words so moved Kelley thathe professed absolute repentance for all his dealings with wicked spirits, vowed hewould burn whatsoever he has of their trash and experiments, and write a booksetting forth their horrible untruth, and blasphemous doctrine against Christ andthe Holy Ghost. It is curious that among the other errors he renounced was theEastern doctrine that a fixed number of souls and bodies have always been in theworld, and that a man’s soul goes from one body to another, viz., into the new-bornchild. In the light of after-events, it is significant that another belief abjured is thatto the chosen there is no sin.Dee was overjoyed, and full of thanksgiving. He believed utterly in Kelley’sconversion, all the more because of his former lapses. If anything were wanting toprove it, it was to be found in the humble and patient spirit in which thisimpracticable, volcanic skryer of his now sat on patiently for two hours and a halfbefore the stone without either cloud, veil, or voice appearing. This to Kelley was“no light pang.” Nay, he argues that servants must wait as long as their Masterpleases, and the time is better spent thanin any human doings. He opens hiswayward heart to Dee, the man without guile, and avows that he had fully intendedat his last outburst, ten days before, to have gone away secretly with those withwhom he had so long dealt had they not threatened him with beggary — a thing,"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"adds Dee, that he most hated and feared. Therefore, till this timehe had been ahypocrite. Now, in his new-found elation, he cares not for poverty; life eternal ismore than riches and wealth. He that can be hired with money to forsake the devilis no Christian. He will doubt no more, but believe. Dee adds that he omits manyothers of his godly sayings, thinking these sufficient to write down. He had nosuspicion of any ill faith. His love for Kelley was truly unbounded in its long-suffering. He offered a fervent thanksgiving for the conversion, and for Satan’sdefeat, and prayed for them both for “continual zeal, love of truth, purity of life,charitable humility and constant patience tothe end.”The same atmosphere continued next day, June 11. Kelley protests he couldsit for seven years awaiting a vision. They do wait nearly four hours. EvidentlyKelley converted is not going to be so good a medium as Kelley unregenerate. Deeexplains the non-appearance as retribution for the three days wasted before. Butthey are all reather depressed, especially the Prince.Then a vision appears of the castle of Grono, in Littau, where the King ofPoland then was. Stephan’s arms are seen over the gate. A man like an Italian isbeheld, carrying an iron chest within which are an image in black wax, a dead hand,and so on. The promise is that Laski shall be King of Poland.Early next morning Kelley, lying awake in bed, had a vision which he or Deeafterwards embodied in the curious diagram facing [ ? ].It may be taken as a sample of the kind of intricate complications of theurgywhich often absorbed the pair for days together.The vision was expounded by Ave, something in the following manner: —A VISION.East and West, North and South, stand fouur sumptuous and belligerentCastles, out of which sound Trumpets thrice. From every Castle, a Cloth, the sign ofMajesty, is cast. In the East it is red, like new-smitten blood. In the South, lily-white. In the West, green, garlick-bladed like the skins of many dragons. In theNorth, hair-coloured, black like bilberry juice. Four trumpeters issue from theCastles, with trumpets pyramidal, of six cones, wreathed. Three Ensign bearers, withthe names of God on their banners, follow them. Seniors, Kings, Princes as trainbearers, Angels in four phalanxes like crosses, all in their order, march to the centralCourt, and range themselves about the ensigns.IT VANISHETH.The dazzling, shifting formation seems to proceed in a glorious pagenat ofcolour, and then to rest, frozen into a minutely exact phantasticon of harmony.Now for the meaning of the allegory. The Castles are Watch towers providedagainst the Devil, the Watchman in each is a mighty angel. The ensigns publish theredemption of mankind. The Angels of the Aires, which come out of the Crosses,are to subvert whole countries, without armies, in this war waged against thePowers of Darkness.Many weeks were taken up with tables of letters for thegames, angels, seniors, etc."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Kelley is again sometimes very much tempted to doubt the good faith of theangelic visitants, more especially as he sadly fears that good angels will not providethem with the needful money that the Prince requires for the success of his cause.One day, Dee wrote in his diary: “E.K. had the Megrom sore.” Kelley read this, and“A great temptation fell on E.K., upon E.K. taking these words to be a scoff, whichwere words of compassion and friendship.” After this Dee resorts more frequentlyto the use of his Greek characters.The Dees were still living near the church of St. Stephen, where Kelley was afrequent visitor. Laski lodged with the Franciscans in their convent. Therevelations were now of tables of letters again, intended, Dee things, that they maylearn the names of angels and distinguish the bad from the good. (The bad angels’names are said to be all of three letters.) He hopes Ave is about to reveal the healingmedicines; the property of fire; the knowledge, finding, and use of metals; thevirtues of stones, and the understanding of arts mechanical. But Ave says it is thewicked spirits who give money coined, although there are good angels who can findmetals, gather them and use them. Then Madimi appears, after a long absence, andaddressing Dee as “my gentle brother,” tells him that Ave is a good creature andthey might have made more of him. She wants to know why they have not gone tothe Emperor Rudolph. The old excuse of poverty is pleaded.That evening, June 26, at seven o’clock, Dee sat in his study considering theday’s action, when Kelley entered and asked if he understood it. He, it seems, hadburst out again, had raged and abused Michael and Gabriel, called Ave a devil, made“horrible speeches.” There had been a most terrible storm of thunder and rain, andKelley always appeared sensitive to these electric disturbances. Now he is penitentonce more, acknowledges his words were “not decent,” and begs forgiveness of Godand Dee. The talk lasted long, and several calls to supper were unheeded; then, justas they were leaving the room, Kelley felt something warm and heavy on hisshoulder, and behold! it was Ave come to acknowledge his repentance. Dee handshim his Psalter book, and with three prayers devoutly said, all is smooth again, andthey go down to supper.Dee’s patience and humility seemed unending. In conversing with the spiritshe is always, as it were, face to face with God. His replies are made direct to theMajesty of the Divine. When Kelley is blamed he assumes equal blame.Ave. — ”Which of you have sought the Lord for the Lord his sake?”D. — ”That God can judge. We vaunt nothing of our doings, nor challengeanything by the perfection of our doings. We challenge nothing, Lord, upon anymerits, but fly unto thy mercy, and that we crave and call for. Curiosity is far fromour intents.”CHAPTER XIIFROM CRACOW TO PRAGUE“Since all men from their birth employ sense prior to intellect, and arenecessarily first conversant with sensible things: some, proceeding no farther, passthrough life considering these as first and last; and apprehending what is painful tobe evil, what is pleasant good, they deem it sufficient to shun the one and pursue"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"the other. Some pretending to greater reason than the rest, esteem this wisdom; likeearth-bound birds, though they have wings they are unable to fly. The secret soulsof others would recall them from pleasure to worthier pursuits, but they cannotsoar: they choose the lower way, and strive in vain. Thirdly, there are those —divine men — whose eyes pierce through clouds and darkness to the supernalvision, where they abide as in their own lawful country.” — PlotinusAll this time, Dee is so absolutely absorbed with his spiritual visions that weknow very little about his outer existence. For three years after he left England, heneglected to enter anything in his ordinary diary, and the Liber Mysticus containsnothing of everyday affairs.In this July, 1584, however, at Cracow, he does enter an important piece ofinformation about his boy Rowland, the baby then about a year and a half old.“1584. Remember that on Saturday the fourteenth day of July by theGregorian Calendar, and the fourth day of July by the old Calendar, Rowlande mychilde (who was born Anno 1583, January 28 by the old calendar) was extreamelysick about noon or mid-day, and by one of the clock was ready to give up the ghost,or rather lay for dead, and his eyes set and sunck in his head.“I made a vow if the Lord did foresee him to be his true servant, and sowould grant him life, and confirm him his health at this danger, and from thisdanger, I would during my life on Saturdays eat but one meal.”Although we never find this vow referred to again, there is no doubt that Deedevoutly kept his bargain. Rowland did grow up and had other remarkableescapades.Still the journey to Prague to the Emperor Rudolph was postponed, and itwas not until the first day of August that the trio set off. Dee and Kelley were readyto go sooner, but Laski had not sufficiently recovered his finances. The party hadbeen augmented by the arrival of Kelley’s brother, Thomas, and Edmond Hilton,son of Dee’s old friend, Goodman Hilton, who had sometimes lent him money, andwho in 1579 had requested leave for his two sons to resort to Dee’s house. ThomasKelley accompanied the Prince and his pair of crystal gazers. The women were leftbehind under Edmond Hilton’s charge.Five or six days after arriving in Prague, on the day of the Assumption of theBlessed Virgin Mary, August 15, Dee was settled in the house of Dr. Hageck, byBethlem in Old Prague (Altstadt), kindly lent him for his use. The house was notfar from the old Rathhaus, the great clock tower of which, dated 1474, and theCouncil Chamber, still exist. It was also near the Carolinum or University, foundedby Charles IV. in 1383, in whose hall John Huss a hundred and fifty years before hadheld his disputations. When Dee and his party arrived in the city Tycho Brahe wasstill alive, though not yet a resident in Prague. Prague was the city of alchemists.The sombre, melancholy Emporer himself relieved his more seriuos studies byexperiments in alchemics and physics. A mania for collecting rare and valuableobjects provided him with a still lighter pastime. He painted, read much, andworked in iron, was a good linguist, and a regular dilettante. Unmarried, and with"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"all the weaknesses of the Habsburghs, for nearly thirty years our of his long life andfar too protracted reign he was quite mad. Not many years after his reception of Deehe ceased to make any pretence of public appearance.The excellent little study or “stove” (from “stube,” German for study) in Dr.Hageck’s house had been since 1518 the abode of some student of alchemy, skilful ofthe holy stone. The name of the alchemist, “Simon,” was written up in letters ofgold and silver in several places in the room. Dee’s eyes also fell daily on manycabalistic hieroglyphs, as well as on drawings or carvings of birds, fishes, flowers,fruits, leaves and six vessels, all the work, he presumed, of Simon baccalaureusPragensis. Over the door were the lines:“Immortale Decus par gloriaque illi debenturCujus ab ingenio est discolor hic paries,”and on the south wall of the study was a long quotations from some philosophicalwork ending with“Ars nostra est Ludus puero cum labor mulierum. Scitote omnes filii artishujus, quod nemo potest colligere fructus nostri Elixiris, nisi per introitum nostrilapidis Elementati, et si aliam viam quaerit, viam nunquam intrabit nec attinget.Rubigo est opus, quod sit ex solo auro, dum intraverit in suam humiditatem.”In these congenial surroundings skrying was at once resumed. Madimi (nowgrown into a woman) was the first visitor, and Dee hastened to inquire for his wifeand child at Cracow. He notes that his first letter from her arrived on the 21st. Shejoined him before long. He was told to write to the Emperor Rudolph. He did so onAugust 17, and he relates in the epistle the favourable attention he has receivedfrom Charles V. and his brother Ferdinand, Rudolph’s father, the EmperorMaximilian II., who accepted the dedication of his book Monas Hieroglyphica, andothers of the imperial house. He signs the letter, “Humillimus et fidelissimusclientulus Joannes Dee.”After waiting a week he sent the letter by Laski’s secretary to the Spanishambassador, Don Guglielmo de Sancto Clemente, who was to present it to Rudolph.With it he also sent a copy of his Monas. The same night he heard by EmerichSontag, the secretary, that the Emperor had graciously accepted the book, and withinthree or four days would appoint a time for giving him an audience.He received letters from England on August 27, which were dated April 15and 16. His brother-in-law, Nicholas Fromond, told him that Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Sled,and his bookseller had used him very ill. Doubtless he was expecting some moneyfrom the sale of his books. Mrs. Dee was much upset at her brother’s defections, andpoor Dee was worried all round, for, as he writes in the margin of his diary, “Satanis very busy with E.K. about this time.” Kelley seems to have been making friendswith young Simon Hageck, son of “our host,” as Dee calls him. To furnish his ownstudy he has bought a clock of Mrs. Hageck for five ducats, which was so good abargain that she requested “a quart of wine” (probably a quarter hogshead) thrownin. She herself does not seem to have benefited much by the largess, for Kelley andLaski’s man Alexander proceeded to get drunk on it, and fell to fighting andquarrelling. Dee, who had stayed writing in his study instead of going to supper,"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"was warned by the city watchman to keep better peace in his house. Looking fromhis window to account for the caution, he saw Laski’s man sitting on a great stone,and called him to come in. When he had heard the tale he went off to Hageck’s to“understand the very truth,” and there found Kelley lying in a drunken sleep on aform. This was a relief. He was better pleased to think that angry words had beenspoken “when wine, not wit, had rule,” and persuaded Laski’s man to stay in hislodgings that night instead of raging forth into the street. Already a scandal hadbeen made which he foresaw would do him much harm. Next morning Kelley hada madder fit than ever.“Much ado. Emerich and his brother (Thomas Kelley) and I had to stop orhold him from going on Alexander with his weapon. At length we let him go, inhis doublet and hose without a cap or haton his head, and into the street he hastedwith his brother’s rapier drawn, and challenged Alexander to fight. But Alexandersaid `Nolo, Domine Kelleie, Nolo.’ Hereupon E.K. took up a stone and threw afterhim as after a dog, and so came into the house again in a most furious rage for thathe might not fight with Alexander. The rage and fury was so great in words andgestures as might plainly prove that the wicked enemy sought either E.K. his owndestroying of himself, or of me, or of his brother. This may suffice to notifie themighty temptation and vehement workingo f the subtle spiritual enemy, Satan,wherewith God suffered E.K. to be tempted and almost overcome: to my great grief,discomfort, and most great discredit, if it should come to the Emperor’sunderstanding. I was in great doubt how God would take this offence, and devisedwith myself how I might with honesty be cleared from the shame and danger thatmight arise if these two should fight. At the least, it would cross all good hope herewith the Emperor for a time, till God redressed it.”By this time Dee had become skilled and tactful in dealing with his turbulentskryer, and he soon brought him to quietness by yielding to his humour and sayinglittle. At mid-day came Dee’s messenger from Cracow, bringing letters from andtidings by word of mouth of his dear wife Jane, “to my great comfort.” Much he wasin need of comfort, and when a letter from the Emperor arrived the same day,desiring to see him, Kelley’s enormities began to assume less desperate proportions.Dee started at once to the Castle, the Palace of Prague, and waited in the guard-chamber, sending Emericus to the Lord Chamberlain, Octavius Spinola, toannounce his coming.“Spinola came to me very courteously and led me by the skirt of the gown,through the dining chamber to the Privie chamber, where the Emperor sat at a table,with a great chest and standish of silver before him, and my Monad and Letters byhim.”Rudolph thanked Dee politely for the book (which was dedicated to hisfather), adding that it was “too hard for his capacity” to understand; but heencouraged the English philosopher to say on all that was in his mind. Deerecounted his life history at some length, and told how for forty years he had sought,without finding, true wisdom in books and men; how God had sent him His Light,Uriel, who for two years and a half, with other spirits, had taught him, had finished"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"his books for him, and had brought hima stone of more value than any earthlykingdom. This angelic friend had given him a message to deliver to Rudolph. Hewas to bid him forsake his sins and turn to the Lord. Dee was to show him the HolyVision.“This my commission is from God. I feign nothing, neither am I a hypocrite,an ambitious man, or doting or dreaming in this cause. If I speak otherwise than Ihave just cause, I forsake my salvation,” said he.Rudolph was probably very much bored by this mystical rhapsody. Heexcused himself from seeing the vision at this time, and said he would hear morelater. He promised friendship and patronage, and Dee, who says he had told himalmost more thanhe intended of his purposes, “to the intent they might get someroot or better stick in his minde,” was fain to take his leave. In a few days he wasinformed, through the Spanish ambassador, that one Doctor Curtius, of the PrivyCouncil, “a wise, learned, and faithful councillor,” was to be sent to listen to him onthe Emperor’s behalf. Uriel, whose head had been bound of late in a black silkmourning scarf because of Kelley’s misdoings, now reappeared in a wheel of fire,and announced favour to Rudolph.“If he live righteously and follow me truly, I will hold up his house withpillars of hiacinth, and his chambers shall be full of modesty and comfort. I willbring the East wind over him as a Lady of Comfort, and she shall sit upon his castleswith Triumph, and she shall sleep with joy.”To Dee, he says, has been given “the spirit of choice.” Dee petitions that hisunderstanding of that dark saying may be opened: “Dwell thou in me, O Lord, for Iam frail and without thee very blind.”The conference between Dee and Curtius on September 15 lasted for sixhours. It took place at the Austrian’s house, whither Dee was permitted, it seems, totake the magic stone and teh books of the dealings. Dee in all good faith promisedthat many excellent things should happen to Rudolph, if only he would listen to thevoice of Uriel. Dee’s sincerity, credulous though it appears, was as yet unshaken.He lived in a transcendental atmosphere, and trembled, as he believed, on the brinkof a great revelation. The very heavens seemed opening to him, and soon, hethought, he would probe knowledge to its heart.Kelley, on the other hand, was under no delusion. He had worked the spiritmystery for long enough without profit; already he was beginning to more thansuspect that the game was played out; that their dreams of Laski as King of Poland,dispensing wealth and favour to his two helpers, were never to be realised; that theEmperor’s favour would be equally chimerical and vain; and that some moreprofitable occupation had better be sought. At the back of his mind lay always thehope of the golden secret. Somehow and somewhere this last aspiration of thealchemist must be realised.At the very time when the two learned doctors were holding theirconfabulation, Kelley, says Dee, was visited at their lodgings with a wicked spiritwho told him that Dee’s companion would use him like a serpent, “compassing his"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"destruction with both head and tayle; and that our practices would never come toany fruitful end.”This was a true prophecy indeed, but many things were yet to come to pass.Uriel now instructs Dee to write to the Emperor and tell him that he canmake the philosopher’s stone: in other words, that he can transmute base metalinto gold. In the next breath Uriel foretells that Rudolph shall be succeeded by hisbrother Ernest, for when he sees and possesses gold (which is the thing he desireth,and those that cousel him do also most desire), he shall perish, and his end shall beterrible. Dee shall be brought safely home to England. Uriel used a curious simile,that Dee “shall ascend the hills as the spiders do.” Dee, with his knowledge of manysciences, has never shown himself a naturalist, but he here gives us an interestingscrap of natural history. He writes in the margin: “Perhaps spiders flying inthe aire,are carried by strings of their own spinning or making, or else I know not how.”Dee’s suit with the Emperor did not much progress. His ministers werenaturally envious of this foreigner, and many whispers, as well as louder allegationsagainst the two Englishment, were abroad, although, as San Clemente told him, theEmperor himself was favourable. The Spanish ambassodor was friendly enough,and Dee dined several times at his table. He professed to be descended fromRaymond Lully, and, of course, like every educated person of the fifteenth andsixteenth centuries, was a believer in the virtues of the philosopher’s stone. He badethem not regard the Dutchmen’s ill tongues, “who can hardly brook any stranger.”Dee wrote again to the Emperor a letter of elaborate compliment and praise ofvestroe sacrae Coesaraoe Majestatis, in which he offered to come and show him thephilosopher’s stone and the magic crystal.Still nothing came of it, and these needy adventurers in a foreign land beganto get into deadly straits. “Now were we all brought to great penury: not ablewithout the Lord Laski’s, or some heavenly help, to sustain our state any longer.”Dee returned from a dinner at the Spanish ambassador’s to find Kelley resolved tothrow up the whole business and start for England the next day, going first toCracow to pick up his wife. If she will not go he must set off without her, but go hewill. He will sell his clothes and go to Hamburg, and so to England. It is all verywell for the spirits to promise spiritual covenants and blessings; but as Kelley said toUriel, “When will you give us meat, drink and cloathing?”At this time the women and children did join the party from Cracow,although Dee does not record it in his diary. But on September 27 Dr. Curtius calledto see him at his lodging in Dr. Hageck’s house by Bethlem, and he says “saluted mywife and little Katherine, my daughter.” Dee laid before him some of the slandersthat he knew were going about. He had been called at Clemente’s table a bankruptalchemist, a conjuror and necromantist, who had sold his own goods and given theproceeds to Laski, whom he had beguiled, and now he was going to fawn upon theEmperor. Curtius was at last induced to spread before the Emperor his report of theconference he had held (by command) with Dee. “Rudolph,” said Curtius, “thinksthe things you have told him almost either incredible or impossible. He wants youto show him the books.” Then the talk became the learned gossip of a couple ofbookish and erudite scholars. Dee produced some rare editions which the othershad never seen. Curtius offered the loan of one of his own works, DeSuperficierum Divisionibus, printed at Pesaro. After this, with mutual courtesies"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"offered on both parts, “after the manner of the world,” Curtius took his horse, andreturned homeward.Jane Dee was ailing at this time, and Dee was much distressed. Gabriel, whenconsulted, told him that the true medicine is trust in the God of Hosts and in HisSon Christ. “The Lamb of Life is the true medecine of comfort and consolation.” Hedid, however, condescend to give a remarkable precription for her use, concocted ofa pint of wheat, a live pheasant cock, eleven ounces of white amber, and an ounce ofred wine, all distilled together. Dee, though no Christian Scientist, was willingenough to administer the strange decoction, but says he knows not where or how toget a cock pheasant. In the spring of the next year, Jane’s fourth child, Michael, wasborn. He was always rather sickly, and died when nine years old. Theodore, herfifth child, was only thirteen when he too died, but all the six other children grewup.Curtius and Dee became good friends. The Austrian showed his Englishacquaintance several of his inventions connected withthe quadrant and withastronomical tables, and Dee confided to him the secret of a battering glass he hadcontrived for taking observations on a dark night. The glass was left at Cracow withhis books and other goods, but he would gladly go and fetch it to show the Emperor.This led to Dee’s request for a passport to enable him to travel, with servants, wifeand children, where he would in the Emperor’s dominions at any time within ayear. He drew it up himself on October 8, 1584, and the Emperor granted it withoutdemur. Dee soon started for Cracow to bring the rest of his goods to Prague, but thediary for the month of November is missing, and the following book opens onDecember 10, when he had set out from Cracow to return to Prague. “MasterKelley” was with him, John Crocker, and Rowland and his nurse, who had been leftbehind when Mrs. Dee and the two elder children joined her husband in Prague. Asbefore, more than a week was occupied with the journey, which was made in acoach, with horses bought of “Master Frizer.” In Prague a new lodging was found ina house belonging to two sisters, of whom one was married to Mr. ChristopherChristian, the registrar of Old Prague. Dee hired the whole house from him at a rentof 70 “dollars” or thalers a year, to be paid quarterly.“On Saturday afternoon, January 12, 1585, I removed clean from DoctorHageck, his house by Bedlem, and came with all my household to the House whichI had hired of the two sisters (married) not far from the Market Place in old Prage.”He announced his return to the Spanish ambassador and to Dr. Curtius, andcontinued his interviews with “the schoolmaster” daily.Some of the sittings recorded at this time are really of the nature of schoollessons, which to a man of Dee’s acquirements must have seemed ratherelementary, yet he humbled himself as a child to learn. One day geographical andethnographical information is imparted about America, or, as Dee calls it,“Atlantis”; Cathay; the Bactrian desert; and Phalagon, a country of which Dee says henever heard. Another day, minerals and their properties form the subject of thelesson.Much was said about the doubting, incredulous spirit of Kelley, which Deealways feels is the hindrance to further knowledge. At length he is givenpermission to choose another skryer if he will: “Take whomsoever thou wilt in"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"whose face the Lord shall seem to dwell, and place him withthis Seer, and let himstand seven times by him. I will take the spirit from him and will give it unto thesame that standeth by, and he shall fulfill my word that I have begun.”But Dee was strangely reluctant to part with Kelley. He loved him like a son,he yearned over his soul, and he entertained more lively hopes than ever of his realconversion, for Kelley had at last consented to partake of the sacrament with hisolder friend. Dee uttered aloud a solemn prayer: —“O God, thouh has coupled us two together in they election, and what theLord hath joyned, no fleshly fancy of mine shall willingly separate. But if it be thywill, seeing he is so hard to give credit to thy holy messengers, without some proofin work first past, as for example this doctrine of the philosopher’s stone, that so hemay come to be allowed, though he imitate Thomas Didymus in his hard and slowbelief. And because he is to receive the pledge of thy mercies, and mystery of theheavenly food, we would gladly hear of that holy sacrament some discourse for ourbetter instruction, and his better encouragement to the mystery receiving.”Then was delivered a remarkable homily expounding Protestant Christianbelief upon several points: the Creation, the fall of Adam (because he wanted thebeauty and excellency of God’s spirit for which he was created); of the sacrament ofChrist’s body, “the holy sign of peace between God and man”; and the mystery andwonder of the rite as shown to the disciples, not, as the wicked do, “tying the powerand majesty of God and His omnipotence to the tail or end of reason, to be haled asshe will....It is a holy miracle, and thou must believe, as the Disciples did, that thoupartakest of the true Body of Christ sub forma panis. But receiving ceasing, theSacrament ceaseth also.” This in answer to Dee’s interposed question. The Hussitedoctrine of the permanence of the sacred element in the common food whenblessed was of course much in men’s minds in Prague. So with an injunction to“share this doctrine with your wives,” this exposition ends.CHAPTER XIIIA DREAM OF GOLD“Now, Epicure,Heighten thyself, talk to her all in gold,Rain her as many showers as Jove did dripsUnto his Danaid, shew the gold a miserCompared with Mammon. What! the stone will do’t.She shall feel gold, taste gold, hear gold, sleep gold.” — Jonson, The AlchemistOn February 27, 1585, Dee and Kelley, with Thomas Kelley, rode with greatsecrecy to Limburg, six miles from Prague, in obedience to Madimi, who howevertold them on arriving that Rudolph know of their departure. Dee suspected Laski’sman, Sontag, of treachery. Michael appeared to them there, and instructed Dee toname his new-born child Michael. The infant was baptised by the Court chaplain inPrague Cathedral (which is dedicated to the very unpopular Saint Vitus) on March"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"18, the Spanish ambassador being godfather and the Lady Dietrichstein, wife of theEmperor’s major-domo, godmother.Kelley was still murmuring under the mystical dealings of the angels. “Letthem give me somewhat profitable to my body, or some wisdom to my mind’sbehoof, and then I will believe in them,” he says. Then he protests he will confessall to the priest, and if the holy father does not allow their doings or counsel to begenuine, neither will he.The remarkable answer that Dee gives again shows us how in advance he wasof his times in matters spiritual as well as scientific. “The authority of good angelsor messengers from God is greater,” says he, “than the authority of the Pope, orpriests.”So the weeks went on. Kelley postponed the day of taking the sacrament. AtEaster will be a fit time. He will wait till then. He is tired of skrying: “I pray you todeal with another. Here is John, a boy in the house. You may use him.” Thus, forthe third time, a boy is suggested.It is a curious piece of psychology, or crystallomancy, that Kelley, whopossessed the mediumistic powers, was always so reluctant to use them, while Dee,who as Madimi told him, had clearer sight than his skryer, was entirely unable toopen up communication with the unseen.Money was scarcer than ever. “My wife being in great perplexity, requestedE.K. and me that the annexed petition might be propounded to God and his goodangels, to give answer or counsel in the cause.” Jane’s petition set out simply thatthey had no provision for meat and drink for their family, that it “would discreditthe actions wherewith they are vowed and linked unto the heavenly majesty” to laythe ornaments of their house or coverings of their bodies in pawn to the Jews, andthat the city was full of malicious slanders. Aid and direction are implored how orby whom they are to be aided and relieved. The spirits, while reminding hergrandiloquently that she is only a woman, full of infirmities, frail in soul, and notfit to enter the synagogue, yet favourably listen, and bid her be faithful and obedientas she is yoked, promising that she and her children shall be cared for. Meanwhileher husband is to gird himself together and hasten to see Laski and King Stephan.This injunction seems not to have been obeyed for some time, for Dee wasnow very busy inditing letters to Queen Elizabeth and to other of his friends inEngland. He was reminded of it later when something went wrong, and anothercrisis arrived with Kelley. On March 27, a Wednesday, Dee was busy in his study,when the skryer burst in, demanding unceremoniously a copy of a certain magiccircle of letters which he professed to have had revealed to him by spirits at Oxford.He wished to show it to a Jesuit priest with whom he had made friends. Heprotested he would quit the company of the spirits with whom they had recentlydealt and return to his former associates — the evil set. Dee said he had no leisureto look for the paper now, he was writing letters of importance, and in a week’s timeor when able, he would see it was found. This of course was irritating. Kelleystormed and raged, said the old man should not stir his foot from the room till ithad been produced, and was about to lock up the door when Dee caught him by theshoulders, “calling aloud to my folks. They came in all, and my wife, and soafterwards by degrees his fury assuaged, and my folks, my wife and his, went away,and after he had sitten two or three hours with me, he saw on my head, as I sat"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"writing, Michael stand with a sword, who willed him to speak, which he did forbearto do above a quarter of an hour.”Kelley, like a spoilt child, demanded of Michael if he should have his circle ofletters. The angel addressed him then in a passage of exceeding beauty, seeming toscorch and wither the promptings of the skryer’s evil nature, while wrestling at thesame time with all the powers of darkness for his soul: —“O Jehovah, whose look is more terrible to thy angels than all the fires thouhast created,...wilt thou suffer one man to be carried away, to the dishonouring andtreading under foot of thee and thy light, of thee and thy truth? Can one man bedearer unto thee thanthe whole world was? Shall the heavens be thrown headlongdown, and he go uncorrected?”He intimates to the partners that their work and calling is greater thanhonour, money, pride and jewels. As it is great, so must their temptation be great.“Therefore God has framed one of you as a stiffe-made Ashe, to bind up thecontinuance of his work, and to be free from yielding unto Satan.”As for the other, Michael promises Kelley that no evil spirit shall visiblyshow himself unto him any more as long as he is in the flesh.“Whosoever therefore appeareth hereafter is of good.”Thus begins to yawn before the pair the most dangerous pitfall of all. Prideand confidence in the perfect intuition of God’s will has led many a good and holyman astray. Soon even the stiff-made ash is to arrive at the pitch of believing thattheir teachers cannot err, and then comes a terrible downfall. Michael in anexquisite little parable bids them cleave fast together. And again it is clear why theelder man, the seeker after hidden knowledge, the pure-minded and gentle-heartedold mathematician and astrologer, though torn in pieces with his partner’s wildoutbursts, his notorious cupidity, impatience, and evil living, yearned over him andhis rebellious youth as a mother over her child. Like Michael, he seems involvedin a prolonged struggle for the rescue of his soul from the demons in whose powerhe devoutly believed.“PARABOLA DE NOBIS DUOBUS.“A wood grew up, and the trees were young, and lo! there arose a greatTempest from the North, and the Seas threw out the air that had subtilly stolenhimself into them. And the winds were great. And behold there was one Treewhich was older than the rest, and had grown longer than that which shot up byhim. This Tree could not be moved with the wind, but the Tree that was young wasmoved to and from with the wind, and strook himself oftentimes upon the stiff-settree. The Forrester came and beheld, and said within himself, `The force of thiswind is great. See this young Tree beateth himself in pieces against the greater. Iwill go home, and will bring my ground instruments, and will eradicate him, and Iwill place him farther off. Then if the winds come, he shall have room to move.’"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"But when he came home, the Lord of the Wood seeing him in a readiness with hisMattock and his spade, asked him of his goings, which told the thing in order untohis Master. But lo! his Master rebuked him, and he said thus: `When the winds arenot, they increase, they are not hurtful one to the other. Suffer them therefore.When the young Tree taketh roots, and shall look up unto some years, his rootsshall link themselves with and under the roots of the greater. Then, though thewinds come, they shall not be hurtful one to another, but shall stand so much themore fast, by how much the more they are wrapped together; yea, when the old treewithereth, he shall be a strength unto him, and shall add unto his age as much as hehath added unto his youth.’“And he ceased to dig.“Be not you therefore haled in sunder, neither be you offended one atanother. Peradventure Reason would set you aside. But God will not. Behold, ifyou break the yoke that you are in and runne astray, he that erreth shall perish,even so shall he that standeth also be desolate. Love therefore one another, andcomfort one another, for he that comforteth his brother comforteth himself....Letyouth yield to ripe years...You have vowed that oneof you do nothing without theother’s counsel, but you shall not be two counsellors. Let the Doer occupie thesuperiority. The Seer, let him see and look after the doings of that he seeth, for youare but one body in this work.”In April, Dee and Kelley returned to Cracow. As they were nearing the citythey saw a great whirlwind wreathing up the dust and shooting forward in asoutherly direction. They found their house let under them to a “forced-in tenant,”but as Dee had brought his keys, he effected an entrance, and secured at least abedstead. By the aid of his lawyer, Mr. Tebaldo, “an ancient practitioner in Polishcauses,” he obtained a decree against his landlord that without six months’ notice hecould not be ejected. They took up their abode in the College of Nyepolonize. Laskinow joined them in Cracow, and took Dee on May 23 to an audience of KingStephan. Stephan was seated by the south window of his principal audience andbanqueting chamber, looking out upon the beautiful new gardens that he was thenmaking. Polite speeches of greeting in Latin passed between the two, but there wasscant time for more before the Vice-Chancellor and Chief Secretary, with others,came in, bringing Bills for the King to read and sign. Stephan had small time tospare for visionary alchemists. His very glorious reign was crowded with greatachievements. Though a strong Catholic himself, he respected the liberties of hisProtestant subjects, won back the Russian provinces for Poland, reformed theuniversities and established the Jesuits in educational seminaries, and protected theJews. He died very suddenly about a year after Dee’s third interview with him. Deehas the following very valuable note of his death, entered in the diary a few weeksafter his arrival at Trebona Castle in 1586: “December 11, Stephan Poloniensis obiit:natus anno 1530, die 13 Januarii, hora quarta mane min 25, in Transylvania. Obiithora secunda post medium noctem, ut intellexi ex literis Dni Lasky, receptis die 29per Alexandrum.”Dee also visited Dr. Hannibal (Annibaldus), the famous divine, and discussedwith him his commentaries on Latin authors- -Hermes Trismegistus andMandellus. He partook of the Communion at the Bernardine convent where theDoctor was a professor. Three times within Easter week did he communicate, “that"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"in all manner of wayes I might have a clean and quiet conscience.” On “EasterMonday, very devoutly, in St. Stephan’s Church, E.K. received the Communion, tomy unspeakable gladness and content, being a thing so long and earnestly requiredand urged of him by our spiritual good friends.” As Dee wrote to Walsingham,“Saul had become a Paul.”It was a very short interlude. For Laski had not yet paid him the “money longsince due,” and Kelley once more vows he will leave, for the “actions areunsuccessful and are to be cut off.” Laski was again admitted to the sittings, andKing Stephan granted them another interview. Laski urged the King to take the twoalchemists into his service and give them “a yearly maintenance.” In obedience tohis instructors, Dee promises to make the philosopher’s stone, if the King will bearthe charge. He does not profess that he can, but he believes the angels will teachhim the secret. Stephan was not so sanguine. In the King’s private chamber, asitting was held, with the crystal set before him, but he remained unconvinced. Hegave no encouragement, and in August the pair, hopeless of patronage from Poland,returned to Prague, where Jane and Joan Kelley, the children and the servants, hadbeen left under Edmond Hilton’s care.An anglicised Italian pervert, Francisco Pucci, now appeared upon the scenesand was admitted to the sittings at the shew- stone. Pucci had been a Lyonsmerchant, but had “laid aside his trade to study sacred letters,” and become atheological disputant of the current type. Professing himself a Protestant, he came toOxford to study, graduated M.A. in 1574, and in London, Basle, Antwerp, and otherplaces, became an open and notorious writer and champion against the Churchwhich he had abjured. He had followed Socinus to Cracow, and had noisily opposedthe Jesuits there. Soon after he recanted, became a Romish priest and secretary to acardinal in Rome, where he died in 1606, and was buried in the Church of SanOnofrio on the Janiculum.On his information it appears that three copies of Dee’s manuscripts wereburned in Prague, April 10, 1586. These were the Book of Enoch, the Forty-eightKeys of the Angels (Claves Angelicae) and the Liber Scientioe Auxilii et VictoriaTerrestris, works which had been written down from the spirit revelations since thepartnership with Kelley had commenced. The books burned were not of course theoriginals, the two first of which still exist. Of the Book of Enoch there are threecopies, one made by Kelley, a remarkable tribute to the mechanical skill indraughtsmanship, the extraordinary application and ability, of this very versatilepersonage. It contains hundreds of diagrams of figures, round or rectangular inshape, composed of an infinite number of minute squares each containing a letter orfigure. These letters occur in every possible combination and order, some readingstraight across the page, others diagonally, and so on. Dee gives an extraordinarystory of the restoration on April 30 of the books said to have been burned, by a manlike a gardener, invisible to himself, to Joan Kelley, and to all in the garden at thetime, save Kelley. The gardener placed them under an almond tree in Carpio’svineyard, on a sloping bank between the banqueting house and the “cliff side.”Trickery of Kelley’s, no doubt.The feeling against these foreign adventurers grew strong in the city. SixtusV., who had succeeded as Pope, issued a Papal edict, dated May 29, 1586, banishingDee and Kelley from Prague within six days. It seemed to trouble them very little,for Dee was already away on a visit to a new patron, William Ursinus, Count"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Rosenberg, at his country seat on the Moldau. From thence he went to see someglass works at Volkanau, about twelve miles north of the city; then he proceeded toLeipsic in time for the fair on May 11. There he met Lawrence Overton, an Englishmerchant to whom Jane Dee had given kind attention and hospitality when he hadfallen ill in her house a year before. Overton had returned from England, where hehad seen Edmond Hilton, sent in November with letters to the Queen, Sir FrancisWalsingham, and others. Hilton was expected back shortly. Overton was on thepoint of returning to England, and by him another letter to the Secretary wasdespatched.Dee’s letters to Walsingham, with their veiled allusions to secret affairs, formone of the grounds upon which the supposition has been based that he wasemployed by the Queen’s minister as a secret spy and diplomatic agent abroad, andthat his cabalistic diagrams contained a cipher. An elaborate theory was constructedto support this contention.From this letter it is evident that Dee wishes his friends in England to believethat he and his partner have already found the hidden secret, but he wraps hiswords in due mystery, and it is impossible to say exactly when Kelley first professedto have made, and when he induced his partner to believe that he actually hadmade, the gold on which his heart was set. That Dee’s heart was equally fixed on thediscovery is indisputable, but from what a different cause!“To ye Rt. Honble. Sr. Fr. Walsingham Knt, her most excellent Maties.Principal Secretary my singular good Frd. and Patron with speed.“Right Honorable Sir,“Albeit I have almost in vain come a hundred miles (from Prague to thisLeipsic Mart) hoping either to meet my servant there with answer to my formerletters, sent in November last to her Majesty (when also I wrote unto your honourand others). And so with speed from this Leipsick to have sent again most speedily,as occasion should have served. and now I find neither servant neither letter fromhim, neither word of mouth, yet all this notwithstanding; and whatsoever thehindrance or delay hereof may be (whether the keeping back of my letters from herher Majesty, or the manifold and important most weighty affairs public hindring ordelaying her Majesty’s most gracious discreet and wise resolution herein.

And at length both the chief Romish power and Imperialdignity are brought to that point resolutely that partly they are sorry of their so latereclaiming their erroneous judgment against us and of us, and seek means to dealwith us so as we might favour both the one and the other; and partly to Rome issent, for as great authority and power as can be devised; and likewise here all othermeans and wayes contrived, how by force or for feare they may make us glad tofollow their humours. But all in vain, for force human we fear not, as plainly andoften I have to the Princes declared. And otherwise than in pure verity andgodlinesse we will not favour any (my words may seem very marvellous in yourHonours ears, but mark the end, we have had, and shall have, to deal with nobabes). I have full oft, and upon many of their requests and questions, referredmyself to her Majesties answer thus in vain expected. Nuncius ApostolicusGermanicus Malaspina, after his year’s suit to be acquainted with me, at length hadsuch his answer that he is gone to Rome with a flea in his eare, that disquieteth himand terrifieth the whole state Romish and Jesuitical. Secretly they threaten usviolent death, and openly they fawn upon us. We know the Sting of Envy and thefury of fear in tyrannical minds, what desperate attempts they have and do oftenundertake. But the God of Heaven and Earth is our Light, Leader and Defender. Tothe World’s end, his mercies upon us will breed his praises Honour and glory. Thusmuch, very rhapsodically yet faithfully, tanquam dictum sapienti, I thought good tocommit to the safe and speedy conveyance of a young merchant here calledLawrence Overton, which if it come to your Honours hand before my Servant haveleft his despatch, I may by your honor be advertised. Your Honour is sufficient fromher Majesty to deal and proceed with me, if it be thought food. But if you make aCouncil Table Case of it, Quot homines, tot sententioe. And my Commission fromabove is not so large: Qui potest capere, capiat.”The almost apostolical flavour which Dee permits himself to impart to someof this letter, owing to the greatness of his believed mission, shows to what a heightof “rhapsodical” fervours his spirit had now attained. It is still more emphasised inthe concluding passage, which begins, however, very practically, with an anxiousthought cast back to his English possessions. His desire that Thomas Digges, theeminent mathematician to whom his calculations for the reformed calendar hadbeen submitted, should be sent over to inspect their doings, was curious, but itshows that he, at any rate, wished to deal openly and conceal nothing. He ends thus:—“Sir, I trust I shall have Justice, for my house library, goods and Revenues, etc.Do not you disdain, neither fear to bear favour unto your poor innocent neighbour.If you send unto me Master Thomas Digges, in her Majestie’s behalf, his faithfulnessto her Majesty and my well liking of the man, shall bring forth some piece of goodservice. But her Majesty had been better to have spent or given away in alms, aMillion of gold, than to have lost some opportunities past. No human reason canlimit or determine God his marvellous means of proceeding with us. He hathmade of Saul (E.K.) a Paul, but yet now and then visited with a pang of humanfrailty. The Almighty bless her Majestie both in this World and eternally; andinspire your heart iwth some conceiving of his merciful purposes, yet not utterly cutoff from her Majesty to enjoy."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"From Leipsic this 14 of May, 1586,at Peter Hans Swarts house.Your Honours faithful welwisher to use and command for thehonour of God and her Majesties best service,“John Dee.”On being ejected from Prague, Dee removed his family and goods to Erfurt,but in spite of the influence of Dr. Curtius, and of a friend of Rosenberg, he was notallowed to hire a house there, for the Italian was before him. Pucci called on Deeafter supper, and held out hopes that he might obtain permission for their return toPrague, for the new Nuncio, the Bishop of Piacenza, was inclined to a morefavourable view than Malaspina. Pucci protested that they were only to beexamined and if found heretical to be sent to Rome. He brought an invitation fortheir return, if they would promise not to exercise magical arts. Dee, who wasstarting early next morning to look at a house at Saalfield, wherein to settle hisexiled family, bade Kelley copy it and rode off. On the ride he thought it over. Puccihe had never liked, neither had jane. “His household behaviour was not acceptableto our wives and family. He had blabbed our secrets without our leave. He wasunquiet in disputation.” Dee summed up the man as a spy, the letter as a bait, andset to work to devise a way of being rid of him “by quiet and honest meanes.” Hewas absent two or three days, but the Italian was still there when he returned, urgingthem to go to Rome. Dee rebuked him for curiosity and interference, and accusedhim of conspiring against them; he, a mere probationer and not yet owned of thespirits (who in fact had said he was “leprous” and should be “cut off”), to presumean equal authority with them in their revelations!Dee wrote a dignified letter to the Nuncio, and despatched it by the Italian,who was to receive from John Carpio, a wealthy neighbour and friend of theirs inPrague, a sum of fifty dollars for his expenses. The travellers went on to Cassel andto Gotha, but it was not long before a permanent asylum offered for the exiles. Theirnew patron, Count Rosenberg, was a friend worth having, for he was all-powerfulwith Rudolph; he was Viceroy of Bohemia and a Knight of the Golden Fleece. Hisinfluence and protection were now to be at the Englishmen’s disposal. On August 8,Rosenberg obtained from the Emperor a partial revocation of the decree againstthem, since they were permitted by it to reside freely in any of his lordship’s towns,cities or castles. They settled on September 14, 1586, at Tribau or Trebona, inSouthern Bohemia, and here for about two years their wanderings came to an end.Dee resumed the writing of his private diary, in which he had made no entryfor three years, the last event recorded there being the departure of the family fromMortlake just three years before, on September 21, 1583. He opened a new volume,an Ephemerides Coelestium, calculated for the years 1581-1620, by Joh. AntoniusMaginus, printed in Venice, 1582. The first entry made in it was Michael’s birth atPrague on February 12, 1586; the next was their arrival at Trebona (for it will be moreconvenient to follow Dee’s latinised version of the name).CHAPTER XIV"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE CASTLE OF TREBONA“Welcome the sour cup of prosperity!Affliction may one day smile again: and until then,Sit down, sorrow.” — Shakespeare, Love’s Labour LostTribau, or Wittingau, the Trebona or our story, is a small village lying in thebeautiful undulating scenery of the Ludnitz, a small tributary of the river Moldau.It is a few miles from Neuhaus and Weseli, not many from the town of Budweis, onthe Upper Moldau, in Southern Bohemia.In 1586 it consisted of little beside the castle, a Rathhaus, quarters for a smallgarrison, and a cluster of dwellings where Dee tells a fire broke out on Whit Sunday,1585, and destroyed several houses. The castle was oneof Rosenberg’s manyresidences in Bohemia, and apparently a favourite one. the Viceroy was now justover fifty (he was born on March 10, 1535); he married about this time, and his wifeconstantly accompanied him on his visits to Trebona. They had also another castleat Neuhaus, beside a residence with beautiful gardens bordering the Moldauopposite Prague. They were frequently on the wing, flitting from Krumau toVienna and from Vienna back to Prague. He welcomed the English travellershimself at Trebona, assigned them their rooms, and promised them all that heartcould desire.The actions, which had long been interrupted, were now resumed in “agoodly chapel next my chamber,” where all the “appurtenances” were set up, withthe “angelicall stone” in its frame of gold upon the table. Rosenberg had beenalready admitted to the sittings, in obedience to directions received on October 14.When the communications were made in English, Dee translated them into Latinfor his benefit. But experiments with Kelley’s powder were now all-engrossing, andeven the spirits pass for a time into the background. Kelley went off to Prague forthree weeks and was followed by Rosenberg. Dee remained with his wife andchildren; after their hardships, poverty, dangerous and wandering life, poor Janemust have been thankful for so luxurious a shelter. Visitors for Dee constantlyarrived. Among them was Dr. Victor Reinhold, the astronomer. Pucci also camefor a fortnight.In December Dee received a very flattering invitation from the Emperor ofRussia (Feodor Ivanowich) to go and take up his residence at Moscow in the Court.Dee’s fame as a learned astrologer and mathematician had spread to Russia; stillmore was his reputation as an alchemist bruited abroad: perhaps he was alreadycredited with having actually made gold by projection or transmutation.The first intimation of the Emperor’s wish was conveyed by ThomasSimkinson, an Englishman, of Hull, commissioned by Edward Garland to go toBrunswick or Cassel, or wherever Dee might be found, and beg him to remain thereuntil Garland could come from Russia. He might tell Dee that the Emperor, havingcertain knowledge of his learning and wisdom, is marvellous desirous for him tocome to his country, and had given Garland a sealed letter of invitation, promisinga sum of 2,000 pounds yearly and free diet from the royal kitchen if he will come.His charges of removing shall be paid, and he shall travel royally with 500 hourses"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"to convey him through the land. If he thinks the salary offered too little, Garland,when he arrives, will assure him that if he asks as much more, he shall have it.The “Lord Protector,” too, Prince Boris, took Garland in his arms on his departureand promised 1,000 roubles from his own purse beside the Emperor’s allowance.Simkinson reached Trebona on September 18, and at once declared hisflattering errand. “On December 8 at noon, Garland came to me from the Emperorof Moschovia, according to the articles before sent unto me by Thomas Simkinson.”On December 17, at Trebona, Edward Garland drew up a paper repeating all theformer promises in the Emperor’s name, and signed it, with Kelley, his brotherFrancis Garland, and others, as witnesses.There is no doubt that the Emperor thought he was inviting to his Court theman who could fill his coffers and bring glory and prestige to his name. Hakluythints at it when he says the offer was made partly for his counsel about discoveriesto the North-East, partly for some other weighty occasions. Dee was no self-seeker,or Court flatterer, although this was the fifth sovereign he says he might haveserved. The offer seems never to have tempted him from his loyalty to his ownQueen. He bade Garland at once dismiss six out of the eight Russian servants hehad brought to attend them on their journey, and turned to matters moreimportant.“On 19th December, to the great gratification of Master Edward Garland andFrancis, his brother, which Edward had been sent to me with a message from theEmperor of Muschovia, that I should come to him, E.K. made projection with hispowder in the proportion of one minim (upon an ounce and a quarter of mercury)and produced nearly an ounce of best gold; which gold we afterwards distributedfrom the crucible, and gave one to Edward.”It is quite significant that Kelley made the gold, Kelley showed it, and Dee iscontent to give him all the credit. The pangs and heartburnings and jealousies haveyet to come. Now he only felt that at last he was victorious in his long quest. Hewas on the crest of the wave. His hour had come.How the wonderful trick was done, Kelley could best describe.Kelley was now constantly riding to Prague, or making longer expeditions toPoland, for he still had hopes of getting more money from Laski. By March his hopeseems to have been realised, for Dee notes that Kelley paid him about 500 ducats intwo or more sums (about 233 pounds). This plenitude of money of courseencouraged the idea abroad that they were actually making it. When he returnedfrom Prague on January 18, Kelley brought a handsome present from Rosenberg toJane Dee, in the shape of a beautiful jewelled chain, the value of which was“esteemed at 300 duckettes,” says Dee, “200 the juell stones and 100 the gold.” Inthree days Kelley had posted off again to Prague, to join Rosenberg at his house inthe scity. This time he took with him his brother Thomas, Francis Garland, and aBohemian servant, Ferdinand Hernyck. No doubt he was pursuing his experimentsfor the “multiplying” of gold in the city, away from Dee.Kelley’s letter to Dee announcing this arrival of his in Prague is the onlycommunication between this strange pair of partners that seems to have survived.It shows that erratic and wayward creature in a gentle and even affectionate light,and although its pious protestations are obviously overdone, it pictures for us quite"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"vividly the relations between the two, and partly accounts for the strength of the tiethat bound Dee to his intractable pupil, soon to become his master. For whle Deelaboured laboriously and scientifically with his alchemical compounds, Kelley atone bound overleaped the chasm and by some process best known to himselfprofessed to have arrived at the goal.To Dee’s single-hearted nature such success was magnificent, wonderful. Hebegan forthwith to treat his quondam skryer with added respect; the expression“Dominus Kelley” creeps once into the diary; and Kelley grew arrogant andoverbearing. For the moment, however, he is all for friendship and respect.“Prage. 1587. 25 Januarii.” [This in Dee’s hand.] (addressed) “To the RightWorshipful and his assured friend Mr. John Dee Esquire, give these. MagnificoDomino, Domino Dee.“Sir. My hearty commendations unto you, desiring your health as my own;my Lord was exceeding glad of your Letters, and said, `Now I see he loveth me,’ andtruly as far as I perceive he loveth us heartily. This Sunday in the Name of theBlessed Trinity I begin my journey [to Poland], wherein I commend me unto yourprayers, desiring the Almighty to send his fortitude with me. I commend me untoMrs. Dee a thousand times, and unto your little babes: wishing myself ratheramongst you than elsewhere. I will by God’s grace about twenty days hence returnin the mean season all comfort and joy be amongst you.“Your assured and immoveable friend“E. KELLEY.”When this letter reached Trebona, Dee had gone riding with two horsemen ofthe city of Neuhaus, hoping to meet Rosenberg, who he thought would return thatway from Vienna to Prague. Mrs. Dee at once despatched the servant Ludovic tomeet his master. So Dee received Kelley’s affectionate letter “in the highway,without Platz,” a village about half-way to Neuhaus. Ludovic carried also a littlenote from Jane to her husband. It is the only letter of hers we have, but it confirmsall that we suspect. We know her to have been a well-educated, well-read woman;the writing is strong and clear; and did not Francis Pucci describe her as a learnedwoman, “lectissima femina”? She must also have been an extraordinarily capableone to have controlled and managed her large household of children, assistants,apprentices, servants and miscellaneous visitors, often in the absence of herhusband, and in a foreign land, constantly moving on from place to place in thisnomadic life they led. Dee has a charming name for her. Somewhere in a letter hespeaks of “my payneful Jane.” Full of pains she must indeed have been, the modelwife for an elderly, incomprehensible husband, using her intellectual powers toaccommodate her family, while the learned man purused his angelic visions andhis alchemical experiments unhampered. Above all things she must have been apeacemaker, hot and hasty although she sometimes was. Here is the letter to thehusband who had only left her that morning: —“Swethart. I commend me unto you, hoping in God that you ar in goodhealth as I, and my children, with all my household, am here, I prayse God for it. Ihave non other matter to write unto you at this time.”"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"There is a capable and managing sound about “my” children and “my”household, which leads one to wonder what this practical housewife thought of allthe angelic promises which were never kept or performed. At the outset of themysterious Kelley doings she was, we know, in her impetuous way, annoyed, angry,probably contemptuous, but by this time she perhaps had grown either to believe inthem or tolerantly to acquiesce. She was only thirty- two, yet she had lived throughmany strange experiences and was soon to be put to the strongest test possible to awoman.By April Kelley was once more settled as part of the household, and onthe 4ththe crystal gazing was resumed. He professed to hear instructions to Rosenberg,who was present, to build a commonwealth, render tribute to Rudolph, and he shallbe Duke of Brandenburg. To himself things are said he is not reluctant to hear. Wehave seen how almost immediately after his marriage he took a violent dislike tohis wife. In the four years, it seems, he had reproached her for giving him no child.To him generation was the root principle of alchemy, and the phase of it in whichhe centred his attention. It is always the marriage of the red man, copper, and thewhite woman, mercury, that is to tinge the whole world with gold. Now a voicetells him why he is barren. Not because of his reckless, disordered life, but becauseshe was of his own choosing — the wrong woman! Therefore he is to be seedlessand fruitless for ever. Had it not been for the Dees’ kindness to her, and especiallyJane’s, poor neglected Joan Kelley would have had but a sorry time. She was onlytwenty-four; lively and docile, she seemed to please everyone but her husband.Pucci, with perhaps a little flattery, calls her “rarum exemplum juvenilis sanctitatis,castitatis, atque omnium virtutem.” If she had not all the virtues, she at least hadseveral. Her brother, Edmund Cooper, and another friend so loved her that theycame over from England a year later on purpose to see if she and her husband couldnot be more reconciled.Kelley had been more unsettled than ever, discontented with his wife, withhis calling, its results, and above all with his position and his poverty. What was apittance of fity pounds a year to a man in constant intercourse with princes andnobles, with credulous fools possessed with dreams of gold? The same qualities thatattracted Dee were equally magnetic with others. Laski loved him; Edward Dyerdeserted his old friend Dee for this newcomer, a nobody. He had made himselfinvaluable to Rosenberg, who seems to have had implicit faith in his powers.Rosenberg induces the Emperor to employ him. Had he not already found thesecret of projection? Was he not the possessor of the magic powder which waitedonly for the opportunity to be transformed into countless heaps of ducats? Onlymoney was wanting, and that he could certainly get. But he must first be releasedfrom this galling position of medium. He told Dee that all through this Lent he hadprayed once a day at least that he might “no more have dealing to skry.” At Easter-time he did receive a promise to be set free from the crystal gazing, as he desired, buthis wish for freedom was not exactly approved by the angelic ministers.“Is it a burthen unto thee to be comforted from above? O foolish man! Byhow much the heavens excel the earth, by so much doth the gift that is given theeexcel all earthly treasure. Notwithstanding, thou shalt not at any time hereafter beconstrained to see the judgment of the Highest, or to hear the voices of heaven, forthou art a stumbling block to many....And the power which is given thee of seeing"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"shall be diminished in thee, and shall dwell upon the first begotten son of him thatsitteth by thee.”The selection of a child as Kelley’s successor seems not to have beenaltogether unexpected. It had been hinted in Prague a year before that a boy wouldserve for the office; but that the choice would fall upon Dee’s own son must havecome as a dreadful surprise, at any rate to his mother. No doubt the old manregarded it as a mark of special heavenly honour.It is more likely that Jane, with her practical mind, regarded the change ofmedium with anything but satisfaction. Arthur was now seven and three quartersof a year old, a clever child, already well grounded in Latin, but far too tender inyears and disposition to be made the subject of any psychological experiments.Fortunately for him, his skrying was a dismal failure, although it seems to havebent his childish mind towards the occultism he followed in after-life.Distinguished physician as he afterwards become, both at home and in the service ofthe Emperor of Russia, he was a true son of his father, and maintained to the end ofhis life a belief in alchemy and transmutation which nothing could shake.Kelley was desired to initiate the child.“I thereupon thinking that E.K. would, should or best could, instruct anddirect the childe in that exercise, did alwayes await that E.K. would of himself callthe boy to that exercise with him; and so much the rather because he said that hewas very glad now that he should have a Witness of the things shewed and declaredby spiritual creatures: And that he would be more willing to do what should be soenjoyned to him to do, than if only he himself did see. But when E.K. said to methat I should exercise the child and not he, and that he would not, I thereuponappointed with myself to bring the childe to the place, and to offer him, and presenthim to the service of Seeing and Skrying from God and by God’s assignment.”Then Dee drew up a petition to put in the child’s mouth that he might be “atrue and perfect seer, Hearer, Declarer and Witness of such things as might berevealed to him either immediately or mediately by the angels.” Three times a dayfor three days he was to offer this prayer thrice over, while seated at the stone. Thepoor child happily beheld in the magic crystal nothing more than dots and pricks,letters and lines, and “a young man in a white leathern doublet and a grey cloke,like hans of Gloats, his cloak,” of all which even his father could make little. On thefourth day came Kelley, to see how Arthur and his skrying progressed. But still thechild saw nothing. Then Kelley applied himself to skry as usual. Looking from thegallery window, he had already without any crystal seen Il and Madimi, also Uriel,who justifies their words. What they command he hesitates to say. Next day he isagain the percipient; the result is the same. At length, with feigned reluctance, hetells Dee of a vision of strange and subversive portent. It is so repugnant to himthat he can hardly impart it. Madimi, throwing aside all her garments, mysteriouslybids them participate in all things one with another. Kelley affects not tounderstand, but after more hesitation expounds to Dee that the sharing is to be ineverything, even of their wives. All things are to be in common between them.Dee, to whom Madimi is invisible, though he hears her voice, fiercelyrebukes her: “Such words are unmeet for any godly creature to use. Are the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"commandments of God to be broken?” This participation, he insists to Kelley, canbe meant only in a Christian and godly sense. Kelley construes the injunction verydifferently, but he affects a chaste horror and swears for the hundredth time that hewill deal no more with the spirits.Then Madimi, with scathing irony, addresses them both as “fools, and of littleunderstanding.” Not content to be hearers, would they be “Lords, Gods, judgers ofthe heavens”? She turns away. “Your own reason riseth up against my wisdom.Behold, you are free. Do that which most pleaseth you.”It is a comfort to learn that the child Arthur had all this time fallen down “ina swound.” He was indeed very ill for some time afterwards, and small wonder.Dee protested and argued with Kelley and with Madimi. He was consumedwith grief and amazement that good angels could propound “so hard and unpure adoctrine.” Had he not offered his very soul “as a pawn to discharge E.K. hiscrediting of them to the good and faithful ministers of Almighty God”? Was it nothis life’s work to withdraw Kelley from any kind of association with the bad spiritswho had frequented him before he came to Mortlake?Until two in the morning of this April 18, 1587, the pair sat up arguing,talking, praying. Kelley held forth about a little spirit, Ben, who had that dayappeared to him in his laboratory alone, and had shown him how to distil oil fromspirit of wine “over a retort in two silver dishes whelmed one upon another, with ahole through the middle and a sponge between them, in which the oil wouldremain.” Ben had foretold Elizabeth’s death in July (she lived for sixteen years), thedeath of the King of Spain and the Pope; in fact, a general moribundity ofsovereigns. Francis Garland was a spy sent by Burleigh to see what they were doing;Rosenberg would be shortly poisoned; famine and bloodshed would cover the land.Many other dire calamities would happen if they were not conformable to the voice;chief of all, the virtue should be taken from Kelley’s precious powder; it would berendered unprofitable, and he would become a beggar. It was Ben, he says, who hadbrought him his powder.Dee replied that he had found so much halting and untruth in Kelley’sreports of actions when he was not present, that he would believe nothing savewhat by better trial he found to be true. But at last his resistance seemed to beoverridden, and in the chill of the early morning he went to bed, heavy at heart inspite of his delusion. His poor wife was lying awake, wondering what turn their ill-starred fortunes were next to take.“`Jane,’ I said, `I can see that there is no other remedy, but as hath been said ofour cross-matching, so it must needs be done.’“Poor Mrs. Dee, shocked and horrified, fell a-weeping and trembling for a fullquarter of an hour, then burst into a fury of anger. At last she implored herhusband never to leave her. “I trust,” said she, “that though I give myselfe thus tobe used, that God will turn me into a stone before he would suffer me in myobedience to receive any shame or inconvenience.” She would eat neither fish norflesh, she vowed, until this action, so contrary to the wholesome law of God, and sodifferent from former actions, which had often comforted her; was confirmed. Boththe indignant women demanded a repetition of the action."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"In obedience to Raphael’s counsel, a solemn pact or covenant was humblydrawn up by Dee on the 21st, and signed by these four strange partners in delusion.It promised blind obedience, with secrecy upon pain of death to any of the four. Itdeprecated all intention of impurity and guilt. Its subscribers promise to captivateand tread under foot all human timorous doubting that the true original power andauthority of sins releasing or discharging is from the Creator. True Christian charityspiritual, perfect friendship and matrimonial liberty between the four is vowed, andthey beseech that this “last mystical admonishment” be not imputed to them forrashness, presumption, or wanton lust.Dee’s hand is unmistakable in the document. He regarded the newdevelopment apparently only as a symbol of further spiritual union, and a means ofobtaining a closer entrance into the secrets of all knowledge. It was no matter tohim, he says, if the women were imperfectly obedient. “If it offend not God, itoffended not mee, and I pray God it did not offend him.”Kelley drew up a paper the day after Dee’s, washing his hands of the wholematter, protesting that he did not believe so damnable a doctrine would becommanded, recounting his warnings to his worshipful Master Dee, and so on. OnMay 6 Dee spread his covenant, a document of the most truly devout character,before the holy south table in the chapel of the castle, with many prayers for divineguidance. The next day Kelley obtained the paper, cut it in pieces and destroyed it,made away with one of the crystals (which was found again under Mrs. Dee’spillow), and threatened to depart elsewhere with John Carpio. Coldness andjealousy fell between the pair.So ended the whole extraordinary episode of the Talbot- Kelley spiritualisticrevelations. Madimi appeared for the last time on May 23. Then the LiberMysteriorum is closed. For twenty years there are no more records of angels’ visits.And the few pages that remain are written in a halting hand in Dee’s stricken oldage, when he was seldom visited by his unseen friends, badly though he neededtheir comfort. No other medium like Kelley was ever found. One can only wonderwhether, after so rude an awakening, even Dee would have implicitly trustedanyone again. These five years with the skryer had filled him to the brim with aconsciousness of some power beyond his wit to control, a power amazing in itsingenuity to torture him. He had asked Madimi piteously if he should suffer anymore of these pangs. He knew now that he would. Yet, in spite of all, thesemarvellous doings had brought him hours of exquisite happiness, moments whenhe had seemed lost in the unity of the combined wisdom of the ages, which to himmeant — God.CHAPTER XVTHE END OF THE PARTNERSHIP“If all you boast of your great art be true,Sure willing poverty lives most in you.” — Ben Jonson, Epigram to Alchymists.Dee now resumed diligently his writing in the other diary, which becomes astrange medly of daily afairs small and great. He sent Francis Garland to England"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"with another letter to Walsingham, dated June 17, begging him to continue hisopinion of Dee’s fidelity towards Her Majesty and the realm. It would be useless asyet to render any account of commodity to them or their country reaped by thisperegrination, “but I trust more will be glad of our coming home than were sorry ofour going abroad.” He has not heard from Mr. Justice Young since Maytwelvemonth, but hopes his pitiful case of the books and other injuries enduredhave, by Walsingham’s favour, had some redress. There is no news of importancebut the Polish King’s election, “the mysteries whereof, by the time this bearerreaches England, will be known to you.” “Remember me to your good lady and toyour daughter Lady Sidney.” Money was now plentiful enough, and on September1 Dee covenanted with John Basset (who had arrived at Trebona on August 20) “toteach the children the Latin tong, and I do give him seven ducats by the quarter, andthe term to begyne this day; and so I gave him presently seven ducketts of Hungaryin gold, before my wife. God spede his work.” Arthur, who was just over eight, wasgettingon with his “grammar”; Katherine was six. Thus was another elementintroduced into the oddly assorted household, and on September 4 Dee writes:“Basset his hurly burly with T. Kelley.” Payments to Basset were entered regularlyeach quarter until August following, when the tutor, whose real name seems tohave been Edward Whitlock, went off to Budweis on pretence of buying “cullors” —perhaps for painting, and never returned.Various visitors came to Trebona, among them Pucci, bringing ChristianFrancke, the author of some books written against the Jesuits. Roseberg returned toTrebona, and finding a constraint existing n the relations of the household, sethimself to reconcile them. “July 19th. a certayn kind of recommendation betweenour wives. Next day som relenting of E.K., also by my Lord’s entrety.” Rosenbergcame and went frequently, so did his wife. Lord Biberstein, a friend of theirs, cameto make Dee’s acquaintance.Alchemical experiments were being prosecuted with vigour. It was Dee’sturn to make something prized, even if it were not gold. “Sept. 28th. I delivered toMr. Ed. Kelley (ernestly requiring it as his part) the half of all the animall which wasmade. It is to weigh 20 ounces; he wayed it himself in my chamber. He bought hisweights purposely for it. My Lord had spoken to me before for some, but Mr. Kelleyhad not spoken.” Secrecy being necessary, he is evidently using a word of hiddenmeaning.Kelley was constantly riding to Prague, and in October, while he was away,“John Carpio [who had joined them at Trebona] did begyn to make furnaces overthe gate. He used of my rownd bricks, and for the yern pot was contented now touse the lesser bricks, 60 to make a furnace.” Experiments on a large scale were aboutto be begun, and when Kelley returned a week later, terribilis expostulatio, etc., is theentry under his name. Edmond Hilton returned from England, and a month laterFrancis Garland, bringing letters from Edward Dyer. He brought also letters fromCourt advising their return home. People in the neighbourhood were beginning totalk about the strange doings of the foreigners in the Castle, and the Captain Critzinof the Guard disdained to come to a wedding supper inthe Rathhaus because Deeand Kelley were to be present. The household grew larger and larger. ThomasKelley was married in June. In December, “Mr. John Carpio went towards Prague tomarry the maiden he had trubbled; for the Emperor’s Majestie, by my LordRosenberg’s means, had so ordered the matter.” He was absent till February 16, and"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"in April brought his wife. Dee turned back to his books of tables, figures andsymbols. “The 30 and 31 day I began to frame myself toward the practice of theHeptagonos of my 4th boke. God prosper my purpose.” Kelley, on the other hand,was absorbed in alchemical studies. Perhaps the secret he had once professed tohave captured had again eluded him.“Dec. 12 afternone somewhat. Mr. Ed. Keley his lamp overthrow, the spirit ofwyne being spent to[o] nere, and the glas being not stayed with buks abowt it, as itwas wont to be; and the same glas so flitting on one side, the spirit ws spilled out,and burnt all that was on the table where it stood, lynnen and written books — asthe bok of Zacharius withthe Alkanor that I translated out of French for some byspirituall could not [?]; Rowlaschy his third boke of waters philosophicall; the bokecalled Angelicum opus, all in pictures of the work from the beginning to the end;the copy of the man of Budwise Conclusions for the Transmutation of metalls, and40 leaves in 40, intitled, Extractiones Dunstani, which he himself extracted andnoted out of Dunstan his boke, and the very bok of Dunstan was but cast on the bedhard by from the table.”The “very bok of Dunstan” was no doubt a copy of the manuscriptTractatus...de lapide philosophorum, which was formerly ascribed to the Saint ofGlastonbury. It was the constant companion of these two alchemists, held in aweand great esteem, as we see by Dee’s words above.In his new liberation from crystal gazing, Kelley became a changed andhaughty being. He was established in his own apartments, and when he felt wearyhis former master was now summoned imperiously to come and amuse him! Hesends the old man a message by his brother Tomas, saying, “You study too much, itis too late in the day to go to Cromlaw, as you intended, he wishes you to come topass the tyme with him at play.” Dee mildly consents: “I went after dynner andpayd, he and I against Mr. F. Garland and Mr. Rob., tyll supper tyme in his dyningrome, and after supper he came and the others, and we played there two or threehoures and frendely departed. This was then after the great and wonderfulunkindness used toward me in taking my man.” A week or two later Kelley sent forDee late in the evening to come to his laboratory over the gate, to see how hedistilled sericon, “according as in time past and of late he heard of me out of Riplay.God lend his heart to all charity and vertue.”It is evident that Kelley was jealously and secretly working at his experimentsapart from Dee. He had learned much alchemy from his master and his master’swonderful library inthe four years, but there was still knowledge stored in chambersof Dee’s brain of which he could not pick the lock. To enter those inner recesses hadbeen doubtless Kelley’s aim when he represented the spirits as bidding them shareeverything with each other. But he, on his part, had no intention of sharinganything that he discovered.The year 1588 began badly, for the child Michael, on New Year’s Day,“going childyshly with a sharp stick of eight inches long and a little wax cadell lighton the top of it [evidently the child was keeping Christmastide in good old Germanfashion], did fall uppon the playn bords in Marie’s chamber, and the sharp point ofthe stik entred through the lid of his left ey toward the corner next the nose, and so"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"persed through, insomuch that great abundance of blud came out under the lid, inthe very corner of the sayd ey. The hole on the outside is not bygger than a pin’shed; it was anoynted with St. John’s oyle. The boy slept well. God spede the rest ofthe cure. The next day after, it apperid that the first towch of the stikes point was atthe very myddle of the apple of the ey, and so (by God’s mercy and favor) glancedtothe place where it entred; with the strength of his hed and the fire of his fulness. Imay make some shew of it to the prayse of God for his mercies and protection.”Dee of course was as skilled in medicine as any doctor of the time. Herendered medical assistance when Thomas Kelley’s wife, Lydia, miscarried withtwin boys. He notes his own symptoms carefully: “June 19, I had a grudging of theague. June 22, I did evidently receive the ague and layd down. Jan. 17. Thehumming in my ears began.” Another time “I was very sik uppon two or three sageleaves eten in the morning; better suddenly at night. When I cast them up, I waswell.”The coldness between the two became unbearable to Dee, the peacemaker, ofwhom Aubrey relates that if ever any of his neighbours fell out, “he would not letthem alone until he had made them friends.” In April, he wrote to Kelley and hiswife “2 charitable letters, requiring at theyre hands mutual charity.” The same dayhe made friends with Captain Critzin, and on Sunday, when Jane ws churched afterTheodore’s birth, received the Communion with her. He hears of some freshtreachery of Pucci, and of Rosenberg’s displeasure, but all is forgotten on May 10,when Kelley “did open the great secret to me, God be thanked!” A few days after,“Mistris Kelley received the sacrament, and to me and my wife gave her hand incharity, and we rushed not fromher.” The reconciliation does not seem to havebeen altogether comlete. Every visitor throughout that summer, Edmund Cooper,Joan Kelley’s brother; Mr. Thomas Southwell, his friend; Edward Dyer, FrancisGarland, and Count Rosenberg, all seem to have tried to patch up the quarrel, butthings only grew worse.The “great secret” opened by Kelley was no doubt the professed secret of thegold. Dee must very soon have found out the true value of this “secret,” butapparently he continued to believe that Kelley had honestly transmuted base metal,and was keeping the method to himself. Nothing was less likely than that he wouldshare his knowledge, even with the master who had taught him all he knew. Thefirst essential in alchemy was secrecy. It is characteristic of Dee that he seems tohave been more pained at Kelley’s want of confidence in him, than chagrined at notknowing the secret. Of jealousy that Kelley was, or seemed to be, the successfulalchemist, there is no trace. But Kelley was gradually undermining all Dee’sinfluence and friendship with Rosenberg, who was their one powerful friend. TheViceroy of Bohemia had much influence with the Emperor. He was costantly at theCastle or with Kelley in Prague. Kelley had stolen the old man’s best workman, andwas now turning all his friends against him. Rosenberg and Kelley were alwaysworking in secret, while he was left outside in the cold. “September 15th, the LordChancellor cam to Trebona and went away on the 17th. The rancor anddissiumlation now evident to me, God deliver me! I was not sent for.” The pathosof the situation is irresistible. The man of a Continental reputation, whom fiveemperors had honoured, must stand aside and see his upstart pupil made much ofand set onthe high-road to fortune. But Fate was more just than she seemed, and"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Dee, who clung to the honest and true way, had in the end the better lot. Not inease or success, truly; but who would not rather leave behind him the reputation ofa sincere man deluded than that of a deceiver, even though not unmasked? Tillthen Dee says he had been “chief governor of our philosophical proceedings, butlittle by little I became hindered and crossed by fine and subtle devices, laid first bythe Bohemians, somewhat by Italians, and lastly by my own countrymen.”The strange partnership had now run its tempestuous course to the end, andthe heterogeneous colony of English men and women at Trebona was about to breakup, never all to meet again. The first to depart was Mistress Kelley, thankful, nodoubt, to disentangle herself from the web of pretences, deception and bickerings.On October 17, “Mistress Kelley and the rest rode towards Punchartz in themorning.” She was on her way to England, and only once thereafter does thisyoung woman’s name enter into our story.[On November 23, Francis Garland andMr. Dyer’s servant,Edward Rowley, who had come back a week or two earlier, left for England. Deesent by tham a most important letter to the Queen, also letters to Dyer, Mr. Young,and to Edmond Hilton. News from England travelled slowly, and Dee had not longsince heard of the glorious defeat of the Spanish Armada of the previous May. Thevictorious captains, Frobisher, Drake, Hawkins, were all well known to him, andwith the Admiral in chief command, Lord Howard of Effingham, he was veryfamiliar at Court, for his wife had been Jane’s early patron and friend. Patriot thatDee was, yearning to get back to England, he now wrote to the Queen a letter ofcongratulation (dated November 1-, 1588) upon the splendid victory of her navy. Itwas couched in the graceful and fantastic terms of homage of the day, and is aliterary production well befitting a man of his reputation. The letter is reproducedfrom the original. It is printed by Ellis in Letters of Eminent Men.[REPRODUCTION OF LETTER GOES HERE]He speaks in it of his proposed return, and begs for a safe conduct through allthe domains of princes and potentates which lay between him and home. “Happyare they that can perceive and so obey the pleasant call of the mightie LadyOpportunitie.” The answer, of course, took long to come, but he began to make hispreparations slowly. He gave to Kelley the wonderful convex glass which theQueen had so often admired. A fortnight after, Kelley gave it to Rosenberg, and theCount presented it to the Emperor. Dee says the Emperor had long esteemed it, buthe has not toldus when he showed it to Rudolph. He had described the mirror inhis Preface to Billingsley’s Euclid (see ante, p. 25).On February 4 he also made over to Kelley “the powder, the books, the glass,and the bone, for Rosenberg, and he tereuppon gave me discharge in writing of hisown hand subscribed and sealed.” Rosenberg was away, and did not trouble toreturn to bid him good-bye. Instead he wrote to Kelley to take his leave of Dee forhim, and said that he would send instructions to his man Menschik to “dispatchhim,” perhaps with some settlement of a financial character.On the afternoon of February 16, 1588, Kelley rode away to Prague, takingmost of the assistants with him: John Carpio, F. Garland, Simkinson. Dee neversaw him again."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Three new coaches had been ordered in Budweis, and when they were ready,Dee dispatched Edmond Hilton (who had returned from England in December) toPrague to buy a dozen coach and saddle horses. Money was plentiful at this time,the practice of economy was impossible to Dee, so he set off to travel homewards instate, as became a man to whom an emperor had offered a princely salary. It wasvery unnecessary, even absurd, but it was characteristic of Dee and his exalted ideas,not so much of himself, as of his peculiar mission. The journey cost, as he reckonedup afterwards, more than 600 pounds. The horses — twelve young Hungariancoach horses and three Wallachees for the saddle- -cost 120 pounds, and cheap theywere at that. The three new coaches, with harness, saddles and bridles, cost 60pounds; and the hiring of two or three waggons for his goods, books, furniture,vessels, etc., ran into 110 pounds. Then he had an escort of twenty-four soldiersfrom Diepholt to Oldenburg, as permitted by the Emperor’s passport; and fromOldenburg to Bremen, the Duke of that province sent six musqueteers to protecthim. It was a dangerous time to ride abroad, as he says, not long before the outbreakof the Thirty Years’ War. A party of eighteen horsemen had lain in wait for hiscaravan for five days, but a warning came through a Scot in the garrison ofOldenburg, and Robert, the Landgrave of Hesse, extended his powerful protection.The train of coaches and waggons, with the travellers and their baggage, leftTrebona on March 11. The Castle had been their home for a year and a half, and wecan fancy Jane, at any rate, dreading to take up once more the old wandering life.For it was to be a year and three-quarters more before they set foot in England. Onthe 18th they were in Nuremburg, where they stayed two nights; on March 26 theyreached Frankfurt-am-Main, and on April 19, five weeks after leaving Trebona, theywere in Bremen, their present destination.CHAPTER XVITHE END OF KELLEY“All you that faine philosophers would be,And day and night in Geber’s kitchen broyle,Wasting the chips of ancient Hermes’ tree,Weening to turn them to a precious oyle,The more you worke the more you loose and spoile.To you, I say, how learned soe’er you be,Go burn your Bookes and come and learne of me.” — Sir Edward Kelley, Metrical Treatise on Alchemy.Before continuing the story of Dee’s life in Bremen and his return to England,the end of Kelley’s extraordinary meteoric career, which six more yearsextinguished, must be briefly traced.Dee expected Kelley to join him at Stade. He confidently thought they wouldreturn to England together, obedient to the Queen’s summons. But Kelley was nowa great man with Rudolph, who had given him an estate and a title, and establishedhim at his Court in Prague as a citizen and councillor of state. Apparently hesucceeded in keeping up the deception of making gold. The news of his promotionwas conveyed by Dee to Walsingham, at Barn Elms, in a letter dated August 22, 1589,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"to which we shall again return. He speaks of Kelley as “my great friend, yet inBoemia,” and surmises that Walsingham may have heard direct from him, who is“now in most favourable manner created a Baron of the Kingdom of Boemia.”The actual title conferred was eques auratus, a synonym for “miles” whichtook its origin in the fact that a knight’s armour was gilded. In English it was ofcourse “Sir.” The title must have been conferred on Kelley very soon after Dee leftTrebona in March; for by the end of June he is called Sir Edward by a couple ofEnglishmen, Robert Tatton and George Leycester, who with Edmond Hilton were atTrebona then, and came on to Dee at Bremen. Kelley commissioned them to takedown particulars of the treachery of one Parkins, a Jesuit in Prague, who wasplotting with the King of Spain and the Pope against England. He wished of courseto score “his faithful discoverie of this treason.” He also desired Burleigh and othersin England to know what great honour had been done him, and he obtained inFebruary, 1590, a confirmation of the grant of his title to send him over, lest thereshould be any doubt in English minds. The document, curiously enough, iscountersigned by Dr. Jacob Curtius, the acquaintance of three years before.Constant letters passed between the two former fellow- workers through theyear 1590, the messenger being either Thomas Kelley or Francis Garland. Allmanner of wild stories were current in England, and have been gathered up andrepeated by every writer upon Dee and Kelley. The sober Anthony Wood relatesthat gold was so plentiful in Trebona before Dee left that the young Arthur playedwith gold quoits made by projection, while a youthful Count Rosenberg (he seems aquite fictitious person) was throwing about silver playthings procured by the likemeans. Burleigh had written for a specimen of their wonderful art, and it said thatthe Queen was actually the recipient of a warming- pan, from the copper or brass lidof which a piece had been cut, transmuted into gold, and replaced. Elias Ashmolegoes further in the story to say that “without Sir Edward’s touching or handling it,or melting the metal, onely warming it in the Fire, the Elixir being put thereon, itwas transmuted into pure gold.” He adds that he has heard froma credible person(who has seen them) that Kelley made rings of gold wire twisted twice round thefinger, which he gave away, to the value of 4,000 pounds: at the marrigae ofRosenberg’s servant before alluded to. Ashmole adds: “This was highly generous,but to say the truth, openly Profuse beyond the modest limits of a soberphilosopher.” Sir Thomas Browne says he heard from Arthur Dee, his friend,conclusive evidence of the manufacture of gold. The reader may smile at these fairytales, but what is to be said of a staid and sober minister like Burleigh being ready tocredit the truth of Kelley’s exploits, whether convinced by the warming- pan, or byother means? In a long letter to Edward Dyer, in 1591, who was then acting as theQueen’s agent in Germany, he urges him to use every means in his power to induce“Sir Edward Kelley to come over to his native country and honour her Majesty withthe fruits of such knowledge as God has given him.” Dyer had been Dee’s friend fora great many years, as we know, and was Arthur’s godfather, but he transferred allhis attentions to Kelley as soon as that clever trickster began making gold. Dee onlysays he “did injure me unkindlie.” Kelley and Dyer became inseparable, and Dyerwrote home to Burleigh wonderful reports of Kelley’s miracles. Ignoring all thathad passed, Burleigh is ready to welcome the quondam coiner, forger, or what not,with open arms back to the service of his Queen. “If his knowledge is as certain asyou make it, what would you have me think could stay him from flying to the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"service of his own sovereign?” If he is afraid of old reports, actions, disgrace, beingbrought up against him (and we know Kelley’s record was none of the cleanest), lethim be assured that he shall have his Queen’s protection “against all impedimentsthat shall arise.” Burleigh becomes almost poetical as he speaks of the patronage of“such a Princess, who never yet was stained with any breach of Promise to them thatdeserved her favour. If I did not know to whom I write, who has had longexperience of her rare vertues,...I could use many arguments to move any mannever to mistrust her.” He implores Dyer to induce Kelley to come. If he does notcome, it can only be because by cunning or legerdemain he has deceived them andcannot do what he promises, or else he is an unnatural disloyal man and subject. Incase Kelley will not come, he asks if Dyer cannot send a very small portion of hispowder to make a demonstration to the Queen’s own sight. What the Treasurerwould like most of all is that Kelley should “send her Majesty as a token a goodround sum of money, say enough to defray the charges of the navy for thissummer,” for the ships of Spain were gathering courage after their defeat. “Butwishers and woulders were never good householders,” he ends. The Queen is at hishouse at Theobalds, and will be some time longer. He would not be content thetime were tripled, so he “had but one corn of Sir Edward Kelley’s powder.” Burleighand Kelley were also in direct correspondence. Beside urging his return, the LordTreasurer, who seemed to consider Kelley as the storehouse of the elixir of life aswell as of the philosopher’s stone, begs for a prescription with the proof ofmanufactured gold. In a brief note of February 18, 1591, Kelley says he will shortlysend the good thing desired for your health.” He has received the salutations sentthrough Mr. Dyer, and “at his return you shall know how I thank you.” This, theonly original letter of Kelley’s to be traced, characteristically promises what he nevermeant to do. Burleigh replied in May, again begging him to send “somethingofyour operation to strengthen me afore next winter against my old enemy the gout.”He once more strongly urges Kelley’s return. How can he hesitate to bestow the giftsthat God has given him rather upon his own Prince and Countrie than uponstrangers?Kelley of course did not return, but apparently wrote again, urging powerfulreasons of excuse. Burleigh’s faith in him began to shake. He sent a last imperativerecall, someof which may be quoted from the rough draft written in his own hand.It shows once more what sort of men the great Queen had to serve her, and what aQueen she was to serve.Beginning “Good Sir Edward Kelley,” Burleigh acknowledges Kelley’s lettersby Dyer. “Without particular knowledge of your impediments, I may not give anysuch censures as others soe unconsiderately, yea uncharitably, may doe. You confessa desire to return to your native countrie; your minde draws to your sovereign.This is commendable, yet many say if you come not, it is because you cannotperform what has been reported of you. Malicious persons say you are an imposter,like some in other countries have been proved. You fear severe punishment. Now,good knight, though I write thus plainly to you, yet such is my credit in Mr. Dyer,such my allowance of your loyal profession, such opinion do I firmly conceave ofyour wisdom and love expressed in your letters, such my perswaysion of yourhabillitie to performe what Mr. Dyer has reported (by reason of the estimation,honor and credit I see that you have gotton by yr behaviour), that I rest only"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"unsatisfied in your delaye of coming; and I am expressly commanded by HerMajestie to require you to have regard to her honour, and according to the tenor ofher former letters, to assure yrself singularly favoured in respect of the benefit youmay bring to Her Majestie....“Be assured of worldly reward. You can make yr Queen so happie for her,surely as no subject she hath can do the like. Good Knight, let me end my letterconjuring you, in God’s holy name not to keep God’s gift from yr natural countrie,but rather help make Her Majestie a glorious and victorious power against themallyce of hers and God’s enemies. Let honor and glory move yr naturall hart tobecome honorable in yr own countrie rather than in a strange one, and leave amonument of yr name with posterity. Let no other country bereave us of thisfelicitie: that only, yea only by you, I say, is to be expected. Let no time be lost; we areall mortall: you that should be author, this noble Queen yt should be receiverthereof.”Then he politely acknowledges some gift Kelley has sent. Instead of an ingotof gold, it seems more like a geological specimen for a museum, and certainly doesnot excite the Lord Treasurer’s immense gratitude.“All this in answer to your by Dyer. I thank you for the montayn or rock sentsafely from Staden. I will place it in my house, where I bestow other things ofworkmanship, and it shall be memoryall of yr kindness, wishing I might receivesome small receipt from you yt might comfor my spyritts in myn age, rather thanmy coffers with any welth, for I esteeme helth above welth.”But Kelley knew better than to face the astute Englishmen at home. In Praguehe felt secure, and all too bitterly he learned his mistake. A couple of independentletters from two English merchants to Burleigh and to Edward Wootton give theexciting story of his fall from favour.He had been established in a house of his own close to the Palace; his wife andbrother had rejoined him; Edward Dyer made it his headquarters. One day, the lastof April, perhaps even before Burleigh’s letter was dispatched, he was suddenlyarrested by the fitful Rudolph’s command, and thrown into prison. A large force ofthe imperial guard, accompanied by the City Provost and one of the Secretaries ofState, burst uninvited into his house to take him whilst at dinner. But a friend atCourt had whispered a word, and the evening before he had ridden off with oneattendant towards Rosenberg. The intruders had to be content with haling offbrother Thomas to prison, “pinacled like a thief.” They searched the housethoroughly, broke open doors, and thrust their halberds into the beds or any placewhere “Sir Edward” might possibly lie hid. Satisfied he was not there, they sealedup certain of the rooms, laid some of the servants in chains — one was afterwards“racked” — and departed, leaving a guard over “Lady Kelley” and Mr. Dyer,forbidding them to stir from the house. Returning with their news to the Emperor,Rudolph “cursed in the Dutch manner,” and gave orders to search the town and thehighways.Kelley had ridden off many miles towards his patron, the all-powerfulRosenberg, but being weary and fasting, halted at the inn at Sobislaus, fed, and threwhimself on a couch to sleep. By three days after, May 2, the soldiers had tracked him"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"down; and roughly seizing him, they cut open his doublet with a knife to search forconcealed valuables or papers, vowing they cared not whether they took him deador alive to the Emperor. Kelley appealed to his all-powerful friend, Rosenberg. “InBohemia,” says the merchant in his letter, “it is a rule that his Majesty dares donothing without the Earl’s consent, he being Burgrave of Prague, the immediateperson and officer under the Crown.” Rudolph was already sinking into themelancholy and madness in which he ended his days. However, Rosenberg’sprotection did not avail. Kelley was taken to the Castle of Purglitz, three miles fromPrague, and there he was closely confined for more than two years.And now for the cause of Rudolph’s displeasure, and the reason of the arrest.First, it is surmised to be debt, but the merchant adds that although Kelley isknown to owe a large sum to two Cologne merchants who trade in jewels, he owesnothing to the Emperor, nor ever had put him to any charge, save for coals andhouse room.Next it is thought he was in league with a professed gold- maker from Venice,executed by the Duke of Bavaria at Munich, on April 25. (Of him, too, Burleigh haswritten in his letter to Dyer.) Thirdly, the Emperor’s fear that Kelley would departfor England is adduced. Dyer had brought autograph letters from the Queenrecalling him. A doctor’s son in the town, who had served Sir Philip Sidney inEngland, and knew her hand, had reported this. It was of course an invention; andthe merchant opines Dyer is of too rare a discretion to permit secret letters to be seenor even heard of; it is more likely that Kelley has some time or other vaunted attable that the Queen had sent for him. “He is a man who taketh, as I hear, apleasure that Princes desire him.” Fourthly, it is the doing of the powerful family ofthe Poppels, second family in the kingdom, and great enemies of the Rosenbergs,who have been “the setters up and principal maintainers of Sir Edward Kelleyhitherto.” The fifth report is that Kelley had distilled an oil or medicine for theEmperor’s heart disease, which was poison. Lastly, the writer comes to what hetakes for the true reason of Rudolph’s anger.An Italian, named Scoto, having cast imputations on Kelley’s powers ofprojection, the Emperor sent for him to come and make proof of his art at Court.Kelley of course excused himself, saying he was sick. Three times he wassummoned, and then the guard was despatched to bring him. The accusation wasLaesus Mejestatis, and the city wonders what will be the end. The Emperor dare notopenly execute him, for fear of Rosenberg and the strong feeling in the State for achange of ruler. Yet he may easily be put to death secretly in that castle where he isconfined, “and Rosenberg not know otherwise than that he liveth, or is dead bydisease. Almost grown now to be a common Practice in the Empire, and in thePalatine especially, noted that way.”This dark hint is almost a prophecy of Kelley’s fate; but the doom was not yetquite prepared. On December 5, 1593, Dee received news of his having been set atliberty on the previus October 4, just two and a half years after his arrest. Not a wordof him in Dee’s diary in the meantime, until March 12 of that year, when the oldman records that he dreamt much of Kelley two nights running, “as if he wer in myhouse, familiar, with his wife and brother.”Kelley characteristically says he was “utterly incapable of remaining idle evenin prison, and employed his time in writing alchemical treatises,” from which itseems he was allowed books and papers, for his writings are mere compilations"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"from ancient chief masters of the art. In The Stone of the Philosophers, dedicated toRudolph, he speaks of two imprisonments, tells him grandiloquently that he has fortwo or three years (1588-91) used great labour and expense to discover for him thatwhich might afford profit and pleasure; and adds, with great bombast, “If myteaching displeases you, you are still wandering astray from the true scope and aimof this matter, utterly wasting your money, time, labour and hope.” Truth is moredesirable than anything else, and posterity will discover that he is to be countedamong those who have suffered for it. Kelley as a sufferer for truth is highlyentertaining, but he goes on to make a still more distasteful allusion. “It alwaysway, and always will be, the way of mankind to release Barabbas and crucify Christ.”Beside this treatise Kelley certainly produced an earlier writing of some sorton the subject, which Dee discussed with the Archbishop of Canterbury on July 13,1590. It had apparently incurred his displeasure. Mr. Waite attributes two othershort papers to Kelley, The Humid Path and The Theatre of Terrestrial Astronomy.A couple of rather quaint alchemical poems — one of thirty-nine stanzas, fromwhich the heading of this chapter is taken — are doubtless by him, perhaps writtenalso in captivity.During the next year letters were two or three times exchanged betweenKelley and Dee, and in March, 1595, Francis Garland, who had then not longreturned from Prague, “came to visit me and had much talk with me of E.K.”Kelley was apparently then restored to the Emperor’s favour, for on August 12, Deesays he “receyved Sir Edward Kelley’s letters of the Emperor, inviting me to hisservyce again.” Did Kelley think there might be further hints to be got from his oldalchemical master? Then under date of November 25, 1595, Dee enters this curtnote: “the news that Sir Edward Kelley was slayne.” Never thereafter does hemention this adventurer’s name.The prevalent story is that Kelley was again imprisoned in one of Rudolph’scastles, and that, attempting to escape by a turret window, he fell from a great heightand broke both legs, receiving other injuries, from which he shortly died. It is evensaid with some amount of credibility, that the Queen wrote imperatively to Dyer tosecure his release, and that everything was prepared in readiness to convey himsecretly to England, and that he was escaping for that purpose when the accidenthappened. This story has hardly been tracked home to its source. It may be true. Onthe other hand, the end may have come in the more swift and secret mannersuggested by the English merchant. In either case, the spirit warning of eleven yearsbefore, that he should die a violent death, was fulfilled. Into his forty years as muchadventure, folly, trickery and deceit, fortune, fame, favour, riches and poverty, hadbeen crowded as could supply material for many a volume of romance.Some of the incidents were indeed used a few years after his death by morethan one dramatist. Dee had only quitted the world about a year and a half whenKelley’s pretensions, Dee’s learning, and the whole paraphernalia of alchemy, wereseverely satirised by Ben Jonson in The Alchemist (1610), a play which reflects allthe crudest superstitions of the time. The credulous knight, Sir Epicure Mammon,describes Subtle, the alchemist, as“A divine instructor can extractThe soul of all things by his art; call allThe virtues and the miracles of the sun"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Into a temperate furnce; teach dull natureWhat her own forces are.A man the EmperorHas courted above Kelley; sent his medalsAnd chains to invite him.”In Butler’s Hudibras, first published in 1663, but written ten or fifteen yearsearlier, Dee and Kelley are again cited, though the satire is chiefly directed againstSidrophel, i.e., William Lilly. The devil is said to have appeared “in divers shapesto Kelley;” and in the description of Sidrophel, these lines occur:“He had been long toward mathematics,Optics, philosophy and statics,Magic, horoscopy, astrology,and was old dog at physiology;...He had read Dee’s Prefaces beforeThe Devil and Euclid, o’er and o’er;And all the intrigues ‘twixt him and Kelley,Lescus, and the Emperor, would tell ye.”One may wonder how much these scurrilous references had to do with fixingDee’s reputation in the eyes of his immediate posterity.CHAPTER XVIIRETURN TO ENGLAND“If I have done my dutiful service any way to her Majesties well liking andgracious accepting, I am greatly bound to thank Allmighty God, and during my lifeto frame the best of my little skill to do my bounden duty to her most excellentMajestie.” — Dee, Compendius RehearsallUpon Dee’s arrival in Bremen on April 19, 1598, a house was at once hired,and the family moved in on May 13. He put out his three saddle horses to grass inthe town meadow till Michaelmas, for nine ducats, and presented the twelveHungarian coach horses to the Landgrave of Hesse, to whose kindness he had beenindebted for protection as he passed through his territories. In June, Thomas Kelley,his wife Lydia; Francis Garland, and Dyer’s man, Edward Rowley, left for England.At the same time Edmond Hilton returned to Prague. An agreement or bond hadbeen entered into between the late partners that the proceeds of the wonderfuldiscovery should be shared. Hilton was back on July 30, with news of Kelley:perhaps not good news, for three nights after, towards daybreak, Dee’s sleep wasdisturbed by a “terrible” dream, which visited him not for the first time, that “Mr.Kelley would by force bereave me of my books.” Hilton left almost immediately forEngland with a letter from Dee to Walsingham to disclose the treason of the Jesuit,Parkins. This letter has been already referred to [p. 201 in original], but it containsother interesting matter, all conveyed in Dee’s beautiful neat hand. He has already"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"written to acknowledge the Queen’s gracious letter of safe conduct, received fromWalsingham, but Hilton and the two English gentlemen, Tatton and Leycester, arestill detained at Stade, waiting for a wind. After speaking of the designs of the Jesuit,he goes on to give the Secretary an important summary of the state of affairs in theLow Countries, where the struggle for independence was well advanced. “TheProvinces all incline to a desire to endure one fortune and become one wholeunited. They acknowledge Her Majestie’s Wars to be just but uncompassable. Theirminds are getting alienated from us, only fayr means and great wisdom will winthem over.” He has taken counsel of “the one of all the inhabitants the most sharp-witted, the greatest understander of all occurrences generall of secret purposes; thebest languaged one (as knowing Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French, Italian, Dutch, etc.);and one employed in the councils; one who was courageous in the first bickeringswith Spaniards at Antwerp; who has observed all the beginnings and proceedings oferrors, political and military, committed on all hands. Now and then he visitethme, and I have asked him to pen his opinion on what can be done to recover andreform the States, but as yet he has not found leisure.” Then he begs the Secretary’sleniency if he has offended in writing of matters not pertaining to him, “and ofwhich no doubt your honour has already had all necessary advertisement fromproperly authorised persons.” He will write no more of public affairs, his comingthither was no public but his private cause, the beginning of his “nere return-making into my most derely beloved Native Country.”At the same time (August 20), Dee wrote to his friend, Mr. Justice Young, thatthe messengers had been delayed twenty-five days waiting for a wind; that he fearedthe Low Countries were bent on shaking off the Queen’s authority if they could; andthat he feared he sould have “to endure this Breamish habitation this winter, as I donot hear a word of the approach of Sir Ed. Kelley, or of Mr. Dyer’s return.”In Bremen, Dee mingled with all the learned and distinguished men of thetime. A memento of this period is to be found in an album, the ThesaurusAmicorum, of Timon Coccious (or Koch), a young Bremen student who died whileat Leyden University three or four years after. The album of white vellum, fadedand yellowed with age, with its edges still shining with the mellow lustre of oldgold, was the receptacle of autographs, wise and pithy sayings, original or quoted, allinscribed after the beginning of July, 1589. Sayings from Plautus and Seneca,Juvenal, Pythagoras and Homer, follow and press close upon the wisdom ofBoethius, from De Consolatione, and the divine poetry of Dante. The first to writein the book was Bruno, Count Mansfeldt, Helmstad, July 1. He is followed by Dr.Cristoph Pezel, then Professor of Divinity and superintendent of the churches atBremen, and on the seventh page is Dee’s beautiful signature and his motto — inthe light of posterity’s unchallenged view of him, full of irony — ”Nothing useful ifnot honest.”Mr. Hart, minister of the English colony at Stade, who had escaped from theSpanish service in Flanders with Sir William Stanley, and the Deputy Governor ofStade, both came from the port town near by to see Dee. Dr. Heinrich Khunrath wasthe chief writer of the advanced school of alchemists who passed from the pursuit ofmaterial gold to the discovery of incorruptible spiritual treasures hidden in thepalaces of truth to which they provided a spiritual key; and it is a pregnant fact thatall of his books were published after this conference with Dee. Daniel VanderMuelen was another visitor, and from Mr. Southwell Dee had news that Edward"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Dyer was sent on a mission to Denmark. Two or three weeks later, he met Dyerunexpectedly in the town. News came of Rosenberg, and several of Dee’s men lefthim to return to Kelley. He was warned to leave his house in Bremen.By November, Dee resolved to wait no longer for Kelley, but to start forEngland. He still hoped, however, to meet that individual ere he embarked. OnNovember 19, his whole party took ship by the Vineyard. A crowd of townspeopleand students collected to bid him good speed, and to see the homeward boundtravellers off; qute a little scene took place, which must have pleased and flatteredDee immensely, for there was no lack of a man’s full share of vanity in him. Pezelhad composed some verses on his departure, had got them printed the night before,and as the party were leaving Bremen for the seaport, a few miles away, theProfessor distributed copies as a parting surprise. The travellers arrived in theThames at Gravesend on December 2, and on landing the next day went straight tothe house of Mr. Justice Thomas Young, at Stratford. We may imagine Jane’s reliefat getting her children safely back to England, with the addition of Michael, born atPrague, nearly four years, and little Theodore, born at Trebona, nearly two yearsbefore.Since Dee’s departure from England six years ago, great events had happened.The “invincible” Armada of Philip had been beaten in a six days’ running fight upthe Channel. The Queen’s hated rival, Mary Queen of Scotland, had been put todeath; Leicester’s short dictatorship of the Netherlands had begun and come to anend. Leicester had been dead about a year. New favourites had arisen in theQueen’s favour. But even more significant than these public affairs had been theupward movement in literature, the birth of dramatic art, a passionate outburst ofpoetic fervour, the frowth of a taste for well- disciplined prose. Many splendid fruitsof this movement had net yet seen the light, Sidney’s Arcadia and the first part ofSpenser’s Faerie Queen were to be issued within a few months; the first play ofShakespeare was publicly performed within little more than a year of Dee’s return.But Lyly and Marlowe had already, during his absence, given Campaspe,Tamburlaine and Doctor Faustus, to be performed by actors in the first stationaryhome of the earlier nomadic players, the theatres of Shoreditch, immediately to befollowed by those of Bankside. Bacon was perhaps even then meditating his Essays,published some half a dozen years later; Hooker issued the first books of hismonumental Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity within four years; and nash, Peele, Green,and a horde of ther writers, were contributing to establish the English literaryrenaissance. One can scarcely help wondering how much the fabulous stories of Deeand Kelley, which must have reached Marlowe’s ears, contributed to his splendiddramatisation of the Faust legend (first printed in Frankfort in 1587). But after all,even the story of Dee’s angels and Kelley’s gold, pales before the lurid glow of thestories of the earlier alchemists, Agrippa and Paracelsus.Dee landed in England a disappointed and a partly disillusioned man,clinging to a belief which was yet useless, unprofitable to him. He could provenothing of Kelley’s exploits. But he lost no time in repairing to Court, and onDecember 19 he was graciously received by the Queen at Richmond.On Christmas Day he first slept in his own house at Mortlake, and beheld forhimself his ruined and rifled library, with its precious books and instrumentsmissing. He himself was in dire straits. He had little left him save his wife andchildren, and some still faithful friends. He took the house over as a tenant from"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"his brother-in-law, Fromond, and settled down in the old quarters. Adrian Gilbertwas the first visitor, generously offering “as much as I could require at his hands,both for my goods carried away, and for the mynes.” Very soon Thomas Kelleyarrived and followed suit by offering the loan of ten pounds in gold; he afterwards“sent it me in Hungary new duckettes, by John Croker the same evening. He putme in good hope of Sir Edward Kelley his returning.”A second daughter was born, and christened at Mortlake, on March 5. Thename given her was Madinia, suggested by the busy little spirit who had been sohelpful at her first coming. The child was christened at Mortlake on the 5th, SirGeorge Carew as godfather, Lady Cobham and Lady Walsingham, godmothers.Letters came from Kelley by Garland in March, and replies were despatched byThomas Kelley in April. Dee is careful to give his former skryer his full title: — ”SirEdward Kelley, Knight, at the Emperor’s Court at Prague.” “Francis Garland was by,and Mr. Thomas Kelley, his wife. God send them well thither and hither again.”On Lady Day, the children begin to go to school with Mr. Lee at Mortlake. “Igave him his house rent and forty shillings yerely for my three sons and mydaughter. The house rent was allmost 4s. yerely, of Mr. Fisher his new house.”Arthur was now ten, Katherine nine, Rowland seven and Michael five. Theyoungest boy, Theodore, born at Trebona February 28, 1588, was rather more thantwo. Dee notes that he was “wened” on August 14, 1589. Katherine was not longunder the Mortlake schoolmaster, for on May 21 “my dowghter was put to MistressBrayce at Braynford [Brentford], hir mother and Arthur went with her after dynner.”On April 15, he writes of his neighbour and friend, the Vice-Chancellor: “Good SirFrancis Walsingham died at night hora undecima.” Burleigh was the only one ofthe old friends left. He records an interesting visit from “the two gentlemen, theunckle, Mr. Richard Candish, and his nephew, the most famous Mr. ThomasCandish, who had sayled round abowt the world.” Cavendish was a Suffolk man.His wonderful voyage occupied two years and nearly two months. He died at seawithin a couple of years from Dee’s note. The uncle Cavendish interested himselfwith the Queen and the Archbishop to obtain for Dee the Provostship of Eton. This,too, fell to the ground, and Cavendish considerately sent him a hogshead of claret.He also lent or gave money to Dee and his wife, in all 302 pounds: in “ryalls andangels.” Dee gave him in return one of his most valued treasures — an alchemicalwork: —“A copy of my Paracelsus, twelve lettres, written in French with my ownhand, and he promised me before my wife never to disclose to any that he hath it;and that if he dye before me he will restore it agayne to me; but if I dy befor him thathe shall deliver it to one of my sonnes, most fit among them to have it. Theoddorhad a sore fall on his mowth at mid-day.”Dee’s income was now almost a negligible quantity. The parsonages had paidhim no rent since he left England. He went two or three times to Lambeth, andtalked boldly to Archbishop Whitgift of his right to them.He began to interst himself in his immediate neighbourhood with the idea ofstopping the “Bacchus Feast,” at Brentford, a rowdy celebration which had excitedhis indignation and of which he gave the Bishop of London a warning."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"In August a domestic tragedy occurred: one of the women servants becamemelancholy and went out of her mind. Lunacy being a disease beyond even Dee’smedical knowledge, and for 300 years after, being treated more or less as demoniacalpossession, it is no wonder that the remedies he tried were ineffectual. It seemsanother instance of the false views of Dee’s character that have been repeated overand over again, that the editor of his Manchester diary urges as proof of Dee’s magicand evil experiments that “some of the inmates of his house became suicides whenin his service.”“Aug. 2. Nurs her great affliction of mynde. Aug. 22. Ann my nurse hadlong byn tempted by a wycked spirit, but this day it was evident how she waspossessed of him. God is, and hath byn, and shall be her protector and deliverer.Amen.“25th. Ann Frank was sorrowful, well comforted, and stayed in Gods mercyesacknowledging.“26th. At night I anoynted (in the name of Jesus) Ann Frank, her brest, withthe holy oyle.“30th.

Nurse Ann Frank wold have drowned hirself in my well, but bydivine Providence I cam to take her up befor she was overcome of the water.”After this Dee had the woman carefully watched.“Sept. 29. Nurse Ann Frank most miserably did cut her own throte,afternone abowt four of the clok, pretending to be in prayer before her keeper, andsuddenly and very quickly rising from prayer, and going toward her chamber as themayden her keper thoght, but indede straight way down the stayrs into the hall ofthe other howse behind the doore did that horrible act. And the mayden whowayted on her at the stayr fote followed her and missed to fynde her in three or fowrplaces, tyll at length she hard her ratle in her owne blud.”In november the Queen came to Richmond and sent for Dee. She offeredgaily to send him something to “kepe Christmas with.” This promise was repeatedto his friend, Richard Cavendish, a week or so later: “she told him she wold sendme an hundred angells to kepe my Christmas withall. Next day, December 4, theQueen’s Majestie called for me at my dore, circa 3 1/2 a meridie, as she passed by,and I met her at the East Shene Gate, where she graciously putting down her maskdid say with mery chere, ‘I thank thee, Dee. There was never promise made but itwas broken or kept.’“The thanks were obviously ironical for the reminder of the promise; the restof the speech was rather cruelly jocose, for, as Dee adds, she had promised to sendthe money that day. However, on the 6th, an earnest of the gift arrived, in the shapeof 50 pounds. On the 14th, she again called for Dee as she rode by his door, “to takeayre,” and he met her at the park gate as before. He does not indicate the subject ofthe conversation, but it was probably a request on his part for some kind of royal"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"permission to continue his experiments in alchemy or transmutation, for on the16th he tells of a visit from Richard Cavendish, who has received from the Queen,“warrant by word of mouth to assure me to do what I wold in philosophie andalchemie, and non shold chek, controll, or molest me.” Coupled with this message,she sent another promise to make up the 100 pounds.Dee’s mind was now bent, he says, to deal with his “alchemical exercises,” andthe only distractions he appears to have had were the constant visitors and smalldisasters of the children. The boy Rowland fell into the Thames on August 5, overhead and ears, about noon or soon after. Their favourite place of play seems to havebeen on the river bank, and accidents there were of no infrequent occurrence.Arthur, when a child, had fallen from the top of the Water-gate Stairs to the bottom,and had cut his forehead badly. Theodore also had a nasty fall.CHAPTER XVIIIA ROYAL COMMISSION“A wise man never goes the people’s way:But, as the planets still move contraryTo the world’s motion, so doth he, to opinion.He will examine, if those accidentsWhich common fame calls injuries, happen to himDeservedly or no? Come they deservedly,They are no wrongs then, but his punishments:If undeservedly and he not guilty,The doer of them, first, should blush, not he.”Jonson, The New InnDee had now abandoned all hope of recovering the two Midland parsonages,the small income of which was all that lay between him and utter dependence uponcharity. His thoughts were now set on the mastership of St. Cross, at Winchester, abenefice which he had already, some twenty years before, petitioned the Queen togrant. Dr. Bennett, the present master, who had then obtained it, might now, hethought, fitly be made a bishop. The Countess of Warwick secured from the Queena promise that Dee should have it, “if it were a living fit for me.” The Archbishopof Canterbury affirmed that it was most fit for Dee and Dee for it. The LordTreasurer protested, “I will do what I can with her Majestie to pleasure you therein,Mr. Dee.” Lady Warwick, faithful to his cause, repeated her request the followingyear, and still there was no news of Bennett attaining a mitre. Dee went to Court atNonsuch in August, and a day or two after his return dined, at Burleigh’sinvitation, with the Lord Treasurer and his two sons, Sir Robert and Sir ThomasCecil, at Mr. Maynard’s, at Mortlake. Burleigh also sent him venison and invitedhim again to meet Lord Cobham.All promised their influence in obtaining for him the coveted Mastership.But it was another castle in the air. His friends were extremely good to him. InMay, 1591, he says:"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"“Sir Thomas Jones, Knight (unaxed) offered me his castell of Emlyn in Walesto dwell in so long as he had any interest in it, whose lease dureth yet twelve yeres,freely with commodities adjoining unto it; and also to have as much mow land forrent as myght pleasure me sufficiently. The 27th day he confirmed the same hisoffer agayn before Mr. John Harbert, Master of the Requestes, in his hall at Mortlake,which his offers I did accept of and he was glad thereof.”He could never have entertained the idea of going to live in Wales, but nodoubt it was policy to accept all offers. Herbert was an old friend and neighbour. Hisdaughter Mary and Arthur had played at a childish marriage years before. Theyseem to have been playfellows still, after the Dees’ long absence, for in this June anaccident happened to Arthur “at Mr. Herbert’s, about sun setting.” He was“wounded in his hed by his wanton throwing of a brik-bat upright, and not wellavoyding the fall of it again. The half-brick weighed 2 1/2 lb.” On May 3 of thefollowing year, Arthur aged thirteen, became a Westminster scholar. “Wensday atten of the clock Arthur was put to Westminster Schole, under Mr. Grant and Mr.Camden.” He came back home in two or three weeks, perhaps only for a few days,and Dee in returning him to lessons wrote a characteristic letter to his friend,William Camden, the antiquary. It shows how carefully the father had studied thechild’s health, abilities, and the quick temper, inherited from his mother. There is atender touch in that mother’s forethought to furnish the boy with means towards aspecial cleanliness which the provision for ablutions at Westminster did notcontemplate. The “little chest with lock and key” for the firstborn son to take toschool is always a family event of magnitude.“22 May 1592.“Worshipfull Sir.

She was christened Frances on the afternoon of the 9th, and sent off with hernurse to Barn Elms the same day. In August her father notes, “Remember that allthings is payd to our nurse at Barnes for the girle Francys Dee from hir birth untyllthe ende of her eighth month, lacking 12s., and on Sunday the 27th of this Augustwe gave the nurse ten shillings. The eighth month ended the twelfth of thismonth.” The child stayed on with her nurse till February 14 of the next year, whenshe was fetched home, “the woman very unquiett and unthankfull.”Two entries, “March 9, the Pryvy Seale at night,” and March 16, “the greatSeale,” refer to a promise given by the Queen to Dee’s cousin, Dr. William Aubrey,of Kew, now Vicar General and one of the Masters of Requests, about five rectoriesinthe Welsh diocese of St. Davids, which Dee was to have when they fell vacant.They were only worth 74 pounds 11s. 2d. in all, and Dee says he never received apenny from them.Things were so desperate that at last, on November 9, 1592, he drew up asupplicattion which his friend, Lady Warwick presented the same day to the Queenat Hampton Court. This document, which Dee says Elizabeth took in her own handto read herself, instead of handing it to a secretary, begged for a personal audit of,and investigation into, the state of his affairs. It is probably a unique petition, and inreading it we are scarcely astonished at the confidence with which the old astrologer,now grown old in the Queen’s service, claims her consideration and provision. Heappears to regard it as little less than a national reproach that a man of science likehimself should be left in beggary. And so indeed it was. For thirty- four years hadthe Queen, true to the Tudor motto — to use everyone as a servant, to owe nogratitude, only acceptance or approval — spent promises upon him, but she hadnever given him a chance of providing for himself.“Forasmuch as the intolerable extremitie of the injuries and indignitieswhich your most excellent Majestie’s faithfull and dutifull servant, John Dee, hathfor some years last past endured, and still endureth, is so great and manifold ascannot in friefe be unto your Majestie expressed, neither without good proofe andtestimonie have credit with your Majesties, and because also without speedy andgood redress therein performed, it is to be doubted that great and incredible"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"inconveniences and griefs may ensue thereof in sundry sortes, (which yet may easilybe prevented) your Majestie’s foresaid most humble and most zealously faithfullservant beseecheth your Majestie to assign twoe or more meet and worthy persons,nobly and vertuously minded, who may and will charitably, indifferently, advisedly,and exactly, see, hear and perceive at the house of your Majestie’s said servant inMortlake, what just and needful occasion he hath thus to make most humblesupplication unto your Majestie; and so of things there seen, heard, and perceived,to make true and full report and description unto your Majesty.

Nov. 9.”The result of this unusual request was that two commissioners were at onceappointed by the Queen. Within a fortnight Sir John Wolley, Secretary for the LatinTongue to Queen Elizabeth, and one of her Privy Council, and Sir Thomas Gorges,Knight, of the Queen’s Wardrobe, were seated in Dee’s “late library room” atMortlake, prepared to listen to his manifesto.We may be sure he had long been preparing for this day. He seated the twogentlemen at a table in the middle of the room, placing near them a couple of othertables spread, one with letters and records of his “studious life for the space of a halfehundred years, now by God’s favour fully spent,” the other, with all his own books,printed and manuscript, a complete author’s collection of original works. At thesuggestio of the commissioners he had occupied the space of thirteen days inpraparing the autobiography which he called “The Compendious Rehearsall of JohnDee, his dutifull declaration, etc.,” so freely quoted in these pages. “It was in someorder of method most briefly and speedily contribed against this day;” and in everyrespect, save that of chronological order, it is a pattern document. It gives theimpression of having been written down in fragments, each incident or recital beingcomplete in itself and most carefully dated, on a separate sheet of paper, and thenthe sheets shuffled and picked out by chance to follow each other for puttingtogether. The story leaps from college day sin 1547 to travels in 1571, on toChristmas gifts in 1590, back to the Queen’s visit in 1575, thence to hisimprosonment and appearance before the Star Chamber in 1555, and hisreformation of the Calendar in 1582. He passes very lightly over his late travelsabroad, merely ading that he “was very ungodly dealt withall, when I meant alltruth sincerity, fidelity and piety towards God, my Queen and Country.” Thecatalogue of his works is valuable, but it is unnecessary to print it in the presentvolume. He concludes his list of eight printed and thirty-six manuscript works(“some perfectly finished and some unfinished yet”) with the very latest, theCompendious Rehearsall itself, adding that there were many other books,pamphlets and discourses not set down. He explains that the list is given neither“as they were written nor by order of yeares,” but hastily as they came next to hand“out of diverse chests and baggs wherein they lay.” He ends the chapter with aremarkable proof of the fecundity of his still active brain, in spite of his sixty-fiveyears."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"“The most part of all these here specifyed lye here before you on the table onyour left hand; but by other books and writings of another sort (if God grant mehealth and life thereto of some ten or twelve years), I may hereafter make plain andwithout doubt this sentence to be true, Plura latent, quam patent.” What otherworks he did accomplish in the sixteen years yet to run of his long life, he describedin an Appendix to the Rehearsal, written about two years afterwards, and printed byHearne, and by the Chetham Society at the end of the autobiographical narrative, towhich he had already added a short chapter giving an account of the result of theCommissioners’ visit, calling it “The Sequel of the Premisses.”To return to the day of the visit, November 22, 1592. The Queen’s Secretaryand the Gentleman of her Wardrobe arrived at Mortlake probably in the morning,and stayed to dinner. Having seated them at the tables in the library, Dee read tothem, or related with the manuscript at hand, the story of the “halfe hundred” yearsspent in the attainment of “good learning,” which he reckoned from his leavingChelmsford Grammar School for Cambridge. It was, of course, drawn up with theskill of a pratised author, divided into fourteen chapters, each with an attractive andpithy title. “Her Majesties specially Gracious and very Bountifull favours towardsme used etc.,” is by far the longest; the shortest is the twelfth: “The Resolution forGenerall, very easy, and speedy Remedy in this Rare and Lamentable Case.” Theremedy he suggests is to make him either Master of St. Cross; Warden ofManchester; Provost of Eton; or Master of Sherborne, one of which posts had beenalready promised him four times in three years. The tenth chapter is “The hardmaking of provision for some hundred pounds [?a year] for the maintenance of me,my wife, our children and family for these three last years, and that but with ameane dyet and simple apparel: I having not one Peny of certaine Fee, revenue,stipend or Pension, either left me, or restored unto me, or of any yet bestowed onme.” He shows how at his return three years before, he found himself penniless;cut off for ever from his two parsonages; disappointed as yet of the large yearlyallowance promised him for his life from Bohemia. Probably on parting from thethen affluent Kelley, some bond was entered into by him or by Rosenberg totransmit to him a share of the enormous profits they expected from themultiplication of the gold. “To save us from hunger starving,” he had had to appealto friends, and he records gratefully that some who had been unfriendly before heleft came to his aid on his return. They “put to” their helping hands in many ways,and alredy he had received from them a sum of 500 pounds and more. Yet he hashad to pawn his plate little by little until all was gone. “After the same mannerwent my wife’s jewels of gold, rings, bracelets, chaines and other our rarities, underthe thraldom of the userer’s grips, till non plus was written upon the boxes athome.” He has borrowed upon sureties, upon his personal bill of hand, upon hisword, upon his promise, and he has run up accounts, so that now he is in debt for333 pounds, beyond the 500 pounds. “The true accounts of all these gifts, loans, anddebts upon score, talley, or book, is here before your Honours;” how the usurerdevoureth him and how he is “dayly put to shame, may be seen.” Other necessaryexpenses amounted to 267 pounds, so that he has spent but 566 pounds in threeyears for housekeeping,” and that with great parsimony, and with gifts from goodfriends of “wine, whole brawnes, sheep, wheat, pepper, nutmegg, ginger, sugar, etc.,and other things for the apparel of me, my wife and our children.” He hasmortgaged his house for 400 pounds, and now will have to sell it for half it cost to"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"pay his debts, he and his family to become wanderers and homeless vagabonds,furnished only with bottles and wallets. What shall he do, he pitifully begs, that hemay prevent his name being handed down to posterity as a warning to lovers andstudents of truth not to follow in his steps and be given to such disgraceful shiftsand indignities? He ends with a passage of true eloquence:“Therefore, seeing the blinded Lady, Fortune, doth not govern in thiscommonwealth, but justitia and prudentia, and that in better order thanin Tully’sRepublica, or Books of Offices, they are laid forth to be followed and performed:most reverently and earnestly (yea, in manner with bloody teares of heart), I and mywife, our seaven children and our servants (seaventeene of us in all), doe this daymake our petition unto your Honours that upon all godly, charitable and justrespects had of all that you have this day seene, heard, and perceived, you will makesuch report unto her most excellent Majestie (with humble request for speedyreliefe), that we be not constrained to do or suffer otherwise than becomethChristian and true faithfull obedient subjects to do or suffer.

It abateth the edge of fretting sorrow and...is the best munition I havefound in this human peregrination. — Montaigne, Essays (Florio)The account of the library at Mortlake as it was when Dee left it in 1583, formsone of the most valuable parts ofthe Compendious Rehearsall. Comparing it withthe catalogue which he made before leaving with Laski, we can see at a glance ofwhat intrinsic value was this collection of precious books which so often haunted itsowner in his dreams. Two original copies of the Catalogue of manuscripts remain,one of which is dated September 6,1583, a fortnight before he sailed from England,and there is a third, made by Ashmole from one of these.The library contained, however, not only books and manuscripts, to thenumber of four thousand, bound and unbound, but scientific instruments collectedfrom several parts of Europe. The books alone Dee valued at 2,000 pounds in thecurrent value of the day, for many of them were unique autographia of famous andrare authors. As a further proof of this estimate, he cited to the two Commissionersa great volume in Greek, two others in French, and a third in High Dutch, whichtogether cost him, and his friends for him, 533 pounds, as the endorsements uponthem will show.The instruments included a valuable quadrant, used and he says made, by hisfriend, Richard Chancellor, the navigator to Russia and the White Seas. Itmeasured five feet in semi- diameter, and Dee relates that Chancellor and hetogether made observations of the sun’s height at meridian with it, before thisexploring seaman sailed on his last voyage (in which he and his crew perished) in"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"1556. Many years after, the quadrant was repaired and re-engraved by Mr.Bromfield, the Lieutenant of Ordnance who had given it to Dee, at a cost of 20pounds. On Dee’s return to Mortlake, he found it barbarously hacked to pieces withhammers.There was also a ten foot radius Astronomicus, (some early form oftelescope), its staff and cross divided with equal markings, like Chancellor’squadrant. It swung in a frame, and could be easily directed to any point in theheavens, or used for mensuration on the earth.A couple of globes of Gerard Mercator’s best make were among the mostvaluable contents of the library, especially as upon the celestial globe Dee hadmarked his own observations of comets, their place and path in the heavens. Therewere other objects which Mercator had constructed specially for Dee, vis., threetheorics, two with horizon and meridian lines in copper. A number of compasses ofmany kinds were among the objects, for Dee had invented, as we have seen, whathe calls a “Paradoxall Cumpass.” There was also a great piece of load-stone, or“magnes-stone,” of extraordinary virtue. It had been sold for five shillings, but“being divided up and parted with piece-meal it made more than 20 pounds.”“There was also an excellent watch-clock, made by one Dibbley, a noteableworkman, long since dead, by which clock the tyme might sensibly be measuredinteh seconds of an houre, that is, not to faile the 360th. part of an houre. The useofthis clock was very great, more than vulgar.”Then in the three laboratories, the chambers and garrets, were stores of“chemical stuff,” which he had been twenty years getting together. Also a great cart-load of special vessels for chemical use, some earthen, some of glass, metal andmixed stuff, which he had brought from Lorraine when Mr. Powell and he had goveover in 1571. Of these, only a few broken bits remained. He describes other thingsleft in his other or “open” library, and in particular a “great bladder with about fourpounds weight of a very sweetish thing, like a brownish gum in it, artificiallyprepared by thirty tymes purifying it; whosoever came by it hath more than I couldwell affoord him for one hundred crownes, as may be proved by witnesses yetliving.”As regards the manuscript treasures of the library, he mentios specially a greatcase or frame of boxes, full of rare evidences of lands in Ireland which had been inthe hands of some of the ancient Irish Princes. Agreements for submission andtributes, with seals appended, and many other valuable records of the descent ofthese manors to such families as the Mortimers, the de Burghs, the Clares, etc. Howhe came by these, save in the way of a collector, does not appear. His interest inWelsh ancestry would account for his amassing Welsh records, of which he saysthere were many deeds of gift from Welsh princes and nobles, of land devoted bythem to the foundation and enriching of religious houses. Norman deeds alsodating back to the Conquest. These were all methodically stored away in separateboxes, each marked on the front — ”the fore part of the boxes” — with chalk,explaining its contents. When he returned from his six years wandering abroad,and looked in the poor boxes, he found the name outside was all that was left. Thedeeds had been “imbezzled away, every one of them, which is a loss of great valuein sundry respects, as antiquaries can testifie for their part, and noble heralds can tell"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"for their skill, and as her Majesties officers, for her interest and titles Royall, maythink in their consideration.”Near this great chest of boxes stood another box, very much less in size,measuring only two feet by one and a half, which was filled with nothing byt seals ofcoats of arms; many of these were named, and had alredy proved invaluable tostudents of heraldry and genealogy, as well as to the Queen’s Heralds who hadcarefully examined them, also a number of other antiquaries as Camden, Stow andothers. The Clerks of the Records in the Tower had sat whole days inthe library atMortlake, “gathering rareties to their liking out of them.” Dee was no blindcollector, hoarding things because they were of value to himself. He was a truealtruist, gaining his knowledge to share with others.“Unto the Tower I had vowed these my hardly gotten muniments (gotten asin manner out of a dunghill, in the corner of a church, wherein very many wereutterly spoyled by rotting, through the raine continually, for many yeares before,falling on them through the decayed roof of that church, lying desolate and waste atthis houre).“But truly well deserve they the imprisonment of the Tower, that will nowstill keepe them, if any publique warning by her Majestie or her right honorableCouncill were given for restitution of them to the Office in the Tower.”Dee’s own works were of course in the library although not included inhiscatalogue. He drew up a list of them for his Apology to the Archbishop in 1595, bywhich it appears that before he left England eight had been published. Theunprinted books and treatises, some, he owns, not perfectly finished, numberedforty-six. To these others were added before he died; two that may be especiallynamed were upon the Three Oracular Sentences of the Ancients: Nosce te ipsum,Homo Homini Deus, and Homo Homini Lupus, (1592); and a “Treatise upon theQueen’s Sovereignty over the Seas,” a fitting subject indeed for an author who hadpersonally known most of the great navigators, and who had already written sointelligently upon the navy and the coast fisheries of “Albion.” The book wasundertaken at the request of “an honorable friend in Court.” It had, of course, along Latin title — Thalattocratia Brytannica, etc. It was finished at Manchester anddated September 20, 1597. Another work projected, and perhaps partly finished, wasto be called De Horizonte Aeternitatis, to consist of three treatises in answer toAndreas Libavius, who had published a book written in misapprehension ofsomething in Dee’s Monas.We spare the reader the long list of titles of Dee’s own books, poured out inan almost continuous stream since The Art of Logicke, in English, printed 1547,during his college days. The only idle years as regards literary output, from then upto his departure for life abroad in 1583, seem to have been 1563, 1564, and 1566-9.The most important of his printed contributions to knowledge are mentionedin these pages. One more may be alluded to here — his edition, in 1582, of RobertRecorde’s arithmetical work, The Ground of Artes, etc. Dee had probably knownthis accomplished physician, antiquary and mathematician at Cambridge, whereRecorde was a tutor before 1545. Recorde was afterwards Comptroller of the Mint atBristol, and Surveyor of Mines and Money to King Henry VIII., but he died ayoungish and impoverished man, inthe King’s Bench Prison, Southwark, in 1558."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"He introduced algebra into this country; was something of an astrologer and a goodmathematician.

Dee.From original and autograph works we may now turn to the miscellaneouscontents of Dee’s library — a truly vast and precious collection for one privategentleman of precarious fortune to won in the sixteenth century. Printed bookswere by no means easy to obtain, and manuscript copies entailed a great expenditureof skill, industry, time and cost. The text was often ignorantly or corruptly renderedby an imperfect scribe or copyist, and the scholar and collector could not rest satisfiedwithout several versions of one work.The cataloguer of the 200 most important manuscripts — Dee himself —enters with exactitude the size and substance of each volume. The bulk of coursewere in quarto, although a few folios and octavos are mentioned. Most of themwere written upon parchment, but a certain number were on paper. Bindings werenot noticed, chiefly because as yet few were bound. Two of Roger Bacon’s tracts,however, on the multiplication of species, and on perspective, the owner describesas together “in paste-bords with strings.” These identical tracts, in Dee’s own hand,and now being edited by Mr. Robert Steele, from the originals in the MazarineLibrary, Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris. From Dee they passed to Sir Richard Eden,afterwards to the Kenelm Digby Library. Treatises on kindred subjects oftenfollowed straight upon each other onthe same parchment, and sometimes as manyas twenty composed a single manuscript, included under a list of titles numbered asone. In some cases the treatise is described as a fragment. Once he writes “thesecond tract is cut out and to be answered for.”The owner’s tastes and pursuits point, of course, to a large representationamong his books, of works in philosophy, alchemy, astrology and medicine, with asubstantial proportion dealing with metallurgy, geometry, optics, physics, Ptolomaicand Copernican astronomy, and every branch of science already known in a crude"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"form to Dee’s famous predecessors. There are also historical chronicles; works ofdevotion and ethics; with a fair sprinkling of authors upon poetry, music, and thegentler arts.Taking first the classics: Dee names the Meno, Phaedo and Timaeus of Plato;writings of Aristotle, Socrates and Hippocrates, of Cicero, Cato and Archimedes. Acopy of Pliny’s Mundi Historia, Lib. ii., Frankfort, 1543, now in the British Museum,bears Dee’s signature, Louvain, January, 1550, and many of his notes. Of Euclid hehad many copies, and Augustine was his guide and confessor. A vast number ofArabic and Persian writers were comprehended in the list. He was particularly richin manuscripts of the early and mediaeval writers upon alchemy and thephilosopher’s stone: Hermes Trismegistus, Geber, Albertus Magnus, JohnSacrobosco, Raymond Lully, Philip Alstade, and Arnold de Villa Nova. Othersciences are represented by Guido Bonatus, Anselmus de Boot (Boetius), Alhazen,John of Saxony, Jacob Alkind, and Petrus Peregrinus and a score of learned writers.Dee’s own perfect and clean copy of the rare printed Epistle of Peregrinus, upon theMagnet (Augsburg, 1558), is now in the British Museum. It bears his name,“Joannes Dee, 1564,” in faded ink, with many and copious notes written by its ownermostly in his large copy-book hand, with a few in the scribbling writing which heused for speed, and some marginal sketches.Several of the manuscripts named in Dee’s list are to be found among theCotton MSS. at the Museum; in Trinity College, Dublin; and at Oxford andCambridge.Of English authors, who are very numerous in the list, the most eagerlysought after, judging by the number of works included by one author, were RogerBacon and Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln. Bacon’s writings were owned byDee in fragments. Some had been already collected and printed in Nuremburg andParis. The only other writer as often repeated in the catalogue is Boethius, whoseConsolation of Philosophy had tempted King Alfred into literary translation someseven hundred years before. Dee notes that he gave a manuscript of it in Greek tothe Library of Cracow, on July 27, 1584. Some of the ethical and philosophical worksof St. Isidore, the canonised Bishop of Seville, were duplicated. Thomas Aquinas;Duns Scotus; Richard of Wallingford, Abbot of St. Albans; Robert of Holcot, theBible Commentator; Robert of Gloucester; William of Woodford, the Franciscanopponent of Wycliffe; Richard Rolle (de Hampole), the hermit and ethical writer,are among his other English authors. A finely illuminated history of the last yearsof King Richard II., by a French gentleman who was in his suite, once the property ofDee, is now in the Lambeth Library. His manuscript Life of Edward the Confessor,by Ethelred, Abbot of Rievaulx, is another treasure that has survived the wreck oftime. It is now among the Harleian MSS. at the British Museum, with his nameand the date 1575 inscribed.Of the three or four thousand printed volumes even Dee’s industry has leftno catalogue. Many of them he mentions in his diaries, as Holinshed’s and Stow’sChronicles; the Arabic book that was lost; the collection of writings upondemonology and witchcraft, which were to be so useful to his Lancashire neighboursin after life. The books of the alchemist of Louvain, Cornelius Agrippa, he oncespeaks of as lying open in the window of his study, and therefore in constant use inthe “actions,” whether theurgic or alchemistic."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"He refers no doubt to Agrippa’s de Occulta Philosophia (Cologne? 1533), awork enormously read in all countries inthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,and translated into many languages. Another book by the alchemist of QueenMargaret of the Netherlands had an even greater popularity in England, France,Germany and Italy. This was On the Nobility and Excellence of the Female Sex (denobilitate et proecellentia foeminei sexus) which in the translation by Henry Care in1670 becomes magnified into Female Pre-eminence; or, the Dignity and Excellency ofthat Sex above the Male. It is dedicated to Queen Catharine of Braganza.These are a very few of the authors and writings contained in the manuscriptcatalogue. Such as they are, however, they give us a faint glimpse into that realm oflearning and romance wherein Dee, shut into his library at Mortlake, roamed a freecitizen of the world and dwelled where he would.CHAPTER XXADIEU TO COURTS AND COURTINGLet me weepMy youth and its brave hopes, all dead and gone,In tears which burn! Would I were sure to winSome startling secret in their stead, a tinctureOf force to flush old age with youth, or breedGold, or imprison moonbeams till they changeTo opal shafts! — only that hurling itIndignant back, I might convince myselfMy aims remained supreme and pure as ever. — Browning, Paracelsus.The immediate result of the Commissioners’ visit to Mortlake was a gift of ahundred marks from the Queen. The Countess of Warwick sent off “hergentleman, Mr. Jones, very speedily,” to tell Dee that Sir Thomas Gorges “had veryhonorably dealt for” him in the matter, and that the gift was granted. The moneywas brought next day (December 2) by Sir Thomas himself. He brought also a letter“full of courtesie and kindness and a token of six old angells of gold,” from LadyHoward to Jane. Dee seems to have become intimate with Lady Warwick throughhis early friendship with John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, who died, aged twenty-four,in 1554. In his Preface to Euclid, Dee has left an etched portrait of his own age. “Notwo besides himself,” says Dee, “can so well say what roots vertue had fastened inhis breat, what rules of godly and honorable life he had framed to himself, whatvices noteable he took great care to eschew, what prowesses he purposed and meantto achieve.”Dee’s “few lynes of thankfulness” to the Queen for her gift were probablywritten at once, but only delivered by Lady Warwick on February 15, at HamptonCourt, on the eve of a move to Somerset House.On the strength of this dole, Dee was able to settle some pressing debts, and tohire a coach and go off with his wife and Arthur and Kate, to spend Christmas andNew Year’s Day at Tooting, “at Mr. R. Luresey his howse.” The Lord Treasurer, hereports, lay dangerously sick at the time. On the 2nd they returned. On the 7th,"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"welcome letters, perhaps containing money, arrived from Count Laski in Livonia,to which Dee replied on the 20th, sending his letter by a Danish ship called the Johnof Dansk.His reputation as an astronomer and mathematician now procured for Dee apupil, from whom he was to receive in exchange a considerable gift or loan.“March 17, 1593. At six after none received from Mr. Francis Nicholls 15punds, part of one hundred pounds, the rest whereof, 85 pounds, is to be receyvedfrom Mr. Nicholls within a fortnight after the annunciation of Our Lady next; andafter that in the beginning of June 100 pounds, and in Julie the third hundredpounds, and I am to teach him the conclusion of fixing and teyming of the moon.”A rather unwise purchase seems to have been made this may; Dee bought the“next mansion house, with the plat and all the appertenances abowt it,” of Mr. MarkPierpoint, of Mortlake. It is true the whole mansion only cost 32 pounds, but itentailed other purchases and soon had to be mortgaged. Possession was notobtained till the autumn. A “hovel” in the yard was bought from Goodman Welderin July for a new angel and five new shillings. The bargain with Pierpoint wasconcluded in the street, when “before Jane my wife, I gave him a saffron noble inernest for a drink penney.”Crowds of visitors came to Mortlake to dine. Mr. Beale (who was a borrowerof books from Dee — his own Famous and Rich Discoveries, and the ChronicaHollandiae Magnae), and his wife; Francis Blount, uncle of Sir Charles, who hadbeen in Constantinople; Mistress Banister; Mr. Redhead, one of the Queen’sgentlemen ushers, and his wife; the mother of John Pontoys, about whom we shallhear more; Mr. Gubbens, book-binder, and Mrs. Gubbens, and many others.Hospitable as ever, Dee had offered shelter for two months to Antony Ashley, Clerkof the Council, his wife and family, “who used me worshipfully and bountifully forour friendship. They had my mother’s chamber, the mayde’s chamber, and all theother house.”Not only books were lent, but instruments also. “On Thursday, Mr. Saundersof Ewell, sent home my great sea cumpass, but without a needle. It came in thenight by water.”In August he is much in train with the Lord Keeper, Sir John Eckford, at Kew.On the 8th he dined there, again on the 17th, this time taking Mrs. Dee andKatherine, who at twelve was sufficiently grown up to dine out. On the 28th he wasall day with the Lord Keeper. The entries we have here, “Mr. Web and thephilosopher came as I was with the Lord Keeper,” and “Mr. Web and thephilosopher cam again,” pique one’s curiosity.At the end of the month, Dee notes the departure from his service “uppon nodue cause known to me,” of Elizabeth Kyrton, a servant who had been with himtwelve years, had passed through the vicissitudes of travel-life in Bohemia, asRowland’s nurse; left in charge of him, as we have seen, in Cracow when the otherswent on to Prague. She had served five years on apprenticeship and seven forwages: five at four and two at five nobles a year. Of her wages there was now fourpounds four shillings due. Dee in paying her, presented a new half-angel; Jane Deegave her another; Arthur half-a-crown for him and his brother (Rowland), andKatherine the like sum for herself and Madinia. Elizabeth’s going seems to have"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"upset the domestic arrangements for a month or so later Dee makes an unusualentry about his wife: “Jane most desperately angry in respect of her maydes.”Margery Thornton, Elizabeth’s successor, left next day, and Dorothy Legg came for30s. yearly.A messenger from Laski arrived, Mr. Cornelio Camaiere, and stayed a week.These constant communications do not by any means support the contention thatLaski parted with Dee in anger, ruined by his costly experiments. It is more probablethat Laski was urging him to return and continue Kelley’s work.The Countess of Cumberland, Lord Willoughby and his sister, the Countessof Kent, came to visit Dee. Willoughby dined and next day sent him 20 pounds.Dee was annoyed by “Mr. Gray, the Lady Cumberland’s preacher, his wrangling anddenying and despising alchemicall philosopher.” A New Year’s gift of 20 angels, in anew red velvet purse, came to Jane Dee from the Lord Keeper.Michael Peiser, doctor to the Duke of Brandenburg, visited Dee, also WalterVan der Laen, “an astronomer of great promise.” Mr. John Aske sent as a presenttwo little doubtle gilt bowls, weighing thirteen ounces and a half. “Sir ThomasWilles offer philosophical cam to my hands, by Mr. Morrice Kiffen.” The children,Madinia and Theodore, were not very well. Several visits were paid to Mr. Webbe,who had been inthe Marshalsea prison since the days before Christmas. His chestsand boxes were sealed up. It is possible he was the Mr. Webbe who was employed bythe Queen to visit and report on Dyer and Kelley at Prague. He may even have beensuspected of bringing some of Kelley’s manufactured gold to Dee. BartholomewHickman and his brother were a good deal to and fro; Bartholomew was firstbrought to Dee as a lad by his uncle, in 1578, with an introduction from SirChristopher Hatton. Now, his daughter Jane was taken into service. Dee gave hima nag that the Lord Keeper had presented, and he rode frequently “homeward,” toShugborough in Warwickshire. In December 1594, Dee “preferred” him to LordWilloughby’s service at the Barbican, and there is a whole history about his livery,which was ordered from a Fleet Street tailor, Mr. Jonson.Dee’s health was now often affected in one way or another. The first mentionof trouble in the kidneys was in 1592, when, at Court at Greenwich, a midnightseizure was eased by a glyster, applied by Dr. Giffard. There were other slight attacks,and in March 1594, he had a“Great fit of stone in my left kidney: but I drunk a draught of white wyne andsalet oyle, and after that, crabs’ eyes in powder with the bone in the carp’s head, andabout four of the clock I did eat tosted cake buttered, and with sugar and nutmeg onit, and drunk two great draughts of ale with it; and I voyded within an hour muchwater and a stone as big as an Alexander seed. God be thanked! Five shillings toRobert Web part of his wages.”This servant was discharged on June 23 with forty shillings for a fullsatisfaction of all things. “On July 1, I gave Robert yet more, a French crown for a farwell.”A year and a half passed after the visit of the Commissioners, and beside theimmediate result of a donation of a hundred marks, nothing had accrued to betterDee’s position. He determined then to redouble his efforts and bring something to"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"pass. He certainly had enlisted the aid of powerful friends, although no doubt therewere still many suspicious enemies.On May 3, 1594, the Queen sent for him to come to her in the privy garden atGreenwich, between six and seven o’clock in the evening. She received him alonesave for the presence of her two ladies, Lady Warwick, Dee’s very good friend, andLady Cecil. Dee presented her with a writing which he calls “the heavenlyadmonition,” which he says she took with grateful thanks. On the 18th, he writes“Her Majestie sent me agayne the copy of the letter of E.K. with thanks by the LadyWarwick.” He had received letters from Kelley four or five weeks earlier, on March28, and he probably had copied out for her certain passages, doubtless referring to thefabulous transmutation of metals. Did he still hold out hopes that he might be ableto achieve a like success? On the 21st, “Sir John Wolley moved my sute to herMajesty. She granted after a sort, but referred all to the Lord of Canterbury.” “Onthe 25th. Dr. Aubrey moved my sute to her Majesty, and answere as before.” Hissuit was promotion to the Mastership of St. Cross, the post which had so long beenthe goal of his hopes, but which he was never destined to attain. He had set out atlength in his Rehearsall for the Commissioners, sundry good reasons why hedesired it, “rather than any other living, see, or dignity of like value in any otherplace.” First, he gave as a reason his longing to retire to a quiet spot away from themultitude and hoards of friends and acquaintances, chance visitors, anddistinguished strangers, who positively “haunted” his house at Mortlake. There, hecould deny himself to no one without offence or breach of friendship. It was fatallyeasy and cheap for every curious person from London, or from the Court, to find hisway down to that big rambling place by the riverside, with whose stills and furnaces,and wonderful doings, rumour was so rife. So much for privacy, next for economy.Fuel, coals, bricks, and all things necessary for his purpose, will be cheaper atWinchester than near London; the glass-houses of Sussex are not far away, and hewill be able to give personal supervision to the making of special vessels. AtMortlake there are too many eyes and tongues. The south coast is within easy reach,and it will be possible to communicate with his friends abroad, to get over thingsand workers necessary, and “have the more commodious place for the secret arrivalof special men to come unto me there at St. Crosses; some of which men would beloath to be seen or heard of publickly in Court or City.” Is it possible that he is stillthinking of Kelley, who, though then (1592) an Emperor’s favourite and the bearerof a title, could easily in England be identified with Talbot the coiner, forger, andnecromancer of former days?Then Dee sets out in his Rehearsall the capacity of the dwelling at St. Cross,which is roomy enough to entertain rare and excellent men from all parts of theworld, as well as any of his fellow-countrymen. This will be for the honour andcredit of England. There is room also for lodging his staff of mechanical assistants;for a printing house to be set up for “reproducing good, rare, and antient bookes inGreek and Latin,” and “some of my own, to be printed with my own ordering andoversight.” Then he lays stress upon the desirable surroundings, a chapel wheredivine service is held every day, for bringing up his children and family devoutly.He ends with the advantages of Winchester School, close at hand, not only for hisfour sons “to become Grammarians in,” but for his obtaining help from the “goodGreek and Latin Grammarians and fair writers in that school, for copying out booksfor her Majesty.”"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"He is teeming with all these projects and activities in spite of his sixty-fiveyears. He was a born librarian; and still had a national library of books andmanuscripts at heart as much as when, nearly forty years before, he had tried in vainto induce Queen Mary to found one.Dee’s eloquent persuasions so far prevailed with the Queen that a draft wasprepared before the end of May, granting to Lord Cobham the next advowson of“Holyrood,” or St. Cross, at Winchester, in the Queen’s gift, to present to John Dee,M.A., on the death or resignation of Dr. Robert Bennett, the present incumbent.Having drawn up this very full account of his doings and writings, to presentto the Commissioners, Dee was naturally anxious that the appeal should be aswidespread and far-reaching as possible. Archbishop Whitgift had shown himselffavourably inclined, and Dee determined to approach him with a copy of that part ofthe Rehearsall in which he recited the titles of the books he had written. Heprepared a Letter containing a brief Discourse apologeticall with a plaineDemonstration and fervent protestation for the lawful sincere and very faithful andchristian course of the philosophicall studies and exercises of a certaine studiousgentleman, an ancient servant to her most excellent Majesty Royall, addressed to theArchbishop; he probably presented it himself during this summer of 1595. It is aprotest and an appeal, and emphatically states that from his youth he has used goodhonest lawful and Christian means to attain such knowledge as shall honour God,his country and his Queen. It ends with a prayer that he may be found of theArchbishop, and undoubtedly acknowledged by the wise and just, to have been azealous and faithful student in the school of Verity and an ancient Graduate in theschool of Charity.On June 3, Dee and Jane, accompanied by all their seven children, four boysand three girls, their ages ranging from Arthur, the Westminster boy of fifteen, toFrances, the baby of two and a half, presented themselves before the Queen at SionHouse, Isleworth. Jane was permitted to kiss her hand. Evidently this was anexpression of thanks for the official preliminaries of the grant of St. Cross. TheArchbishop was present, and Dee humbly requested him to come to his “cottage.”The invitation was repeated on the 6th, when Dee supped with the Primate. Thingswere not, however, settled so quickly. Dr. Robert Bennett had to be provided with abetter position before he would resign; some hitch occurred, and on June 29, after avisit to the Archbishop, at Croydon, the poor man writes distractedly of his brokenhopes: —“After I had hard the Archbishop his answers and discourses, and after thathe had byn the last Sonday at Tybalds with the Quene and Lord Threasorer, I takemyself confounded for all suing or hoping for anything that ever was. And soadiew to court and courting tyll God direct me otherwise! The Archbishop gave mea payre of sufferings [sic] to drinke. God be my help as he is my refuge. Amen.”Everything fell through, and things began to look darker than ever. Michael,who had been a delicate child, fell ill in July. On the 6th, he “becam distempered inhis head and bak and arms.” Dee himself was unwell, complaining of headache andinternal pains, but he does not forget to note that he paid “Letice my servant 5s., partof her wages, with part whereof she is to buy a smok and nekercher.” Michael’sillness was short: “July 13th, in ortu solis, Michael Dee did give up the ghost, after"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"he sayed `O Lord, have mercy upon me!’“ His father omits any reference to thechild’s burial.The summer passed with very little to record in the diary beyond a visit onAug. 25, fromFerard, the herbalist of quaint and fragrant memory; another on the30th, from “Monsieur Walter Mallet, who toke his leave to go to Tholose. He hadthe fix oyle of saltpetre.” Dee sends letters in September to Kelley, and in Octoberdetermines on another appeal to royal favour. But Elizabeth was getting old andhard to move; Burleigh also was failing. Dee wrote in his wife’s name to LadyScudamore, her old friend and Katherine’s godmother, begging her to intercedewith the Queen that either he might appear and declare his case before the Council,or else have a licence under the Great Seal to go where he would. St. Cross wasfarther off than ever; England cold and inhospitable; and he prepared to say a finalgood-bye to courts and courting at home, and betake himself to Germany, orAustria, or some other land. Francis Garland arrived on December 2 from Prague,“just as I came five years ago to a day from Bremen to England.” Little profit indeedhad he reaped in that five years.On the 7th, “Jane delivered her supplication with her own hand to theQueen, as she passed out of the privy garden at Somerset House, to go to dinnerwith Sir Thomas Heneage at the Savoy.” Elizabeth handed the letter to the LordAdmiral, but took it again from him, and kept it on her cushion. The next day, theLord Admiral and Lord Buckhurst reminded her of the matter; presently she toldthe Archbishop that she wished Dee to have Dr. Day’s place of Chancellor at St.Paul’s. “8th Dec. The Chancellorship presented. The Archbishop of Canterburywilling,” he writes; but this was apparently another castle in the air, for Dr. WilliamDay was not appointed Bishop of Winchester till a year later, November 23, 1595,and although Dee’s name appears as Chancellor under the date of December 8, 1594,he seems never to have held office.His friends, however, were not idle. In a month’s time, January 3,Archbishop Whitgift was recommending Elizabeth to grant him the Wardenship ofChrist’s College, Manchester, in her own gift. Dr. William Chadderton, who wasthen Warden and Bishop of Chester, was to be promoted to the see of Lincoln, andhere was an opening for Dee. On February 5, Sir John Wolley endeavoured to gether to sign the patent for his appointment, “but she deferred it.” Dee was up anddown to London from Mortlake, and on February 10, at two in the afternoon, he“toke a cut-purse taking his purse out of his pocket in the Temple.” On April 18, theQueen did sign the bill, when it was offered her by Dee’s friend and neighbour atMortlake, John Herbert, Master of the Requests. On May 25, 26, 27, it passed theSignet, the Privy Seal, and the Great Seal; and, as a climax to his entry in the diary,Dee adds, “3 pounds 12s. borrowed of my brother Arnold,” doubtless to pay the fees.The Earl of Derby gave him letters of introduction, and he was soon incorrespondence with Oliver Carter, one of the Fellows; with Thomas Williams,another; and with Mr. Goodier, lessee of the tithes belonging to the Warden andFellows. Carter and Williams were already at law with each other, and soon wereboth to be at loggerheads with Dee and his laudable desires to set the tangled affairsof the college straight. Carter was one of the moderators of the monthly lecture inManchester, had great influence, and seems to have been unprepared to welcome aWarden of Dee’s reputation."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"“July 31st. The Countess of Warwick did this evening thank her Majestie inmy name, and for me, for her gift of the Wardenship of Manchester. She toke itgratiously and was sorry that it was so far from hense, but that some better thingneer hand shall be fownd for me; if opportunitie of time would serve, her Majestiewold speak with me herself. I had a bill made by Mr. Wood, one of the clerks of thesignet, for the first frutes forgiving by her Majestie.”So at length there was something tangible in prospect. Things had to besettled up at Mortlake and preparations made for the journey northward. We maybe sure that Dee’s gratification at receiving a post of some sort, after a lifetime ofwaiting, was mixed with regret at quitting the place that had been his home for solong. His “yong coosen, John Aubrey, came in May to recreate himself for a while,”and stayed nearly a month.On August 14, Jane’s youngest child, a girl, was born. She was baptised atMortlake as Margaret Dee on the afternoon of August 27; godfather, the LordKeeper; godmothers, the Countesses of Cumberland and Essex, all three representedby deputy. The Countess of Essex was Walsingham’s only daughter and heir. Shehad been Sidney’s widow, and was now married to Essex.Dee was now entertained often by Lord Derby at Russell House, once to meetsome German guests. On October 9 he dined with Sir Walter Raleigh at DurhamPlace. This palace in the Strand had seen many vicissitudes before it had been givento Raleigh by the Queen. Originally the residence of the northern bishops, it hadbeen seized by an earlier king. Lady Jane Grey had been wedded there. Her tooambitious father-in-law had gone thence to the Tower and the scaffold. Catholicplots against Elizabeth had been hatched by Spaniards in this, her own house, andnow the great seaman, fresh from far Guiana, was housed in a little turret,overlooking the river and the ships.Dee was anxious to reclaim, before going to his new home, an Arabic booklent to some friend in Oxford. He had written to Mr. Harding and Mr. Abbottseveral times for its return about a year and a half before. Now, on October 20, hesent his man Richard Walkden to Oxford to find and bring it. The man returnedfrom a fruitless errand, but on November 19 “my Arabic book was restored by God’sfavour.” His gratitude expressed itself in a practical manner to the trusted Richard:“I delivered unto Richard Walkedyne my man, Mr. Robert Thomas hisfustian dubblet, for 10 shillings of his wages. I gave him more when he was to ridedown with my wife: 10s., whereof 6s. 4d. was due to him that he had layd out forme. The other 3s. 6d. was of his wages.”A portion of goods and furniture had already been despatched towardsManchester by a carrier named Percivall, and on the 26th Jane and her children allset of by coach towards Coventry, a usual half-way halting place on the high-road toLancashire. A last piece of business was transacted on December 23 with JohnNorton, stationer, to whom Dee owed money, perhaps for printing: “I payd him tenpownds in hand and was bound in a recognisance before Doctor Hone for thepayment of the rest, 10 pounds yearly, at Christmas, and Midsummer 5 pounds, tyll53 pounds 14s. 8d. more were paid.” The same day he received 30 pounds in partpayment of 100 pounds for the house at Mortlake, which he had lent to Mr. Paget."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXIMANCHESTER“He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave,By laboursome petition; and, at last,Upon his will I sealed my hard consent.” — Shakespeare, HamletThe Collegiate Church, now the Cathedral of Manchester, was founded about1420 in this already ancient town by Thomas de la Warre, baron and priest, rector orparson of St. Mary’s, Manchester, and lord of the manor. The flourishing town ofwoollen industries, introduced by the Flemings a hundred or more years earlier,demanded a new and more capacious church; and De la Warre, the last of his noblehouse, determined to provide buildings in which a Warden, priests or Fellows, andchoristers, should be continually resident, as well as to found a new church. Hegained the consent of his parishioners to the appropriation of estates belonging tothe existing rectory, as an income for the college, and supplemented it from his ownlands in the district. He also obtained a charter of foundation from Henry V., datedMay 9. The college was dissolved by Edward VI. and refounded by Henry VIII.; butby the time of Elizabeth its lands had been plundered, sold or leased, she herselfbecoming a sharer in the profits of spoliation until there was hardly any clearproperty left. At the instance of Dean Nowell, an inquiry was instituted, with theresult that the college was granted a new charter in 1578, as Christ’s College, toconsist of a Warden, four Fellows, and two chaplains, with choristers. Nowell andOliver Carter were two of the first Fellows. The second Warden was Dr.Chadderton, who had been Leicester’s chaplain, and was Bishop of Chester. Underhim the Catholics were relentlessly persecuted, Manchester prisons were filled, andthe famous Marprelate printing press was discovered and seized. Chadderton’spromotion to the see of Lincoln in 1595 made an opening for our persistent place-beggar to be disposed of at last.Dee arrived in Manchester on Monday afternoon, February 15, 1596, and tookup his abode in the college. On the following Saturday he was installed intheWardenship, between nine and eleven o’clock, as he tells us. He has unfortunatelyleft no account of the ceremony. His first business was to become acquainted withthe tenants fo the college lands, and the owners of tithes which constituted itsrevenue. On April 2, he says Sir John Byron and his son, Mr. John Byron, dinedwith him at the college. This family, although Newstead had been acquired someforty or fifty years previously, were still often resident on their Lancashire estates.Clayton, near Manchester, was in fact then their chief residence. A little later in themonth, Dee records the courts kept for the manor of Newton, in Manchester parish,of which the Warden and Fellows were lords. The Dean and Canons, the presentrepresentatives of Warden and Fellows, still hold a court leet twice a year for thismanor.There is an interesting letter from Dee to Robert Bruce Cotton, the antiquary,dated in May this year, throwing light on his relations with the people in hisemploy — copyists, assistants or apprentices. He had brought with him from"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Mortlake Antony Cowley, who had formerly been in Cotton’s service. Dee wasanxious to know if he had departed from the employ of his late master withhis goodwill.“Truely, for my part, I will receyve none to my simple service (man orwoman) unleast they come from theyr Masters or Mistresses with theyr well likingof suche their departure from them. Therfore, I wold, by this bearer, gladly receyveyour answer herein, by word of mouth or by your letter. And so shall I be free fromall offence giving to your worship, or any els inthis cause: as I am most free fromcoveting, desyring or longing after my neighbour’s wife or any servant of his. If Imight have a thousand pounds to sollicite or procure any mans servant to forsakehis master or mistress, and to come to me or any other, I wold not do it, Godknowes.”In about three weeks Dee received a reply to this considerate letter, evidentlynot entirely satisfactory, for on June 3 he paid Antony Cowley 20s. and dischargedhim. Next day “Antony went forth early from my house, I know not whither.”Dee now began to direct his whole attention to his charge: the college and thecollege lands. A royal commission was appointed to sit and examine its internalaffairs. On June 18 “the commission for the college was sent to London to beengrossed inthe Duchy office.” Dee was a layman; he had always stipulated heshould have no cure of souls attached to whatever benefice he might hold. For thedaily services at Manchester he employed a succession of curates (mostlyunsatisfactory), to whom he paid “wages 50s. for three months.” He was far moreinterested in the temporal than the spiritual welfare of his college, and indeed hisdesire for such an appointment seems rather to have been solely prompted by theselfish, if necessary, wish for an income and means to pursue his own studies inpeace. He was to find neither in Manchester.In June he received a visit from Mr. Harry Savile, the antiquary, of the Bank,Halifax, and by him he sent a request to Christopher Saxton, of Dunningley, nearHalifax, to come and arrange a survey of the town of Manchester, and consult aboutthe parish boundaries. Saxton was a well-known character of the time, the holder ofa patent from the Queen, whose arms appear upon the maps he made of the threecounties of Chester, York and Lancaster. They were the first maps of Britain madefrom actual survey, and had been issued as an atlas in 1579, most of the mapshaving been engraved in 1577. His visits to Dee lasted over three weeks; notes areentered of his measuring the township and visiting Hough Hall, the seat ofNicholas Mosely, the Lancashire clothier who, two or three years later, became LordMayor of London and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth. The boys, Arthur andRowland; the two faithful assistants, Crocker and Walkden accompanied Dee andMr. Saxton on the peregrination. Harry Savile seems to have made one of the partyalso. Unfortunately, Saxton’s Manchester survey is not now known to be inexistence.A surprise visit was paid to the Warden on June 26 by his landlord, the Earl ofDerby, and a large party of ladies and gentlement, including Lady Gerard, wife of theMaster of the Rolls; her daughter Frances, and her husband, Sir Richard Molyneux,of Sefton, a former member for the county of Lancaster. Their son-in-law, Mr.Richard Hoghton, of Hoghton Towers, and others, also accompanied the Earl. The"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Warden says: “They came suddenly upon me after three of the clock. I made thema skoler’s collation, and it was taken in good part. I browght his honor and theladyes to Ardwick Green toward Lyme, to Mr. Legh his howse, 12 myles off.” Mrs.Legh was Lady Gerard’s second daughter, so it was altogether a family party thatdescended so unexpectedly on the Warden, and no doubt ate merrily of his“scholar’s collation.” The only absence from Manchester recorded by the Warden(except the two years in London) was on August 13 this year, when he says that he“rid toward York and Halifax, returning from York on the 20th.”On September 1, Mary Goodwyn came “to govern and teach” the two youngerchildren, Madinia, aged six, and Margaret, one year old. There was a field or two letwith the College House, and the Warden now turned farmer, getting a small droveof seventeen head of cattle up from his kinsfolk in Wales to graze the pasture. Theywere brought up by the “courteous Griffith David, nephew to Mr. Thomas Griffith,and were a present.” Dee had to visit Sir John Byron about the college tenants.“Who pretended that we have part of Faylesworth Common within ourNewton Heath, which cannot be proved, I am sure. We wer agreed that JamesTraves (being his bayly) and Franis Nutthall, his servant for him, shold with meunderstand all circumstances, and so duly to proceed.”The close of the year was marked by an episode which might have gone fartowards clearing Dee’s character from the aspersions still being cast upon him.Nowhere was superstition and belief in witchcraft more prevalent than inLancashire, and in November and December of this year he seems to have beenapplied to for advice as regards a woman and seven children, said to have becomedemoniacally possessed through the influence of one Hartley, a “conjurer.” Dee’scurate, Matthew Palmer, happened to go in as Hartley was praying over the womanin a fit. He demanded what he was doing.“`Praying.’“`Thou pray! thou canst not pray,’ quoth he. `What prayer canst thou say?’“`None,’ saith he, `but the Lord’s Prayer.’“`Say it,’ quoth he, the which as I remember, he could not say.”Dee “utterly refused to meddle with the affair, and advised the father toconsult with godlye preachers and appoint a private fast.” Perhaps he rememberedthat when he asked, long before, if he had done well concerning Isabel Lister, vexedof a wicked spirit, the angel’s reply had been “Friend, it is not of thy charge.” He sentfor Hartley, and “so sharply rebuked him that the children had more ease for threeweeks after.” The devils were finally exorcised by a godly preacher, John Darrell, or,as we suspect, by the children’s release from Hartley’s attentions, who was hangedsoon after. Dee’s library, a good part of which he must have moved to Manchester,was constantly in request at this time. It was rich in books on demonology andpossession, and Lancashire justices of the peace who had to deal with these cases ofwitchcraft brought before them seem to have resorted to such works, for and againstthe persecution and annihilation of witches, as the De Praestigiis Daemonum (Basle,1566) of John Wier, the Fustis Daemonum and the Flagellum Daemonum of themonk Hierom Menghi (Frankfort 1582, Boulogne 1586). All these Dee recordslending to Mr. Edmund Hopwood, of Hopwood, a deputy- lieutenant andecclesiastical commissioner, as well as a J.P. Wier or Weier was very likely known"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"to Dee at Louvain. He was one of the earliest apologists for these unfortunate folk,and pleaded that, their brains being disordered by melancholy, they merited pity, notpunishment. His book contains the first account of “The Pied Piper of Hamelin,”from the archives of the town of Hamelin. A Spanish grammar was lent to Mr.Barlow for his son. Mr. Matthew Heton was the borrower of theological works,including the Concordantiae Bibliorum (1555) of Robert Stephens, the illustriousprinter of the New Testamentl; and a Calvinistic treatise, De Coena Domini, writtenby Dr. Pezel, who had, we remember, commemorated Dee’s departure from Bremenin 1589 by verses. Dee lent Heton books,but Heton lent Dee ten pounds on a bill ofhand. To John Cholmeley “I lent my Latyn boke in 8vo, De Morbis Infantum.”The disputes over tithes and lands belonging to the college naturally affectedthe Warden’s income, and Dee found himself compelled to borrow small sums asbefore. Finally he was reduced to raise money on his plate, and especially on thehandsome double gilt tankard, with a cover, which was the christening gift of theCountess of Hertford to her god-daughter Frances. It weighed 22 ounces, and Deetells how he delivered it to Charles Leigh, one of the college “singing men,” to lay inpawn in his own name with Robert Welsham, the goldsmith, “till within two daysafter May-day next. My daughter Katherine and John Crocker [the old servant], and Imyself [John Dee], were at the delivery of it and waying of it, in my dyning chamber.It was wrapped in a new handkercher cloth.” All that was obtained on the tankardwas 4 pounds of the current value.In the spring of 1597, Dee records, on May 4, the last of the Rogation days ofthe year, a very interesting topographical event, viz., the perambulation of thebounds of old Manchester by himself, the curate, and the clerk.Away in the south-eastern corner of England, in the little village of Bourne,near Canterbury, about this very time, Richard Hooker, the saintly scholar, wasperforming a similar perambulation, of which Izaak Walton has left us theimmortal picture. A homily was prepared for the service, a psalm sung, and themalediction pronounced, “Cursed be he that removes his neighbour’s landmark.”Izaak Walton tells us that Hooker, to look at, was an“Obscure harmless man in poor clothes, his loins girt in a coarse gown orcanonical coat; of a mean stature and stooping, yet more lowly in the thoughts of hissoul; his body worn out, not with age, but study and holy mortification. Yet hewould by no means omit the customary procession; persuading all, both rich andpoor: if they desired the preservation of loe and their parish rights and liberties, toaccompany him in his perambulation; and most did so. In which perambulation,he would express more pleasant discourse than at other times, and would thenalways drop some loving and facetious observations, to be remembered against thenext year, especially by the boys and young people; still inclining them, and all hispresent parishioners, to meekness and mutual kindnesses and love, because lovethinks no evil, but covers a multitude of sins.”The Warden of Manchester has not left us such an impression of the ancientantiquarian custom performed as a holy rite of devotion, but as an exact topographerand mathematician he has givena highly valuable record: —1597. “May 4. I with Sir Robert Barber, curate, and Robert Tilsley, clerk ofManchester parish church, with diverse of the town of diverse ages, went in"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Perambulation to the bownds of Manchester parish: began at the Leeless Bircheagainst Prestwicke parish, and so had vew of thre corner stake, and then down tyllMr. Standysh new enclosure on Thelmore, wher we stayed, and vewed the stake yetstanding in the back of the dich; [it] being from the corner eleven measures of Mr.Standley’s stik, then in his hand, and 2 fote more; which stik I did measureafterward, and it did conteyn in length: feet 5, ynch 3. The total mesure: fete 69,ynches 9. At which place Teblow, servant to Mr. Ashton of Chaderton, did meet us.The survey geometricall of the very circuits of Manchester parish wer ended in this,being the sixth day of my work folks doings.”In the Chetham Library is a holograph letter from Dee to the rector ofPrestwich, William Langley, dated two days before this perambulation, informinghim of the project for making a chart of the parish bounds, and inviting him,“As one side of our parish in Thielmore doth border upon some parts of yourparish of Prestwiche, to request some one or two of the auncient of your parish to beallso beholders of our bounds, notifying toward your parish in that place. Myneighbours do intend to come on Wensday next, in the morning about 9 or 10 of theclok, to that part that is by Goodman Smehearst’s house, and so toward the birchetree that is called the Leeless Byrche, and thereabouts, for a little space; to beggyn thevew of the bownds and meres of Manchester parish: by the order of an enjoynedwork by the higher powres, for avoyding of undue encroaching of any neighbourlyparish one on the other. You understand me sufficiently well, I dowt not. Pardonmy boldness so bluntly to borde you with so homely a sute.“Your wurships sincere“Wellwisher in Christe,“John Dee, Warden.”John Crocker and several other men were occupied for some weeks inmarking the boundaries of the manor; they met with extraordinary opposition fromthe landowners, and on June 14 Dee alludes to a riot that took place at Newton,Captain Bradley and others endeavouring to hinder the college employees in theirlabour. What with opposition abroad and difficulties with his curate at home, Deewas finding the coveted appointment no bed of roses. He records another of hischaracteristic dreams — the dreams of a bibliophile, to whom books are treasures asdear almost as his children: —“This night I had the vision and shew of many bokes in my dreame, andamong the rest was one great volume, thik, in large quarto, new printed, on the firstpage whereof as a title in great letters was printed Notus in Judaea Deus. Manyother books methought I saw, new printed, of very strange arguments. I lent Mr.Edmund Hopwood of Hopwood my Malleus Maleficarum to use till New Year’styde next, a short thik old boke, with two clasps, printed anno 1517.”It was now early August. So Hopwood, who was bent on mastering thesubject of witchcraft, was to have about four months to study The Hammer forWitches, a book first issued in 1489, after the Bull against sorcery of Pope InnocentVIII., by the three sorcery inquisitors. It was translated into German,"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Hexenhammer, and formed the text-book of procedure against witches in Germany.Its authors give emphasis to their learned observation that witch-craft is morenatural to women than men, because of the inherent wickedness of their hearts! Inmediaeval times there appeared, alas! no safe and inconspicuous path for ordinarywomen. The entire sex consisted apparently of either angels or devils.On a Sunday in August, Dee entertained the Earl and Countess of Derby at a“banket at my loding at the College, hora 4 1/2.” They had newly taken up theirresidence at Alport Park, which had been the college property before the dissolutionof the monasteries. It is now inthe heart of the city, somewhere near the MidlandRailway works.There was scant time for literary labours amid so much entertainingtopographical work and litigation; abut in September Dee sent to his former friend,now Sir Edward Dyer, a treatise he had some time written on “The Queen’s TitleRoyal and Sea Sovereignty in St. Georges Channel and all the Ocean adjoining toEngland, Scotland and Ireland.” He quotes in it so freely from his British Monarchy(see ante, p. 39) that he encloses a copy of that work, written twenty years before, incase his correspondent does not possess one handy. The letter gives such a graphicpicture of the state into which the college affairs had fallen, and of the characteristicenergy with which Dee set about to try and reform them, that it must be quoted atsome length. When the accompanying volume and manuscript have been fullydiscussed, the writer passes on to the“intricate, cumbersome, and lamentable affairs of estate of this defaced anddisordered college, whereunto not only I am assigned for my portion ofmayntenance, for me and all myne, but allso, by college oath, bownde to see untothe right and dignitie thereof. Which hat bred unto me already, both wonderfullcare of mynde and no little payne taking, ever since my entrance, and daylie dothand will brede me more and more. And hath browght me likewise in great debt, byreason of the pore Revenue of my stipend (of only iiijs. a day for me and all myne),and that in these tymes of very great dearth here, yea, so great, that unleast (inhismost fatherly Providence) the Almighty God had stirred up some mens hartes tosend me, this present yere, from Dantzig, some barrells of kye; from Wales somecattall, and from Hull some fish for Lent: God knoweth that it passed all our wittesand habilitie to devise or use any other meanes, sufficient to the preserving of thelives of me and my familie togither, being now but of eightene persons, mostnedefull: I my wife and our children, being the one half of them.

Very few allusions to domestic and familymatters occur inthe diary for these Manchester years, but in November, 1597, anaccident is recorded to Arthur, who was at home for a time. He was amusinghimself by fencing with Edward Arnold, one of Dee’s men and his usual messengerto London, when the foyne or thrust of the rapier of his opponent damaged his lefteye. The lad was now about seventeen, probably already entered at Christ Church,Oxford.Correspondence with friends in London, as Dr. Julio, a well- known physicianof the time, and Dr. Caesar (afterwards Sir Julius Caesar and Master of the Rolls),both of Italian origin, sometimes relieved the Warden’s tedious and tiresomedisputes with the Fellows, the tenants and the tithe owners of the college.To Caesar, as Master of the Requests, Dee wrote on October 2, 1596, on behalfof William Nicholson, about an action he had brought against two persons forenclosing moor and mine land at Reddish. Some idea of the lawless proceedings ofthe time may be gathered from Dee’s description of the injuries the plaintiff hadreceived in having his barns pulled down and his corn and hay, “to the quantitie ofa great number of loads, cast out of doors, which some of my family beheld.” Deeadds pointedly: “I shall be forced ere it be long to fly to your direction and help incauses Judiciall”; and ends by a reference to Caesar’s recent marriage, six monthsearlier, to a Manchester lady (Alice, daughterof Christopher Green): “God bless youand your new Joye.”Oliver Carter was more troublesome than ever, and lawsuits were institutedby the Warden both against him and George Birch, another of the Fellows. OnSunday, September 25, Dee writes: “Mr. Oliver Carter, his impudent and evidentdisobedience in the church.” There was evidently a scene, though not, as Mr.Halliwell has it, caused by Carter’s “dissoluteness in the church.” There was nohouse for the Warden, but the fines of the Fellows for absence were by the lastcharter to be devoted to its provision. If they did not pay, Dee had to meet the renthimself. At the beginning of 1598 there were four lawsuits on the Warden’s hands,but he records that he “stayed” them all, for one cause or another, one until Sir JohnByron returned. In Januaru the college gate and a large piece of the wall fell down at"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"midnight, so there were repairs to be made. He had a letter from John Pontoys, thefriend who had sent him twenty-one loads of Dantzic rye, very useful forconsumption. Another welcome contribution for domestic use arrived at this time,viz., “two lings and two haberdines from Mr. Harry Savill, from Lichefield.”Haberdines are dried and salted cod. He records an eclipse of the sun on February 25,with the comment that although it was a cloudy day there was great darkness abouthalf-past nine.In March, the entries in the diary end abruptly, and are not resumed again tillJune, 1600, a period of more than two years, of which there appears no record. Thetime was apparently spent in London or at Mortlake; the purpose of the journey wasno doubt to represent to the Privy Council or other authorities the terribly involvedstate of affairs in Manchester, where the college had become almost “no college.”CHAPTER XXIICOLLEGE AFFAIRS“I came among a people who relied much on dreams. And I told them exceptthey could distinguish between dream and dream they would mash or confound alltogether. For there were three sorts of dreams. For multitude of businesssometimes caused dreams; and there were whisperings of Satan in man in the nightseason; and there were speakings of God to man in dreams.”George Fox, JournalThe Warden was apparently absent from his charge at Manchester for twoyears and a quarter, between March, 1598, and June, 1600. When he resumed hisdiary to chronicle his return, it appeared that he had been very busy in London,arranging for a special commission to sit in the college chapter house, to inquireinto encroachments made upon the manor of Newton. His wife and two elder sons,Arthur and Rowland; Mary Nicholls, daughter of his old friend and pupil, FrancisNicholls; all travelled with him from London. What became of the youngerchildren we can only guess. The party set out on the 10th and arrived in Manchesteron June 18. Rowland was then seventeen, a Grammar School boy on BishopOldham’s foundation in Manchester. Early in the following December, he obtainedan exhibition at Oxford fromthe school. Dee, as Warden, was charged with certainofficial visits of inspection of the Grammar School, and was by no means alwayspleased with the reult. He says, for instance, on August 5 of this year, “I visited theGrammar Schole, and fownd great imperfections in all and every of the scholers, tomy great grief.” Of an earler visit he says it was “to see theower, &x., for Mr. Heton,” i.e., to see the clock.Dee had almost completed his seventy-third year, and had maintained hisbodily strength on the whole remarkably well. This summer he observed that forthe first time inhis life his pulse assumed the well-known symptom of intermittentbeating, or pulsation. With all his usual exactitude, he records that his pulse kepton missing a pulsation after the fifth, or the seventh, or eleventh beat, although itwas for the rest strong and equal. He mentions a great many sleepless nights.“Nocte Amaritudo mea,” “Circa mediam noctem Amaritudo mea,” are entries thatoccur with some frequency. On July 7, he says, “This morning, as I lay in my bed, it"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"came into my fantasy to write a boke: De differentiis quibusdam corporum etspirituum.” His views on this subject are again sometimes noted. If they are notabout books, they concerned that long-frustrated hope of his life, that he mightactually one day, and by no fraud or trickery, stumble on the secret which Kelley hadprofessed to know. By this time, Dee must have been assured of Kelley’s knavery,and yet his faith in the possibilities of alchemy remained unshaken to the end. “Ihad a dream after midnight,” he says, “of my enjoying and working of thephilosopher’s stone, with other. My dream was after midnight, toward day.” Alas!this pleasure he was never to enjoy in the flesh. Next night: “I dreamed that alongbetwene Aldgate and the postern on Tower Hill did men stand in a lane, with pikesin theyr hands, as though more should come to them, or that they wayted forsomebody. But theyr regard and looking was directly to Y Towre, where certeyngreat personages dyd stand; and one of them as upon a stage did declare with a loudvoice to the pikemen, matter of importance, very loud.”The description of the topography of his dream, given by this Londoner born,is very exact. The gate of Aldgate, taken down in 1606, was the eastern postern of theCity, not far from St. Botolph’s Curch. So the lane of pikemen was a very long one,or seems so to us, who know the distance covered with hundreds of buildings and anetwork of streets.There was little time now for him to devote to alchemy by day. His work layin a more practical direction: —“July 17. I willed the Fellows to com to me by nine the next day. July 18.They cam. It is to be noted of the great pacifications, unexpected of man, whichhappened this Friday; for in the fore-noone (betwene nine and ten) when theFellows were greatly in doubt of my heavy displeasure, bu reason of their manifoldmisusing of themselves against me, I did with all lenity interteyn them, and shewedthe most part of the things that I had brought to pass at London for the Colleg good;and told Mr. Carter (going away) that I must speak with him alone. Robert Legheand Charles Legh [the singing men] were by. Secondly, the great sute betweenRedich men and me was stayed, and by Mr. Richard Holland, his wisdom. Thirdly,the organs, uppon conditions, wer admitted. And fourthly, Mr. Williamson’sresignation granted, for a preacher to be gotten from Cambridge.”Richard Holland, of Reddish and Heaton House, was a man of some note inManchester, a feoffee of the Grammar School, and three or four times sheriff of thecounty. The “preacher gotten from Cambridge” to succeed the last unsatisfactorycurate was William Bourne, a Fellow of St. John’s. “July 31. We held our audit, Iand the Fellows, for the two yeres last past in my absence: Olyver Carter, ThomasWilliams and Robert Birch, Charles Legh, the elder, being receyver.” This entry inthe diary seems to make it plain that Dee was absent from Manchester during thewhole of the two years of which we have no account. In July, too, Dee records theloan of his second part of Holinshed’s Chronicle to Mr. Randall Kemp.In September, the commissioners appointed by the Bishop of Chester againmet, and called Dee before them in the church, “about thre of the clok after none,and did deliver to me certain petitions put up by the Fellows against me to answerbefore the 18th of this month. I answered them all eodem tempore; Yet they gaveme leave to write at leisure.” The commissioners were Richard Holland and"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"William Langley, both of whom we have met before, with the rector of Stockport,Richard Gerard. Things perhaps were set on a little better foundation for a time.Points of dispute were referred to the steward, Humphrey Davenport, “Counsayler,of Grays Inn,” and Oliver Carter, the contentious Fellow, died within three or fouryears.The last troublous years in Manchester must be briefly passed over, andindeed the material for them is scanty. Dee had to borrow money on more plate,“double gilt potts with cover and handells,” “bowles and cupps with handles,” fromEdmund Chetham, the high master of the Grammar School; and he had not beenable to redeem them when Chetham’s father and executor made his will in March,1603. He says in it that Dee delivered to his son “six severall parcells of Plate to bekept as a payne or pledge for the same [loan], which by reason of my saidexecutorshippe are now come into my possession,” and he wills the ten pounds lentupon them to his other sons Humfrey and Ralphe. When, if ever, the pieces wereredeemed, does not appear. Another valuable article — ”a silver salt, dubble gilt,with a cover, waying 14 oz.,” had to be deposited with Adam Holland in January1601, for a loan of five pounds for one year. Dee’s store of plate, though large, wasbeing heavily drained and irrevocably scattered in this way. The old man doubtlesssaw his treasures, the gifts of friends and patrons of half a century, disappear withfeelings of deep chagrin and disappointment, mingled with memories of pasttriumphs, and little light upon the future. A piece of the plate came to light at theTudor Exhibition in the New Gallery in 1890, when a silver cup, the property of Mrs.John Hookham Frere (said to be Dee’s great-great-niece), was exhibited. Writing ofthis cup to her son Bartle Frer, about the end of the eighteenth century, Mrs. Freresays, “My great thrice- great uncle, John Dee, because he was a wise man, was takenfor a conjurer. I have his silver cup now here with me, and you may drink of it, butI know no story in the family that he ever divined by it. It serves me here for asugar basan.” Evidently Mrs. Frere took an entirely rational view of the powersattributed to her famous ancestor.Perhaps in these sad days he looked back regretfully to the glorious visionsand promises made him by those angelic visitors inthe years when he and his skryerlived in the Courts of kings and emperors, and were consulted and deferred to asseers and wise men. Even the thoughts of suspicions harboured; of secret and openfoes, at home and abroad; the recollection of heart burnings and passionate sceneswith the incalculable Kelley, must have seemed dazzlingly brilliant as comparedwith these grey hopeless years. It is little wonder that he began to seek among hisassistants and friends another skryer, through whom he might renew someglimmer of the former days. Mr. Francis Nicholls, who had come to Mortlake in1593 to learn astrology, seems to have been tried. He was frequently with theWarden, and his daughter Mary stayed for two or three months with the Dees inManchester on their return from London. She would be a companion in age forKatherine, and the Warden tells how the two girls, his wife and himself, partook ofthe sacrament together on August 10, 1600. Bartholomew Hickman was moresuccessful as a medium than Mr. Nicholls, and yet at first not always to be trusted.Dee had learned by now to be very discriminating, and he found many of the“reports of sight and hering spirituall,” obtained through this skryer, so untrue thathe made a bonfire of all the writings on Michaelmas Day, before his wife; Mr.Nicholls; his brother, William Nicholls, and a Mr. Wortley. “A copy of the first"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"part, which was afterward fownd, was burnt before me and my wife.” Therevelations afterwards transmitted through Bartholomew were not so treated, andwere evidently considered by Dee to be genuine messages from the unseen. Hisvisitors left the next day after the Michaelmas bonfire, the Warden accompanyingthem on foot as far as Deansgate, where they parted. On his return home a surpriseawaited the old man.Dee’s servants, many of them, attached themselves to him for life, as we haveseen. They, at least, regarded him without suspicion. He was no invoker of devilsor conjurer of evil spirits to them. No master could be kinder, more gentle,considerate or more strictly honourable. In whatever straits he found himself, healways contrived to pay, and faithfull record in his diary the payment of, theirwages. We have seen how he writes to Sir Edward Dyer of their diet. It will beremembered that one of his early apprentices, Roger Cook, left him after fourteenyears, jealous that another man should be admitted to processes from which he wasexcluded. This was over twenty years ago, nor had his name ever been mentionedin the diary since. Now, Roger Cook reappeared in Manchester, quite unsought,offering and promising“his faithful and diligent care and help, to the best of his skill and powre, in theprocesses chymicall, and that he will rather do so than be with any in England;which his promise the Lord blesse and confirm! He told me that Mr. Anthony (hislate master) considered him very liberally and frendely, but he told him that he hadpromised me. Then he liked in him the fidelity of regarding such his promise.”A week or two later, on November 1, Dee writes that R.C. began to distil.Afterwards there seems to have been cause for suspicion that Roger had spread falsereports about his former employer, but the mistake was generously acknowledged;matters were cleared up, and peace once more reigned: —“Feb. 2. Roger Cook, his supposed plat laying to my discredit was by Arthur,my sone, fownd by chaunce in a box of his papers, in his own handwriting, circameridiem, and afternone about 1 1/2 browght to my knowledg face to face. All wasmistaken and we reconcyled godly. Feb. 5. O libera nos a malo. Feb. 10.Reconciliation between us, and I did declare to my wife, Katherine my dowghter,Arthur and Rowland, how things were mistaken.”In October, Sir George Booth, High Sheriff of Cheshire, came to Manchester tosee the steward of the college, Humphrey Davenport, of Gray’s Inn, about some ofthe college property in Cheshire, which he held. Booth had been knighted since hislast visit. After all parties had been interviewed, they came to a mutual agreementthat the Warden and Fellows would accept the arbitrament of the steward on thepoint in question, his decision to be delivered after the lawyer had paid his next visitto London. Davenport’s clerk, John Radclyffe, and Mr. Dumbell were at the collegeat the time, but Dee says “they hard not our agreement, we were in my diningroom.”He received a kind letter from the Bishop of Chester (Richard Vaughan),recommending Mr. Thomas Billings to him for a curacy. He does not say if thespiritual ministrations of Mr. Billings were accepted. The commissioners were still"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"sitting, and in November they made an award against Mr. James Ashton, ofChadderton, for holding the manor or property of Nuthurst while its title belongedto the college. There was a final scene with Oliver Carter in the college, before Mr.Birch, Robert and Charles Leigh. At the college audit on December 2, Dee wasallowed his portion of 7 pounds yearly for house rent up to the Michaelmas before.A grant was now made to Arthur of the chapter clerkship, but the holder, OwneHodges, was only going to relinquish it on condition of 6 pounds being paid for hispatent. So more silver had to be pledged to meet a loan.The last entry made by Dee in his diary is on April 6, 1601, when he made“Mr. Holcroft, of Vale Royall, his first acquaintance, at Manchester, by reason of Mr.William Herbert, his servant. He used me and reported of me very freely andworshiply.”For the concluding seven years of the old man’s life there are only a fewscanty outside records on which to rely, beside two or three fragmentary entriesprinted in the end of the Book of Mysteries. In such a practised and ready writer asour aged mathematician and astrologer, the failure to set down records seems tobetoken failing strength of both intellect and body.CHAPTER XXIIILAST DAYS“If I read aught in Heaven,Or Heaven write aught of fate, by what the stars,Voluminous or single charactersIn their conjunction met, give me to spell,Sorrows and labours, opposition, hateAttends thee; scorns, reproaches, injuries.” — Milton, Paradise RegainedA few days after the diary closes, Dee’s fourth son, Theodore, died. The boywas just over thirteen, perhaps at the Grammar School. Michael, we remember,had died at Mortlake seven years before, so the only sons left were Arthur andRowland, both now grown almost to man’s estate. Within about a year, Arthurmarried, and soon embarked on his successful career as a physician in London,Manchester, Moscow and Norwich, to which we can return later.Arthur’s wife was Isabella, daughter of Edmund Prestwich, Justice of thePeace, of Manchester, a member of a family whose name is perpetuated by a largedistrict of the town. The marriage took place in 1602, when Arthur was twenty-four,his bride just under twenty. The young couple settled with or near his parents atfirst, and Dee had the joy of seeing grandchildren grow up around him. Four ofArthur’s twelve children were born during the old man’s life, and he pleasedhimself by drawing a horoscope for two of these, Margarita 1603, and Jane 1605, onthe vellum leaves of a small square manuscript volume which still fills us withwonder at his boundless industry. It contains an anatomical drawing of the humanbody and tables of astrological signs for its different parts, aphorisms, studies ofmedicine, the actions of metals, and other hermetic notes. Arthur’s horoscope,drawn and expounded by his father in the same book, is sufficiently remarkable,"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"with its prophecy that he should have good fortune from a prince, and die abroad, aviolent death. In the centre of the figure, Arthur himself has added the words“sententia patris mei de mea nativitate erat. Magna bona cum multis malis.”Arthur only added one horoscope, that of his seventh child, Isabel, born 1614;otherwise, as they appeared almost annually (twelve in eighteen years), hecontented himself with simply writing names and dates on leaves of coarse paper,added to the beginning and end of his father’s little commonplace book, which hasbeen rebound roughly in cheap modern cloth.Beyond these events, there is nothing to tell of the next three years, which arewithout a single jotting of his own in any of his diaries; but the old prejudices andsuspicions must have revived in a very active and bitter form. The aged studentcould endure them less patiently than before. He had lost hope of outliving them;he had lost his Queen, who, though she had held out to him promises ofpreferment as unsubstantial as a mirage of the desert, had ever been friendly andkind; had constantly welcomed, nay, invited, him to her presence; and hadapparently maintained her faith in him to the last. Burleigh’s death in 1598, andnow the Queen’s, left him without patron and protector. Elizabeth died atRichmond on March 23, 1603, but Dee, presumably, was far away in Manchester, andnot near at hand at Mortlake, even had he been required. The course of themagnificent life was run, and no prognostications of her astrologer could put hopeinto the physicians and courtiers watching around that royal deathbed. The Queenwas seventy, and had reigned for fifty-three years.From King James there was nothing to be hoped for Dee, the man familiarwith occult sciences. The Scotsman felt himself a special expert on the subject ofwitches, demons and magic. Had he not attended the infamous trials of 1590 and1591? And was he not the author of a book intended to shatter the doubts of thosewho were still unconvinced of the infamy? He was aghast at the new andunorthodox views of apologists like Wier and Reginald Scot, and upon his accessionpromptly ordered The Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584), by the last named, to bepublicly burned. James’s Demonologie is a strange piece of reasoning, a plea, in fact,for the devil, with whom he seems to be on particularly intimate terms. “God’shangman” — that is the title awarded him — is, according to King James, able toreturn and reanimate any dead body. He announces his faith in the power ofconjurers to invoke the devil when they choose, and to invest others with his spirit.He adjures all pious people to unite in exterminating and utterly destroying allpersons so possessed: a somewhat unkind request, since he has previously allowedthat such objects of reprobation are permitted to exist in order that the godly may bewarned!The first Parliament of James met on March 19, 1604. On the 275h a new andmore stringent Act against Witchcraft was brought into the House of Lords. It wasreferred to the bishops, who discovered it was imperfect, and had a fresh one drawn.On June 9 the execrable Act that disfigured our statute book for 150 years becamelaw. This haste, it was supposed, was used to meet offences exposed by the Scottishtrials, now again evidently revived and much talked of in England. It is significantto remember that Shakespeare finished writing Macbeth in 1606. In what way Deefelt himself specially involved, unless by the publication, in 1603, of Harsnet’s tiradeagainst impostures and exorcists, it is hard to conjecture, but the times were ripe forhim to make, at this identical moment, a passionate appeal to the King and"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Parliament. On June 5 he presented to James, in the Palace at Greenwich, a petitioncouched in the strongest and most piteous terms that any man could devise.He urged upon the King“to cause your Highnesse said servant to be tryed and cleared of that horrible anddamnable, and to him most grievous and dammageable sclaunder, generally, andfor these many yeares last past, in this kingdom raysed and continued, by report andPrint against him, namely that he is or hath bin a conjurer or caller or invocator ofdivels.”He went on to relate how he had published many times his “earnestapologies against the slander [one we remember in his preface to Billingsley’s Euclidin 1570, and another, the letter to the Archbishop in 1595, he had republished in1599 and 1603], and yet this ungodly and false report, so boldly, constantly andimpudently avouched,” has been uncontrolled and unpunished for so many years;and, moreover, in spite of all, some writer, either a “malicious forraine enemy or anEnglish traytor to the flourishing State and Honor of the Kingdom,” on January 7,1592, had called him, John Dee, in print, “the conjuror of the Queen’s PrivyCouncil.” It seems, therefore, very needful that the suppliant shall be brought totrial, for the credit of the Lords of the Privy Council as well as for his own.“Therefore he offereth himself willingly to the punishment of Death, yea eyther tobe stoned to death, or to be buried quicke, or to be burned unmercifully, if by anydue, true, and just meanes, the name of conjuror, or caller, or invocator of Divels ordamned Sprites, can be proved to have beene or to be duely or justly reported andtold of him (as to have been of his doing) were true, as they have been told orreasonably caused any wondering among or to the many-headed multitude, or toany other whoseever else.”Dee’s sympathies were so strongly with the unfortunate, persecuted, so-calledwitches, that he was willing to throw in his lot with them and share the same fate.He ends this extraordinary petition with “a great and undoubted hope” that theKing will “soon redress his farder griefs and hindrances, no longer of him possiblyto be endured, so long hath his utter undoing, by little and little, beene mostunjustly compassed.”Following up this petition, the poor man, grown desperate, three days later(June 8) presented an address in verse to Parliament, begging them to pass “an ActGenerall against slander, with a special penal order for John Dee, his case.” He wasfar too much in earnest to be suspectedof any humorous intention, but a thought ofthe needful reformation such an Act might have wrought in the country by thistime cannot be suppressed. Certainly it would have been a more creditable piece oflegislation than the Act which afforded such wicked and cruel pretext for espionageand terrorism, and for putting unfortunate lunatics — called witches — to death byhanging, burning and stoning by a mob.It seems as if Dee’s ruined and beggared condition, the long procession ofdisappointments he had patiently borne, had entirely destroyed the sense ofproportion in his mind between personal and public affairs. Continual broodingover the thought of the neglect, the suspicion, that his undeniable talents hadundergone, the obstinate slander, ignorant incredulity, or flat denial of things inwhich he most truly put his faith, all distorted by his natural vanity and good"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"opinion, seems to have convinced him that his crushed and melancholy fate waslittle short of a national disaster. This feeling had become an obsession.There was unfortunately nothing in his halting verses to induce Parliamentto pay any heed to a tiresome old petitioner, a survival from the last century and thelast reign, who had outlived every contemporary inclined to believe in him, andwhose course was now nearly run.Nor did James respond in any way to his heartbroken petition. Robert Cecil,and all who wished to stand well with him, took their cue from the King, and Deein his old age was left forsaken and alone.The following is the address to Parliament: —“TO THE HONORABLE ASSEMBLIEOF THE COMMONS IN THE PRESENT PARLIAMENT.”“The Honor due unto you all,And reverence to you each one,I do first yeeld most speciall;Grant me this time to heare my mone.“Now (if you write) full well you may,Fowle sclandrous tongues and divelish hate,And help the truth to beare some swayIn just defence of a good Name.“In sundry sorts, this sclander great(Of conjurer) I have sore blamde:But wilfull, rash, and spiteful heat,Doth nothing cease to be enflamde.“Your helpe, therefore, by Wisdom’s lore,And by your Powre, so great and sure,I humbly crave, that never moreThis hellish would I shall endure.“And so your Act, with Honour greatAll Ages will hereafter prayse;And Truth, that sitts in Heavenly sear,Will in like case your comforts rayse.Most dutifully in all humilitie at your commandment, John Dee,servant and Mathematician to his most royall Majestie.An. 1604. Junij 8.”Dee’s good name was one of his dearest possessions, but he had long seen itshadowed and dimmed. Another treasure — his “painful” Jane — the wife whohad loyally cleaved to him through good and ill report, was to be the next of whichhe was to be bereft. She was so much his junior that he might reasonably haveexpected her to tend his declining years and to survive him. But it was thoroughly"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"in keeping with her unselfish character and devoted life that her death came as asacrifice to duty. In the spring of 1605, a terrible scourge of plague visitedManchester. She nursed her children safely through the epidemic, but fell a victimto it herself. She died and was buried on March 23 in the collegiate church of St.Mary. The old man had no heart to take up his pen and record her death. The barefact is all we know, from another source; and the fate of all Jane’s children, saveArthur, is wrapped in a like mystery. At her death, Jane was a month under fiftyyears old; the twenty-seven years of her married life had been crowded years, theone thought in them all to watche over and ward her great childlike, learned,marvellous husband and her children. Now she passed the task on to her daughterKate, who faithfully fulfilled it.A few fragments of angelic visions, which after nearly twenty years were onceagain vouchsafed, are all that remain to tell of th last two years of the old man’s life.Bartholomew Hickman was the skryer, and Dee was in London, “at Mrs.Goodman her house,” very ill. On March 20 and 29, Raphael appeared, to comforthim as regards his alarming symptoms of haemorrage, and bade him use themedical skill that God had given him. Dee, in utter dejection, owned that he wasbeaten in his “great attempt to make the council privy of my beggary, and to offerthe Earl of Salisbury such my duties as I may perfect to his account.” He was right tohope nothing from the great Burleigh’s little-minded son. Robert Cecil lackedalmost everything that had made William Cecil great, even a great sovereign toserve.In July Dee was again in London, this time staying in Westminster, at the“Three Kings” in King Street. Katherine was with him, his devoted daughter, nowa woman of twenty-six, apparently unmarried. Two companions or servants,Patrick Saunders and Thomas Turner, were in attendance. On the 9th, the angelRaphael came to the sad and broken old man of eighty, holiding out promises andhopes that seem cruelly delusive. But Dee was still wrapped in that inviolablearmour of faith or credulity that had already withstood so many severe shocks.Whether he now actually beheld Raphael, whether he still with his ears heard theangel’s voice, or whether only within his spiritual consciousness he felt the impulseand the message, is quite immaterial. But it is noticeable that there are now nodescriptions of Raphael as an apparition. The message is all he heeds. As he issinking slowly down into his grave from natural decay, there is a double andfigurative meaning to be read into the angel’s words. Raphael bade him first believethat his perishing bodily frame shall be restored and made sound, for, howeverreluctant he at his great age may feel, he is to go shortly on a long journey to friendsbeyond the sea, where the secrets of wisdom, the philosopher’s stone, the book of St.Dunstan, and “that Jewel that was delivered,” shall be made known to him. He isnot to go alone, for his good friend, John Pontoys, will come from Dantzic to be hisstay and helper. “Therefore set thy things in order for thy Wardenship, and all thyother worldly affairs, as shortly as thou canst, by all means possible.” He is not tomistrust because of his physical weakness, for he shall have long life like Hezekiah,and instead of living in want or beholden to those who love him not, he shall beprovided for where he shall be able to do God service. He shall enjoy fame andmemory to the end, and Raphael will accompany him, as he did the young Tobias,on his journey. Perhaps Dee remembered the mystical words of Gabriel, used tohim at Cracow in April of 1584, —"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"“Happy is he that hath his skirts tied up and is prepared for a journey, for theway shall be open unto him, and in his joynts shall there dwell no wearinesse. Hismeat shall be as the tender dew, as the sweetness of a bullock’s cud. For unto themthat have shall be given, and from them that have not shall be taken away. Forwhy? The burr cleaveth to the willow stem, but on the sands it is tossed as a featherwithout dwelling. Happy are they that cleave unto the Lord, for they shall bebrought unto the storehouse, and be accounted and accepted as the ornaments of hisbeauty.”[The old man penned on a slip of paper some notes to aid his failing memorywhen next he should see his instructor. In two days, on July 11, he was able to putthe questions.What country shall he go to?The answer is, where he will. “Thou hast been a great traveller, and it isreferred to thy own choice,” subject to divine approval. Dee suggets Germany, andreceives consent.Whom shall he take with him besides John Pontoys? What about hisdaughter Katherine, and the young man, Patrick Saunders?The answer is very emphatic. It shows how dependent the old man hadbecome upon this elder daughter of his old age. “John Dee, thou of thyself dost bestknow that without thy daughter, thou canst not be without her.”Certainly he could not part from Katherine, even with Pontoys as his“speciall comfort and aid,” and the “honest and well-disposed young man,”Saunders, who had been sent on purpose to go with him.What about books and appurtenances? Is Mr. Bardolf to go? What shallArthur do in his intended travel? “Shall I ever return to England, and shall I keep atitle to enjoy my house when I do return?” Will the King grant a licence, or will itnot be another disappointment, like so many that have gone before?It is all a vain and illusory and impossible chimera. The only journey left forthe old man to take was the one to “that undiscovered bourne from whence notraveller returns.” Still, the wonderful visions perhaps brought him ecstatic hours.His brain was yet strong and clear, less worn out than his body, but like all oldpeople, he lived over again and loved to dwell upon the past. A few days later hesat talking after dinner to Bartholomew “of divers my doings with Mr. Kelley.” Hehad forgotten little of these dazzling experiences, and perhaps to while away thetime he read his precious diaries over and over again. But of later events hismemory was failing: “I asked Bartholomew if he had ever seen my jewel that wasbrought since it was set in gold [this had been done more than twenty years before],and he thought that he had not seen it.” Surely tactful politeness on Bartholomew’spart. “Whereupon I went speedily to my chest, unlocked it, and took it out, andundid the case and set the stone in his due manner.”Soon Raphael appeared in the stone, and Dee heard his voice, promising thatthe powder (i.e., Kelley’s powder) which he was keeping — ”the which thou dostmake account of as no better but dust” — should be turned to its right use.Is it possible that the old belief in the golden secret had at last been killed?The powder was now but dust, as the old man would soon become, and as all hisfixed dreams of projection had ever been."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The last entry in the spiritualistic diary was made on September 7, 1607, butwhether Dee was at Mortlake or in London cannot be said. Pontoys had arrived. Hewas anxious to know if he would be thought fit to serve Dee in Bartholomew’sabsence. Also he earnestly desired to know his guardian angel, and he would fainhear also “the end of the Polish troubles.”Captain Langham, it is hoped, is going to lend 100 pounds; if not, Pontoys willset to work “to win some help for money by distillations and alchemicalconclusions.” Poverty is again stretching her gaunt fingers over this fond dreamerof gold. He had missed his “silver double gilt bell salt” and many other things fromhis house. He is “bereaved of his own goods.” The truth was that Arthur hadsecretly taken them away to sell or pawn, in order to provide necessities for thefamily. Dee has been expecting a sum of money from the Emperor Rudolph, howmuch he does not know. But Raphael tells him to “let it go and speak no further ofit. The Emperor of all emperors will be thy comfort. Thou hast no more need ofhim [Rudolph], only to keep good will and friendship betwixt him and thee.”[ThenRaphael fades into the eternal invisible, and the last word of the angelic visions iswritten.In the private diary, kept in the almanack from Venice throughout this lastyear, there is little beside the bare stroke marking the months off into weeks, as wasDee’s usual habit. The strokes are continued beyond the month of his death,December, 1608. The last written entry is on December 19, and is almost illegible. Itis in the old man’s hand and appears to read “tonitrum a Corrfe.”On which day at the death of the old year, Dee’s spirit joined those others thathad always been so near to him, we do not know, or on what precise date he wasburied in the chancel of the church standing so close to the house at Mortlake whichhad been his home for thirty years. The parish registers for five years are missing,and the stone which Aubrey says marked his grave has long since disappeared.Fifty years later, John Aubrey talked to Goodwife Faldo, an old woman ofeighty who had known him, and was shown a slab from which the brass haddisappeared. She said that her mother had tended him in his sickness before hedied in his own house inMortlake, “next the house where the tapestry hangings aremade.” Evidently his last days were passed in the cottage which he had purchasedmany years before to add to the larger house, inherited from his mother. The oldwoman’s gossip was interesting to Aubrey, for he was a grandson of Dee’s cousinand neighbour, Dr. William Aubrey, the Master of Requests who had helped Dee tothe Manchester post. She was full of marvellous stories, of course, for Dee’sreputation for “magic” was impelled to survive him. But they were harmlessstories enough: he had “layed a storm for Sir Everard Digby”; he had recovered abasket of clothes which she as a girl, and one of his younger daughters of her ownage, had negligently lost together; he had bidden a butler who had lost his master’splate on a boat coming down from London by water to go back on a certain day, andhe would see the man who had taken the wrong basket by exchange: the butler haddone so and had found his plate; he had told a woman that she laboured under theevil tongue of an ill neighbour; he would not recover some lost horses, though hewas offered several angels. He used to distil egg-shells, and kept a great many stillsgoing. He had given and built the gallery to the church at Mortlake, and GoodyFaldo’s father was the carpenter that worked on it. “He was a great peacemaker, and"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"if any of the neighbours fell out, he would never let them alone till he had madethem friends.” “A mighty good man he was.”The old woman remembered that he entertained the Polish ambassador notlong before he died, and showed to him the eclipse of the sun, in a dark room. Shecould call to mind the stone upon his grave: it was between the tombstones of twoother servants of Queen Elizabeth, Mr. Holt and Mr. Miles, upon both of whichwere brasses. The children, she said, dreaded him because he was accounted aconjurer, and yet whenever they strayed into the church, they would run straight toplay upon his gravestone. There were steps at the upper end of the chancel when hewas buried, but the minister laid them plain in Olver’s days, and then the stone thatcovered Dr. Dee was removed. She could recall his appearance: a man tall andslender, clad in a gown like an artist’s gown, with hanging sleeves and a slit.These garrulous reminiscences give us a picture of the old philosopher’s endmore valuable than any mere formal entry of the date. Some day, however, it maybe possible to recover that.Meanwhile, Dee’s memory may be entrusted to the kinder judges of to-day,who will be more charitable because more enlightened and less impregnated withsuperstition. They may see in him a vain, presumptuous and much deludedperson, but at any rate they must acknowledge his sincere and good intentions; hispersonal piety; his uncommon purity of thought and mind. If, in his thirst forknowledge of the infinite unknowable, he pushed back the curtain farther than waswise or justifiable, did he harm any one’s reputation beside his own? Did he notsuffer all the penalty in his own miserable failure, so far as comfort and prosperityin material things were concerned? In all the vague hopes held out by him toQueen, Princes and Emperors, of enriching them through his alchemical skill, hewas no conscious charlatan, playing a part to lure them on, but a devout believer inman’s power and purpose to wrest scientific secrets from the womb of the future.Can we look back upon the discoveries of three hundred years and feel his certaintywas vain? The powers of electricity, the training to our uses that marvellous andlong concealed agency and light; the healing virtues of radium, should be worthmore to us than much manufactured gold.APPENDIX ITHE DESCENDANTS OF JOHN DEEWhen the aged mathematician died at Mortlake in 1608 he left to survivehim five or six out of his eight children. Michael, born at Prague, had died on hisfather’s birthday in 1594. Theodore, born at Trebona, died at Manchester 1601.Arthur and Rowland were left. Katherine was his companion to the end. The threeyounger girls, Madinia, Frances and Margaret, had, for anything we know, survivedthe plague which was so fatal to their mother, but there is no trace of either of themafter that event in March, 1606. Aubrey, indeed, did hear from Goody Faldo of adaughter, whose name he thinks was Sarah, married to a flax dresser ofBermondsey. Dee had no daughter Sarah, and Aubrey does not suggest a name forthe problematic husband.Arthur, the eldest son, we have followed through a childhood of accidents tohis selection and setting apart with a solemn rite to be his father’s “skryer” in the"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"magic crystal, in the eighth year of his age. We have traced the failure of that ill-advised choice, and have seen the lad of thirteen sent off to Westminster Schoolwith a little trunk and his mother’s blessing. The next events in his life recorded byhis father are his being wounded by a foyne while fencing with Edward Arnold, andthe grant of the chapter clerkship of Manchester, in 1600.He married in 1602, lived for a while in Manchester, and began practisingmedicine. Wood says he spent some time at Oxford, but his name has so far notbeen found in any college admissions. In his will he is described as “Doctor ofPhysic.” Probably he took his degree abroad. His marriage to Isabella Prestwich,daughter of a well-known Manchester justice of the peace, took place when he wastwenty-two, and it is to be presumed that he continued living on in Manchesteruntil his father left that city some time in 1605 or 1606, after the sad death of hiswife. Arthur set up a practice in London some time about that year, althoughprecise dates are not obtainable. He seems to have followed the common usage ofhanging outside his door a list or “table” of medicines, and their excellenttherapeutic properties, which were said to effect certain cures of several diseases.This attracted the attentio of the censors appointed by the Royal College ofPhysicians, who proceeded against him forthwith, under the powers granted themagainst empiricks, which they had exercised since the foundation of the College inthe early years of Henry VIII. The learned members of the college esteemed this“crime” such an “intolerable cheat and imposture,” that they summoned ArthurDee to appear before them with his remedies that they might impose a due penaltyupon his presumption. The rest of the story is unrelated, and we cannot say whatfine or order was his reward.He seems, either through inflence or talent, to have made his mark as adoctor. In July, 1614, he was recommended by the Archbishop of Canterbury and theLord Chancellor to be elected physician of Thomas Sutton’s newly founded hospital,the Charterhouse, and we may presume the appointment was made. In May, 1627,Charles I. recommended him as physician to the Emperor of Russia, and in June itwas agreed to send letters out by him or his agent, the stipulation being made thathe must sail at once, “or not have passage this year.”He took up his abode at Moscow, if not in the splendour and riches offered tohis father, at least sufficiently provided for to maintain his huge family in comfort.Four or five of his twelve children died in infancy; the complete list of them, asgiven in his father’s book of horoscopes in the British Museum, is as under: —MargaretbornApril 4, 1603.Jane“March 31, 1605.John“July 24, 1606 (died).Arthur“March 16, 1608.Maria“February 24, 1612.Rowland“September 8, 1613.Isabel“September 5, 1614.Frances“October 25, 1615.William“August 27, 1617.John“March 30, 1619.EdmundbaptisedAugust 27, 1620.buriedSeptember 23, 1621."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"AnnabornJanuary 15, 1622.Arthur’s wife, Isabella Dee, died July 24, 1634. About this time he returned toEngland and settled in Norwich, near his friend, Sir Thomas Browne, who was thenbusily engaged in writing down the ethical and theological conclusions which hecalled the Religio Medici. Browne was, of course, the younger man. Writing in1658, a few years after Arthur’s death, to Elias Ashmole, Sir Thomas tells of themany talks about the doings of Dee and Kelley that he had with “my familiar friend,sonne unto old Doctor Dee, the mathematician,” who had “lived many years anddied in Norwich.” Browne sent to Ashmole “the scheme of Arthur’s nativity,erected by his father, Dr. John Dee,” a copy from the original, made by Arthurhimself, with comments added by a Moscow astrologer, Franciscus Murrerus.Dr. Arthur, in spite, or perhaps because, of his early environment, retaineduntil his dying day a devout belief in the possibilities of alchemy to make projectionor transmutation. He had grown up in the fixed idea that the ever-exclusive secretwould soon be found out. In fact, he was persuaded that divers workers had indeeddiscovered the art. The child of seven or eight, who had played with quoits orplaythings, which he understood had been turned into gold upon the premises, waslikely to retain this conviction. To doubt it would be to cast a slur upon his father’smemory. Of Kelley his recollections — the recollections of a boy under nine —could be but dim and hazy, untouched with any possible scepticism or criticaljudgment. After the February day when Kelley rode off to Prague in 1588, neitherArthur or his father had ever set eyes on this adventurer again.He had succeeded in convincing his old friend of the truth of theserecollections, for Browne writes of him as “a persevering student in hermeticallphilosophy, who had no small encouragement, having see projection made, andwith the highest asseverations he confirmed unto his death that he had ocularly,undeceivably and frequently beheld it in Bohemia. And to my knowledge, had notan accident prevented, he had, not many years before his death, retired beyond thesea and fallen upon the solemn process of the great work.”Continuing the correspondence six months later, when additional matterrises to mind, Sir Thomas writes again to Ashmole, in 1675, with more particularsof the “solemn process.”“I was very well acquainted with Dr. Arthur Dee, and at one time or anotherhe has given me some account of the whole course of his life. I have heard thedoctor say that he lived in Bohemia with his father, both at Prague and in otherparts. That Prince or Count Rosenberg was their great patron, who delighted muchin alchemie. I have often heard him affirme, and sometimes with oaths, that hehad seen projection made, and transmutation of pewter dishes and flaggons intosilver, which the goldsmiths at Prague bought of them. And that Count Rosenbergplayed at quoits with silver quoits made by projection as before. That thistransmutation was made by a powder they had, which was found in some old place,and a book lying by it containing nothing but heiroglyphicks; which book his fatherbestowed much time upon, but I could not hear that he could make it out. He saidalso that Kelley dealth not justly by his father, and that he went away with thegreatest part of the powder, and was afterwards imprisoned by the Emperor in acastle, from whence attempting to escape down the wall, he fell and broke his leg,and was imprisoned again. That his father, Dr. John Dee, presented Queen Elizabeth"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"with a little of the powder, who having made trial thereof, attempted to get Kelleyout of prison, and sent some [persons] to that purpose, who, giving opium in drinkunto the keepers, laid them so fast asleep that Kelley found opportunity to attemptan escape; and there were horses readie to carry him away; but the businessunhappily succeeded as is before declared. Dr. Arthur Dee was a young man [he wasa boy of eight] when he saw this projection made in Bohemia, but he was soinflamed therewith that he fell early upon that study, and read not much all his lifebut books of that subject; and two years before his death, contracted with oneHunniades, or Hans Hanyar, in London, to be his operator. This Hans Hanyarhaving lived longin London and growing in yhears, resolved to return intoHungary. He went first to Amsterdam, where he was to remain ten weeks, till Dr.Arthur came to him. the Dr. to my knowledge was serious in this businesse andhad provided all in readiness to go, but suddenly he heard that Hans Hanyar wasdead.”During his residence in Moscow, Arthur compiled a book of alchemical notesand extracts, which was published at Paris in 1631 under the title of FasciculasChemicus, etc. Ashmole, among his early enthusiastic labours upon alchemicalauthors prosecuted under the name of “James Hasolle,” translated this into Englishin 1650. While the book was at press in the beginning of the year, he wrote toArthur, apparently as a stranger, informing him of his occupation, and putting atthe same time a question or two upon his father’s books.Arthur’s reply, dated Norwich, January 31, 1649 [50], now in the BodleianLibrary, begins by expressing regret that “you or any man should take plains totranslate any book of that nature into English, for the art is vilified so much alreadyby scholars that daily do deride it, in regard they are ignorant of the principles. Howthen can it any way be advanced by the vulgar? But to satisfie your question, youmay be resolved that he who wrote Euclid’s Preface was my father. The Fasciculus, Imust cofess, was my labour and work.” He ends by saying that he will be in Londonthat day week, and if Ashmole wants to see him, he may hear of him in Butler’sCourt at the end of Lombard Street, at his son Rowland Dee’s warehouse. Thewriting, and especially the signature of this letter, are good testimonies to the carebestowed by William Camden of Westminster School on the boy’s handwriting. Hisfather, as we remember, had asked for special supervision of the roman hand, sincematter, poor in itself, but set down in a good style, did, in his opinion, often receivemore attention than good material badly written and expressed.Browne had received from Arthur a complete catalogue of all his father’swritings, both finished and intended. But there was one not included, viz., theBook of Mysteries. Sir Thomas, writing in 1675, says he never heard him say oneword of “the Book of Spiritts sett out by Dr. Casaubone, which if hee had knowne Imake no doubt butt hee would have spoake of it unto mee, for he was veryinquisitive after any manuscripts of his father’s, and desirous to print as many as hecould possibly obtain.” He goes on to say that Arthur understood that Sir WilliamBoswell, the English Resident in Holland, owned a number of Dee’s MSS., which hehad collected and kept in a trunk in his Dutch home. Boswell refused manyapplications from Arthur for leave to print some of these, which the famousmathematician’s son considered should not be locked up from the world. Boswellannounced his intention of printing them himse, which of course he never did."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Nor did the Book of Spirits see the light of day during Arthur’s lifetime.Perhaps had Casaubon appealed to him as Ashmole had done, it would never havebeen issued at all. A son would certainly have remonstrated against thisrevelations, this tearing down the veil from the inner tabernacle of his father’s soul.Arthur died in the autumn of 1651, eight years before Casaubon published hisbook. He made his will on September 17, describing himself as Doctor of Physick, ofthe city of Norwich, and leaving a small legacy of twenty shillings to the poor of theparish of St. George Tombland, in which he had lived.Only three sons out of his seven, and three daughters of the six ar named inthe will, all the others being dead, unless it was Arthur, the eldest, who had been amerchant in Amsterdam. There is a legacy of twenty pounds to his wife.The second son, Rowland, was established, as we have seen, in LombardStreet as a merchant. To him Arthur had already had already given his father’sportrait, now in the Ashmolean Museum and reproduced as the Frontispiece to thisbook; and a painted coat of arms. Sir Thomas Browne, who had often seen it, speaksof an addition made to the coat by grant of the Emperor Rudolph in the shape of amathematical figure; probably the delta which Dee always used for his name in thespiritual diary. To Rowland’s wife there is a legacy of twenty pounds.“To John Dee, my youngest son,” Arthur left one hundred pounds and hisgold seal ring with the coat of arms cut in a sapphire. John was a Russia merchant.There is no mention of his eldest child and daughter, Margaret, who is said tohave married another Russia merchant named Abraham Ashe.To three sons-in-law, “my son Grymes;” “my son Anguish” (this was thehusband of his youngest child, Anne); and “my son Fowell,” he leaves respectively aplush coat; a saddle and pistol; and a black gown and plush suit.To each of his three daughters, their wives (none of them mentioned byname), he gives 20 pounds; and to the two elder, his two iron-barred sealskin trunkswith long cushions and foot carpets, feather bed, blankets, bolsters and coverlets. Heappoints his friend John Toley, of Norwich, his executor, and gives him his watchand silver chain, with a square box of cypress wood, double-leafed, with drawers.His servant, John Sergeant, is to have all the contents of his extensive wardrobe,consisting of his coloured cloth suit and and cloak; black suit and cloak lined iwthrough bayes (Norwich was the seat of the bay and say industry); his winter pair ofboots, and two pairs of summer boots; his “hatts;” his “stokins whatsoever;” hisblack satin doublet; shirts; six of his “worst-falling bands and ruffs;” and fortyshillings due for wages at the Michaelmas following.Arthur Dee died before October 16 of the same year, 1650, when the will wasproved by John Toley.Rowland, Arthur’s fourth son, married and died in 1687, when his wife wasexecutrix of his will. Rowland’s sons by this wife Jane (d. 1698) were Rowland, bornMarch 25, 1646, married October, 1675; Elizabeth Gardiner of Aldersgate (d.September, 1698); and Duncan, born November 3, 1657. Both were educated atMerchant Taylors’ School on the Bishop of Peterborough’s foundation (see below).Duncan went on to St. John’s College, Oxford, and entered the legal profession. Hewas chosen Common Serjeant of London in 1700. He defended Dr. Sacheverell forfour days of his trial in the House of Lords in 1710; died in 1720, and was buried inSt. Mary Aldermanbury. By his wife Mary (d. Stoke Newington, March 24, 1728) heleft a son Henry (d. 1725), others having died young."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"David Dee, born in Shropshire, of St. Mary’s Hall, Oxford, rector of St.Bartholomew the Great, Smithfield, 1587 — 1605, is said to have been a grandson ofBedo Dee. If so, he must have been either brother or cousin of John Dee ofMortlake, who, strange to say, alludes nowhere in his diary to any relation of thename of Dee, although he speaks often of his Welsh kinsfolk, and of his cousinAubrey. As he died at Mortlake in 1608, aged eighty and a half, David, whosurvived him twelve years, must have been his junior. David Dee was deprived ofSt. Bartholomew, “for what,” says Newcourt, “I know not”; but he was brought backthere to be buried on February 3, 1620. By his wife Martia, daughter of John Rogers,David Dee had three sons, of whom Francis, the eldest, was educated at MerchantTaylors’ School and St. John’s College, Cambridge. He entered the Church, heldvarious livings in London and elsewhere, and four years before his death wasconsecrated Bishop of Peterborough. By his will (dated May 28, 1638), he gave hisrectory of Pagham, Sussex, to found two fellowships and two scholarships in St.John’s College, one of which was to be held for ever by “one of my kindred or of myname, from either Merchant Taylors’ School, London, or from PeterboroughSchool.” We have seen that two of John Dee’s great grandchildren were sent toMerchant Taylors’, and one, Duncan, proceeded to St. John’s, probably on thisfoundation. The Bishop’s eldest son, Adrian Dee, Canon of Chichester, diedunmarried, but his younger sons, John and Daniel, left descendants.APPENDIX IIBIBLIOGRAPHYThe principal authorities for Dee’s Life are his own Diaries, already frequentlycited in the foregoing pages, viz.: —(1) The Private Diary. The original notes comprising this are in two 4toalmanacks in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, numbered Ashmolean MSS. 487, 488.They were transcribed and printed for the Camden Society (1842), with numerousomissions, by Mr. J.O. Halliwell [-Phillipps]. The Manchester portion of this Diary,covering the years 1595-1601, was edited with much local knowledge and care by Mr.J. Eglington Bailey, and privately printed; only twenty copies (1880). Mr. Bailey alsoreprinted from Notes and Queries (May, 1879) his paper on Dee and theSteganographia of Trithemius.(2) The Spiritual Diary, or Liber Mysteriorum, divided by Dee into separatebooks, each dealing with a special epoch. The first five books, with an appendix tothe fifth — dating in all from December 22, 1581, to May 23, 1583 — are comprised inSloane MSS. 3188, at the British Museum. The remaining books, actually twelve butnot consecutively numbered, were printed by Dr. Meric Casaubon in The True andFaithful Relation, etc., 1659, fol. Three of them are entitled “Libri Mystici ApertoriiCarcoviensis Sabbatici”; three “Mysteriorum Pragensium Confirmatio”; and the twolast “Liber Resurectionis” and “Mysteriorum divinorum memorabilia.” This endson May 23, 1587. About a dozen pages of occurrences taking place in 1607 are printedby Casaubon at the end of his book, from stray papers.Dee’s autobiographical Compendious Rehearsall ranks next in importance.The original MS. was partly burned in the fire in the Cottonian Library, but atranscript made by Dr. Thomas Smith (author of a life of Dee, see below) was printed"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"by Hearne inthe Appendix to Johannis Glastoniensis Chronicon (Oxford, 1726). Thisprinted version was collated with Ashmole’s transcript of the original (AshmoleanMs. 1788), and edited by James Crossley for the Chetham society, in AutobiographicalTracts of Dr. John Dee, Warden of the College of Manchester, 1851. In his preface,the editor promises another volume of correspondence and selections of Dee, whichnever appeared.The Latin life of Dee, Vitae Eruditissimorum et Illustrium Virorum, by Dr.Thomas Smith (1707); the article in the Biographia Brittanica, edited by Kippis (1778,etc.), largely based upon the foregoing, and upon Strype;s Annals (1725, etc.); someaccount in Wood’s Athenae Oxoniensis (Bliss), i. 639, 640, and Fasti, i. 143; in Foxe’sActs and Monuments, ed.

Clark (1898); and A Treatise of Religious andLearned Men (1656), by Edward Leigh, are further sources. For the Manchester years,Hibbert and Ware’s Foundations of Manchester (1833) is useful; and for Dee’sdescendants, see a General Account of Families derived from Bedo Dee, by H.B.Wilson (1815) and his History of Merchant Taylors’ School (1812-14). Later writerswho have descanted more or less at large upon the romantic episodes of Dee’spartnership with Kelley, as apart from any other achievement ofhis long life, areWilliam Godwin, in his History of the Necromancers (1834); Charles Mackay,Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions (1841); Isaac Disrael, Amenities ofLiterature (1841); W.

The consummate description of JohnInglesant’s tragic and pregnant vision of his brother’s murder, seen before hand inthe crystal, as related by J.H. Shorthouse, will occur to everyone.Dee’s own writings were extraordinarily numerous. In his Rehearsall heenumerated forty-nine. There is a list of seventy- nine in Cooper’s AthenaeCantabrigensis, vol. ii., pp. 505-509; but some of these are doubtful: e.g., No. 66,Treatise of the Rosicrucian Secrets, etc.; for the Rosicrusians only came intoexistence about the time of Dee’s death. Others are but notes from amongAshmole’s manuscripts. One (No. 75) is the horoscope or nativity of Kelley, drawnor erected by Dee, which Ashmole has printed in his Theatrum (p. 479). To add toMr. Cooper’s list there are some Latin verses in Henry Perry’s Egluryn Phraethineb(1595).All the printed books by Dee are extremely rare. There is much informationabout them in Ames, Typographical Antiquities (e.d Herbert). Copies of thirteen arein the British Museum Library, including those of other writers to which hecontributed prefaces, additions and notes, as Recorde’s Grounde of Arts (manyeditions); Billingsley’s Euclid; Roger Bacon’s de Secretis operibus artis et naturae, etc.and various Ephemerides.

The petitions addressed to the House of Commons and theKing are printed on broadsides (1604). There are also three copies of Casaubon’sTrue Relation in the British Museum, one of them collated with the original MS. byWilliam Shippen, of Stockport, 1683.No adequate idea of the remarkable doings of Dee and Kelley over the crystalcan be entertained without a study of Dee’s manuscript “Book of Enoch” in SloaneMSS., 663, 120, and 2,599, 1-45; and his “Claves Angelicae,” 3191 in the samecollection. the diagrams of complicated arrangement of letters and figures, theirneatness of execution, mathematical precision and etymological intricacy are no lessamazing than the clear bold text in which the descriptions are written in printinghand. Regretfully it was decided not to reproduce an example, owing to the lack ofpictorial value.The Portrait of Dee, now in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, reproduced asFrontispiece to this volume, was painted when he was 67; it belonged to hisgrandson, Rowland Dee, and at his death it passed to the possession of EliasAshmole and was by him bequeathed to the University of Oxford.
