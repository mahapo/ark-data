Page numbersrefer to Clay Holden’s transcription; taking Page 1 as the first page of Dee’s text after theAnno 1581:1582 Mysteriorum Liber Primus title page.)Page 1Praeter alias meas extemporaneas preces, et ejaculationes ad Deum vehementiores: Haecuna, maxime usitata fuitOratio mea Matutina, Vespertinaque: pro Sapientia.Among my other extemporaneous prayers and most fervent outpourings to God:this one was most customarily used. My Morning and Evening Prayer: forwisdom.In nomine Dei Patris, Dei Filii, Dei Spiritus Sancti AmenIn the name of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost. Amen“In Nomine Dei Patris...”Dee implies (here and elsewhere) that he started all his Actions with the prayers on this page. Thisparticular phrase is the standard Western Christian formula for marking the ritual start of anOffice, Service, or other ceremony or rite. It is also used within a service to mark a change offocus or as a section boundary. As an example of the former, it is used at the start of the Mass,and after it is said the priest is instructed to ignore anything else going on in the church, even theelevation of the Host at another Mass. As an example of the latter, it is used in the Anglican rite tointroduce the sermon or homily.Omnipotens, Sempiterne, vere, et vive Deus, in adiutorium meum intende: DomineDominantium, Rex Regum, Jeovah Zebaoth, ad adiuvandum me festina:Gloria Deo, Patri, Filio, et spiritui Sancto: Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper et insaecula saeculorum: Amen.Almighty, Everlasting, True and Living God, make haste to deliver me. Lord ofLords, King of Kings Jehovah Zebaoth, make haste to help me.Glory be to God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is nowand forever, world without end: Amen.Translator’s Note: ‘semper et in saecula saeculorum” is generally given in English translations as“forever, world without end” or “for ever and ever.” Literally, it is “always, unto an Age ofAges”, and is done in imitation of a Hebrew idiom.“Omnipotens...Amen”Christian communal life (monastic and secular) was, until the Reformation, built around the Daily(or Divine) Office, a series of eight liturgical services centered on the recitation of psalms andprayers. It was also common for individuals to structure their private devotions around parts ofthe Office.Almost every service of the Daily Office opened with the psalm verse “Deus ad adiuvandum mefestina”, followed by the lesser doxology. (The exception was Matins, the first service of the day,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"where “Deus ad adiuvandum” usually came as the second element.) See the notes below fordetails of the psalm and the doxology.The elaboration of the simple biblical “God” to a longer list of names and attributes is a cabbalisticpractice, detailed by Reuchlin and Agrippa. See, for example, the works cited in the discussionsof PELE and NA later in Liber Primus.The daily office ended with a simple “Benedicamus Domino” (“Let us bless the Lord.”) EveryAction in Liber Primus is closed with a more elaborate blessing (e.g. the doxology, Soli Deohonor omnis, “Glorie, thanks, and honor be unto the Almighty Trinitie”, etc.)Thus, Dee not only marked out his ritual time and space using the same formula a religious servicewould use (see note on “In nomine” above), but also began the Actions with the standardintroductory formula from the daily cycle of prayer and devotion, and ended each one with anelaboration of the traditional closing.“Ad adiuvandum me festina” – Ps 69:2 (Vulgate), Ps 70:1 (English Bibles)Vulgate ex Septuaginto: Deus in adiutorium meum intende Domine ad adiuvandum me festina;Vulgate ex Hebraeo: Deus ut liberes me, Domine ut auxilieris mihi festinaBCP: Haste thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to helpe me, O Lord.Geneva Bible: O god, haste thee to deliver me: make haste to helpe me, O Lord.KJV: Make haste, O god, to deliver me; make haste to help me O LORD“Gloria...”This is the short doxology, generally used after psalms, hymns, and canticles. Generally, though,it begins “Gloria Patri” rather than “Gloria Deo, Patri.”Recte sapere, et intelligere doceto me, (o rerum omnium Creator,) Nam Sapientia tua,totum est, quod volo: Da verbum tuum in ore meo, (o rerum omnium Creator,) etsapientiam tuam in corde meo fige.Teach me to know aright and to understand (O Creator of all things) for thywisdom is all that I desire. Give thy word in my mouth (O Creator of all things)and fix thy wisdom in my heart.“Fige”Note that figo is also the word used for driving nails.O Domine Jesu Christe (qui sapientia vera es, aeterni et Omnipotentistui Patri) humilime tuam oro Divinam Majestatem, expeditummihi ut mittere digneris, alicuius pii, sapientis expertiquie, Philosophiauxilium, ad illa plenissime intelligenda perficiendaque, quae maximivaloris erunt ad tuam laudem et gloriam amplificandam: Et siMortalis nullus iam in terris vivat, qui ad hoc munus aptus sit: velqui ex aeterna tua providentia, ad istud mihi praestandum beneficiumassignatus fuerit: Tunc equidem humilime, ardentissime et constan-tissime a tua Divina Majestate requiro, ut ad me de caelis mitteredigneris bonos tuos Spirituales Ministros, Angelosque, videlicet Mi=chaelem, Gabrielem, Raphaelem ac Urielem: et (ex Divino tuofavore) quoscunque, alios, veros, fidelesque tuos Angelos, qui me pleneet perfecte informent et instruant, in cognitione, intelligentiaque"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"vera et exacta, Arcanorum et Magnalium tuorum (Creaturs omnestuas, illarumque naturas, proprietates, et optimos usus, concernentium)et nobis Mortalibus scitu necessariorum; ad tui nominis laudem,honorem, et gloriam; et ad solidam meam, aliorumque (per me,) plurimorumtuorum fidelium consolationem: et ad Inimincorum tuorum confusionem,et subversionem.

Alternativetranslations for \"Fiat\" are “May it be so\" and \"Make it so.”Ab anno 1579. hoc fere modo: Latine, vel Anglice; (ast circa annum 1569 alio etpeculiari, particulari modo: interdum pro Raphaele, interdum pro Michaele) ad Deum"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"preces fundere: mihi gratissimum fuit:Mirabilem in me faciat Deus Misericordiam suum.Amen.From the year 1579, it was done in this way: in Latin and in English; (but aroundthe year 1569 in another and peculiar, particular way: sometimes for Raphael,sometimes for Michael.

Amen.John Dee His Note (Page 2)Angelus sive Intelligentia, nunc toti mundo praedominensThe Angel or Intelligence now ruling over the whole world.“Intelligentia” In a theological sense intelligentia is a ‘a non-corporeal Being or Intelligence’, and is commonlyused for angels and spiritual beings. Agrippa, Ficino, and Aquinas use it in this sense.‘Intelligentia’ can also be a ‘rational activity, rational comprehension’, in a more philosophicalthan theological way (also used by Aquinas and various neoplatonizing Christians.) Here, it iseasy to opt for the former meaning, though in Liber Tertius the choice is not so clear.“Annael praedominens”Oddly enough, Trithemius in his De Septem Secundeis (also called Chronologia Mystica) saysthat Gabriel is the Angel currently (in 1582) presiding over the world. Annael is problematic inother ways as well. (See below.)Etymologia: {Gratiosa/Afflicta} misericors DeiEtymology: The Gracious/Afflicted Merciful ... of God.Translator’s Note: This is a little problematic, since there is no noun here. (The four other Angelsin the Note are all described with nouns.) It could be, for instance, the “merciful nature” or“merciful things” of God. “Gratiosa/afflicta” can be explained in Christian terms, in which God’smercy is both gracious (in many senses of the word) and suffering (because of the Passion andDeath of Christ.)4 Angeli praesidentes 4 Cardinibus Caeli: ut Agrippa notat in scala Quarternarii.4 Angels presiding over the 4 cardinal points of Heaven, as Agrippa notes in hisscale of fours.“scala Quarternarii”Note that this reads “scale of fours”, not “scale of four”.

By thisreason, it is seen, not absurdly, to signify praying to and acknowledging God.Translator’s Note: “Confiteor” is more commonly translated “confess”, as in “confess the strengthof Christ crucified”. “Acknowledge” was chosen instead as it might be less ambiguous to amodern reader.“ratione”For expanding “roe” to “ratione”, see Dizionario di Abbreviature latine ed italiane.

Also, the phrase “Protestatio fidelis” might makeone think of Dee as a faithful Protestant, but this is a mere hint or interpretation and not a literalrendering.Si quis autem vestrum indiget sapientia, postulet a Deo etc.For if any of you is in need of wisdom, let him ask of God, etc.“Si quis...” – James 1:5 The text in the microfilm of Sloane 3188 may have a dot over the final “a” or it may not. If itdoes, this would then read “sapientiam”, which is also grammatically correct, and the reading inthe Vulgate.Vulgate: si quis autem vestrum indiget sapientiam postulet a Deo qui dat omnibus affluenter etnon inproperat et dabitur ei.KJV: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, andupbraideth not; and it shall be given him.Geneva Bible: If any of you lacke wisdome, let him aske of God, which giveth to all men liberally,and reprocheth no man, and it shall be given him.Mittas lucem tuam et veritatem tuam, que me ducant etc."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Send forth thy light and thy truth, which may lead me, etc.“Mittas lucem...” Psalm 42:3 (Vulgate), Psalm 43:3 (English Bibles)Though this echoes Psalm 42:3 in the Vulgate (Ps 43:3 in the English Bibles and Psalter), it is notan exact quotation.Vulgate ex Septuaginto: emitte lucem tuam et veritatem tuam ipsa me deduxerunt et adduxeruntin montem sanctum tuum et in tabernacula tuaVulgate ex Hebraeo: mitte lucem tuam et veritatem tuam ipsae ducent me et introducent admontem sanctum tuum et ad tabernaculum tuumBCP: Oh sende out thy light and thy trueth, that they may leade me: and bring me unto thy holyhill, and to thy dwelling.Geneva Bible: Sende thy light and thy trueth: let them leade me: let then bring me unto thine holyMountaine and to thy Tabernacles.KJV: O send out thy light and thy truth: let the lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, andto thy tabernacle.Recte Sapere et Intelligere doceto me, Nam sapientia tua totum est quod volo,etc.Teach me to know well and to understand for thy wisdom is all that I desire, etc..Da verbum tuum in ore meo, et sapientiam tuam in corde meo fige, etc.Give thy word in my mouth and fix thy wisdom in my heart.Translator’s Note: “Give thy word in my mouth, and thy meditation in my heart” is used by sometraditionally-minded Episcopalian and Anglican priests before officiating at Holy Communion.Page 4Castra metatur Angelus Domini, in Circuitu timentium eum,...The Angel of the Lord measures out his camp, encircling those that fear him, ....“Castra metatur” – Psalm 33:8 (Vulgate); Psalm 34:7 (English)Ex Septuaginto: vallabit angelus Domini in circuitu timentium eum et eripeit eosEx Hebraeo: circumdat angelus Domini in gyro timentes eum et eruet eos.BCP: The Angel of the Lord tarieth round about them that feare him: and delivereth them.KJV: The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.Geneva Bible: The Angel of the Lord pitcheth round about them, that feare him, and deliuereththem.Dee’s version is slightly different from either of these. “Metatur” has the sense of surveying ormeasuring out an area, unlike either ‘circumdat’ or ‘vallabit.’ The more precise word isconsonant with the angelically directed mathematical construction and subdivision of the SigillumAemeth in the second book. It could also be that Dee the mathematician found the surveying termmore congenial than the less technical wordings in the Vulgate.De mirabili potestate Artis et Naturae.Concerning the miraculous power of Art and Nature.Facilius (sine comparatione) a Deo impetrandum foret, vel a bonis spiritibus, quicquidhomini utile reputare etc.Whatever is considered useful to man is more easily (immeasurably so) entreatedfrom God, or from good spirits, etc."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"“Facilius....”The Bacon work is variously titled Epistola Fratris Rogerii Baconis de Secretis Operibus Artis etNaturae, et de Nullitate Magiae or Epistola Rogerii Bacon de Potestae Artis et Naturae. Dee givesyet a third notion of the title. (I have picked and chosen the manuscript variants that most closelymatch Dee’s text. One of Dee’s copies seems to have embodied a state of the text not otherwiseknown – see Roberts and Watson, p. 62, and their notes on catalog numbers D4 and DM163. Onewonders whether Dee’s text was lacking de Nullitate Magiae -- “on the Nullity of Magic”, orwhether he suppressed the thought.)Et adhuc erratur, quando per invocationes, et deprecationes, et sacrificia nituntur homineseos placare et adducere pro utilitate vocantium; facilius enim sine comparatione a Deoimpetrandum foret, vel a bonis spiritibus, quicquid homini debet utile reputare.And still it is mistaken, when men strive, through invocations and prayers and sacrifices,to please and persuade them for the benefit of the callers; for it is incomparably easier toobtain from God, or from good spirits, anything which ought to be deemed useful forman.Whitby (p 202-23) cites a 1659 English translation Frier Bacon his Discovery of the Miracles ofNature, and Magick, about which he notes “This edition bears the notice on the title-page that ithas been ‘faithfully translated out of Dr. Dee’s own copy, by T.M.” The translation could just aswell have been made out of the Froben edition of 1618, which also claims to be taken from Dee’scopy – see Roberts and Watson above. without all question the way is incomparable more easie to obtain any thing, that is trulygood for men, of God, or good angels, then of wicked Spirits” (pp.3-4)Numquid non est Deus in Israel, ut eatis ad consulendum Beelzebub deum Accaron.Reg. 4 cap. 1Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that you go to consult Beelzebub, thegod of Accaron?

See note on “de Triplici hominis custode”below.(In margin) vide Agrippam de Triplici hominis custode, Lib 3, cap 22see Agrippa “On the Three-fold Guardian of Man”, Book 3, Chapter 22“de Triplici hominis custode”This is the title of Agrippa, De Occulta Philosophia III.22, which beginsTriplex unicuique homini demon bonus est proprius custos: unus quidem sacer, altergeniturae, tertius professionis. For every man there is a threefold good spirit as a proper keeper: one holy, another of thenativity, the third of profession. The first spirit is similar to the concept of “guardian angel”, the second sprit is like the Classicalconcept of “Genius” or a person’s innate (and astrologically influenced) spirit or potential, and thethird is the spirit of one’s profession, path, etc. There is happiness when the second and third arein agreement, and unhappiness when they are not.Book III, chapter 23 of Ficino’s De Vita Libri Tres is about making Genius and Profession agree.Dee owned a copy of this work.Laudate Dominum in operibus suis.Praise the Lord in his works.“Laudate...” – Sirach 39: 19 (Vulgate); Ecclesiasticus 39:14 (English)Vulgate: florete flores quasi lilium date odorem et frondete in gratiam et conlaudate canticum etbenedicite Dominum in operibus suisKJV apocrypha: And give ye a sweet savour as frankincense, and flourish as a lily, send forth asmell, and sing a song of praise, bless the Lord in all his worksGeneva: And give ye a sweete smel as incense, and bring forth flowres as the lilie: give a smel,and sing a song of praise: blesse the Lorde in all his workes.(In margin) vide Reuchlinum de Verbo Mirifico, de nomine NAsee Reuchlin “On the Marvellous Word”, concerning the name NA“NA”Reuclin de verbo mirifico, II, sig e6v, (Stuttgart facsimile p 72)Et sequitur: Nequaqum Jacob appellabit nomen tuum sed Israel: quoniam cum deo &homine praevaluisti: Ut est item vocabulum Na: quod in animi molestia"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"turbationibusquae utimur.

And in the book of Judges the Lordsays “My name which is Pele”, which signifies to us “a worker of miracles” or “bringingforth wonders.”Page 14(In margin) De sigillo Emeth vide Reuclini Artem Cabalisticam lib 3 et Agrippam lib 3"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"cap 11On the seal of Emeth, Reuclin’s “The Cabalistic Art”, book 3, and Agrippa book3, chapter 11“Emeth”The Seal of Emeth has a long history.
