As the final step, these energies aredirected so that they energize the magician himself.The magickal records covering the results of the first use of this exerciseare available separately.I have received several complaints about my published rituals recently.Some complain that they are too elaborate, others that they are too simple, andsome question whether they really qualify as magickal rituals in the traditionalsense.The complaints of over-elaborateness stem from the fact that it isimpossible to perform any significant part of the works in a single session. Thisis perfectly correct, and is done deliberately. My experience has been that therewards given to the magician by the “angels” of the Enochian system are veryprecisely gauged to the amount of care and effort the magician puts into thework. Works that are planned, rehearsed, and carried out over a period of weeksor months are much more likely to produce significant initiations than anynumber of single-session efforts. The present work was designed to beperformed in stages, with the expectation that each stage will be performed untilthe powers invoked achieve a self-sustaining presence in the magician’s templebefore he passes on to the next stage. It can be expected that the rewards will becommensurate with the effort involved.Complaints of excessive simplicity derive from lack of the pompousverbiage typically found in formal rituals, and the dearth of advice concerningsymbols, implements, and materiel that would help to fire the imagination of themagician. There is a decidedly bare-bones feel to the descriptions. This isperhaps an expression of my own character as a magician; I find that complexpomp and ceremony put me off rather than enhancing the work. I have completefaith that every magician’s imagination and intuition will provide him withenhancements appropriate to his or her own character and style, and so see noneed to provide more than the minimum schema necessary to accomplish thework successfully.The differences between these rituals and more traditional forms derivesfrom the nature of Enochian magick. In most systems, the primary difficulty is inproducing a flow of the desired power. The major portions of the rituals arededicated to simply getting the power to appear. Once it does appear, itsdirection to the desired end is a relatively simple matter."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Comselha: An Enochian Macrocosmic RitualPage 2In contrast, the Angelic Calls and Names provide a means by which evena beginning magician can easily call up a strong flow of force. But the forcesinvolved are much more ambiguous than in other systems. Each appears to havemany different natures depending on the level and orientation from which theyare viewed; their manifestations seem to be potentially infinite. The primarywork of a ritual must accordingly be to focus, direct, and condition them,through the use of the imagination, so that they manifest in a clear andmanageable way. This work conforms to that necessity.Additionally, the specific form used makes this work somethingresembling an inverse path-working exercise, going top-down rather thanbottom-upwards. And as Frater Azoth has pointed out, there are resemblances tothe mandala-workings and chakra-visualizations used in Tibetan Buddhism.They are certainly very similar in intent, though the similarity of form wasunintentional.The Place of WorkingThe work may be done in either a physical or an astral workplace. Themagician may find astral working preferable due to the size of the magickalcircle, and also because the area can not be used for any other purpose while thiswork is proceeding.The magickal circle is actually four concentric circles having specificrelative proportions. The \"units\" referred to may be of any convenient size,provided that the innermost circle is large enough to stand or sit in comfortably.The inner circle has a radius of four units. The next circle has a radius ofeleven units, and thus produces a band 7 units thick around the inner circle. Thethird circle has a radius of 12 units, making a band one unit thick around thesecond circle. The outer circle has a radius of 13 units, making another band oneunit thick.All four circles are divided into quarters by lines going from the center tothe circumference in the cardinal directions. Each quarter of the second circle isfurther divided into six pie-sections fifteen degrees wide. Each quarter of theouter circle is divided into three pie-sections thirty degrees wide.The innermost circle should be colored some dark neutral color, such as adark gray. The two outermost circles in each quarter should be colored in theKing-scale elemental color of the corresponding element, thus:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Comselha: An Enochian Macrocosmic RitualPage 3QuarterElementColorNorthwestAirBright pale yellowNortheastWaterDeep blueSoutheastFireGlowing orange-scarletSouthwestEarthWarm velvet blackThe second circle should be in some light neutral color, such as a slightlygrayish white. Alternately, each sector of this circle could be outlined in theelemental color of the quarter with a fill in one of the planetary colors, followingone of the schemes described further on. But this alternative may be tooburdensome for an astral working."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Comselha: An Enochian Macrocosmic RitualPage 4Symbolism of the CircleThe structure of this magickal circle mirrors the medieval concept of theheavens. In that cosmology, the planetary and heavenly realms are viewed as aseries of concentric circles surrounding the Earth, each circle going outwardsrepresenting an increasingly more \"divine\" power. The planets each take a circlein their cabalistic order. The sphere of the zodiac is outermost, representing anouter \"shell\" around creation; beyond it is the Empyrean, the unknown, invisiblerealm of God.The scheme has been slightly modified here to fit the actual natures of theEnochian powers involved. It is recommended that the magician make adiagram of the circle and completely familiarize himself with the meaning of thevarious parts before beginning work. If this is done, the actual work becomes amuch simpler prospect.Our goal in this work is to take the invisible power of the divine, bring itinto the realm of creation, and then bring it downward through a series oftransformations to energize and consecrate the Earth and ourselves. Thus wewill be working from the outer circles towards the center.Functionally, the three Names of God in each Tablet act to gather theinvisible power of the divine and transform it so that it is accessible to the lowerpowers of their Tablet. As such they act as the interface between the Empyreanand the realm of creation, in a way similar to that of the zodiac. The outermostband of our magickal circle will embody this principle.Each of the twelve Names of God will have dual attributes. The first,which we will call the \"outer\" attribute, represents the energy the Name takes infrom the divine, as symbolized by one of the zodiac signs. The second \"inner\"attribute represents the energy as it has been transformed by the Name into aform compatible with its Tablet. This latter attribute also uses the zodiac signs,but after another fashion.The cross that divides the circle into quarters represents the solstices andequinoxes, and at the same time the \"Black Cross\" that binds the four ElementalTablets together into the Great Table. The western arm of the cross is the springequinox and the eastern arm the autumnal equinox. The northern arm is thewinter solstice, and the southern arm the summer solstice. The three Names ofgod are assigned to their quarter's three sectors of the circle's outer band inclockwise order. The relevant attributes of these names are as shown in thefollowing table."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Comselha: An Enochian Macrocosmic RitualPage 5NameElementQuarterOuterAttributeInnerAttributeOROAirWinterPiscesGeminiIBAHAquariusAquariusAOZPICapricornLibraMPHWaterFallSagittariusPiscesARSLScorpioScorpioGAIOLLibraCancerOIPFireSummerVirgoSagittariusTEAALeoLeoPDOCECancerAriesMOREarthSpringGeminiVirgoDIALTaurusTaurusHCTGAAriesCapricornThus in their outer attributes, the Names collect a complete round of thedivine energies as passed inwards through the zodiac. In their inner attributes,the Names pass inwards the power of their element, in its alchemicallymercurial, salt, and sulphuric forms.The function of the Elemental King of each Tablet is to take the powerpassed inward by the Names of God, concentrate that power, transform it anddistribute it to the Seniors and the powers of the Lesser Angles. In this work wewill only be concerned with his transformation of the power into the six-foldconstellation of the Seniors.The Seniors represent the planetary powers, but in a way not entirelycompatible with the medieval cosmology. The medieval system, like the cabala,sees the planets as ranked hierarchically, some being more divine than others. Incontrast, the six Seniors in each Tablet are in every way equals; none is higherthan the others.In this work we will consider them as each being a vertically-orientedpower; each represents a flow of power that is colored by a particular planet'snature, but which passes downwards through all the planetary circles of themedieval scheme. Each letter of a Senior's name will represent his power as itmanifests in one of those circles. As an example, the \"A\" of ACZINOR will be aJovian power acting in the sphere of Saturn; the \"C\" of that name will be a Jovianpower acting in the sphere of Jupiter, and so on.Following this scheme, the Senior's names are assigned one to each pie-section of the second band within our magickal circle. They go from the outsidetowards the center, as do the powers represented by those names."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Comselha: An Enochian Macrocosmic RitualPage 6The innermost circle represents the Earth as the center of the medievalcosmology. Additionally, this circle holds all of the Lesser Angles of the Tablets.There is a more elaborate version of the structure used here, in which the LesserAngle powers also have their spheres surrounding the Earth; but for currentpurposes all the microcosmic spheres have been lumped into one."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Comselha: An Enochian Macrocosmic RitualPage 7The RitualPreparatory and Concluding ActionsActions in this section should be practiced daily until they have becomefamiliar and the feelings and attitudes necessary can be held without effort. Withpractice, they should become easy enough that they can be done smoothly in acouple of minutes. These actions should be performed in every ceremony, beforegoing on to one of the stages.1. Use a plain white robe for a costume, with no decorations or regalia ofany kind. A black over-robe, again without decoration, should be worn overwith white robe at the beginning of the ceremony. This second robe should besuch that it can be easily and rapidly thrown off. A plain white wand,unconsecrated to any other purpose, may be used, or figures may be drawn withthe hand.2. Perform a preliminary purification and consecration of the Temple withFire, Water, and Air. Use frankincense or some other solar incense for thecensing, rather than any specifically elemental incense. DO NOT perform anypreliminary banishings or invocations; the G.D. pentagram and hexagram ritualsare specifically to be avoided, as are any other rituals that describe a protectivecircle around the place of working.3. Move to the center of the circle and kneel or sit comfortably, facing thedirection of the spring equinox.4. Imagine that the innermost circle is the microcosmic world, and theentire Earth and all of the purely elemental magickal worlds are containedtherein, as well as your body. Feel all these things being gathered into the sphereand being immovably fixed there. Spend as long as necessary to get a strongfeeling that this has been accomplished.5. Imagine that the black robe is a shell, an outer mundane bodyconcealing the essentially divine essence of your being. Imagine that all themundane parts of your being, and every other thing that distinguishes you fromthe divine, is part of that shell. Feel these things moving into the robe andbecoming fixed there, leaving nothing but the divine essence, enclosed in thewhite robe, contained within it. Again, spend as long as necessary to feel this hasbeen accomplished.6. Undo the black robe so that when you stand it will fall away and be leftlying behind within the inner circle.7. Stand up and simultaneously cast off the black robe. As you do so, feelthat everything of your personal identity is being left behind with it. Even the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Comselha: An Enochian Macrocosmic RitualPage 8physical or astral body your consciousness inhabits should be felt to be nothingmore than a projection, an illusion without substance or influence. All thatremains is a divine essence, free of its envelope. This essence expands itself intothe God of Justice, IAD BALT, who reigns over the Enochian universe.From this point on in the work, all actions are to be done as if you werethis god. The region enclosed by the circles is the realm of your creation, andyou can stand within it or outside it without being in any way influenced by it.You should make an effort to feel a total freedom from any conditions orlimitations of the created world.8. Still looking towards the spring equinox point, survey your creationand review its structure. In the center is the World, and the realms of theelements. Next outwards is the realm of the planets, enclosed by the realm of theSun. Beyond the Sun the remainder of the manifest universe is compressed intorealm of the zodiac. And beyond the zodiac is the Empyrean, your true homeand state of being, a higher-dimensional universe in which your creation isembedded. See each of these realms as separated from the next by a thinmembrane or interface, not so much a barrier as an area where their influencesbalance and cancel out.Meditate on your creation and that which encloses it as long as you like.9. Concluding actions. After completing these preliminary exercises, or (ifyou have passed to one of the later stages) at the end of the ceremony, return tothe center circle. Take up the black robe and put it on. At the same time,consciously re-absorb everything that you have previously fixed in it. Take onyour personal identity again in all its aspects. Then sit in silence and seek toabsorb any forces generated by the ceremony. As you proceed through thestages you may note significant changes in awareness, new insights, revelations,etc. during this time. Take as much time as you feel necessary to absorb andintegrate them into your being.Finally, declare the work to be completed, and return to your mundaneactivities.Stage One10. Following step 8, walk to the outside of the circles along the line of thespring equinox. Imagine at the same time that you are passing through therealms of your creation back to the Empyrean.11. Still outside the circle, turn and circumambulate it in a clockwisedirection, drawing a glowing line in the air above outer edge of the outer bandas you go. Imagine that by doing so you are temporarily sealing off your"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Comselha: An Enochian Macrocosmic RitualPage 9creation from the higher dimensions in which it is embedded, so that there is notransfer of information or energy from one to the other.12. Upon returning to your starting point, turn to face inwards along theequinoctial line. Vibrate the First Call. As you do so, imagine that it is causingthe gathering of the limitless energy of the Empyrean, and causing that energy topress inwards on the boundary you have drawn around the realms of yourcreation. Vibrate the Call several more times, each time producing an increase inthe energy present, and in the pressure it exerts upon the boundary. Seek tocreate as high a state of tension as you can, with the energy pressing irresistibly,and the boundary resisting immovably.Stage Two13. Move clockwise until you are outside the center of the outer bandsector assigned to the name ORO. Face the center of the circle, and visualize thatname floating in the air above its sector, just inside the barrier.14. Vibrate the name ORO several times. Simultaneously draw thehexagram of Pisces on the face of the barrier and draw the glyph of the signinside the hexagram. Next draw a circle around the hexagram just touching itspoints. While doing so, imagine that you are etching the circle in the barrier inthe same way you would etch glass with a glass cutter.15. Strike the center of the circle forcibly with your fist or the wand,punching out a hole in the barrier. (The hexagram remains suspended within thehole, its lines glowing.) Immediately you withdraw your fist, the Empyreanenergy pressing on the barrier pushes through the hexagram, through the hole,and fills up the ORO sector of the outer band. As the energy passes through thehexagram it takes on the color of the sign Pisces, and remains this color as it fillsthe column.16. Repeat steps 13-15 for the other sectors, going in order clockwisearound the circle. Use the appropriate colors and hexagrams for the sector'souter attribute in each case. If necessary, take time to renew the pressure of theEmpyrean energy between sectors.Stage 3This stage may be done one quarter at a time on separate days. If so, donot repeat the work on a given quarter in consecutive sessions; instead continuewith the succeeding quarters and repeat the entire cycle of quarters as manytimes as necessary to get the energies firmly established."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Comselha: An Enochian Macrocosmic RitualPage 1017. Again move clockwise until you are opposite the center of the OROsector in the outer band. Face the center of the circle and visualize the Namefloating above the center of the sector.18. Vibrate the name ORO several times. Draw the hexagram of Geminion the interface between the outer and third bands while continuing to vibratethe name. Put the glyph of Gemini inside the hexagram. Draw the glyph ofalchemical mercury above the hexagram, and the Enochian glyph of Air belowit. Draw a circle around the hexagram as in step 14, as if etching the outline of apunch-out on a piece of glass.19. Strike the circle with your fist and punch out a hole. See the forceaccumulated in the ORO sector pushing inwards into the third band, backed upby the pressure of the Empyrean energy pushing into the sector from outside. Asthe energy passes through the hexagram, its Piscean quality is transformed intothe quality of Mercury of Air.20. Move to the outside of the IBAH sector, and repeat steps 17-19. Exceptuse the hexagram of Aquarius, with the alchemical glyph of Salt above it and theEnochian glyph of Air below it. See the energy being transformed into Salt of Airas it passes through the Hexagram.21. Move to the outside of the AOZPI sector, and repeat steps 17-19. Usethe hexagram of Libra, with the glyph of alchemical Sulphur above and theEnochian glyph of Air below. See the energy being transformed into Sulphur ofAir as it passes inwards through the hexagram.22. Move inwards and stand in the middle of the third band sectorassigned to BATAIVAH, facing outwards. Vibrate BATAIVAH and continue todo so. See the power of the King's name gathering in the forces flowing throughthe three holes from the fourth band, and concentrating those forces into a point.Inside the point of concentrated force, the mercurial, salt, and sulphuricaspects of Air combine to form pure elemental Airy energy, and this energyexplodes outwards from the point to fill the entire sector.23. Repeat steps 17-22 for the other three quarters in clockwise orderaround the circle.Stage FourThe Seniors are assigned to the sectors of the second band either incabalistic order (starting with Saturn and ending with Luna) or in clockwiseorder beginning with the upper arm of the Linea Patris. Here the cabalistic orderis used. As noted earlier, the names are written in the sector from the outside in,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Comselha: An Enochian Macrocosmic RitualPage 11and each letter represents the passage of the Senior's power through one of thePlanetary Spheres of the medieval cosmology.24. Perform the gathering and combination of the alchemical Airs as instep 22. Try to increase the pressure and volume of elemental Air within thesector to the maximum.25. Turn to face inwards and vibrate the Elemental King’s name again.Continue to vibrate it, and feel its power gathering in the elemental Air from thesector, and forming it into a ball centered on the previously-createdconcentration point so that the ongoing conversion of alchemical Air feeds it. Asthe amount of elemental Air in the ball increases, it suddenly ignites and forms aself-sustaining Sun.26. Staying in the third band, move opposite the first sector in the secondband. Draw the hexagram of Saturn on the interface between the bands, andvibrate the name of the Senior of Saturn, HIPOTGA.27. Turn to the sun and draw out of it a line of power. Attach that line tothe center of the hexagram. (This line of power should actually be something likea narrow hose, within which energies flow out of the solar sphere and into theSenior’s realm. But nothing flows as yet, as a hole has not yet been punchedbetween the bands.)28. Repeat steps 26-27 for the remaining sectors in the quarter, drawingthe appropriate hexagrams and invoking the appropriate Seniors.29. Move into the second band and stand facing the hexagram of Saturn.Draw the hexagram again on this side of the interface, invoking the Senior. Nextvisualize the letters of the Senior’s name written in the sector from the outsidetowards the center.30. Draw a circle around the hexagram, etching the surface of theinterface, and strike to punch it out. Energy begins to flow through the “pipe”from the Elemental King, and as it passes through the hexagram it takes on thenature of the Senior.31. Vibrate the name of the Senior slowly and with each letter of the namedistinct. As you pronounce each letter, see the inflowing energy filling up theregion just above that letter in the sector. At the same time confirm mentally orby visualization that the letter embodies the power of the Senior in the planetarysphere associated with it in cabalistic order. Continue to back down the sectortowards the center, doing the same for each letter in turn.32. When the entire pie-shaped sector has been filled with energy, youshould now be standing in the first, central circle representing the Earth. On the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Comselha: An Enochian Macrocosmic RitualPage 12barrier between the first and second circles, draw the astrological symbol ofEarth, a circle crossed by two lines at right angles to each other. See the outercircle of this symbol etched on the barrier as before, and strike to punch it out,allowing the energy to flow into the central circle.Visualize the energy spreading outwards from this point to cover theentire inner circle, as water from a hose spreads out to cover a tile floor. As itspreads, the energy also soaks into the black robe, which still lies upon the circle.The energy also fills the entire circle until it is above the level of your head.When the circle is filled, in your imagination trace the path of the energy backthrough all the preceding stages to its origin in the Empyrean.33. Repeat steps 29-32 for the other sectors in the second band.34. Repeat steps 24-33 for the other three quarters in the circle. Thiscompletes the exercise."}]
