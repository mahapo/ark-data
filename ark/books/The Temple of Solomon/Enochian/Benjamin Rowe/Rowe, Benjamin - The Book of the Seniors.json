This section presentsthe results of a series of invocations of the Seniors from that Tablet. The record iscomplete and is presented exactly as it was received at the time of the invocations,without editing.The invoking names of the Seniors are derived from the Great Central Cross ofthe Tablet by reading outwards horizontally and vertically from the two centermostsquares of the Tablet. In the Golden Dawn’s theory of the Enochian system, theyrepresent the forces of the planets manifesting within the element, and are consid-ered to be Briatic in nature. With the Elemental King, who represents the Sun and isa link between the Briatic and the Yetziratic levels of the Tablet, they bind togetherall the forces within the Tablet. Additionally, the Seniors are said to provide knowledge specifically concerning“human affairs”, and the present record confirms that in the broadest sense. Onanother level (and unknown to me at the time of the operations) the 24 Seniors inthe four Tablets correlate with the 24 Elders mentioned in the Revelation of St. Johnthe Divine. In this latter case, they relate to the zodiac signs, presumably two foreach sign. And again, the record would seem to support this attribution.A somewhat different method of operation is used here than in the previousinvocations of the series that were described in Touring the Earth Tablet. In thatwork, each of the “Kerubic” squares of the Tablet was examined individually. Thevisions were deliberately forced into a highly visual and symbolic form, along thelines set down in the Golden Dawn's rules for astral workings. While these restric-tions made it easy to establish the validity and consistency of the visions, it alsoforced the information given by the Kerubic forces into an extremely cumbersomeand hard to read form.In the current series, no effort has been made to make the visions conform to thebaroque style touted by the Golden Dawn. Rather, the Seniors were allowed topresent themselves in their own manner, except for a brief presentation of a teles-matic image as a check of validity. Attempting to examine each square individuallywould have been much too cumbersome. The result has been much more direct andreadable than in the previous case.Despite the looser form, the results of these invocations are entirely consistentwith the previous invocations of the working. Taken together, they present a devel-oping system of symbolism related to the planet Earth, the various modes of mag-ickal initiation, and man's place on Earth and in the universe. The story presented by the Seniors is a history of the spiritual development ofman on Earth, as viewed by the being who is the life of the Earth and thoseappointed to direct that development. The main characters are those beings whoseactions are the root of the mythos of the gods Set and Horus, and the plot describestheir conflicts as they contended for control of man's evolution over eighty million"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors2 \u0001years. With the earlier works in this series, it also presents a “reconstruction” of theoriginal mythos of Set, from before the time when priests of Horus and Osirisdemolished his temples and turned him into a devil-god for their own forms of reli-gion. This mythos is not a step backward in time, but a re-formulation in terms of theincoming energies of this present day, when the equinox is moving into the constel-lation of Aquarius. The philosophy presented is entirely consistent with the basictenets of Thelema as originally stated in Liber AL vel Legis, and those later elabora-tions presented by C.S. Jones (Frater Achad). The energies of the sign of Aquarius are vastly different from the energies of theprevious aeon, which was under the sign of Pisces. The Piscean age was character-ized by highly structured, imposed systems of religion and magick, presentedthrough the work of rigid hierarchical organizations. In that age, the individual wasexpected to subordinate himself to the work and symbolism of the group, and toaccept what was given to him on faith. Man was seen as being at the bottom of thespiritual hierarchy, and was therefore subordinate to all of the spiritual forces. Hecould only contact them through faith and supplication, in effect begging them for abit of wisdom.The Aquarian energies, on the other hand, are extremely individualistic. The rul-ing planet, Uranus, and the exalted planet, Mercury, show that in this new timeindividuals can achieve magickal and spiritual success entirely through their ownefforts, without the aid of any outside force. The results of their work will be pro-portional to the effort they put into it. Where Mercury, knowledge, was in its detri-ment in Pisces, here it is at its height. Thus knowing and self-will, and notsubmission and faith, are now to be the key to initiation.Under the Aquarian energies, each man contributes to the group work by doinghis own work and discovering his own Will, without reference to the work of others.The links between the work of one person and another will come naturally, as aconsequence of the internal connections that exist between all things, and not as anexternally-imposed set of formulae. The connections mentioned above are oneexample of this principle. No doubt many more examples will arise in coming years. Following this principle, I would like to encourage the reader to examine thiswork and all such works with a critical eye, to not accept it as literally true, and notaccept it as symbolic truth unless it fits your own views of the spirit. Perhapsanother way is better for you. There is more than enough room for any number ofviews.Before concluding, a few explanatory remarks might be in order.Where reference to the cabalistic Tree of Life is made in this work, it is always tothe revised version discovered and presented by Frater Achad. I have personallyfound this form of the Tree to be much more productive than the old G.D. version.The extended working of which this paper is a part has demonstrated that it is notmerely a curiousity, but a workable and very effective system of symbolism, at leastthe equal of the older version of the Tree. But the use of this alternate system should"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Introduction\u0001 3not deter users of the older Tree from reading this book. The essential aspects of thework are not dependent on the Tree at all, and can be applied to many different sys-tems.It seems appropriate to provide the readers with a minimum sketch of the sym-bolic basis of the narrative, so that they might have some clues to its occult interpre-tation.The planetary symbolism of the Seniors themselves appears only on a very super-ficial level, and has little to do with the content of their story. The plot of the storyfollows the sequence of the zodiac signs in precessional order, starting with the signof Pisces, showing the Earth and her Lunar twin as the two fishes. Further develop-ment follows through Aquarius and the other signs until it ends in Aries, with aminor epilogue not related to the signs. The portion concerning the Earth-Spiritand the portion concerning the character Set follow parallel but separate threadsuntil they meet in the sign of Scorpio, from which point the story goes forward in asingle plotline. All the major plot elements relate in some way to the astrological (asopposed to the cabalistic) attributes of the signs.The main characters represent the elements of the modified INRI or IRNI for-mula, presented in detail in the paper titled Set / Horus and several of my otherpapers. (The formula’s appearance here is in fact the first clue I received as to themodified formula’s existence.) Briefly, the Earth herself represents the first and last“I” of the formula, corresponding to the astrological signs Taurus and Aquariusrespectively. This dual characterization shows her as both a celestial being in herown right (Aquarius = “The Star”) and as the nurturing mother (Taurus, ruled byVenus and the Moon) within whose “womb” and at whose behest most of theaction takes place.The protagonist, Set, corresponds to the “N” of IRNI, and his described charac-ter relates closely to that sign, its traditional ruler Mars, and its exalted planet Ura-nus. The sign's modern ruler, Pluto, appears only as an undercurrent and in thePisces phase of Set's plotline. Set's opposite number, Horus, represents the “R” ofINRI, corresponding to Sol and its sign Leo. There is also the question of identities to be considered. The reader might won-der, as he examines this work, just who the Seniors are speaking to. It would beabsurd to think that the scribe, the fellow whose name appears in the copyrightnotice, is the one who did all the things the Seniors attribute to the one they speakto. He is all too human, very much a child of his times, and more than a little bit ofa fool. But if not him, then who?In the words of the Seniors, the scribe is part of a tripartite being, a “man who isa mage who is a god”. As a general rule, when the first person singular is used in thiswork, it is a blend of the scribe and the mage, in varying proportions, who speaks.The distinction between them is never too clear to the scribe, and it is becoming lessclear as this working progresses. But the more doubtful and uncertain the “I” whospeaks appears, the greater the proportion of the scribe in the mixture."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors4 \u0001But when the Seniors speak, they are generally referring to the actions of themage, the god, or a blending of the two. The sole exception is when they refer toevents occurring on the physical plane during the lifetime of the scribe. Perhaps the best view to take on this subject is to consider each aspect as apseudo-autonomous subset of the next highest aspect. That is, each is a projectionof the will of the next which can act independently most of the time, but which isabsorbed and loses its individuality when the next highest aspect choses. Thus, thelower aspect is never entirely certain whether it is expressing just itself or is acting asan extension of a higher aspect.That being said, I will let the Seniors speak for themselves. As always, I welcomecomments and correspondence about this work.Benjamin Rowe5/7/1986, Niles, Ohio."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Aczinor, Senior of Jupiter\u0001 5Aczinor, Senior of Jupiter4/10/86As the vision opened, I found myself in a place where blue sky came down to ayellow plain. There was a brilliance about everything, a cheery internal glow. I sawthat the yellow plain had the texture of velvet or cotton candy.Looking to the east, I saw a star coming up above the horizon. It had eight pointsaround the circumference, another point aimed towards me and another pointedaway from me.To the south, I saw a lion seated on a cubical throne.To the west, there was a watery area, in which a boat or barge was travelling. Tothe north there was an image of the planet Jupiter, rotating majestically in space.I called again upon the Senior Aczinor, and he appeared wearing robes of bluewith a dark purple shimmer in the folds. I did the LVX signs, to which he respondedwith the sign of Set, LVX, and the sign of the Enterer. I tested him with the penta-gram of earth (which had no effect) and with the hexagram of Jupiter, which causedhis force to flow into me. He himself dissolved, passed through the hexagram, andreformulated himself on the near side of it.From close up, I could see that his hair was white, and his skin was a violet sodark and rich as to be almost black. His eyes were a lighter shade of violet. He heldup his right hand in the sign of blessing and asked me to return it. Another flow offorce went between us, filling my own aura with a deep violet similar to his owncolor.He said “Thank you, o mage of power. Now we can speak clearly to each other. Iam Aczinor, representative of the father Jupiter in the system of the Earth Tablet.Though your invocations began with the King Iczhihal, yet I am the first to speak,being the initiator among the planetary powers of the Tablet. I the wisdom of theKing, and of his father the Sun, and cause it to take form before the eyes of man. Iam the first below the so-called abyss in the Tree of Life, and so I am the pattern ofmanifestation within the world. Thus my star shows ten points, and thus the lion,the king, is enthroned by my existence. I function as his seat of rulership, causing hispower to be extended into matter. Thus the four-square throne1 is mine. The bargeof the west shows my watery character, as the yellow plain and blue sky show myairy nature. The barge again is a foursquare construction, fitting the symbolism ofmy sephira, which is also considered watery in some ways. Thus also I float abovethe waters of creation in the earth's sphere, guiding those waters in their flowingdownwards into matter.“Since I am of the earth as well as of Jove, I am also related in some ways to hisphysical manifestation. The equivalent power in Jove's system rules those levels ofhis physical body in which life has appeared, taking its energy not from the Sun, butfrom the weaker but still great life of Jove himself.1. When he said the words “seat” and “throne”, there was a second voice saying the enochian word “thild”, which Dee trans-lated to mean both these words."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors6 \u0001“Now you have been asked to be shown the invocations of the planets in the eno-chian system. I can not do this myself, being but the most junior of his representa-tives within the levels of the system. But I can tell you how to go about preparing forthese. As you have thought, it is best to do invocations of all the seniors within thetablets. But rather than holding to a single tablet, invoke all of the equivalentSeniors from each of the tablets at once. This will allow you to get a full view of theaction of the planet with the sphere of Earth, who contains all of the tablets yet pre-sented to man within herself. “From this, we will hope to instill enough of the force within you to make thepresentation of the sphere clear and easy to perceive. Then you can go to your castleand locate the books with the invocations, and read them and transcribe themclearly.”2(3-hour interruption at this point.)“To continue, since you have invoked me and I have come, we must use the forcefor some purpose. Therefore, let me begin a tale, as is my right as the initiator.3 “The planets of the system, with the exception of Luna, are all the bodies of livesof a scope so inclusive as to make the perceptions of men and angels nothing incomparison. All of them, even the least, operates at least at the level of Yesod in theTree of which the manifest Tree of Life is Malkuth. Most of them operate in Netzachor Tiphereth of that larger Tree.4“The one exception, Luna, is a dead world. Its action on man is purely a reflec-tion of the Earth's own power, projected outward by the minds of men onto thenearest convenient target. Luna is the body of a being who is now no longer inincarnation, having completed his tasks at an earlier stage in our solar system. Histwin, the Earth, remains in living incarnation, and her influence extends to controlher brother's dead shell. The cycles of life within the earth that are tied to Luna refl-ect the rhythms of interaction between the Earth and her brother in long-ago days,before the appearance of life out of her seas. Their cyclic interaction produced a‘standing wave’, a continuing cycle of echos of the original interaction of the two.“The Earth herself continues to reflect these cycles in the pulsations of her mag-netic envelope. These aural-magnetic effects are the true cause of the lunar cycles inliving things.“I myself, angel and Senior though I be, am still within the range of these cycles,and I have less power sometimes and more at others as a result. You yourself are alsosubject to them, though since you wear a body of a male human, the effects are moreof a psychological nature than they would be for those who wear female bodies.Nevertheless, the effects are there to be seen in all humans.“I speak so long about Luna-Earth because I myself was the proximate cause ofthe brother's loss of connection with his body. Yea, even I, Aczinor, most junior ofthe Seniors of Jove, have had my influence in the dramas of the solar system. As you2. These invocations have never been obtained. At the present (9/92) I am assuming that the promise that they would be acquired was simply a distraction until events allowed me to understand my true will more clearly.3. I suspect that this statement is a bit of Jupiterian humor.4. The many moons of the solar system are included among those bodies called planets, for purposes of this statement."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Aczinor, Senior of Jupiter\u0001 7are now to have yours, o man who is a mage who is a god. Yours is the separation ofthe consciousness of the Earth from the deep levels in which she sleeps. Mine wassimilar for her brother in Luna. So you and I are brothers of the spirit, in the ways ofour works, and I am pleased that you have come to me for aid in your quest.“Now the brother's work was to express fully, with his sister, the effects of the so-called Third Ray of Active Intelligence within the system. Where she represents thelifting of the spirit out of matter by that force, he represented and embodied themovements of life into matter. For life must be present in matter before it can againbe raised up.“This one in Luna was of the younger of the stellar brethren, only a few cyclesaway from existence as a being of the type now embodied by human beings. Thiseffort on Luna was to have been his first experience in incarnating as a full planetarybeing, free from the supervision of a mentor. (In the early stages of life in the higherrealms, the man-gods perform their creations within the aura and under the guid-ance of a more advanced practitioner of the art.)“Well did he do his work. Too well, in truth. For in concentrating himself to passthe spirit of life into matter he concentrated too well and part of his own spirit,though not his awareness of being nor his true self, but only that spirit which enliv-ens the ethers, became tied again into matter as it had been in the days before hisrise to godhood. Worse, even when he realized what was going on and attempted toseparate himself again, the flow of his energies into matter continued against hiswill.“But we speak here of things far beyond this level, and words are not fully suitedto the expression of these concepts. Perhaps a few images would make clear what wedesire to express.”(I had had a strong feeling at this point that I was not really perceiving the pre-sentation in its correct form. Aczinor's comment is the result of this feeling.)He gestured with his left hand, and before us there appeared an image of theEarth-Luna system. But where in our own time Luna is dead, here he was sur-rounded by an aura of life, though the surface seemed as barren as it does now. Theearth also shone with an aura of equal brilliance.Now some of the life around the moon seemed to be sucked into it, leaving a hol-lowness, growing outward from its surface inside the aura. A shock went throughthe remaining aura and out into space. As it passed over the place where Aczinorand I stood in the heavens, I felt a tremendous sense of despair and failure, and asort of panicky desire to repair the disaster before it was too late.The despair, sorrow, and self-recrimination I sensed was so overwhelming that Icried out, and had to leave the vision for a few minutes until it passed and I couldagain think sensibly. Worst was the sense of shame this being felt, as if in his failurehe had also brought the works of the rest of the beings in the system to naught. Itwas as if this being in Luna had lost all sense of self-respect and self-confidence byhis failure."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors8 \u0001The pain he felt could be seen to radiate out into the system. It caused sympa-thetic responses in all the lives of the other planets, and so the whole system wasthreatened with disruption.Now Sol turned his attention to the situation, seeking the cause of the disruptionhe had felt on the levels where he had his attention. Seeing the plight of Luna, heimmediately overshadowed that entity, taking him over body and soul as he wasable to do from his higher level. He caused a stasis in Luna so that the flow into mat-ter was halted. The soul and awareness of Luna he lifted up, out of the trap, andwrapped in his own aura, comforting him and healing him.Aczinor continued:“With the immediate danger halted, there was time to look at the situationclearly and objectively. Sol and the planets attempted to comfort the lunar lord, buthis shame was too great. He knew that by his failure he had ruined the whole beau-tiful plan by which Sol had intended to express love and life for this section of thegalaxy. The far-reaching consequences of his failure overwhelmed him, and hebegged to be allowed to resolve his error in some way, to expiate his shame withaction.“Since this disaster took place within the aura of Sol's work, it must therefore beremedied within the limits of his kingdom. He could not simply eject the ruinedmatter from the system, any more than a man can cure a cold by giving it to some-one else. Nor could he allow this involutionary flow to remain free in the system, forthen it would continue to increase, eventually ruining the plan which Sol's quickaction had so far saved. There was much discussion among Sol and the senior plan-ets of the system, and deep meditation by all, lasting many millennia, on how thisproblem could be solved. Many plans were proposed, but none of the senior planetsfelt confident enough of his solution to propose it as a definite course of action. Sothe discussion continued.“Our earth, being among the junior planets of the system, having not yet reachedTiphereth of that larger Tree in which the gods live and act, was not a party to thediscussions but was only an observer. But unlike the seniors she was on a level whereshe was intimately connected with the type of force her brother manifested. And herlove for her twin motivated her in a way the senior planets could not be. She deviseda plan, and when the senior planets did not arrive at a satisfactory solution, she pro-posed her plan to Sol.“It is impossible to state now what Earth's path would have been had this disasternot taken place. The conditions under which it might have been understood byhuman beings have not existed for many tens of thousands of millennia. The mindsof men, as they have evolved under her new plan, are too far from the type of con-sciousness needed for any meaningful expression to be possible.“But it can be said that under that original plan there would never have beenincarnate human beings on Earth. The furthest into matter they would have gonewould have been Yesod, and for most of the life of the system they would have beenin Tiphereth."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Aczinor, Senior of Jupiter\u0001 9“In Earth's proposed plan, she would take the involutionary forces of herbrother's sphere into herself and hold them there by deep concentration. She would,by her concentration, create a shell around herself which would keep the involu-tionary force out of the rest of the system. Thus the other planets could continue todevelop their themes without interference.“To eliminate the involutionary force from the system completely, she would setit against the evolutionary aspect of the Third Ray that she herself expressed. Theincredible tension between the two would be used to produce an acceleration ofevolution within her sphere. Where before evolution was a gentle process, withmany thousands of millennia between substantial changes in form in a species, nowevolution would be forced, with continual changes of both form and content of theliving animal bodies. this forced evolution would produce bodies of a degree ofrefinement and integration that would never have been seen within the limits ofSol's original plan.“Thus would she tie the involutionary and evolutionary tendencies together,halting the involution in Malkuth, keeping it from pulling the whole system backinto the shell-worlds that preceded the full incarnation of the gods. And when thebodies were of a great enough degree of refinement, she would begin to eliminatethe involutionary force all together. She would do this by forcing the human soulswithin her sphere to incarnate in matter.“Unlike the matter itself, these souls, being already of a spiritual, evolutionarynature, would evolve much more rapidly. In matter, they would ache to return tothe levels from which they first came, and their natural desire to return would even-tually counter the involutionary tendency.“Not only this, but the hammer-blows of experience the human souls wouldreceive within the forge of incarnate existence would change them into somethingfar greater than they ever could have been within the original scheme. For theywould come out of that forge with a temper, a hardness, that could never be lost,making them as the gods of the system and of the stars, brothers to these withinwhose influence they had led their many lives, where otherwise they would haveremained the pawns and tools of the gods throughout the life of this current uni-verse. Thus many thousands of millions of new gods would eventually rise out ofmatter where otherwise there would have been none. All of them able to expresswithin the universe both the formula of spirit, which is evolution, and the formulaof matter, which is involution. They would be true microcosms, and after manymore cycles of evolution on the god-levels, each of them would be individuallycapable of creating whole new universes for life to express itself in. Thus was `lifemore abundantly' once said to be the keynote of our planet.“Even within this present universe will the effects of the Earth's proposal be felt.For these lives of men will spread out to the stars, when the gates are again openfully, and they will catalyze similar reactions in other spheres, where conscious lifeexists but develops at a slow pace. Thus will our galaxy and universe benefit from"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors10 \u0001the crisis of Luna-Earth, as consciousness independent of the gods rises up all overin response to the calls of the souls of men.“But to return to our story, Sol heard the Earth's plan, and felt that it was theonly possible one that had any hope of success. But he was certain there were aspectsEarth had not considered, being beyond her current level of consciousness. Andsuch a radical change of plan could not be put into effect on his own authority sinceits effects would spread so far beyond his own sphere of action. So he `passed thebuck' as you would say, laying the decision in the hands of his own mentor, whoincarnates in one of the stars of the Sirius group at this time.“Now Sirius (as we shall call him, though that is not his true name) saw that theEarth's plan would work, but that there was a danger of her becoming so concen-trated that she would not know when the disposal of the involutionary force wascompleted. Thus he declared that if the plan were to be implemented, there must atall times be within her sphere those who were capable of breaking out of it on theirown, with no assistance, so that she might never suffer for lack of light should shehave need of it. And also, these others must bind themselves to her, and constantlyrecapitulate the process of their evolution within her sphere, so that she might everbe reminded by her connection with them of the purpose for which she had hiddenherself.“The adepts of Active Intelligence, and of Love-Wisdom, and of the lesser rayswho were acting in her sphere and under her direction could none of them accom-plish this task. For their natures lack the forcefulness needed for such a solitarybreakout as Sirius demanded. Only the adepts of the First Ray, the Will aspect, couldsucceed at this task, and those few of this type who were already working withinSol's system were working at tasks that they did not dare abandon. For the First Rayis not natural to our system and only enough adepts to fill the critical needs werethere.“So the call went out for adepts of the First Ray willing to fulfill the task set bySirius. And this is where you yourself come into the story, o scribe who is a god. Totell of your part we must tell more of your origin than we have as yet.“Now, the progression of spiritual beings upwards through the planes in thecourse of evolution follows a regular cycle. That is, there are generations of suchbeings, and each generation must mature to a certain level as gods before they canperform the acts that cause the next generation to be born out of the union of spiritand matter.“Thus there are large gaps between these generations. These gaps are not gaps intime, for time is meaningless on the levels of which we speak. Rather, there are gapsof relative accumulation of experience between the generations. This amounts tothe same thing on your present level, but not on these higher levels. Normally thereis a gap of one full Tree of Life's worth of experience between generations, althoughcertain members of each generation will advance more quickly so that the gapbecomes less as the progress continues. As one generation moves out of our mani-fest tree, another arises out of the union of spirit and matter to replace it. This"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Aczinor, Senior of Jupiter\u0001 11occurs in cycles so vast from our current viewpoint as to be indenumerable in termsof years. Our Earth is now an exception to this because of her daring plan.“You were born of one such generation and your progress followed that of yourfellows up to the level of Tiphereth in that time and place's Tree. But at one pointyou had completed a cycle of existence within a planetary system, and as that sys-tem's lives withdrew from matter you went off into space with your fellows to findfurther opportunities for experience. “Now by what can only be called a fluke, a play of Murphy's law, the current thatthe souls ride between the stars separated you from your fellows, and pulled youinto the center of a cataclysmic conflict between two stellar beings of a vastly higherlevel. Like a piece of flotsam on the waves, you became trapped in the circulatingcurrents between these two.5“The forces there were so vast and intense that at first it was all you could do tokeep your being from vanishing, torn to pieces by the conflicting pulls. For a timenot to be measured in years did you struggle to maintain your integrity againstthese near-overwhelming forces. That you were not made naught was more due tofortune than skill at first, for there were places in the currents between the two godswhere you would have vanished like smoke on a breeze.“But eventually you learned to draw on those currents of will themselves tomaintain your being. While still trapped within the currents of the two gods' confl-ict, yet you could live and learn and grow. And so you did, drawing on the knowl-edge of those gods as you drew upon their power, ever increasing your own powerand will, rising through the planes until finally your will was so strong that youcould force yourself out of the bonds of the conflict.“Out in the spaces between the stars again, you sought out your former compan-ions who had not been caught in the trap. Finding them was a shock, for you hadnot realized how much you had changed in the course of your escape, having hadno one to compare yourself to. Now you found that you had little in common withthem. They were still singular beings, being all of the Third Ray essence, while youwere now tripartite, having absorbed the forces of Love-wisdom and Will from yourexperience in hell.“You could no longer communicate with them as equals. They could not under-stand you as you now were, and only your tales of shared experiences convincedthem that you were their lost companion. You could still communicate with themwithin the limits of the third aspect, but even there your formulations were often sosubtle as to escape their comprehension.“There were beings around who could understand the other parts of your beingto an extent. But these were devas and other angel-like beings, passive transmittersof higher forces rather than active users like yourself. So they also were of no use toyou in the long run.5. On the physical plane, these two beings were represented by a pair of mutually orbiting black holes. The currents men-tioned are equivalent to the gravitational stresses between two such objects."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors12 \u0001“The gods of that time and place were also uncertain of what you were. Likethem, you encompassed the entire Tree of Manifestation in its three aspects. But youhad fully fused the three aspects at a level of experience far below that at which theythemselves had done, and none of them knew of precedents that would aid in decid-ing your case, determining where you could fit into the scheme of things.“So, neither fish nor fowl, you wandered the universe, going wherever there wasneed of one or another combination of your three aspects. But never did you find aplace where you fit fully, and could use all your skills at once. And always, always,there was that tremendous sense of loss at your separation from your originalgroup, and an ache to fit in somewhere with companions of like powers and percep-tions. Alone and apparently unique, you conceived of yourself as the ‘solitary one’or the ‘unique one’. Eventually you shortened this to simply ‘one’, since one of any-thing is always unique and solitary. This you translated into Hebrew during yourlast completed cycle of incarnation on Earth, calling yourself ‘Achad’, and expressingyour full command of all the Tree in your two mottos, ‘O . I . V. V. I . O .’ and‘V. I . O . O . I . V.’.“But I digress. You continued to wander, seeking work worth your skills, until thecall went out seeking adepts of the Will aspect for the Earth's plan of salvage. Youwere far away in space and time, but a god who had known you in the old days andhad felt the gods' equivalent of compassion for you and frustration at his inability tohelp you, remembered and recommended you to the god Sirius. Sirius saw that youwere ideal for this work, for you had already demonstrated an ability to free yourselffrom traps of a far greater strength than the Earth's blockade would be, and youwere already capable of acting almost on the levels of the gods themselves. Thusyour presence would ensure that the shell could always be broken, no matter howbad the disaster.“You had also demonstrated your ability to live isolated from the universe atlarge for long periods, during your captivity between the warring gods. Many of theadepts of Will who had already been considered had been passed over for this veryreason. They could not function without external contacts.“And again, being somewhat less than a full god, though fully expressing allaspects of the Tree, you were still capable of incarnating as a human being withouttoo great a loss of your higher perceptions. Thus you seemed ideal for the positionSirius sought to fill. After consultation with Sol and Earth, you were called to Siriusto have the proposal laid before you.“You agreed with Sirius' evaluation, and saw in the plan two possible benefits foryourself. First, the drop-forge environment Earth was to become was a reasonablesubstitute for the trap in which your own skills had been shaped and tempered.Thus you now had some hope that companions who would be your equals wouldcome out of it. If not from among the human souls on Earth, then from among theadepts called for the task. And, failing that, the additional experience might be suffi-cient to raise you to full godhood by the end of the cycle of closure. I am happy to"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Aczinor, Senior of Jupiter\u0001 13say that both of these goals have been accomplished, though few of your true com-panions are incarnate at this time.“Thus you became the head of that group called, in Liber AL, the ‘Kings of Earth’,but who prefer to be called Knights, for their task is one of aiding a good and righ-teous cause, and not one of rulership for its own sake. And the Knights of Will inthe Earth were formed from among the adepts of will who volunteered and werequalified for the task.“You ask why this was not said at the outset, in the visions of the Kerubic squares.The reason is that you would not have believed it. As it was, your resistance to whatwas shown about yourself was so great that everything had to be couched in sym-bols, and even those were slightly distorted. It could not have been otherwise, forSirius' rule still holds among the Knights, and in each life in incarnation the Knightmust recapitulate the whole of his evolution in the Earth. For such a recapitulationto succeed, it must be done blindly. And so you could not have known what wascoming, and your initial resistance was reasonable and appropriate. With what wehave given you since then, you are coming to accept the truth of what we say, andyou will eventually merge your incarnate and excarnate aspects again.“Nevertheless the Kerubic visions do contain many symbolic statements of whatwe have said here, particularly in the visions of the earthy lesser angle. That dark selfwho spoke in those visions, through whose eyes you seemed to see at times, ismerely that part of yourself that has been excluded from consciousness during yourrecapitulation.“We have been at this much of the day, and it is time to stop. Tomorrow we willfinish with my part of the tale.”4/11/86I tried to get contact using the usual invocations, but there seemed to be a greatdeal of interference. So I decided to delay the rest of Aczinor's tale for a day.4/12/86I did the invocations, and again found myself in the area of yellow land and bluesky that opened the previous vision of this Senior. I called upon Aczinor to appear,and he did so, looking essentially the same as in the previous vision. I did the sign ofSet and the signs of LVX. He replied with the same signs, and added the sign of fire,which he held until I returned it.I tested him with the pentagram of Earth and the hexagram of Jupiter, and nei-ther had any effect on him. I asked why he had done the sign of fire, since we were inthe Earth tablet at this time.He replied, “We are not in the Earth, but above it, in the airs of the planets fromwhich it was formed. But that is not the reason why I did the sign. It was done insalute to the master of the First Ray of Will who stands before me.”I decided this was an acceptable explanation, in view of the previous messages,and asked him to continue."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors14 \u0001“When we left off, we were at the point of describing the initiation of the Earth'sclosure, under the auspices of Sirius, Sol, and the Knights of Will within her sphere.You were described as the chief of the Knights, and a little of your history was given.We started to supplement this with additional information the next day, but thecurrents were against us and we cut off communication until today.“Before we continue, though, I wish to say a few more things in relation to whathas come before.“I said in the aborted session yesterday that the reason why your own path fromTiphereth to Binah was done alone, instead of with a group as is normally the casewas due to your duties as the chief of the Knights. In your position, by declarationof Sirius, you are required to recapitulate the whole of your own history of initiationin each of your incarnations. Since the initiation must be done blindly, we could notearlier explain the reasons for your isolation, despite your frequent requests over theyears that someone do so. I speak in this case for the other Knights, who have mon-itored and aided your progress through this current incarnation, while you did thedifficult task of repeating the unrepeatable.“We said before that it was only by a fluke that you became what you now are. Ifthings had been otherwise, you would never have come to the position you nowhold, nor would you have ever heard of it. You would still be down in the Tree withthe rest of your original group of companions of the spirit. But because of yourentrapment between the two conflicting gods, in that far-away place and time, youbecame more than a man, and somewhat less than a full god, long before your timewould have come in the normal course of evolution. You are indeed, as you have soaptly described it, a queer fish. Before the closure of the Earth in long-ago times,there were none known who duplicated the qualities of your own being, intermedi-ate between god and man, partaking of the nature of both in the fullest possiblemeasure, fusing them into a third thing for which the universe at that time had noname. With the closure of the Earth, and the development of other adepts of theWill aspect under the forceful conditions of the Earth, you have come to have atleast a few who are similar enough to yourself that you are able to communicatefully the quality of your being to them. But these are still not exactly like yourself,for the forge of Earth is not the forge of the stars in which you grew, and all of theadepts had companions of their own type with whom to develop. So your quality ofuniqueness has not been completely lost to the world, and Achad is still the appro-priate description of your being.“The conditions under which you grew to power and mastery are unrepeatable,as we have said, being a fluke of cosmic nature that will not likely come again. So itis nearly impossible to produce in matter a complete recapitulation of your devel-opment. In some instances, mere symbolic substitutions had to be made for thetrue powers that affected you in the original course.“To substitute for the two powers whose conflict gave your being the boost intomastery, you were in this life maneuvered into situations where you found yourselfin the middle of arguments and conflicts in which you had no personal interest. But"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Aczinor, Senior of Jupiter\u0001 15your presence acted to catalyze the manifestation of the full emotional force of theparticipants. These forces, being diverted from the direction in which they shouldhave gone, towards the opposing party, were directed instead onto yourself. Theseforces were in some instances of such an intensity that they did almost kill you, asdid the original forces. But these forces of the present day events would only havekilled your body, where the true forces of the original conflict would have resultedin the true annihilation of your being.“In the conflict between Paul Solomon and the other David6, you were given theopportunity by one of them to chose between them, and when you refused to chose,preferring to maintain your independence, he tried to kill you by psychic meansunder the guise of helping you. This resulted in the rip in your aura that was nothealed until your later contact with Nema. But at the time, this rip was a help, for itallowed the inner powers who supported Paul Solomon, on the other side of theconflict, to open you up to the spirit of the Earth at our request, so that you wouldhave a true feeling for the goal of your work from the beginning. Also they did theservice of prophesying the course of your work. And as you have found now, theirprophesy was accurate to the last decimal place, so to speak. Like all good prophe-sies it was incomprehensible at the time but perfectly clear when the events itreferred to occurred. Thus they referred among other things to `the One', Achad,who is yourself in your fullness, at a time when you had not even heard of Jones, letalone of Achad or his Tree.“Now this compensation of the forces of evil thrown at you by David, with theforces of healing and light thrown at you by the supporters of Solomon, was theclosest we could come in this incarnate world to the powers of the stars that causedyou to be as you are, in the beginning of time. We continued to bring you into suchsituations, of a lesser degree of force but greater duration, for several years after-ward. The circumstances that were engineered were designed to force you into thesolitary path that you had to take and to keep you there until the path had been trodto its end. The pain and confusion and loss you felt by this isolation, and your con-sequent efforts to rid yourself of the inhibiting influence were fairly good analogiesto the feelings and acts you did while caught between the two gods.“The loss of your original companions from before your entrapment and yourlater finding of them and experiencing of their noncomprehension of yourself wasduplicated in this life by the lack of comprehension the adepts showed for yourwork in its early stages, and in the rejection and insults of your skills that theyshowed. This was run concurrent with the other events that caused you to becomeisolated, so that the intensity of the isolation could be increased to the point neededfor this life's work. So the periods of your isolation in the entrapment and your laterisolation after your escape were run in parallel in this life, compacting the story'stwo similar parts into one for convenience.6. At the time I was working with Paul Solomon in 1973, there were two persons named David associated with his group, known as the Fellowship of the Inner Light. One, David Railly, seems to have been the reincarnation of the biblical King David. The other, whose name I have deliberately forgotten, seemed more an avatar of Loki, though I never found out for certain. It is the latter person who is mentioned here."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors16 \u0001“Thus your path in this life has been the closest possible duplication in incarna-tion of the original course of your initiation. Now that you have achieved the levelof Binah, the rule of Sirius is somewhat mitigated. But still, your whole course hasnot been trodden, so the blindness must continue in part for a short while yet, untilthe powers of the planets chose to bring you back into their fold. The timing of thiswill not be under your control or the control of your fellow knights, but is a deci-sion to be made by the gods themselves, in their own chosen time. But at the sametime, it is vital that you have a reasonably clear view of what has come before, so we,Aczinor and the Knights, must resort to this more indirect method of revealing yourpast. The memories on which what we say is based are open to you, but the time toseek them must be kept in the future for a short while yet. In the course of yourplanetary explorations in the next few months, more will come to you in the formof direct memories, as you have already had direct memories of your lives as Dee,and as the priestess of Isis and Set, and as the priest-child of Set in that same templein a later time, and of that other life in the middle ages in which you discovered thepath to the stars in the powers of the menhirs, and in that life in the last century,immediately preceding your incarnation as Jones, in which you met David the Isra-elite in his incarnation among the Indians.“The scope of your past is too great to be absorbed at once, and so these expedi-ents must be used to accustom your brain to the ideas, opening the channel bywhich the true memories will come.“Now I would like to continue with the story of the Earth's closing, but the nextsection is the responsibility of the goddess Lzinopo, who rules the lunar-earth cur-rents within the Earth Tablet. She will be the one to describe the manner of theremoval of the twin's ethers from Luna, and their incorporation into the body of theearth by yourself and the other Knights. She will also go into some other thingsrelated to your own course in that time and place, and how these affect your currentwork.“To do this, invoke her at the time and place that you will, but soon, so that thecurrents you began with the invocation of Iczhihal will continue to flow withoutneed for re-initiation.”I said that this was acceptable, and asked if there was anything else he wished tosay at this time. He indicated not, but added that if I had any questions, he wouldsurely answer.I asked, as a matter of curiosity, if he could tell me the meaning of his name.“My name, Aczinor, means `Wisdom flowing from the waters of Night'. Wisdomis of course the province of Jove among the planets, as truth is the province of Sat-urn. Night, in this case, is the Earth herself, who is the manifest representation ofthe powers of the True Mother, Nuit. It is from her womb that these waters of wis-dom flow. Thus I embody the principles of wisdom in the element of Earth, as myopposite, Saturn, embodies factual truth.”I thanked Aczinor for his efforts on my behalf, and gave him license to depart."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Lzinopo, Senior of Luna\u0001 17Lzinopo, Senior of Luna4/13/86I invoked the forces of the Senior Lzinopo of the Tablet of Earth. The Seniorappeared as a woman, dressed in a long flowing gown of a dark blue or violet color.On her head she wore a crown like the waxing moon, with the limbs of the moonprojecting out on either side of her head. She had a high rounded forehead, likeQueen Elizabeth I, coupled with a square jaw. She stood turned about 30 degrees toher right. Her right hand was held forward, with the palm cupped upwards in a ges-ture of pouring. Her left arm was held at her side, with the hand facing to the rear,and it was bent at the wrist so that it was also cupped upwards.From her right hand, I saw fall what appeared to be either grain or flakes of silver.These fell, but before they could hit the ground they were blown backwards betweenher legs, and appeared to flow upwards from there into her womb, which was con-cealed by her robes. Then, from the womb descended another stream, this time ofgolden flakes, which again were blown backwards before they could hit the ground.This second stream flowed up and landed in the palm of her left hand. A moon wasembroidered on her left shoulder, and a sun was embroidered on the right shoulder.I did the LVX signs, and the Sign of Set. The image of the Senior slowly rotateduntil she was facing me, still holding the position in which she first appeared. Thefront of her robe was cut deep, so that the tops of her teats could be seen. The edgeof the cut was embroidered with a design of golden bees and butterflies. Her skinwas white, but her feet, sticking out beneath the robe, were black.I did the LVX signs and the sign of Set again, and she did not respond. The pen-tagram of Earth and the hexagram of Luna caused the background to becomebrighter, but had no effect on her. Testing with the letters made her grow larger, butstill she did not move. Finally, I tried the signs of the rending and closing of the veil,at which she straightened up and replied with all the signs I had given, plus the signof fire, which I returned.She said, “I salute you, o mage who is the power of Will within the Earth, withthe sign of your power among the elements. I am the goddess Lzinopo, who is asenior within the Tablet of Earth at the bidding of our goddess who resides in theplanet Earth.“Now, to answer your unspoken question, the reason I did not at first respond toyour gestures and signs was so that you could get a full view of my magickal image.This will be important later, for reasons we will not now go into. I also did so toexpress that I not only symbolize the so-called Lunar current within the Earth, butam also of the nature of the Earth herself. The combination of the Lunar flexibilityand changefulness with the power and stability of the Earth bring about that condi-tion known as stillness and silence, which are the primary virtues of the elements ofEarth. The gesture in which I stand is a traditional gesture of Isis and of Nepthys,the revealed and the hidden powers of the Earth. My countenance also reveals mycombination, with the lunar forehead and the earthy jaw. So too with the combined"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors18 \u0001forces of the Sun and Moon which are shown in the grains or flakes that fall fromone hand into my womb, and out into the other hand. Meditate on this for a while,after we have finished here, and you will see some significant symbolism of theEarth in this.“The bees and butterflies are also traditional symbols of the Moon and of thefemale sex, for obvious reasons.“Now in order to continue with the tale of the Earth's closing, we must give youjust a little more information about your own position in the matter, and the rela-tions between you and certain other adepts who had been considered for the posi-tion which you now hold.“In the time when the adepts of Will were being selected for their part in the taskof the Earth, there were several adepts of Will already working in the solar system.These were not First Ray adepts, as you yourself are, but adepts of the first sub-ray ofthe Second Ray of Love-Wisdom, which is the common keynote of our system.Among these was one who working in Sol's sphere, doing the work of connectingthe Earth with Sol's pattern.“This one, who felt that he was best qualified by his previous experience in thesystem, and by his intimate connection with the Earth, wanted to be the leader ofthe group which was to handle and integrate the force of the dying brother into theaura of the Earth. Being of the Second Ray, he was comfortable in the system, andhe felt that his ease of movement and ability to direct the forces made him the bestqualified for this job. However, he was somewhat lacking in the ability to operatealone, having grown up spiritually in direct and full contact with many of the cos-mic forces, and having attained his initiations through group work, as is normallythe case. In the position you now hold, he would have required the force of all theother adepts of Will to crack through the shell of Earth at the time when the workwas completed. He did not feel that this was a handicap, since once the closureoccurred, none of the adepts could escape from the earth, and therefore would beavailable at the proper time.“But an adept of the Will aspect of Love is a far different thing that the adept ofthe Love aspect of Will, such as yourself. The Second Ray adepts are proficient atgathering together and integrating energies, but are less able to deal with the releaseof those energies back into chaos, which is what this task requires at its end. It wasfelt by the gods involved that allowing him to be the chief of the Knights would leaveopen a possibility that the shell would not be cracked, if his identification with hisbeing in the Earth became strong enough in the intervening thousands of millennia.“What was needed was one who was not entirely comfortable in the system,being of another nature, so that even in the body the system would tend to rejecthim. This would ensure that the chief's identification with the manifest earth wouldnever be strong enough to preclude his necessary rejection of it in the breaking ofthe shell.“It was at this point that you were brought to Sol by Sirius, and examined for theposition you hold. The candidates were gathered, and tested in their ways and abili-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Lzinopo, Senior of Luna\u0001 19ties. Of all examined, only two had the minimum qualifications, you and that otherwe speak of.“There was really no question in the minds of Sirius and Sol that you were thebetter qualified, so the examinations were more or less pro forma. But this other onedid his best to convince them that he was better, and so they selected him as thealternate, in case some misfortune happened to prevent you from doing the work atthe last moment.“One can not really say that this being was jealous of you, for such is an emotionthat only manifests in the lower bodies. But the adepts of Love-Wisdom have onefault, which is that often, being identified with the essential force of our system, theybelieve that their perspective is greater than it is, that their own evaluation is theonly evaluation possible. In their identification with the solar force, they take onsomething of the sense of inclusiveness that is his, but without also taking on theperspective needed to truly manifest that inclusiveness. This fault reflects, on ahigher level, the egoism of the integrated personality in the worlds below Tiphereth.All of the rays have their faults, which are usually the same as their virtues, exceptexaggerated. The First Ray types like yourself have the fault of being over-persistent,of being too forceful in their presentation of their will for the matter on which theyare working. Thus, left to themselves, they sometimes tend to produce degenerateversions of what they should have done. Such types are very dangerous within a sys-tem of the Second Ray type, and so they can only manifest here under the greatest ofrestrictions. In your present life, and in the case of your previous incarnation asDee, these limits were applied by withholding from you the powers to match yourwill until you were sufficiently advanced to restrain yourself.“So the chief and alternate were chosen, and the lesser adepts who would fill outthe organization of the Knights of Will in the Earth were chosen, under the recom-mendation of Sol and Earth, each for his particular purpose in the scheme. Whenthis was done, the preparations for the actual closure began.“Now as was said by Aczinor, during all this time the moon was held in a psychicstasis in which no actions could occur. The spirit who inhabited the moon, beinghealed of his shame and his desire to rectify the situation on his own, was given overto certain gods in another system, to continue his training in the methods thatwould prevent him from being caught in a similar situation in the future. This sepa-ration of the spirit from the life of the ethers, the part of his being that had beentrapped, was performed by Aczinor. Being the closest in nature to Luna's spiritamong the Seniors of Jove, who is the manifestation of the synthetic aspect of Love-Wisdom, it was he who was called upon to draw away the living substance from thelunar body and to bring it here to Earth. Sol opened a gap in his stasis, away fromthe point where the Lunar Lord was connected to his body, and slowly he allowedthe force of etheric life to flow to that opening. As it flowed, it was picked up by Acz-inor and drawn across the short distance into the Earth's inner aura. When therewas no life left in the lunar body, the connection between the Lunar Lord and thatbody shriveled and disappeared, since no more of his life could enter through Sol's"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors20 \u0001continuing stasis. Thus he “died”, in the sense that he could no longer be consideredas having a connection with his body of manifestation.“This all took place many millions of years ago, in the middle of the Cretaceousperiod of Earth's history. The absorption of the etheric substance of the deadbrother into the body of the Earth caused an intensification of the Earth's magneticfield, and in the etheric equivalent of that field, her life-aura. And as a consequence,the amount of radiation coming into the Earth was substantially reduced. Thispurely physical effect was the first stage of the Earth's closure. Coupled with a reduc-tion by Sol in the physical radiation output from his body, this caused a climatolog-ical change which eventually resulted in the extinction of the major animal formsthen inhabiting the Earth. The was part of the Earth's plan, this change being thefirst of the methods by which the animal bodies would be put under stress to forcetheir evolution.“The Earth was not fully closed at this point, but the time of closure followedsoon upon it. The adepts of will came to Earth, and the first of their tasks was tomake use of the new force of the dead brother to complete that closure.“Before this could be done, preparations had to be made. In order for the Earthto experience the work of the adepts in the manner decreed by Sirius, each adepthad to be fused on one level with her energies, in a marriage of spirits. On a cosmiclevel, this fusion took place through a process analogous to the sexual process inhumans, which leaves a permanent connection between the participants. In effect,and speaking very loosely, the Earth allowed herself to be raped by these adepts,allowed them to take into themselves the essence of her spiritual substance, and toplace that substance completely under each adept's individual control. She became the whore of these man-gods, accepting all that they thrust into her,and giving all that they took from her, without expression of her own will, com-pletely passively. To allow the adepts this freedom on her, she had to concentrate herconsciousness to the point where her will was completely divorced from her bodiesof manifestation. She concentrated her consciousness in her equivalent of thewomb, her navel chakra, in the mode of receptiveness, and divorced her conscious-ness from the rest of her body. (Her life, of course, continued to regulate the actionsof that body without her attention, in the same way that a human being does nothave to consciously think about the processes of digestion or circulation of blood inorder for those processes to function.)“The adepts of Will, who at that time were all operating on the levels of the solarsystem, now had to create for themselves the various bodies of manifestation thatwould allow them to function in her sphere. These bodies, the so-called Atmic bodyof the hindus, and the body that is called the soul, they built directly out of the liv-ing substance of the Earth, forming it to their Will without regard for her awareness.In doing this, they created the prototypes, the models, on which the human bodiesof this current day and those more developed bodies to come in the future wouldeventually be based. Their very presence in these levels, and their act of will in forc-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Lzinopo, Senior of Luna\u0001 21ing the substance of the Earth into the desired forms, initiated the changes thatwould lead to incarnate humans seventy million years in the future.“From that day forward the Earth progressed and developed only through herconnection with the adepts, as they did their work within her. Gone was the possi-bility of her active development under her own will, until such time as the involu-tionary force of the dead brother's ethers was completely eradicated. She nowprogressed by reflection of the adepts as they recapitulated their own paths of initia-tion within her sphere. This has all been gone into in much more detail in thevisions of the Kerubic squares, and we need not expand on it any more here.“In the visions of the fiery lesser angle of the Earth Tablet, it was shown how aforce of Will, represented by the element of fire, becomes encapsulated when it isforced into the Earth. This is an automatic effect, requiring no conscious effort onany being's part. In the instance we are examining now, the force of Will was theforce of the Knights of Will in the Earth, as they took and manipulated her sub-stance to their own ends. The force of Will presented by the adepts, particularly byyourself who was more than an adept though less than a god, caused such an encap-sulation to take effect on a scale that caused the entire earth to be enclosed withinthe shell. Thus was the earth cut off from the heavens, and thus was her sleep withinher own womb made complete. And thus has it continues to this present day, whenthe shell is about to be broken again.“And thus also we complete our own presentation for the moment. More will begiven if you return in the next few days and invoke the next of the Seniors in theseries, Alhctga, Senior of Venus, who will show how the adepts made use of theforces of involution to force the development of bodies suitable to the task ofdestroying that very force. She will also go more into the developing conflictbetween yourself and your alternate, which is the basis for so much of the religiousmythology of later ages. If you have any questions, ask them now, please.”I asked her to describe the nature and limits of this shell that was formed by thepresence of the adepts. What could enter into it, and what could go.“This shell is primarily on the levels of consciousness, those levels that beginwith the ego in Netzach, and end with the individual pattern of destiny in Chesed.The lower levels, which are merely matter, with no inherent self-consciousness, areopen to the outside. But the energies that can get in even on those levels are dis-torted by the aura of the earth in their passage, so that communication with theoutside is problematical and subject to many errors. On these levels, the shell actsmainly to keep the involutionary force inside, rather than keeping the outside fromcoming in.“On the egoic-solar levels, the shell is two-way. That is, it keeps all but a fewbeings of a certain type from coming into the earth, and also keeps any involution-ary forces that have come that high from getting out. Again, some inward commu-nication is possible, but it is often distorted. The main effect is to keep those soulswho are on Earth now within her sphere of action. None who are here can reallyescape from the earth, although it is possible to send portions of the consciousness"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors22 \u0001outwards, provided they are of a sufficiently pure character, and get back informa-tion from outside. But they can not leave the Earth completely, and can only incar-nate within her sphere, until the shell is broken again. Similarly, souls of the humantype who are outside the Earth’s sphere of action can not come in and join the fun,but can sometimes send projections of themselves to see what is happening.“On the levels above Chesed, the shell does not really exist, but the thought-forms created in the minds of men by the isolation of the lower levels generallyinsures that they do not think of the outside without some outside influence con-tacting them first. This is changing rapidly in this present day, though, as the con-sciousness of space produced by the space programs and the use of communicationsatellites sends men's minds outwards again. The American lunar landings, and thelandings and fly-past missions to the other planets by our unmanned spacecraft area sign that the shell around the earth is deteriorating and will soon fall.“On a physical level, the shell extends somewhat beyond the orbit of the moon inthe form of an almost-spherical torus. That is, the shell is closer to the Earth at thepoles than at the equator, and tends to hollow inwards right above the poles. Theforces making up the shell rotate in both a spiral around the center of the earth, andin a spiral around the ring of the torus, much in the way that magnetic fields causeelectrons to move.”As I did with Aczinor, I asked her to explain the meaning of her name.She said, “My name, Lzinopo, means `first to come from the depths', or `first inthe lower waters', depending on context. I am the flowing watery aspect of theEarth, its changeableness and its physical adaptability. I rule the production of newforms out of her substance, which is why I was chosen to give this part of the storywhich has to do with such creations. Also, being of the `lunar', receptive nature, Iam also of her `mother' aspect. I represent the link between her and those greaterwaters which flow from the womb of Nuit, her correspondence on the cosmic levels.Thus I am first to come out of her waters into those larger waters, among the powersthat serve her.“Now, do you have any more questions? If not, I will take my leave. Do not forgetto invoke next the powers of Alhctga, so that the story will continue in its properorder.”I told her I could not think of any other questions, and gave her license to depart.(I note here that I had a great deal of difficulty keeping my mind passive enoughto receive this communication clearly. It seemed that even the slightest evidence ofwill on my part tended to distort it a little, so that the grammar became stilted inplaces. I suspect that this is due to the reflective, lunar nature of the force of theSenior.)"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Alhctga, Senior of Venus\u0001 23Alhctga, Senior of Venus4/14/86I invoked the Senior of Venus in the Tablet of Earth, named Alhctga. The cur-rents of force felt strong, but did not show any tendency to produce an image.After several invocations, the Senior appeared as a woman, dressed in a flowinggreen and amber robe (the cloth shimmered in these colors as she moved). Her hairwas a honey-blonde color, worn loose to her shoulders. On her head was a circlet ofcopper, with a star of seven points mounted on the front, covering the ajna chakra.The skin of her face and hands was a mediterranean olive-tan color. She appeared tobe pregnant, and held her left hand to her belly. Her right hand was held forward inthe same gesture as was shown by Lzinopo in the previous visions, but nothing fellfrom her hand. Her face was middling-narrow with a fine bone structure. A smallsatisfied smile creased her face. The hem of her robe was embroidered with dovesand serpents, and an occasional double-headed eagle.I did the 5=6 signs, and the signs of Set and LVX. She responded in kind, andthen held her hands out to her sides as if inviting me to come closer and embraceher. I tested her with the pentagram of Earth and the hexagram of Venus. Neitherhad any effect except to brighten the area a little. Testing with the letters also had noeffect.I invited her to speak, and she said, “Come closer and embrace me, o mage ofWill, for I have the power of the Earth in her fullness within me, and you are thefather. Therefore do I take a mother's right with her mate.”I willed myself forward and embraced her. Her eyes could be seen to be of a verydeep green color, with streaks of olive and amber-brown. She leaned against mewithin the embrace for a moment, then stepped back.She said, “My name, Alhctga, means `closest in spirit to the Mother'. I am theexample of what the Earth's eventual force within the system will be after her rising.For the Earth is intended to express the force of Love-Wisdom within the system, inits reproductive aspect and its desire aspect, where the planet Venus expresses thatforce in its egoic aspect, and Jupiter expresses the synthetic aspect. Since you havecaused her to awaken slightly, therefore is she aware again of the power of her mate,and has taken some of it into herself. As the force of the union increases, she passesit on to those of us who are her servants, so that we might prepare in our own wayfor the rising that is to come. You have not yet seen your mate in these visions, andwill not until the day of the marriage, when you again rise into the stars and take herwith you to meet the planetary lives of the system as a new, greater being than whenshe laid herself in her womb to sleep.“Now being of the reproductive aspect of the Earth, and of her spiritual aspect aswell, it is my task to explain the ways in which the Adepts of Will had their way onher, in the early and middle days of the hiding, before the appearance of humanbeings incarnate in the body. I will show you the ways in which the adepts used theinvolutionary forces of the dead brother of Luna to force the growth of more"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors24 \u0001refined, tougher forms within her sphere. To begin with, we must again speak of thedeveloping conflict between you and the one appointed as your alternate.“In the early days of the Hiding, many thousand of millennia ago, there were nobodies on the Earth that could be used for the incarnation of intelligent, self-awarebeings. Since the appearance of such beings was vital to the eventual elimination ofthe involutionary force within a reasonable span of time, the first task of the Knightsof Will within her was to initiate the processes that would eventually lead to theappearance of such suitable bodies. In terms of its effect on the goal, this was theleast important of the periods of time, though it was the longest as it would be mea-sured by incarnate intelligences. These later periods after the appearance in bodiesof true human beings are much shorter. But the intensity of the effects working noware such that the difference between the earth before the Hiding and afterwards formany thousands of millennia is minuscule by comparison.“But nevertheless, this creation of bodies had to precede the important part ofthe work, or that work could never be done. Effectively, the Knights of Will had tocreate a situation in which the evolution of the physical animal bodies would beaccelerated several fold. To do this, they had to make use of the involutionary forceof the dead brother.“Now at this point there came a disagreement over methods, between you andyour alternate. As usual, he was trying in some way to take away the leadership ofthe group from yourself, so that he could be the one who would be the initiator ofthe Earth's rising in this present day. Lzinopo has already gone over the ways inwhich the powers of the adepts of the Will sub-ray of the Second Ray, and of theLove sub-ray of the First Ray, could degenerate or be exaggerated into faults. Both ofyou, you and your alternate, possess the faults to match your virtues, and alwayshave done so. This was inevitable, since neither of you really had any competitionon your own level to slap you down.“But within the framework of the Earth, you, of the two of you, has tended to bemore cautious and workmanlike in the manifestation of your force. You being aliento the system's essential keynote, the system tends to backfire on you more rapidlythat on your alternate and thus you retain more caution in your actions. Your alter-nate on the other hand, being comfortable with and in the Second Ray, tends tojump ahead of himself, thinking he knows it all and can do whatever he wants with-out care of caution.“Now at the point in manifest time of which we speak, the Knights were discuss-ing the ways in which the involutionary force could be used to accelerate evolution.Being of the First Ray, and having experienced the effects of forceful invasion ofyour being in the time of your entrapment, you held that the organism itself mustalways be held inviolate. That is, that the involutionary force should never, ever, bemerged into the actual physical bodies of the animals being evolved. Rather, itshould be applied to the organism from the outside, in the form of rapid and unex-pected environmental changes. This would allow the evolutionary aspect of the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Alhctga, Senior of Venus\u0001 25Third Ray within the animal bodies to operate freely in its adaptation to new condi-tions.“Your alternate, being of the Second Ray, was inclined to merge the involutionaryand evolutionary forces within the same body, and to try to harmonize them by bal-ancing their conflict in the nervous systems of the animals themselves. He felt thiswould be more effective than your own method.“As it has turned out now, your own method was the better of the two, and wasthe one that eventually was adopted for most of the surface of the planet. But at thattime it was questionable whether one or the other was better, since it had not beforebeen tried in the knowledge of any available source.“Your alternate managed to convince a large minority of the Knights to supporthis own proposal. This group, while not large enough to over-rule your own deci-sion on the matter, was strong enough to demand that their own ideas be given afair test. Therefore two areas of the Earth's surface, each at that time reasonably iso-lated, were designated as test areas. The one given over to your own plans was thearea now known as East Africa. The one given over to your alternate's plan was thearea now known as Australia-New Zealand. These two land masses, having sepa-rated from each other only recently as geological times go, still had comparablegroups of animals on them. But they were far enough separated that there wouldnot be any cross-fertilization between them.“So the two of you and your adherent adepts went to work. Within the area ofAfrica you caused severe climatic and geological changes to take place, using theinvolutionary force to produce these changes as you needed them. The food short-ages, and the increased dangers to survival, you believed would cause a rapidincrease in adaptation among these creatures, making them more versatile andresilient, able to adapt that much more quickly to future changes. Eventually youhoped to create a creature that would be able to not only adapt itself to its environ-ment but to cause modifications of that environment for its own use.“Your alternate, on the island continent of Australia-New Zealand, did notindulge in such climatological modifications to any great extent. He consideredthem unimportant, and did not even attempt to control those natural changes thattook place within his area of work except when they became too extreme to allowhis subjects to live. In his area, he attempted to fuse the involutionary aspect of theThird Ray with the evolutionary, hoping and expecting that this would create inter-nal stresses in the animals that would cause their bodies to adapt and become morerefined. Eventually, he hoped, the forces in these bodies would cancel out com-pletely. Since the amount of involutionary force within the Earth was much lessthan the amount of evolutionary force, his idea was that even after the involution-ary force was entirely canceled (over a period of millions of years in billions of ani-mal bodies) there would still be enough evolutionary force left so that the Earthcould go back to her original plan of expression within the system. That this ideawas in direct conflict with the intent of the Earth herself did not bother him, sincethere were none but yourself who could prevent him, and you, being the consum-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors26 \u0001mate individualist that you were, would not do so without at least a fair test. Hefigured that a fait accompli would put him on top again among the adepts of thesystem, and even Sol would not be able to say him nay.“But alas for this plan, his system did not work well enough to be continued.After several million years, a sudden change in climate caused all the animal lifeover the largest portion of his work area to be killed off, and the coming of a desertcondition that appeared to be permanent prevented the remaining animal livesfrom ever gaining the needed strength and numbers again. Thus, even his ownadherents decided that his plan would not work and it was decided to abandon it infavor of your own plan, which seemed to be working well.“(I should point out here that your own manipulations of the African climate ledto the changes in his work area. He could have prevented them if he had paid moreattention to the climatological effects, but he had not done so. You had warned himseveral times that he should do so, and predicted the result that came. But he hadrejected it as gratuitous carping on your part. Since you were all now working on alower level than before, such emotional reactions were now possible, and heexpressed them in this instance. He blamed you directly for the failure of his plan,and vowed privately to perform an act of revenge at a later point in your own work.But he missed his chance the first time, and after that you were warned and manip-ulated his anger to your own ends.)“Meanwhile, the animals of your own area of work had been adapting constantlyand continuously to the changes you had forced upon them. Many of them devel-oped sufficiently to be able to survive over ranges of climate that would have killedany of their predecessors in less than a day. And not only to survive, but to flourish.The population had not only increased despite the changes, but had increased invariety far beyond what you yourself had expected. Large numbers had evenescaped the work area and fled to other lands, spreading the adaptations far andwide.“Now in view of their relative success there was no question in the minds of theadepts that the external-threat system of forced evolution was superior to the inter-nal-conflict model. So even your alternate abandoned his project, and went to workto spread the new animal lives about the globe and to force even more adaptationswithin their being. Thus, the modern mammals and birds became the ruling classesof the animals upon the Earth, and the marsupial descendants of the alternate'sexperiment were left to develop as they could in the new conditions. Some of themdid evolve significantly once the internal pressure of the involutionary force wasremoved, but none ever came fully up to the standards of the mammals.“All of these events took place during what man now calls the Tertiary period ofevolution on Earth. Within that period, the time of experiment ended abouttwenty-five thousands of millennia ago. By the beginning of what is now called theMiocene epoch, the adapted animal forms had been spread all about the Earth, andhad taken root and begun to adapt even more on their own, filling every availableniche in the ecological pattern."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Alhctga, Senior of Venus\u0001 27“This time-scale seems vast from the standpoint of an incarnate intelligence, Iknow. But from the point of view of the Adepts of Will, it was more brief than thelater period in which human-like beings had appeared. On the levels on which theywere working, time as man now knows it did not exist, and duration, the rate atwhich events are experienced, could be varied widely by the will. So it did not seemall that long from their viewpoint.“It was only after the appearance of man-like or ape-like beings that the workagain began in earnest. These being represented the ultimate in adaptability andnervous-system development of all those animals that had been forced to evolve.And they had already begun to use tools on their own, to change their environment,when it was discovered that their nervous systems had developed enough to incar-nate a human-type soul.“There were several species that showed potential for full awareness and intelli-gence, and it was decided that all of them would be tested and set against each otherto see which would come out best. This testing began about seven million or eightmillion years ago, with the appearance of the first true hominid species, which weresmall ape-like beings. It continued in irregular spurts up to the present time, as onespecies after another showed itself to be of less than human potential and wasdropped from the schedule. Usually these beings were rapidly killed off by the com-peting species who were still within the testing cycle.“About a million, a thousand thousand years ago, the last three of these specieshad been selected and set against each other in competition for living space andfood. Eventually one of them won out, and became the only truly human species ofEarth. But this species again fragmented as small populations became isolated fromthe main group and began to evolve even more on their own in the less fruitful areasof the world that circumstances forced them to. With the increased adaptations thattheir extreme living conditions gave them, they eventually migrated into the areascontrolled by the main group, and either supplanted that group or mixed with it,either way leaving their own genes in charge and causing the weaker genes of thelosers to disappear from the race. This occurred several times more during theintervening millennia, and each time the replacing race was stronger and moreadaptable that its predecessor. Eventually we came to a point where all of the ani-mal-humans were fully capable of holding all of a human soul. Though at that pointthe consciousness aspect of the humans could still not be fully expressed. The livesof men, the connection between the heart center of the body and the life aspect ofthe soul that enlivens the body, had been in place since the first appearance of thehominids. Now the consciousness aspect, which was present but rudimentary in theraces, had to become fully developed.“Now at this time on earth, the human souls who lived within her sphere weregathered into a community on the astral plane. There was a civilization there thatcompared favorably with most of the present-day human societies in manifestation,as far as human thought and behavior went. Since, on the astral, there was no inher-ent need for competition, this society was relatively peaceful and given to simple"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors28 \u0001human artistic pursuits, along with the normal interactions between souls thatmake up the substance of most lives. There was no pain that was not self-created,and no horrors of any sort. This would not have been the case if the earth had beenopen to the stars in that time. If that had been the situation, then conflict wouldhave been more prevalent, as one or another group sensed the force of one oranother cosmic being and attempted to put its energy into practice in their lives. Butthe isolation of the Earth made for relative stability and coherence in the group ofhuman souls. This was the civilization that is remembered today in the legends ofAtlantis, and Mu, and of other “lost” civilizations.“The manner in which the consciousness of human souls was forced to comedown into the bodies completely has been covered in the visions of the Airy LesserAngle of the Earth Tablet, and we need not go into it again here. But we shouldremind you for purposes of reference that it was you yourself who was the cause ofthe fall into matter, and thus it is you who was the proximate cause of the legends ofLucifer, the angel who fell and carried the legions of angels with him. This sameevent was the cause of the legend of the snake in the garden of Eden, who temptedthe more receptive (and therefore more “female”) human souls to become attractedto matter, and to leave the light of the sun for the darkness of Earth.“Now in the foregoing years, before the fall, you had spent several different“incarnations” on the astral plane, trying to convince the souls there to go into mat-ter willingly. But most would not hear you, and so you devised a plan, with theother adepts of the Will, to cause the fall to take place involuntarily. This was theevent that was described as the act of the child who studied crystals, in the accountof your past lives in the Kerubic visions.“I said that I would not say much on this, so I had better stop now. But there ismore to be seen in this area before you go on to the next senior, Liiansa, so youshould again invoke me before that time. I will come to your call, and we will seewhat remains to be seen.”4/15/86I called upon Alhctga again, and she appeared. This time she was not pregnant,but all other aspects of her appearance were the same. I did the 5=6 signs, and thesigns of LVX and of Set. She responded with the sign of Set, and then transformedher body into the various crosses and symbols of LVX. Then she reformed as awoman and saluted me with the fire sign.“Hail, o mage of Will, hail to you, and homage to you! For in the dark of nightyou have brought the light again to the Earth, and the Earth rises up in response.“Now during the previous day, we had difficulty speaking together, and thereseemed to be some inhibition working to make the communication weak. This is inpart due to the fact that you are operating under a transit of Saturn, but more to thefact that we are here dealing with energies far beyond what might normally beencountered in an invocation of these squares of the Tablet."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Alhctga, Senior of Venus\u0001 29“To continue with our story of yesterday, we were about to tell of the way inwhich you caused the souls of men to become incarnate consciously in bodies forthe first time.“In that time of which we speak, man was living in consciousness primarily onthe astral levels. Those few parts of his consciousness that had been fused with thephysical body were concerned with the operation and functioning of that body inthe world, its maintenance and basic survival, and so seemed dark to the larger partof awareness that remained upon the astral levels.“It has long been known that the lower levels of the astral reflect the heavinessand inertia of the lower earth, and the darkness and seeming evil there acts as a bar-rier between the incarnate existence and the astral. This barrier today acts mainly tokeep men from becoming fully aware of their astral life, which they continue intheir dreams but which they do not remember in the waking incarnate state.“In those earlier times, the barrier's effect was mainly in the opposite direction,keeping the astral self from remembering those parts of its being that existed uponthe manifest plane of Malkuth. This barrier was the main difficulty to be overcomein forcing the fall of man into matter.“You will recall from the visions of the fiery lesser angle of the Earth Tablet thatthe energies of matter have a mode of rotation opposite to that natural to the higherplanes. The friction between these counter-rotating planes was what created thedarkness on the lower astral, and the barrier between them.“The entire purpose of the work of the Earth, her plan for the removal of theinvolutionary force from the solar system, took on a rapid increase in activity at thispoint. Where the previous thousands of millennia had been given over to the refine-ment of bodies through the external-threat model of evolution, now the main riteof the work must come into being. The involutionary force had to be placed into theconsciousness of man, so that by his will and his awareness, and his striving toreturn to the spirit, it might be overcome and eliminated while at the same time giv-ing a tremendous boost to the development of consciousness in the cosmos. Wherebefore the force only acted upon the bodies from the outside, now it must be incor-porated into the feelings and minds of men, so that the conflict might be resolvedforever.“To do this, and also to get the greater part of the awareness of each soul down tothe level of Malkuth, you took the involutionary energies and formed them into avortex, a whirlpool, on the higher levels of the material plane. Since the involution-ary force also has a rotation opposite to that of the evolutionary aspect in matter, itsrotation was identical with that of the astral levels. The only thing separating it fromthe astral before this time was the intervening evolutionary aspect, and the effect ofSaturn upon this low plane by reflection from his normal place beyond the Tree ofLife.“So you gathered this whirlpool around yourself on the physical plane (theetheric levels of that plane). Then by your concentration upon the relation betweenthe astral and the physical, from a viewpoint on the lower astral, you caused the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors30 \u0001effect of that vortex to be drawn upwards through the barrier that separates theastral from the physical. You opened the gate into hell for the innocent lives of theearly men. That this was done at the bidding of the planet herself was not known tothem, and so they perceived your action as evil after the desired effect had been fullyachieved.“Having opened the gate, you yourself were the first to pass through it, leavingbehind the astral to explore the physical through the senses of the body. Havingdone so, you returned with reports of what was in that place, seeking to inspire curi-osity and a will to see among the humans. Some of these responded, and not all byany means were your fellow adepts of the Will aspect. For even in that time, whenhumans were merely a form of angel or deva, passive to the action of higher forces,some of them by flukes of nature were prepared for this work and became attracted.“Each one who passed through the gate and returned to the astral culturebrought with him a bit of the involutionary force. By contact with the others on thatplane, the force was slowly spread throughout the astral assembly of men. Theybecame infected with the force unawares, and its effect on them, the changes it madein their perceptions, were not immediately grasped by them.“But eventually it became clear to even the most innocent that somethingunprecedented was happening. Where before the astral community had been rela-tively stable and unified, now there was growing dissent. Conflicts arose as the per-ceptions of men were changed by the experience of the involutionary Third Rayforce. What had once been whole now became divided. Groups of men on the astralcame into conflict, and the way in which the society was to be governed became amatter of debate instead of natural activity. Some held for attempting to retain theold state. Some held for going immediately into matter. Others developed opinionsthat were at odds with any type of perception known to man up to then.“This growing development of conflict is remembered to this day in the stories ofthe fall of Atlantis, how the priests of the different gods fought, and in their fightingcaused Atlantis to sink beneath the waves. This sinking was not the sinking of a landmass into a physical ocean, as it is usually interpreted, but instead is the sinking ofman down through the astral waters to the material world.“Having tied nearly all the souls of men in existence into that vortex throughtheir infection by the ones who had passed through it, you now did the act whichcaused men to fall into matter no matter what their will. Focusing yourself on thehighest levels of the material world, you caused these souls to be drawn to youthrough the gate by their connection with its energy. You caused the vortex todescend from the astral and this caused a corresponding descent of man.“Having brought men into matter, on the side of consciousness, you now closedthe door to the astral fully, locking them in until by the force of will they wouldeventually break out again. With the door closed the vortex was no longer needed,and you caused its energies to be dispersed among the population, each one absorb-ing his share of the involutionary force to the extent he was able despite his desires"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Alhctga, Senior of Venus\u0001 31in the matter. The rest of the force, that could not immediately be held, was dis-persed back into the environment.“While this event seemed to occur rapidly from a viewpoint on the astral plane,in the realms where time governs it was spread over many years, as the souls hadchances to incarnate in the limited number of bodies available. In manifest time, theevent began at the end of the tertiary period, and continued on well into the quater-nary, or most recent, epoch.“At the same time, the concentrated involutionary force that was released backinto the environment caused a degradation of the living conditions on earth,through a reduction in the amount of heat escaping from the Earth's core. Thiscaused the climate to vary widely, rapidly swinging from hot to glaciated and backagain, putting extreme stress for survival onto the now incarnate humans. Theneeds for survival forced the human souls to make use of that faculty of their beingnow known among men as the concrete mind, forced them to make use of theirhigher faculties within the limits of incarnate existence.“The involutionary force in men's minds caused them to perceive each other asenemies, if they were not already familiar with each other. This time was one ofgreat killing of man by man, and of tribe by tribe. The many skulls from this periodfound by archaeologist that had damaged skulls are evidence of the severity of theproblem. At the same time, man perceived the involutionary force in his environ-ment, in the form of the dangers to himself, and the concrete mind had to be usedto devise ways of countering the danger from both man and world. Thus was bornthe beginnings of civilization, in the gathering of men for the protection of eachother against other men and the environment. “In many ways, the conflicts between men within each group were more intensethan the conflicts with external dangers. For the need for survival caused them torefrain from killing each other as easily as they killed strangers, and this restraint letthe force build up. It was the effort to devise ways to live with each other despite thetendencies of the involutionary force, as much as it was the effort to devise protec-tion against the outside, that caused the concrete mind to be developed.“The effort to survive caused thought-forms to appear on the astral and mentallevels, which incorporated a will to counter the effects of the involutionary force.These thought forms, slowly built up by the minds of men, acted directly as a bal-ance to the involutionary force, weakening it and destroying it a bit at a time. Thewill-to-survive proved to be greater than the will-to-death, and slowly man con-quered the involutionary force for his mother the Earth.“By the end of the last great period of glaciation, about ten thousand years ago,the battle had been effectively won. Man had learned to survive in the worst condi-tions that nature could throw at him, and flourished in all the environments thatcould be experienced on earth. Now the concrete mind, freed somewhat from theessentials of the battle, began to create new ways of living, different from those of theanimals from which he evolved, which so greatly increased his ability to survive thathe became in truth the lord of the world that he is today. Truly is man Adonai, the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors32 \u0001Sun in the Earth, the light of the spirit within matter, as the Earth had intended himto be in that long-ago day when the plan of salvation was devised.“I might mention in passing that the conflicts between men in this day, betweennations and individuals, are merely the hangovers from this period. The involution-ary force is gone, save for those rare cases when man invokes it deliberately. Theevils that men do are the result of his racial memories of that time, brought forwardinto this new age. “It might seem as if man is more violent than ever in this day, but this is not thecase. The per capita number of deaths by homicide in this day is much less thaneven a thousand years ago. And when it is compared with those early days, there isno comparison at all. The existence of such great weapons as man can now bringagainst man is causing him to become consciously aware, as a race, that what aidedhim in his early survival has now passed its day, and must consciously be removedfrom his behavior. The men of those early days, had they had atomic weapons,would not have hesitated to use them at the first offense. Man in this day shows hissuperior state by the fact that, once he realized the terror he produced, he restrainedhimself from its actual use. I have confidence, as do my fellow Seniors, that man willbe able to survive the existence of his own tools, and will remove them from theworld in short order, as circumstances change and they become unneeded even asdeterrents. “Truly do I speak, and all men should listen to these words: Nowhere, nowhere inthe cosmos (save in your own case, o unique one who writes this) has consciousnesscome through such tribulations as man on Earth has suffered. And nowhere has theconquest of mind been as great as it has here. Truly has man shown himself to be thechild of the gods, the conquering child who sweeps all before him. All, even the leastof men, have already passed onto the road of the Gods, and all, even the least, shalltread its path in the endless going into wonder. Those who say differently, that manmust subordinate himself to the will of the gods, and become as the beasts of thefield in his submission, speak from ignorance, and the blindness that the closure ofthe Earth has kept upon him. “Open your eyes, O Men! Open them, and see that even now, upon the Earth andin the body, you are gods. Nothing now determines your path but your own desiresand will. Nothing now stops you in your going save only that resistance of matterthat all the gods must fight against. Fight ye with a good will, and conquer! Let thelight come into the Earth again through your minds, and ye shall bring that light tothe universe at large, and the beings who inhabit that universe shall wonder at you,and be abased as you continue to do what they can not, and bring down the lightbeyond the Tree into matter.“Other places are there in this universe, very many, where consciousness doesexist in the body, and mind act upon matter. But in those places, the course of evo-lution was of a gentler nature than here, and the minds of the souls that were likemen before the fall were placed into their bodies directly, by the gentle hand of theirgods. None of them, none, have the strength of being that the least of men shows."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Alhctga, Senior of Venus\u0001 33None of them, none, will survive the withdrawal of their enlivening god from mat-ter, save those on whom man acts in the future years beyond the opening of thegates to the stars.

Thus will light spread ever more abundantly throughthe cosmos, and the gods shall rise up out of matter to create endless new universesfor the play of evolution and wonder.“Now, o scribe who is a mage who is a god, we have done with the presentationof Alhctga, who is myself.

He wore a black and red robe, with a lining of dark violet. His feetwere shod in what appeared to be sandals made of some dark, heavy metal. In hisleft hand, he held a book, open to a page showing a black tower with a guardianbefore its gate. As I watched, he turned the page, and showed another picture, of theplanet Saturn, with the enochian letter equivalent to “A” under it.7 I did the 5=6 signs, and the sign of Set. Liiansa answered with the LVX signs, andalso the sign of Set, followed by the sign of fire, which he indicated was a salute tomyself. I returned the sign.I asked him to speak, but he did not. Instead he turned to his left, and pointedwith his left hand to a point to my right. I turned, and there I again saw the image ofthe planet Saturn. But here it seemed in some way emphasized that the rings of Sat-urn actually represented a hole between levels of existence, and the body of theplanet sat in the hole and guarded it. On closer examination, I saw that there wereforces of some sort coming down from above, and passing between the ring and thebody of the planet. Below the planet, these forces came out again, but in a differentform. I could see that they now had an ordering to them of a different type thanwhen they entered. It was as if an inchoate mass of particles had been boundtogether into a sort of crystalline web, which the planet spun out behind it as itmoved.8I turned back to Liiansa, and he said: “Welcome again, o mage of will. Now thatwe have covered the nature of my being by these symbols I have shown, let us con-tinue with the story that we have been telling, of the past of the earth and mankind.“When you last left off, we were at the point where the involutionary force hadbeen completely conquered by the desire of men, acting in the body and upon theearth. The time is just after the last of the great ages of ice, about ten to twelve thou-sand years ago, depending on the part of the world we are considering.“This is the time which is felt, in the backs of the minds of men of the presentday, to have been the “Golden Age” of man, that wonderful past that everyonethinks of but no one can identify. The “good old days”, as it were. “Indeed, in many ways it was a golden age, though from the standpoint of ourmodern environment it was a rather harsh time physically. The reason that it wasgolden, from man's point of view, is that in that time, the true opponent of man, theinvolutionary force, no longer had a great effect on him, and at the same time, pop-7. The tower in this case is the tower of the elements, Malkuth, and the guardian before it is Saturn in his capacity as guard of the gate to the worlds below Malkuth. Caer Benoic, the “four-sided castle” of the Grail myths, is a congruent symbol. The enochian letter Un, equivalent to the English “A”, is attributed to Taurus, kerub of Earth, in the G.D. system of symbolism. Hence the second page indicates Saturn of Earth, the character of Liiansa.8. Saturn is again shown in Malkuth, as the crystallizer, or cause of outward expression, of subjective concepts."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Liiansa, Senior of Saturn\u0001 35ulation was so low, and so spread out over the surface of the earth, that competitionbetween man and man over resources had not yet begun. Man took what he willedfrom the earth, without opposition.“Now in that time, the culture was much more of a cooperative than a competi-tive venture. Man did not have to compete with man, but he could gain great advan-tage in life by combining his individual skills with those of other men, to make life alittle easier for all. Thus the groups of men were cohesive and cooperative, ratherthan competitive.9 “Since the pressure of forced evolution was no longer on man, and his mind wasat that time not distorted by the teachings and acts of later days, the signs of thespirit were given openly to man, without concealment or distortion. For the firsttime on earth, and for the last time for a very long time, knowledge of the relation-ship between yourself, acting as Set, and the Earth was fully known. The religioussymbolism of the day emphasized this union of yourself and the earth andexpressed it in the ways most relevant to man of that time.“The basis for their “religion” was the light in the earth. Man was that light, andyou as the Son of the Stars were the symbol of that light in the minds of the seers.The earth itself was symbolized by the cave, the womb in the ground, within whichman sheltered, and had his civilization. The earth's womb, as the caves were consid-ered, was always of the same temperature, no matter the forces outside, and so itwas the best of places to live. The earth gave these places without demanding any-thing in return, and so man saw her as the great provider, out of whom came allgood things. Not only their shelter, but their tools of stone and their nourishmentcame from her, and so she was worshiped as the all-mother.“The religions of that time were truly magickal in character, and were concernedmore with getting things from the earth to make life easier than they were with theworship of some god or another. Man felt that the world would give him anything,if he planted the seed of his need deep within her womb. “So the priest-leaders of that time, who were magickians and also were huntersand leaders in the mundane sense, would travel as far into the earth as they could,deep into the lowest passages of her caves, and there they would plant the seed of theneed, in the form of pictures painted on the walls of her womb, and energized bythe desire of the heart. By doing so, they believed that they could cause the earth toproduce exactly those things they desired. And so it often was, for confidence inaction is the key to magick, and their belief in the efficacy of their actions was abso-lute.“The artistry of these paintings is not much appreciated in these later days, forman now sees these pictures in the light of his bright lamps, and not as they were9. The May, 1986, issue of Scientific American (distributed about two weeks after this section was completed), contains an article about this period of time which substantiates the claims made here. The article also clarifies that man at that time had developed a complete, workable system of life that allowed him to live in relative comfort and safety throughout the year. The technology of the period was highly developed for the materials they had to work with, and the society, while completely egalitarian, was thoroughly effective in achieving these goals. The article also supports the statement made later in this sec-tion that hierarchical systems of status did not appear until two to three thousand years later."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors36 \u0001intended to be seen. In the light of the dim torches by which they were created, thesepictures seemed to move, to take on the life of the thing they represented, so that inthe eyes of the magician-priests, they were identical to their physical counterpart.“In the more southerly climes, where the caves were not so common, there devel-oped a similar worship, but using the symbolism of the seed in the ground, whichsprang to life to provide man with food. Thus were the beginnings of agriculturebrought into the world, as an adjunct to the worship of the goddess, and of her son.“Now the name Set is not the name by which you were known to these men andwomen, but the symbolism they used is substantially the same, within its limits, asthe symbolism we are trying to re-introduce to the world today in an effective form.The symbolism of the mother and the son was nearly universal in that time, andappeared in cultures that had never met each other directly. All of the symbolismcame directly from the sensing of the mages of the story which we tell now, to theextent that it had been accomplished in that day.“So this was the golden age, when man was at peace with himself, and with theearth. It was a period of necessary rest for the souls of men, after the terrible trials ofthe previous thousands of millennia. Conflict existed primarily on a personal level,and not at all on the social level. That is, group did not normally fight against group,but cooperated in the tasks of living.“But this situation was not to last, as we all know all too well today. And, as in theprevious phase of the cycle, you and the Knights of Earth were primarily responsiblefor its ending, and the initiation of the next phase of the Earth's plan for man.“The golden age was intended also as a sign for the future, so that men mighthave in their astral memories the sense that there was a time at which men did notfight men. In the earlier phase of the work, the natural desire of the souls of men toreturn to the spirit from whence they came acted as the impetus for the work ofeliminating the involutionary force. Now, in the present day, a new goal had to becreated. For now the Knights were to plunge man into the state of conflict with manthat has continued to this current day, and is still in process of overcoming. “The reason for this conflict was not to destroy man, or to cause suffering for itsown sake, but to force man to come to terms with man, to understand himself andothers through the ability to sympathize and feel another's pain. Man at that time,while in tune with nature, was still not completely master of himself, as is still thecase today with a small portion of the population. In order to get man to come tothis understanding, he had to experience its opposite. That is, the conflict, the painsof civilization, would act to cause man to evolve himself further than nature couldforce him, so that he gained full control of his incarnate being. The unification ofthat being, through the elimination of both internal and external conflict, wouldcause man to eventually express not only the third-ray influence of Active Intelli-gence, but also the second-ray influence of Love-Wisdom, acting as the cause andgoal of right human relations. Man had to learn to live with man in ways that wouldbe beneficial to all, despite the pressure to conquer and eliminate opponents.”"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Liiansa, Senior of Saturn\u0001 37(At this point, I felt that I was having some difficulty getting the informationclearly, and asked Liiansa if there was anything that might help. He indicated that itwould help to use the word of spirit I had been given, with the first key. But since Iwas ill with some infection at the moment, he suggested I stop here and continueanother time, so as to not over-stress my body.)(Later that evening, I decided that the difficulty was due to my perceptions notbeing properly aligned with the force invoked. To try to correct the problem, I didan invocation of Nuit using my self-developed version of the VIIIth degree OTOmethod. Her relation to the idea of alignment is through the Tarot card now knownas The Star, which shows at its top a star surrounded by seven smaller stars in a par-tial circle. I associate the center star with Polaris, and the seven stars with the stars ofDraco, which were related to her in early times. Since the position of Polaris is anexpression of the Earth’s center of rotation, it represents the alignment of the mani-fest and unmanifest parts of existence, the mundane and the “heavenly”. It is alsointeresting to note that in Achad's Tree of Life, the sum of the paths of the SupernalTriangle, which has this path as its base, is 510, the numeration of ThNIN, Draco.(The immediate effect of the invocation was to relieve me of the stress my illnesshad put on me, and to allow me a good night's sleep for the first time in severalnights. Her answer to my request for the missing key to perceiving this story prop-erly was given to me in the dreams I had that night, which will be described below.)4/19/86, 11:23 AMI invoked Liiansa using the usual methods. He appeared to me in vision in thesame form as the previous day's, but lacking the book he had held at that time.Instead, his left hand now held a phoenix wand, and his right hand an ankh. Hisskin was an indigo color today.I saluted him with the signs of Set and of LVX, and he answered with those signs.Testing him with the pentagram and the Hexagram of Saturn caused him to formu-late more clearly. He came forward, and called on me to take the wand and ankhfrom him. I did so, and asked what the purpose of these gifts was.He replied, “Now that you have found how to use the invocatory word of thespirit in its proper fashion, you are entitled to use these tools, which are the expres-sion of the spirit of life, and of its return to incarnation in new forms. Both of theseare part of the symbolism of yourself who is Set. He is the master of life, and themaster of death. His power of going takes men to the stars, where Horus can onlytouch them through the sun.“Take these tools, and make use of them in your rituals of the spirit, and theirpower will be multiplied greatly, to your benefit and the benefit of the earth whomyou seek to raise.“Now, let us go on with the story as we have begun it. Yesterday, we were about toexplain the manner in which intra-human conflict on a large scale was introducedto the world, in order that men might learn of the power of Love-wisdom throughthe expression of its negative side, which is repulsion-conflict. By exhausting the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors38 \u0001possibilities of the latter in manifest experience, they eventually were and are beingforced, individually and as a group, to come to the realization that the former is thehigher expression.“To do this was something you could not do yourself, as you knew in that time.For your own nature, being of the Will aspect, was too far from the natures of mento affect them directly. So, in this time, you decided to turn over the main focus ofthe incarnate work, the work in the world, to your alternate. Being of the Loveaspect, in its Will sub-aspect, his expression was closer to theirs, and so he was bet-ter able to introduce that idea which would eventually result in the conflict youdesired.“How was this to be done? The symbols of the mother and the self-begotten sonwere already strong in the earth at the time we speak of, and had no further need ofencouragement to continue their flow of force into the world. Had this flow beenallowed to continue unobstructed, then man would not have advanced much fur-ther than he had at that time, living a natural life in a natural world. The associationof the mother is too strong to be overcome without an equally strong opposingviewpoint being available. The stars of night now had to be masked by the brillianceof the Sun, who is closer to man but less holy than her. But the sun is the soul, andthe soul is what you sought to bring men to, through the harmonizing of conflict.“This is where your alternate came into the picture, as the opponent of the forcesof night, and the proponent of the power of Sol. Sol is of the second ray of Love-wis-dom, as has been said before, and your alternate in his essential nature embodiedthat force, as has also been said.“Even in those very early times, before the beginnings of civilization, it wasknown how men and women united to produce children. But the power of thefather was seen to be merely a stimulus to a process that was inherent in the female,the manifest aspect of the Mother. Now the father, the male, had to take on his ownpower, and understand his own place as the key to power. In effect, the martial sideof life, which no longer could fully express itself in the fight against nature, had nowto be channeled into higher levels, where it could affect the course of men's mindsand actions towards each other on a large scale.“And so the first revisionists of the spirit were born onto earth, and developed,over a period of millennia, a current opposing the current of the mother. This wasthe solar current, with its symbolism of the sun who dies and is reborn, without theaid of the mother. In later days, this expressed itself in the temples of Horus, Osiris,and of the Jews and Christians. It was the system of hierarchical dominance, asopposed to the natural association and merger of abilities which was the hallmarkof the mother's symbolism. Man fought man, following the ways he observedamong the animals, fighting each other to establish which should rule, whichshould be the one to breed, and therefore to carry on his life into the future.“This was also the earliest time in which the power of Saturn was raised up toBinah, figuratively speaking, and the power of the Mother cast down into Malkuth."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Liiansa, Senior of Saturn\u0001 39The new philosophy denied her her place in the heavens, and put up the father, inthe form of the authoritarian figure, the so-called “Alpha male”, in her place.“The religions of the mother were not cast down permanently in that time. Formany ages, lasting into the dynastic times of Egypt, she again came to power forperiods. But these periods grew shorter and shorter as the millennia progressed, andthe periods of dominance by the father-gods became longer, until in these laterdays, in the late Hebrew, the Greek (to a lesser extent), and the Roman and christianreligions, she has been effectively wiped out as a manifest power, even though heradherents and servants continue to do her work on earth. In fact, their work hasbeen helped by her loss of mundane power, for her practitioners could develop theirwork in secrecy, and with their full attention, instead of being distracted by theneeds of running a civilization. So her inner power, and that of her child Set,increased substantially at the same time that their outer power decayed.“You will recall, from an earlier invocation, your memories and feelings of a timein the early period of the Egyptian civilization when you and your opponent wereboth incarnate at the same place and same time. The place was a temple of themother and son in the southern part of that country. At the time, you were incar-nate as a woman, a senior priestess of that particular cult. One of the methods bywhich the cult tried to express the idea of the mother and son was in the way of hav-ing women have children fathered by their own children, or the children of otherpriestesses. In this way, they hoped to produce a son eventually who fully expressedthe power of the mother, being different from her only in the one gene that causedhim to be male.10 (They of course did not think of it in terms of genes, but came toa similar conclusion by direct observation of breeding experiments with animals.)“In that particular life, the adversary in this contest, your appointed alternate forthe eventual awakening of the Earth spirit, was incarnate in one of the bodies ofthese male children. But unlike most who resulted from such processes, and wereconditioned by the teachings of the temple to accept their place in things (whichwas a good one for the times), he, from the first moments of his conscious selfhood,desired to be free of the influence of women. He disliked being subordinate to anybeing, and he perceived the women, being physically weaker than the males he sawin the temple and outside it, as being naturally subordinate to himself. Like the malelion with whom he later has identified himself, his will was purely to dominance ofself over others, the innate expression of his perceived superiority to men. “As he grew in that time, and came to his physical maturity, he was trained in themethods of the temple, in the ritual of uniting male and female for the purposes ofthe gods and the priestesses. His power was so great that he took the training muchmore rapidly than most, and by the time he was fifteen, he had accomplished thefull training and become an initiate of the temple. “But, despite his power and authority in the temple, due to his magickal skills, hefound his new position even more aggravating. He saw his own abilities as superior10. The defective children of either sex were killed humanely (that is, quickly and without warning) as soon as their defects were detected. The priestesses felt that they were merely following the Mother’s way in this, and taught such."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors40 \u0001to those of all the other temple-workers, and believed himself to be the naturalleader of the temple. But above him stood yourself, his actual physical mother, aswell as the head of that temple. No matter how great his accomplishments, itseemed he could never get away from your perceived dominance. This created greathate, a great force of the rejective aspect of love-wisdom within him. And he deter-mined to overcome you by any means possible of accomplishment.“Within the temple, as we have said, there were many young men. These wereeducated, and if found unsuitable for the priesthood were given honorable posi-tions managing the affairs and properties of the temple. Many of these latter werealso resentful, for reasons like or unlike those of your opponent. These he soundedout, with a proposition that they take over the temple themselves, and raise them-selves up as its leaders. He found many who would go along with him for one rea-son or another. He also sounded out those outside the structure of the temple, thehunter and worker classes, and got many of the strongest of these to agree to hisplan. Thus he obtained the forces needed to conquer the temple.“In the night he opened the gates of the temple, and called in his assistants andconspirators. Together, they attempted to slay all those who came within their reach,so that none would survive to tell of their evil. But many heard the noise of theirattack, and managed to escape through other entrances. (Tactics was not one ofyour opponent's strong points, in that time or later times.) And so many lived topreserve the knowledge and warn other temples of the impending change. Many ofthose who escaped hid within the temples of other gods and goddesses, in otherplaces, and as small groups within these temples preserved the symbology of themother and son.“Now, on the morning, this one called forth the peoples of the area, and declaredfrom the steps of the temple that a new aeon had arisen, in which the elder godswere thrown down, to make place for the new, chief of whom was to be the Child ofVictory, the conquering child, who he claimed to embody in himself. Thus was bornthe first of the “official” Sun-gods, he who later became Horus.“You yourself were captured in that raid, by the express will of your son andadversary. And you became the first of the “official” victims of Horus, as your sonsacrificed you to his new image of the gods.“Note the irony of this, o scribe! In this present day, in that last life of his and ofyours, did he again attempt to declare the aeon of Horus, and to absorb the intent ofyour will in this time into himself, thus becoming the one to reopen the earth to thestars. He even dared to adopt your own symbolism in his effort! The parallelsbetween that time and this are exact, save that since you were in a male body thislast time, he must needs take out his hate of women upon others in your stead. Nev-ertheless, his attack upon your being in that last life, through the magickal link cre-ated by your oaths to him and his organization, are a correspondence to his slayingof you in that earlier time. The gods laugh at him, as he stands before them now,exposed for the fool that he is in his failure."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Liiansa, Senior of Saturn\u0001 41“Yet much of good was accomplished by him, nevertheless. He never knew ofyour secret intent that events happen in just that fashion, in that day as in this. ForSet, who is Achad, the Isolated One, who is yourself, does keep his secrets well (evenfrom himself, if need be), hidden on the levels beyond the reach of those that he hasmanipulated for the development of man, and the raising of the Earth. “Thus in that time did he serve your will by bringing the forces of conflictbetween groups to a new pitch of intensity, inaugurating the forceful developmentof the emotional and mental natures of man. And thus in this present time, throughhis will to succeed, and to be the opener of the stars for man, did he have to revivethe very doctrines that in earlier days he did suppress. Thus again is he the tool ofhis own downfall, his actions against your body in that last life providing the shockthat, when its recoil returned to him, knocked his own intent askew, and left himsitting on the sidelines in this most important of times. All as you intended. Fornever could he see that in death was your victory, your opportunity to come againin another form and another place, to continue the fight for the freedom of menfrom the subjection of the gods.“Thus also in those old days, when the priests of the mother and son who hadhidden among the other gods' priests summoned up again in secret the force ofyour will, to continue the work. The many tales of Set returning in the god-formsrelated to other gods, only to be slain again by Horus, or by his successor Osiris,reflect the fact that no matter how hard he tried, in his many incarnations, he justcould not destroy the intent of your work, nor could he make it his own. Heattempted to control the world, through his many god-forms in many nations, butthe more order he brought about, the more disorder resulted. Thus did Set everconquer Horus. Thus did the sacrificial victim become the god, while the slayer wasbound away by his own acts. We laugh at him, laugh and gloat, at the great onefallen so low! Yet how could he expect otherwise, with his will bound to an ill pur-pose from the beginning?”(All during this speech the astral area in which we stood echoed with huge laugh-ter, and a feeling of immense humor, coming from some point not seen. As if theuniverse itself were greatly amused.)“Now we are done with the tale that I am to tell, and the rest of the story of Setand Horus, and their works in the Earth, will be told by the last two of the Seniors,Ahmlicv and Laidrom, and by the Sun-King of the Tablet, Iczhihal.“But it might be good to explain a few things from your own life's recent events,to show how even in this time has Horus-Osiris attempted in his feeble way to inter-fere with your work.“First, I would like to cover the incidents that took place in Indianapolis. First,tell the tale of the policemen, then that of the authority who employed you. Then Iwill explain for those who read how these fit with the story we are telling.

I continued to work with the currentinstigated by the invocations during that time. Set first appeared openly as an oper-ator in the work while I was there.The incident with the policemen occurred the first day after Set announced him-self. In the evening, I was in my room at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, room 1216. It wasaround 11:00 pm, and I had settled down to do an invocation of Set using my ver-sion of the VIIIth degree methods. I had also smoked some pot a while earlier forrelaxation, and still had my supply out, but disguised from view by being in a plasticshopping bag from a local department store.I had been doing the invocation for some few minutes, and had a strong feelingof being filled with the force of the god, when a loud pounding came from the door.I went to the door and opened it a crack to see who was there. What I saw was twopolicemen, one with his hand on his gun and his thumb on the hammer, and severalpersons behind him in medical green clothes. All of them were looking at me as if Iwere a particularly obnoxious laboratory specimen they were about to dissect.The cop with his hand on his gun told me to open the door and let him in so thathe could ask me some questions. I asked him to explain his reasons, but he refusedto give them. I then told him to wait while I put on some pants. But as I moved toclose the door, he pushed against it and forced his way into the room, followed byall the others with him.Since there appeared to be nothing I could do about his forced entry, I got somepants on, and turned to question him about his purpose. He did not answer, butstarted grilling me about what I had been doing that evening, whether I had madeany phone calls, who I had seen, where I was from, and what I was doing in Indy. Ianswered every question responsively, as seemed prudent, and repeated my demandfor information after every question. Meanwhile, his partner looked around theroom, not touching anything, but obviously looking for something actionable. Thesecond time I protested this, he came back and stood by his partner.After about ten minutes of this grilling, the cops turned and left, followed by theothers, still with no explanation given. The next day, I called the hotel managementto protest this treatment, and the lack of hotel security personnel on hand to protectmy own interests. After checking with the police, the manager (who had never beeninformed of this impromptu raid) called back to explain that the cops had had ananonymous call saying that someone was going to suicide by jumping off the twelfthfloor balcony of the hotel. Since I was the only person living on the twelfth floor thatday, the cops had made a beeline for my room, on the idea that wrong action wasbetter than no action.The second incident(s) involved my relationship with my employer. One day inclass, I had been asked some questions about matters of import to new employees,"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Liiansa, Senior of Saturn\u0001 43such as the promotion possibilities, chances for raises, working environment,benefits, etc. I had answered these questions truthfully, saying that promotions werebecoming rare, salaries would continue to stay far behind the national average,benefits were being rapidly eroded, and that the pensions system was clearly headedfor dissolution. Naturally, this caused more than a little upset among the local management.They wanted me to tell the trainees that everything was all right with the govern-ment, and that they could expect all sorts of great and wonderful things to come outof their work. I told them that if they wanted to have fairy tales told, they wouldhave to do it themselves, and that I would in the future refer any such questions tothem.About a week later, I was talking with the local manager, who appeared to be anice person as an individual, afterhours at a local restaurant-lounge. She had askedme what my true feeling about the agency were, and after getting her assurance thatmy answers would be held in strictest confidence, I told her exactly what I thoughtthe problems with the agency were, and that the problems came from the very topmanagement. The next day, I found that not only had she not kept the confidence as she hadsworn, but had immediately called the regional commissioner and blabbed thewhole thing. The commissioner came down, along with one of her assistants, and Ifound myself in a good approximation of a star-chamber proceeding. No, more likethe Inquisition, at least in atmosphere.They had gathered, I was told, to decide whether a person of my clearly hereticalviews, who had dared to actually criticize the gods of the agency, had any businessteaching the minds of innocent young trainees. They first discussed my commentsto the class about benefits, trying to convince me that I was wrong. When I coun-tered by quoting substantial evidence in favor of my statements, in the form of thedocumented actions of their own superiors, and of the current administration, theygave up on that tack.Then they went to work on the comments I had made to the manager. These,they said, were the worst form of heresy, and the only way I could get back into theirgood graces would be by recanting the whole thing in writing, and apologizing inperson to those I had mentioned. The fact that the information was given in strict-est confidence, and they only knew about it through the actions of an oath-breakermade no difference to them. If I said it once, I could say it again in the future, withmore damaging effect to their reputations, particularly that of the commissionerwho headed this panel. I declined to do as they told me to do, and matters restedthere for the moment.Two days later I had the misfortune to contract pneumonia from the usual nastyIndianapolis winter. I called in sick, and mailed them a statement from the doctor Ihad seen saying that I would be too ill to work or travel for at least ten days.

In fact, I wasrunning a 103 degree fever at that moment. I was told that everyone authorized tomake that decision would be out of town until after the end of the next week. I wasalso told that they had already called the hotel and told them I was moving out.So I ended up driving 500 miles, in half-hour segments so I could rest, half delir-ious with fever, in the middle of winter. Being forced to do this added at least twoweeks to the time it took to recover from this illness. It also lead to my rapid resig-nation from that organization. I’m too stinking proud to work for scum like that.Liiansa's comment: “The meaning of these two events in the light of our tale hereshould be fairly clear. It was a last-ditch effort by the forces of Horus-Osiris to getyou off the path of your destiny. Government is of course heavily Osirian, sinceOsiris was a black god, and black is the color of Saturn, and of the astrological Cap-ricorn, which rules government.“Two attempts were made. These reflect the usual actions of the Horan-Osirianpowers towards individuals, and they expected you to react in the usual way, givingthem something they could use to either hang you or put you back firmly undertheir control.“The policemen are enforcers of the authority of the government, their powerfularm. So long as police exist, it is possible for the group that controls them to say 'Dowhat we want or we will kill you'. All government, no matter where in the world youlook today, is based solely and deeply on this principle of forced obedience. Not oneof them, not one anywhere, is truly responsive to the will of the individuals overwhom and in whose name they claim to govern.“Had the force of the Osirian current had its effect on the anonymous mentally illperson who made the call to the police a little earlier than it did, then it is quite pos-sible that you would have been caught smoking pot, and the amount you held onyou at that time would have been sufficient for a long prison sentence. “But, as is usual, the forces could not act quickly enough. Never is a governmentreally able to control events, no matter how hard it tries or oppresses its people. Italways and only reacts to what is forced upon it. The self-styled “rulers” of the landsthink they are the top of the heap, but in fact they are whores, dishonest ones atthat, incapable of initiating anything truly new into the world. All they can do istake what the world throws at them, and try and twist it to their purpose. But neverdo they catch up. Always, Set is one step ahead of them, creating new things to dis-order their system faster than they can control them. This delay is inherent in theforce of Saturn that they have co-opted to their own purpose, though they neverrealize it. Thus in this case, the force of Set within yourself, making you stand up tothe police instead of quaking fearfully as they had hoped and expected, counteredthe force of the Osirians sent to derail you again.11“Similarly for your confrontation with your employers.

Again, it was too little, too late, and so will italways be.“Now, you took this force of Saturn that had been sent at you, and used it in theway it was intended to be used, in the beginning of time. Saturn truly relates toMalkuth, as the barrier between the Tree of Life and those realms that lie below it,with which none of any spirit will deal. Being Malkuth, he relates also to the crystal-lization or outward expression of the inward will. And so did you use it, crystallizingyour decision to quit their ways and go your own, which had been building forsome time.“It was no accident that the forces came at you just as Set, who is Achad, who isthe core of yourself, appeared on the scene. The actions of light, until they are firmlyestablished in the person, always generate an opposition. It is natural that this be so,and also convenient, for it forms a sort of final test of the effectiveness of your work.Had you not actually succeeded in your intent in the Earthworks, then these thingswould not have appeared. So even the shells unwittingly have acknowledged theappearance of the new master, and again shown themselves to be the inferior.“Now as to the dreams, I will summarize them to save time. You had invokedNuit to find out the key to what I was trying to say, the concept that would allowyour intuition to understand it whole. The first dream was short, and only oneimage is of relevance to our discussion here. In it, your mother handed you a key, inthe form of a small red obelisk or menhir. You discovered that this key was to a car.But rather than going directly into the keyhole of the ignition, it went into a loopthat allowed it to be used as a lever, like a torque wrench, to start the car.“The mother is obviously a symbol of Nuit, as you have already interpreted it.The key is a form of the pyramid, representing the path of Shin, which connectsKether with Tiphereth in your system. The loop it went into is the yoni, here repre-senting the lower aspect of your being who is the scribe.“The car is a form of the Tarot card The Chariot, since an automobile is a vehiclewhich is powered by the elements. That is, it moves by burning (fire) in a vaporousform (air) a liquid (water) derived from the ground (earth). Exactly as the chariotof the card is drawn by sphinxes of the elements. So in all, this image indicated thatthe key you sought is to be found in the union of spirit-fire with its opposite, in thesign of Cancer.“Just to drive in the point, you were caused to awake from the dream at exactly4:18 am. And the invocation was done on 4/18. The significance of the date did notoccur to you until you saw the time at which you awoke.11. Liiansa neglects to mention here that the idea of suicide, the purported cause of the police invasion, is related to Set. Sui-cide relates to Scorpio, Set’s sign, through the scorpion that stings itself to death, and also directly in that Set has frequently made his own murder an intrinsic part of his plans for a given lifetime. Thus the anonymous caller was telling the Osirian authorities that Set was up to something on the twelfth floor of the hotel, in a direct symbolic fashion. He apparently spoke better than he knew, to my present great amusement."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors46 \u0001“Now Cancer is a water sign, and therefore has to do with distribution and disso-lution of things in some fashion. In the context of this story we are telling, we willlook at it in a slightly different fashion than it is usually interpreted.“In the normal interpretation, Cheth, Cancer represents the dissolution of thelower self in ecstatic union with the higher spirit. With the lower self gone, the bod-ies of the person that live below Tiphereth become a shell, like the knight's armor,that is empty except for the spiritual forces, with no real personal self to be seen.This is in accord with the traditional astrological interpretation of this sign exceptthat it is on a higher level.“The dream was in part an acknowledgment that you are achieving this level ofunion in your work with Set/Achad. You are almost ready at this point to reverseyourself and acknowledge that you are indeed as we have presented you to be, in theEarth Tablet working. Already, your magickal memory has opened widely, and youhave had many glimpses of your other lives, as they relate to your overall work andyour work in this time and place. These will continue and improve in clarity andprecision as you progress.“But as I said, the dream was also the answer to your question. Remember thatyour purpose at the time we have been speaking of was to generate a counter-forceto the Sirian force you represent in the earth, so that by conflict men would come tounderstand the causes of conflict and learn eventually to establish right relationsamong themselves.“So look at the symbol of the sign of Cancer. It is made of two lower-case sigmas,one turned upside down and pushed so that its tail is below the body of the other.The uninitiated astrologer often says that this is a picture of the claws of the crab,but this is not the case. The initiate frequently associates it with the symbol of yin-yang, again associating it with the merger of opposites.“But it is also a glyph of the whirlpool, which is a concentration of water into adistinct form within a larger sea of undifferentiated water. The whirlpool is a shell-full of air within the water, again relating back to the Tarot card.“Consider how a whirlpool comes into being. It is caused by two currents ofopposing vector sliding past each other. The friction of their passage transfersmomentum, changing the vector forces along the interface so that they turn andbecome circular in their movement. Your satellites have photographed any numberof these whirlpools where the Gulf stream goes past the main body of the Atlanticalong the east coast of your land.“In this case, you needed to generate such a whirlpool, a vortex (to use the mag-ickal term) in the mental and emotional levels of being, so that the spirit could finda way into those levels. It is fortunate that you had the ideal method of doing soimmediately to hand, or your work would have been much more difficult than itwas.“Remember that you yourself are of the First ray of Will, and the sub-ray of Love-wisdom, represented by the term 'love under will'. Your alternate is of the Secondray of Love-wisdom, and the sub-ray of Will, so that he might be termed 'will under"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Liiansa, Senior of Saturn\u0001 47love’. So the vectors of your individual forces, along one dimension, are exactlyopposite to each other.“Your own force, as I have said, was already firmly established in the minds ofmen at that time, between seven and eight thousand years B.C. In order to generatethe conflict you desired, so that man might become conscious of the gods while inthe body, you merely had to give your alternate his head, and allow him to attemptto fulfill his own plan within the world. Naturally you did not tell him of your realpurpose, but held it concealed on levels he could not yet reach. Remember your ori-gin, and what we have said about your level of achievement at the time you werefirst called to the Solar system.“Rather, you put a different face on it, one he would find believable. In a conclaveon the inner planes around 7000 B.C., you informed him and his followers that itwas your will that they take over the next part of the work, and do it according totheir own ways. The reason you gave was that you had realized that your own typeof force, the First ray, was too far from the consciousness of men to be effective, andalso too dangerous to be allowed into the world in its pure form. You said that itcould only cause destruction if introduced at this point. Your opponent, expressinghis usual Second-ray faults, believed you implicitly since your words fit with his ownevaluation of the situation. “For two and a half millennia, you allowed them a free hand in creating theirworks. You effectively withheld yourself from action on any large scale, althoughyou continued to support fully those who followed your way. But you made noeffort to expand your power base on earth, and allowed your alternate to create inthe minds of men those ideas that would eventually cause a flow of power along hisown lines. “He introduced conflicting ideas along two lines that affected yours directly.First, he emphasized the group over the individual, encouraging the subordinationof the soul to the purpose of the group. Second, he introduced the concept of hier-archical status, of relative individual value, to man. That is, he encouraged men tothink it natural that one who is stronger than another, either physically or spiritu-ally, should dominate and control the other's actions.122 Together, these conceptseventually resulted in the form of top-down imposed structuring that is common toall the civilizations on earth today, with only small groups actually attempting tooperate on a basis of your own concepts, which are the sanctity of the individualwill, and the cooperation of men for mutual benefit without coercion.“His current was in effect an overlay on yours, and your own current was in linewith the memories of the “Golden Age” that all men sense in themselves, so therewas never really a chance that he could overturn your own current on any levelhigher than Tiphereth. Too many individuals would be subconsciously sabotaginghis work, even as he did it. This naturally occurs in any situation where imposedrestrictions take too much away from the individual. Also, biologically, the human12. These concepts are definitely Second-ray in nature. Note their importance in the works of Alice Bailey."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors48 \u0001body is suited on an instinctive level to working in groups no larger than thirty orforty persons, which was the natural size of human communities for most of theevolution of truly human bodies. Thus in larger groups there is a natural tendencytowards splintering and separation which acts automatically against imposed forces.Every government that has ever existed has eventually succumb to their own large-ness. The larger the group or organization, the more unconscious sabotage occurs,and the more likely it is that it will come to the end of its existence. The rapiditywith which this occurs is inversely proportional to the degree of freedom the groupallows its individual members.“Now in this current time we are attempting to redress the balance, bringing thesanctity of the individual back into the minds of men, as the forces of Aquariuscome into appearance on the lower planes. This force is associated with the volun-tary association of individuals in groups, on the basis of mutual need and interest.Thus it is suited to our purpose, as is the energy of the sign's ruler, Uranus, who rep-resents the principle of individuality, or the destruction of imposed groupings. “The force going out of manifestation, that of Pisces, is associated of the dissolu-tion of the individual into the group. Through its ruler Neptune it relates to illu-sion, false prophecy, Maya, inchoate idealism, etc. Thus the popularity of the BigLie, and of emotional manipulation as tools of governance among the predomi-nantly Piscean governments of the world. Through its other ruler, Jupiter, it relatesto the idea of kingship, of order imposed by fiat or decree that is characteristic ofsuch governments, no matter their supposed philosophical base. Note also thatMercury, intelligence and knowledge, is in its detriment in Pisces. Hence the com-mon demands by the hucksters of the Christian churches that man put aside hisintelligence and have Neptunian “faith”, and mindless obedience to the Jupiterianrulers of the churches. Contrary to this, Mercury is exalted in Aquarius, and thuswill knowledge overcome superstition as the currents of the sign takes over from itspredecessor. “Our work and yours, o beast, is to help man in the transition to life based onknowledge, on gnosis, by providing invocations and a system of symbolism suited tothe consciousness man will have to adopt to deal with the incoming age. The ritualsand invocations will be given as your sight develops to the needed degree of clarityto read your own library on the inner planes directly, instead of through the pic-ture-book representations we keep for the less well developed.“That is all we have to say about this, except to say that the other dream you had,of a man breaking into your room while you examined a handful of jewels, wasmerely a reminder. The big man is of course the cop who broke into your room. Thejewels in the hand relate to the VIIIth degree working you were doing at the time,with the colored gems representing the chakras you were stimulating.“Now I am done, and you need not invoke me again, save when you desire myassistance in some matter in the future. Tomorrow or the next day, you shouldinvoke Ahmlicv, who will show you the tasks you put yourself to, while your alter-nate was working his will within your secret design."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Ahmlicv, Senior of Mercury\u0001 49 Ahmlicv, Senior of Mercury 4/23/86 4:54 pmThe vision opened upon a region of air, light blue in color. Ahmlicv appeared.His likeness was of a stocky youth, wearing a robe-like garment that appeared to becovered with round, overlapping scales of a silvery blue color. He wore on his head acrown with small wings, on which were engraved the sigil of Mercury, its astrologi-cal symbol. His left upper arm was horizontal at the shoulder and cocked forwardabout forty-five degrees. His left forearm was vertical, with the hand open and thepalm facing forwards. His right arm was held down and slightly behind him. I couldsee the end of a wand of some sort in his right hand. It looked like a caduceus with-out the entwined snakes.13 His skin looked the color of buckeyes or chestnuts, per-haps a little lighter.My viewpoint revolved around him until I could see that on his back he hadsmall wings like the typical Christian depiction of an angel.I did the signs of Set and of LVX. He responded with LVX, the Set’s sign, then thefire sign, and then the sign where the arms are held down and out from the sides at a45 degree angle. He said, “I greet you, o mage of earth and fire. Let it be that we become one, inthe telling of this tale of the earth and her masters. “Now, when you left off with Liiansa, you had come to the point where you hadturned over your main work to your adversary, so that his more congenial forcecould produce in man the sense of conflict between individual and group that hasbeen the source of all the conflicts of mankind since. At the same time, though, youwere taking on another aspect, that of Thoth, so that you could produce a tendencyto upward motion to add to the cyclic nature of the conflicts generated. That is, yousought to ensure that the conflict would result in upward progress rather thanbecoming stasified in a circulating current. “This was to be done by enhancing the knowledge of mankind, and causing hismind to look ever towards the new things possible in life, rather than backwardstowards the golden age. If the force of your adversary had been left to itself, it wouldhave caused a regression to those more primitive conditions again after a shortperiod of conquest.“Now on the first plane of this system, that which is represented by Kether in theTree of Life, and the highest of the seven planes of the Bailey system, you caused tobe formed an image of the god Thoth, as the god of wisdom and knowledge. Thisexpression of your will you then brought down into Chokmah, so that it would refl-ect your will rather than embodying it. Thus the lunar aspect of Thoth was born,even though this was not the strongest of his aspects. But knowledge had to be rep-resented as complete in itself, not tied to either of the conflicting forces, and so itrequired both a male and a female aspect in one. 13. Actually, he was standing in the classical pose shown in Roman statues of the god Mercury. But I did not recognize it because I was seeing it from an unusual angle."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors50 \u0001“In one sense, Chokmah is male, in that it balances the definitely female charac-ter of Binah, but in another sense, it reflects itself into Tiphereth as the son, and is initself the son on a higher plane, uniting in itself the femaleness of Binah with theinitiating impulse of Kether. As the son, it balances male and female, as Thoth bal-anced the conflict between Set and Horus, so that neither would ever win in theirperpetual battle. This legend reflects your intent exactly, as does his role as one ofthe Lords of the Balance in the Tuat. Knowledge had to be seen as impersonal, nottied to any one condition or philosophy.“Now, in those old days, you caused to be created through the other Knights theTemples of Thoth in Egypt, and his correspondence was shown in other landsaround that same time, give or take a thousand years. Remember, a thing estab-lished on the inner planes can only manifest in a particular area of the world whenthe zeitgeist allows it, so the time differed from place to place.“Most of this work was not done directly by the Knights, for the Earth alreadyhad a full complement of adepts of the fifth ray of Intellect, ready to go into actionin this very way. The intellect aspect would have been part of the earth whether ornot the events leading to her hiding had taken place, and so she had the appropriatekinds of workers available. The part of the Knights and yourself was to determinethe time at which they would start to work with full force within the world, and theform of manifestation that they would take in the human kingdom. Thus yourmanifestation of the image of Thoth caused the initiation of this cycle.“Up to this point in history, about four thousand years before the dawn of theChristian era, mankind looked at knowing primarily in terms of the passing on ofskills. That is, knowledge of how to do things was considered of primary impor-tance, and other knowing was considered useless by definition and was not kept.There were exceptions to this, as there always are, but on the whole, this was thecondition that prevailed. “Now you had to show that knowing for its own sake also led to things of value.So the introduction of Thoth as a god was intended to turn the zeitgeist in this latterdirection. Men were now beginning to develop the abstract mind, and those whoincarnated with strong minds had to have some sort of symbol on which to supportthemselves, so that they would not allow their minds to become subordinate to theconceptions of those less-developed persons who made up the majority of human-ity. If Thoth had not been there, then peer pressure would have distracted themfrom their true purpose into less productive lines.“Now, the essence of preserved knowledge is in the symbols by which it is pre-served. Word-of-mouth transference of knowledge is limited, even in those societieswhere guilds and work groups had formed to preserve particular sections of knowl-edge. There is only so much that one man can hold in his mind, and word-of-mouth transference inevitably leads to a situation in which some knowledge is lostwith every generation. New things come into being, but old things are lost at thesame time."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Ahmlicv, Senior of Mercury\u0001 51“Writing, the preservation of words in a concrete form, which can then be readby many men, is a superior way of doing things, as all men would nowdays be will-ing to admit. Without writing, man could never have developed the kind of societythat he has now. If writing were to be suddenly removed from the world, all wouldimmediately collapse back into barbarism.“So the essence of this new tack was to cause to be developed in the minds ofmen the idea that symbols could be made for ideas as well as for experiences. Up tothat time the symbols available were mainly intended to express in visual form theexperiences and perceptions associated with a certain god, or a certain state ofmind. Now man had to see that words themselves could be made into symbols, andthat these symbols could be understood by all, and not just by those who had hadthe experience.“Into the minds of men, then, was forced this idea. And many responded to it inmany parts of the world. It did not take any incarnations of masters to produce theeffect, although many did incarnate. Men alone and without aid from the mastersand Knights were already of a level of achievement that they could do the work ontheir own, given the original impulse to do so. This latter way was preferable,because then the new idea became directly incorporated into the zeitgeist, where ifthe masters had tried to introduce it by themselves, it would have been adoptedmuch more slowly. Even as it was, many men considered writing to be a magick onthe same order as the powerful rituals of the priests. And so it was, and is, but it is amagick that can be used by any, not just those of talent.“To be certain, writing was in the beginning mainly the property and secret ofthe priestly classes. But once introduced, it could not be withheld from man. Likethe physical Mercury that is named after the god, it flowed outwards and down-wards through the classes, sneaking through every available crack in the priest'ssecurity. And once it became known, and the advantages seen in such mundanepursuits as the tallying of stores, then the demand for persons who could writebecame so strong that the priests could not do other than train many and releasethem into the world. Thus came into being a new category of man, the scribe, ofwhom you have in part chosen to be an example yourself in this life. “The scribes, the masters of letters and numbers, the translators of fact into sym-bol, have been the mainstay of every civilization that has had them since that time.Through their works, the knowledge of man has grown, not exponentially, but at arate that is much more than geometric. If we were to chart the amount of accumu-lated knowledge available to the race since the dawn of consciousness, for most ofthe race's history the line would barely be above the baseline. But with the introduc-tion of writing, the line suddenly curves upwards. With the invention of paper andink, and its spread through the world, the line began to approach the vertical. Withthe introduction of easy methods of reproduction, the line immediately passesthrough the top of the graph and out of sight.“In this present time, the number of book-equivalents of information producedyearly has come close to equaling the number of people alive in this time. No one,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors52 \u0001not even the most intelligent, can possibly comprehend all the knowledge that isproduced in a single year, let alone during a man’s whole lifetime. The universe ofthe knowable has become as effectively infinite as the physical universe from whichknowing sprang. Man has created out of himself a new world, one in which he is thetrue ruler, and none of the lesser orders can equal him. He has indeed become a godby his knowing, and even the least of those who know is guaranteed a place in theuniversal work of consciousness.“Strangely, man has not yet realized, on a broad scale, that this is the case. Moststill seem to think that they live and move in a world of facts, that can be checked byreference to the world they can see and feel. But this has not been the case for manycenturies. It is fair and valid to say that today, in the developed countries, the num-ber of persons who live entirely within the world of factual experience amount to nomore than five percent of the population. Even in the least developed countries,where writing is not the property of the masses, less than twenty percent of thosealive could be said to be in this category. The rest of them live more and morewithin the world of mind, of concepts, and the manipulation of concepts takes thegreater part of their lives. Without realizing it, man as a whole has raised his con-sciousness out of the living world, and taken the first three initiations in the process.That is, the initiations corresponding to 0=0, 1=10, and 2=9 in the cabalist systems. “There is no man alive today who has not taken at least the 0=0 initiation, andthe vast majority have taken the 1=10 initiation, and now live their lives with theirconsciousness focused on the astral/emotional level. That they have done so uncon-sciously and as a part of the great upward movement of the consciousness of therace-being does not in any way lessen their achievement. Mankind is now initiated.“Thus it becomes necessary in this time that men learn those techniques andviewpoints that will enable them to control their emotions, and to live focused onthe intellectual level. The methods to do this have been available for many centuries,and in this present day have more or less become public property. Anyone who hasneed of such can easily locate the needed materials in any library or bookstore. Mostmen can figure out the needed techniques without any help at all, by the innatepower of their minds. All it takes is the desire to do so, and a little persistence.“In the coming centuries, even this amount of effort will become unnecessary. Asthe intellectuals of the race become a larger portion of the population, and truethinkers appear in more and more areas of life, the needed perspective will becomean inherent part of the zeitgeist, and will be absorbed without effort in the processof growing up. “All this, from a few men scratching marks in clay! And now we have reached apoint where even the symbolic equivalents of factual events are becoming of lesserimportance, and ideas about ideas, and about thinking, are becoming more impor-tant. Meta-thinking and meta-language are rapidly being developed in this presenttime, and within a few years, probably within the lifetimes of many alive now, thestructure and properties of the world of thought will be as familiar to man as thephysical world in which he lives."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Ahmlicv, Senior of Mercury\u0001 53“And as humanity as a whole rises through the planes to their new focus in Hod,the task of the adepts has also been raised up a level. In the early days of man, whenyou first called the souls of men into matter, the task of the adepts was to bringabout a fusion between the astral world and the physical world. And this task wasthe primary task for many thousands of millennia. Then, in the early days after theend of the glaciers, the task was to develop the astral powers of the race, to teachthem to become the masters of emotion rather than the subjects. This was accom-plished on a large scale by the end of the Egyptian dynastic periods, well within thetimes of recorded history. And since then, up to the present day, the task has been tofuse the intellect with the previously-fused spheres. In the last three hundred years,the task has gradually been shifting, so that now, and in the immediate future, thetask of the adepts with respect to humanity as a whole is to teach man to unify thethree lower spheres, and to put them fully under the conscious control of the indi-vidual, making him a fully integrated personality. This latter task is in process, par-allel with the fusion of mind and emotions, and should, if things go as foreseen, beaccomplished for a large part of the race by the end of the next five hundred years. “There will always be some, a large minority of men, who do not achieve fullfusion within the limits of this current humanity. These people will act as the brainof the race-being, the material expression of the ideas of the race, subject to thedirection and will of those who have achieved higher levels. Hod and Netzach mustbalance, and these will act as Hod to the Netzach of the integrated personalities.“At the same time, this upward progress of the race as a whole has opened upnew horizons for the adepts. Since humanity is so close to full fusion of the lowerlevels, the adepts can now concentrate on the development of the middle levels ofthe tree, from Tiphereth to Chesed, which make up the soul of man. More and moreas the years progress, the adepts will concern themselves solely with events on theselevels, and the fusion of these levels with the lower ones. No longer do they have tospend most of their time leading the blind majority of men to their destiny. Manwill be able to be self-determinative in the best sense, and will be able to develop hisown methods of right action within the world, within the limits and specificationsgiven by the masters.“It will be more common in coming centuries for adepts to work in their naturalfield of expression. And humanity will shortly come to accept that these adepts aredoing something valid for the earth. What, even today, seems to be an area of blind-ness that men fear and misunderstand, will shortly become accepted, and will seemno more peculiar to society than a man who specializes in some little-known area ofknowledge or science. Persecution will become a thing of the past, as the emotionaltypes gradually leave incarnation, and the mental types suited to the incomingAquarian energies become more common. Man will change his society so much inthe next two hundred years that any true predictions we make now would seen fan-tastic and unimaginable.“This is another reason why your own theme, that of the advantages of reincar-nation to the willful traveler of the Path, becomes so important at this time. As the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors54 \u0001changes in society become ever more rapid, the need to gain new bodies adapted tothe zeitgeist of the times will be ever more vital. Man must be able to see that if hispresent physical, emotional, and mental bodies are no longer able to adapt rapidly,he has the option to drop that body and reincarnate in a new one, without loss ofpurpose, and without developing so-called “bad karma” as a result. “The only reason why suicide has ever caused bad results for a person is that hebelieved it would do so. The sense of sin in the western cultures, and the false viewof karma in the eastern cultures, created a mind-set that drew limiting energies tothe person. He was punished for suicide because he believed he would be punished. “Death is every man's privilege, if I may quote your favorite scribe quoting some-one else. As the truth of reincarnation becomes self-evident in the next century, theidea that suicide is a sin will gradually fade, and men will laugh at the naivete oftheir ancestors, fearing to kill themselves and get a new body, when they had somany times an advantage in doing so.“The false view of karma, which says that man is forced to compensate for pastacts in a current life, must now be taken from man. The true view is as you havestated it. The acts to be done in any life are under the full, willed control of theincarnating entity. If he chooses not to learn fully of a particular perspective onexistence, by looking at all sides of it in the compensatory process that has beencalled karma in the past, then he need not do so.“At the point where man chooses his new body of manifestation, nothing con-trols his selection but his own conscious choice. Those who say this is not so areliars, or self-deluded fools. The will of man is greater than the false limits put onhim by incarnate minds, and no act of any sort on the physical plane can force himto incarnate in a particular way in any future life.“However, this truth does not give license to run roughshod over other men. Allmen have this freedom equally, and revenge is a well-developed concept in theminds of men. If one acts too cruelly towards one's fellows, injuring them withoutoption of defense, then that one may find himself in his next lives surrounded bythose who are intent, by their own wills, on making him suffer.“Consider the case of he who was Hitler, in that recent time. Since then he hasattempted to reincarnate seven times. Each time he has selected a body without thedefects that caused him to be as he was in that time. But he erred in making theChosen of God his victims, for the memory of that people is as long as their history,and they never, ever, forget an injury. In each lifetime since then, he has been mur-dered at an early age, in a cruel fashion, by the will of those who can not forgive.When they will allow him to live as a man again can not be said, for as yet the hateof those who stalk him has not been poured out fully.“Therefore, it is best, from a practical standpoint, to not seek to injure others,without allowing them an equal chance at yourself. When such is the case, allinvolved will usually feel that the fight was fair, and will not seek to follow from lifeto life for revenge. This is true even if the incarnate self feels he will never forgive."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Ahmlicv, Senior of Mercury\u0001 55For the non-incarnate self, freed from the pain of events, can see with a truer per-spective and act accordingly.“'As brothers fight ye!'

But I perceive that, as with my fellowSeniors, you wish me to state my nature, and the meaning of my name.“He whose book you have recently obtained is a talented individual, and worthyto explore the realms of Enoch. But as is inevitable with a work so broad, errorscreep in. He has been fairly accurate in the definition of my fellow's names, but inthe case of my own he is in error. My name does not mean 'most ancient one', as hesays. Rather it means, 'youthful in all the ages'. Thus I have carried the spirit of Mer-cury, the god of youth, in the Earth through all the times since the beginning of theplanet. And so will I until the end. I am the fresh green buds of spring, as they comeforth full of life, green from the rains of Pisces and the warmth of Aries, and thenourishment of Taurus. I am the principle of new growth in the world, of newthings come to lighten the lands after the time of darkness. I am also the principle ofrelative value, and of the objectification of thought. Thus it was my force, actingthrough the adepts of the fifth ray, that caused the concrete mind to be developed inman under the will of the Knights and masters in the Earth.“Your own group had little to do directly with the development of the concretemind in man, save that your efforts caused the time of its development to be set for-ward by many thousands of millennia. Had the Earth not closed herself, and set theKnights to direct her course through the dark times, then man would haveremained upon the inner planes, and mind of my sort would not have come untilfar in the future. Fortunate is man that he has been put under the hammer of thegods, and forged into a sword to cut the earth from the ties of her past! Fortunate ishe to have been tortured as the ore is tortured to get the pure metals out, and fortu-nate is he that his metal proved good in the eyes of the Knights, and of their broth-ers the gods. Now let that sword be drawn from its scabbard, and let the Knightsdirect that sword against the ties that bind the earth into her sleep in the womb!And praise unto the adepts of the gods, in all their forms and functions, for theyhave been an acid to leach from the ore the last pure drop of metal, and a flame tomake from that metal a weapon fit for the use of the gods!“Now I am done, unless you have more questions, o mage of fire and earth.” I had no questions, and so gave him license to depart."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors56 \u0001Laidrom, Senior of Mars 4/24/86, 10:45 am.The vision opened upon an air of a steely-blue color.

He responded with Set, LVX, and then raised thehammer over his head and brought it down in a swift motion. I asked him to begin his presentation. He said, “It is not yet time for us to do mysection of the presentation of the seniors, o mage of earth and fire. For there is someother work for you to do in this time that is more urgent. I would suggest that youdo the invocation of spirit, and then use the word you have been given to invoke thespirit in its sub-aspect of fire, the last letter of the word. This is important, andshould be done asap.“But while we are here, I should clarify the meaning of my name so that this doesnot distract you in the other work. My name means 'first among the third angle'sconscious powers'. That is, 'L', first, 'aai', among, 'd', third angle, 'r-om', with 'om'meaning consciousness or understanding, and the 'r' being a symbol, a contractionof the enochian word 'rahe', meaning 'willfulness' or 'directed power'. Thus, theycombine to show the meaning I have stated. Now go and do the invocation of theword and return.”I saluted him and left the vision.-------------------------------I recited the first key, and vibrated the word. I visualized the pyramid, which hasthree sides of the element of spirit, and the left-hand, west, side of fire. I entered intothe pyramid and waited, vibrating the name with a will to attract entities who couldexplain the nature of the square to me. A column of light appeared in the center of the pyramid, and began to expand,filling the whole interior with light. But the visions stopped at that point. I sensed that the true intent was that I prepare myself for my visit with someother magicians the coming weekend, by balancing myself as much as possibleunder the current transits of Uranus and Saturn to my astrological pattern. This wasso that these powerful forces would not interfere with the events of the weekend."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Laidrom, Senior of Mars\u0001 574/30/86I invoked Laidrom with the usual methods. He appeared this time in the guise ofa Knight, with a dark brown horse at his side. He had his sword in his left hand, anda small shield in his right. The sword was held upright.I did the signs of Set and LVX, and he answered with the same, followed by thesign of fire. I tested with the pentagram of Earth, which made his image brighter. Now he mounted his charger, and rode towards me. As he passed, I was drawnup onto the horse behind him. He said, “We have far to go today, so I have broughtthis mount to make the way go faster. Observe as we go, and tell what you see.”He gave the horse a kick with his heels, and we were off. The first place we cameto was a dark plane, with the sky above it lightening with the dawn. On the horizonahead of us was a tower outlined against the sky. As we came closer, I saw that thetower was cylindrical and did not have any buildings attached to it. We rode into thetower and came out upon its battlements. Here Laidrom said we should dismountfor a moment.On the plain below, I saw a number of small dark creatures scurrying about.Closer examination showed them to be scorpions. They dressed themselves intoranks, and turned to the tower. I saw them raise their claws in an imitation of thesign of Set. Then they rose upon their hindmost pair of legs, and gave a fair imita-tion of the signs of LVX.Observing them, I asked Laidrom of the significance of this place. he said “Theseare the ranked powers of the sign of Scorpio, which is Set's sign.14 Though we are inthe earth tablet, we have come here as the first step on today's journey of discovery.For the powers of Set are your own powers, and must be invoked and absorbedbefore we pass on to other places. I bid you, go down among the ranks, and accepttheir salute.”I mounted the horse, and rode down the tower and onto the plane, drawing upbefore the first rank of the scorpions. There I dismounted and went forward.The lead scorpion, who stood a half-length in front of his fellows, came forwardand placed his left claw into my right hand. Thereupon his sting jetted forth venom,covering both the claw and hand. They melted into each other, and then the scor-pion melted into my astral body. I felt a thrill of power as it did so. The other scorpi-ons came forth in turn, and each did the same. There were seemingly endless ranksof the beasts, but the process took only a few moments of time.As I absorbed the ranks, there appeared about me a storm-like charge of power,filling out my aura with its force. I could see flashes like lightning bolts along theouter shell of the aura, and a whirling wind sprang from nowhere bringing with itrain and thunder. I myself changed as the power increased. My skin turned a darkolive color that looked almost black in this half-light, and I felt myself changing intothe image of a man in the short kilt and collar typical of egyptian deities. I requested14. Since Mars is the traditional ruler of Scorpio, it seems appropriate to see it here, despite the watery nature of the sign. But Scorpio is also related to Earth, as it represents the decaying vegetation within which are hidden the seeds of the next spring’s growth."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors58 \u0001a mirror, and saw that my head had become the head of a grazing beast of some sortthat I did not recognize. The skull was long and ended in a horse-like muzzle. Theears were small, and in the position the head was held on the body they were aboveand forward of the horns. They twitched in short arcs. The horns went out horizon-tally from the sides of the head, and then curved upwards. Each was about the samelength as the thickness of the head. In my right hand I held a staff of life, a phoenixwand, and in my left hand I held an ankh.Now the mirror vanished, and I was again on the plain, which was now almostempty of the scorpions. One or two of them were headed out over the horizon, but Idid not pursue them. I turned to the horse and saw that it had also changed. Wherebefore it had appeared as a knight’s horse, thick-bodied with strong legs, suitable tocarry a great weight, it now had more the aspect of the arabian type, a racer ratherthan a charger. Its mane was lifted up in spikes, as if an electric charge were held init. Its skin and hair was now black in color, instead of the previous brown. The horsegestured with its head in a way clearly intended as an invitation to mount. I did so,and the horse returned me to the parapet of the tower. There, Laidrom mountedagain, and we took off into the sky.As we passed on, he said “Now you have absorbed the force of your father, theGod Set, who is Achad, and we can go on to other things. The image in which youfound your body is the image of Set, with the head of the beast that is his sigil. Usethis image if you would invoke his force at any time in the future.”Now we were passing through a realm of silvery-gray, with patches of fog swirl-ing around, so dense they looked almost like steel.“This is the original realm of your brother-god, Typhon, on one of whose horsesyou now ride. We will not see him this time, for he is involved in another work else-where at the moment, but he left for you this mount, as a gift to his brother. In thegroup working of last weekend, you invoked the Dark Hunt of the Sidhe, which isthe image of Typhon in the lands of the Celts, your ancestral clans. Their relation toTyphon is clear from the whirlwind-like way in which they appeared and flewaround the circle, and in the way they rose up to heaven and off to the south at theend of their appearance. The horse who remained and nuzzled you is this horse onwhich we now ride, in one of his more playful moods. He also nuzzled your friendKenn, in order to show that his own work has a part in the release of the minds ofmen from the tyranny of the Osirian priests and authorities. Thus we praised himand recognized his value in this way.”Now we came out of the silvery area, and into another which was of a more nor-mal aspect. Here there was green grass growing, and trees full of fruit and nuts. Thehorse stopped beneath a tree, and we dismounted again. He went aside a pace andcropped the grass. Still in the aspect of Set, I turned about in a full circle. To the east the sky wasblue, and showed the rays of the sun slowly rising over the low hills there. In thesouth it was still dark, and lightning flashed in the clouds. To the west the groundrose and then dropped away, so that it appeared that one could step off the edge"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Laidrom, Senior of Mars\u0001 59directly into the realm of the stars, which shone brightly. The space between themseemed to be living, and projected a sense of extreme depth, passing into dimen-sions different from the one we were in. To the north, a great wheel revolved in thesky, its center in the position of the star Polaris. The ground beneath us was richwith the remains of plants, compressed into peat, and directly above, a small cloudlingered, shielding our sight from the sky there. I willed it to move, and saw behindit a deep abyss, a door seemingly entering into nothingness.My consciousness was riveted by this hole, this rip in space, and it seemed to pullme towards itself. I resisted, and asked Laidrom to speak and account for theseimages.“The hole above is the abyss which is your brother Typhon, the gate to the worldsbeyond the worlds of light. He is not the entry into that lower darkness beyond theroots of the tree, as the later egyptians taught, but rather is the entry way into thatlarger world of which the manifest Tree is the reflection and body. Let us mountagain and go to it.”We did so, and as we did, he said “The other images were of your place as Setwithin the symbols in the minds of men. Set is the pole-star, the force of light enter-ing into the earth through the tunnel in her magnetic shielding that exists at eachpole of rotation. Around that star is the constellation Draco, frequently attributedto Nuit, or to the mother-goddess who is the Earth. The pre-dawn light indicates hisother aspect, as the god Kephra, the god of incarnate light in the darkness, the lightwithin all men that enlivens them and drives them back to the spirit with its painfulprodding. The stars to the west are of course the stars and space of Nuit, the highermother from whom Set was born into the Earth. The south is the realm from whichwe just came, the realm of Typhon within the earth.”We had continued to rise towards the abyss while he said this. Instead of becom-ing darker in its immediate area, it became lighter, until the space about us wasfilled with intense brilliance.“The abyss of Typhon appears to be dark to the eyes of the lower worlds, for itslight is beyond the range of man's senses. But as we come nearer, and adapt to it, itshows its true character as the light which powers all existence.”As we came closer to the abyss, I saw within it little squiggles of light, like the sigilof the astrological sign of Aquarius, save that these were in constant motion, flash-ing about within the limits of the gap. They also reminded me of the wavy visualeffects that sometimes precede a migraine headache.Laidrom said, “Typhon is related to the powers of the planet Uranus, and thesign of Aquarius. Uranus is the power within atoms, that constantly changing forcethat takes on the aspects of all the sub-atomic particles. Each can change from oneto another while retaining the same energy as its essence. This ability to change rap-idly from one thing to another is the mark of Typhon. Since the Horan-Osirianpriests saw change as destruction, and did not appreciate that change is also devel-opment and unfolding of life, they saw him as evil, as a devil like unto yourself, andcaused his image to be changed within their culture to reflect their fears. Now in this"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors60 \u0001time has he come forth in the minds of men as your precursor, your herald, point-ing out his true nature to man so that he might have the perceptual and conceptualbase to manifest your own energies. He combines yourself and Nuit in an unfoldingtension, not merging the two, but holding them separate but intensely involved.Thus the flashing images of the energies bounding between the poles within him-self.”Now we drew very near to the gap. It took on the aspect of a great wall, loomingabove us to infinity. We plunged between two sets of the energetic lines, and outinto darkness.On the far side, my consciousness seemed to be in two places at once. Part wasstill within the astral body, and another part stood off at a distance, apparentlybeing held there by another consciousness greater than itself.I saw myself, Laidrom, and the horse as tiny figures, just barely visible above thegap, which itself seemed very small. I got the sense that they were being observed bybeings of a much greater scope, who surrounded the hole and looked at the worldthrough it. One among them was very close to the hole, and I could feel that hisbeing was bound into a spherical shape. From him radiated a sense of god-like tran-quility and unconcern with self. His spherical body was of an intense blue color, andthis color seemed to transform by synesthesia into other forms, a sound like a tri-umphal organ note, a feeling of warm fatherly protectiveness, a taste like the richtaste of fine dry sherry.Others beyond him manifested other colors. One was the red of Mars, and a linewent from him to Laidrom. Another was mirror-like, a reflecting stillness that couldbe vitally fluid when appropriate. Yet another like the sudden rush of green thingsfrom the ground in spring, throwing out life in abundance. And another like a darkstable cube, who moved not, yet held all movement within himself. Beyond themyet was another like the light of the Sun, brilliant yellow-gold with the internal cer-tainty of one who rules by divine right.Beyond them were many others, going off into the distance on all sides. Onlythose closest to us were silent and observing. The rest talked among themselves intones of many instruments, so that their voices made an harmony like the best oforchestras playing a song of grandeur and magnificence.Now my consciousness was separated from the one who held me above my body,and I saw him as the incarnation of the force of Typhon into a conscious entity. Hiscolor was a sort of yellowish green that could not be focused on. It changed as onelooked at it so that it did not register on the mind directly, but only as a memoryafter the fact.My own consciousness was still dual, one part in the astral body in the form ofSet, and the other, no longer held, taking on a form like those of the gods surround-ing me, but not so large. My own note seemed to be triple in character, one part likea flute, one like a bassoon, one like a trumpet volley. But all three were the same insome way.The part of me that was still on the horse asked Laidrom to explain this thing."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Laidrom, Senior of Mars\u0001 61“The bodies that surround you are the bodies of the planets on their true planeof existence beyond the realms of the manifest Tree of Life. They live here, and sendtheir energy into the world through the worlds in which they attach themselves tomatter. “Now they have come here to welcome and help the one who will bring to manthe consciousness of their true nature, which is the nature that man will take on thestar-roads, and to see that he is connected properly with his own body within theirrealm.“You are a marvel to them, as you are to all within the greater realms who haveseen you. Of these before us, only one, he who manifests as Uranus, has managed tomanifest a nature which is of three different natures at once. The others are all tri-plex as well, but manifest only one or two natures among their three aspects. Ura-nus must do so, for he powers the Tree of Life in its existence, but he has come to histhreefold nature by another route than you, and only came to it after many uni-verses full of experience, and on a much higher level. That you have managed to doso while barely out of the Tree is the miracle that they marvel at.“Of course, we speak here of that fullness of being that is not yet completelywithin your self-conscious aspect, and not alone of the scribe who writes thesewords and comprises two of those aspects within himself. The third aspect is yet thelargest of the three in power, and can not yet be comprehended within your incar-nate perceptions.“Because he is the only one who is of the three natures of yourself, Uranus wasthe only one who could hold you in place and avoid the premature merging of yourexcarnate consciousness with your incarnate consciousness. Thus he did aid you toprotect yourself in those first moments when your body came into this world, sothat it would not be destroyed by an inflow of power. Now, that larger part of your-self is holding back on its own, giving you just as much of its awareness as you canabsorb at this point.”Laidrom directed the horse towards the Sun, who stood behind those others. Atthe same time, that larger sphere of self went into orbit about the sphere of Sol, eachorbit drawing it closer in. It intersected the lower aspect once on each orbit, so thatits spiral path and our straight path progressed inward at the same rate.As we approached the sun, an image began to form out of the center of hissphere. It was the image of a king upon his throne, as in the card called TheEmperor in the Tarot. Its throne was lacking the symbols of the Ram that are in thecard, and in their place had the symbols of the Lion and the Dove. As I watched, this king raised the scepter that was in his left hand, and pointed ittowards me. He also raised high the orb in his right hand, and shook it towards me.A golden fluid sprang out of it, and covered me and the horse fully with a sheen likeoil. Laidrom, I noted, had jumped out of the way as this was done, and then comeback to stand in the air beside me.This king now spoke, saying, “Thus do I anoint as my herald the one who hasbeen the aid and comfort of my daughter in her times of trial. He shall come before"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Book of the Seniors62 \u0001me in the Courts of the Stars, in the place of honor in our procession to the mar-riage of the daughter and that one who is beyond me, as I am beyond her.

Go, and return to your world andbody. As the days progress you shall see that here I have spoken a truth, a truth thatshould be known of all men who hope to be greater than they are.

Yea, honor shall come to all, within the Courts of the Stars.“Be ye gone now to your place.”The part of myself that was outside the astral body seemed to be locked onto thesun in some way, so I performed the sign of Hoorpokrati to reabsorb it. Yet a partstill seemed to be within the aura of the Sun, and remained there as I willed thehorse to turn, and pass through the abyss of Typhon into the worlds of the Tree ofLife.As we passed through the Abyss of Typhon, it receded into the distance again,leaving us suspended in light above the landscape from which we began our passageoutwards. Laidrom was still in the air beside me, and directed me to land upon thepeat fields. We did so, and I dismounted again. I noted that I was still in the god-form of Set, which seemed to have maintained itself without any attention on mypart throughout this working. I needed a few moments to gather my wits again, so Iexamined the wand that I held. It was a phoenix wand, as I had perceived earlier, but rather than being in thestandard form of such wands in the Egyptian cults, it was a staff of ebony wood,"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Laidrom, Senior of Mars\u0001 63with a phoenix rising in flames mounted on its top. The flames seemed to flickerand flow down the staff as I watched, covering my hand and arm with its power.After a few moments, the fires dispersed into the general glow of my aura, and Ibegan to feel more normal again.The ankh that I held in my other hand looked to be of some metal that wasextremely hard, and had a blue sheen to it. The hardness reminded me of platinumin some way, and the blueness of refined uranium. Sparks flashed frequentlythrough the glow that surrounded it, and also flashed up my arm and into my heartcenter. I got a sense of increased life in the heart as this occurred.Now I turned to Laidrom, and asked him what was next to be done in this time.He said, “We are done, except for a small explanation of what has occurred.”He gestured, and an image of the temple that I constructed from the Tablet ofEarth appeared before us.“In the course of these visions, you have been generating the force to fully chargethe parts of the temple within which the gods are said to reside. Your previousefforts, viewing the Kerubic squares of the tablet, had the effect of charging the pil-lars of the temple, which enclose between them the part of the temple given over toman. Thus in these two series have we completed the construction of the temple intruth, so that now you stand as the exemplar of the path which that templedescribes, fully able to manifest all its levels and functions.“The parts of the temple attributed to the sephiroth need not be invoked at thistime, although I am certain that you will do so at some time in the future, simplyfor the sake of consistency and completeness. But in fact they have already beeninvoked in their essence in the invocation of the pillars. For note you, the lowest ofthe sephirotic squares of each angle, which sum up the powers of the sephiroticcrosses, are placed in the temple exactly upon the intersection of each angle's keru-bic squares, as they are grouped to form the pillars of the temple. Thus, the invoca-tions of the pillars also served to manifest a sufficient amount of the sephiroticenergies that a new set of invocations is not needed.“The tour of the paths of the Seniors within the Earth Tablet is completed.Within this tour, we have given you knowledge of the course of yourself within theearth, and the course of man under the tutelage of the Knights of Will in the Earth,who are also known as the Knights of Set and the Mother.
