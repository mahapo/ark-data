If any of these three is lacking, then the work is likelyto fail; once you are skilled in using all three, you can dispense with practi-cally all the other things people sometimes insist are essential to the practice. Of the three, emotion is the power that drives the whole show; emotionfrom the guts, and from the heart. I will go even further; it is not just emo-tion, but passion that is the power behind magick. Passion in the sense of anintense desire to be connected to that which you are seeking to invoke; adesire that places no restrictions or limits on the connection, but which is soone-pointed that nothing save that which is sought is included within itsfocus. And passion in the sense of a boundless enthusiasm for the acts bywhich you seek to create that connection. Admittedly, this is the ideal case;but the closer you can get to it, even for a few moments, the more likely yourwork is to be successful. This passion-for-connection is what creates the magickal link betweenthe magician and that which he is invoking; or, if the link already exists,expands it and strengthens it. The emotion literally creates a channel orumbilicus between them, through which energy and knowledge can flow ineither direction. The stronger the emotion, the stronger the link becomes;the less energy is lost in side-thoughts and distractions, the stronger the linkbecomes. Thus a one-pointed focus is most desireable. But conversely, restrictions the magician places on the connectionbecome constrictions in the link, reducing the potential flow of powerthrough it. If a magician insists that a spiritual force or being manifest itselfin a specific way, then it is less likely to appear, or the manifestation with beweaker. But if his desire for connection is unconditional, then a response ismuch more likely, and will be more powerful when it comes. Similarly, if amagician doing a ritual to obtain money desires that money to appear in theform of a cashier’s check, he is less likely to obtain it than if he was willing toaccept it in any form.In its highest form, this unconditional passion becomes almost indistin-guishable from what is called “Divine Love”, which is the closest that one cancome (within the worlds of manifestation) to the transcendental state of theMother aspect of divinity. Passion-for-connection transforms into a state ofpure relationship, pure Love, in which all distinctions are erased; both the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"nature of the magician and the nature of that being invoked disappear,totally lost in the link between them.Imagination provides the medium (rather, an opening to the medium)through which magick produces its results. The personal imagination seemsto blend seamlessly into the astral light, the larger magickal universe; thepoint at which one becomes the other is impossible to define clearly. Anobject that begins as a purely internal construct – created and sustained bythe imagination of a magician, propelled by the power of emotion – canmove out into the astral light and take on a life independent of its creator. Itcan gather or become a container for magickal power, and act back on itscreator (or on others) in ways that are impossible for him to producethrough his imagination alone. Conversely, beings and powers operating onlevels the magician cannot yet perceive can make themselves known to thehim through his receptive imagination, opening his awareness into newrealms of experience. The symbols used in magick are forms that, when created in the imagi-nation, tend to gather specific types of power from the astral light, which arefurther limited by the intent of the magician. The shape of the container, ineffect, determines what can be put into it; the simpler, rigidly geometricforms (such as the pentagram and hexagram) draw relatively pure, funda-mental forces; complex symbols – e.g., god-forms – draw correspondinglycomplex assemblages of forces. When the magician projects the image of a symbol onto his sur-roundings, an extended magickal space is created in which the astral lightbecomes conditioned into conformity with the symbol. The area becomesmore attractive to the types of power invoked, more comfortable for mag-ickal beings having the nature represented by the symbol. The world of thepowers and the world of the magician then intersect, making interactionpossible.(A detailed series of practices for developing the imagination and cre-ating a general-purpose magickal space can be found in my article A ShortCourse in Scrying. This present paper is aimed towards showing by examplehow it is used in formal rituals.)Feeling is the third leg of the tripod, and the final key to success inmagick. In order to bring into being the conditions you desire, you must cre-ate in yourself the sensations and feelings that the things you have createdthrough your imagination are real, and that the goal of the operation hasalready been accomplished. In the magickal universe, when you act with allyour being as if something is already real, it becomes real. This feeling of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"reality is the trigger that causes a symbol to move from the imagination intothe astral light.This key to magick is simply stated, but in practice it seems to give thegreatest difficulty for most people. The usual culprits are intellectual doubts– “I know I am only imagining this” – and fears of various sorts, e.g., “whatif it makes me go crazy?” Both of these have to be ruthlessly eliminated fromthe magician’s consciousness for the duration of the operation. After thework is completely over, you can be as doubtful and fear-ridden as you want;a certain amount of doubt, of critical examination, is healthy and appropri-ate at that time. But during the work, you must be completely focused onfeeling (not thinking) that what you create is real. Some might be concerned that this “believing makes it real” idea isactually a form of self-hypnosis, a way of fooling oneself by reducing thecritical faculties. A genuine success in performing the ritual will dispose ofthis concern. At some point in the work a threshold is crossed; the strengthof the invocation produces an even stronger response from somewhere out-side yourself. Events in your magickal space take on a life of their own, atleast partially independent of your will. And – most significant – they beginto manifest an intensity, richness and texture that it is utterly impossible foryou to produce through your imagination alone, no matter how adept youmight be in its use. Once this has been experienced even a skeptical mindmust grant that the events are “real” in some sense, even if not in the sameway as mundane happenings.So for magick to be successful, emotion must push a link outwards intothe magickal universe, imagination must aim it towards the desired goal,and feeling must affirm the reality of that which is sought. Full success willnot come on the first try; for some people, not even on the fiftieth. It takestime to condition the mind to the proper performance of these practices.But once a single success is attained, additional successes follow at more fre-quent intervals."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn’s Pentagram RitualThe Pentagram Ritual is an excellent practice-piece for developing profi-ciency in these three essential skills. Its physical and verbal elements are sim-ple and easily memorized, enabling the student to give most of his attentionto the visualizations and the feelings attending them. But for all its simplic-ity, it is capable of producing profound effects on the consciousness of themagician. Performing it is also of long-term benefit; it purifies and strength-ens the magician’s magickal body, and increases his general sensitivity toevents in the magickal universe.Oddly, the most frequently referenced descriptions of the PentagramRitual make almost no mention of its imagery and feeling components. Per-haps in the Golden Dawn and Crowley’s A∴A∴, these were expected to bethe subject of verbal instruction, or were simply assumed to be too obviousto mention. Regardless, it was the absence of such descriptions thatprompted a student to request the elaborated version of the ritual that fol-lows. The Pentagram is a symbol whose power is partly innate, and partly amatter of the magician’s intent. Its natural tendency (in the astral light) is toattract a dynamic, active mix of the elemental forces; in contrast, the equal-armed cross attracts the same forces but tends to keep them fixed and dis-tinct from each other. But when the Pentagram is used to invoke a specificelement, the element is determined largely by the magician’s habitual meth-ods of usage and his intent of the moment. There are several methods ofencoding the desired element in the way the Pentagram is drawn; all of theseare more or less arbitrary, and depend on consistent use and practice to beeffective.ZACDBrrInvokingBanishingFigure 1."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"In modern magickal systems, it is customary to associate the elementswith the points of the Pentagram as shown in Figure 1. This set of associa-tions derives from the Golden Dawn, and was intended to reflect the posi-tions of the Elemental Tablets within the “Revised” Great Table of theEnochian magickal system. Had they chosen to use the original version ofthe Great Table (as would seem more appropriate, from more recentresearch) a substantially different set of associations would result: Earthwould be at the upper right point, Water at the lower right, and Fire at thelower left.Since the Golden Dawn associations have come into general usage, itseems convenient to stay with them. The method of drawing invoking andbanishing Pentagrams is also arbitrary, and in this case, the Golden Dawnused a method that is cumbersome, difficult to remember, and contains anundesirable dualism. To replace it, I recommend the method used by theAurum Solis, which is simple and self-consistent. To draw an invoking Pen-tagram, draw clockwise from the point associated with the desired element;to draw a banishing Pentagram, draw counterclockwise from the samepoint.In the Golden Dawn version of the ritual, the magician is instructed todraw a pentagram of Earth in every quarter. The theory behind this was thatthe element of Earth serves as container or receptacle for the other three ele-ments. This idea seems to derive from an old interpretation in which Fire,Water, and Air were the true elements, and Earth merely something onwhich they acted. I feel it more appropriate to use the pentagram of Spirit.Spirit contains all the other elements within itself on an equal basis, andfacilitates the transformations between them that make possible activity andlife in the manifest world; it is more truly “generic”."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Lesser Ritual of the PentagramThe Opening.1. Stand in the center of the circle, feet together, facing east. Using yourthumb, touch the center of your forehead, and vibrate “Ateh.”As you say “Ateh,” imagine a beam of light coming down from the heavens,and forming a sphere or dome of brilliant white light, about nine inchesacross, above your head. Note: Wherever a glowing sphere, column, or line is mentioned it shouldappear like a neon light, transparent or translucent with every point of itsinterior emanating light. Your body should be perfectly “transparent” to allthese images; that is, the lines and column should pass through your bodywithout being hindered by it in any way.2. Still using your thumb, gesture slowly down the centerline of your bodyuntil your thumb is pointing at the ground between your feet.As your gesture moves downwards, imagine a column of white light about 3inches thick, descending from the sphere through the center of your body atthe same rate of speed (as if you were “drawing” the column with your ges-ture). Feel the column as being filled with a vibrating energy that sets up asympathetic vibration in your body wherever it passes.Vibrate “Malkuth.”Imagine the column of light descending into the ground below your feet.Once there, it anchors itself in place and forms another ball of light; this ballstarts out a dark red, but quickly becomes brighter and whiter as moreenergy feeds into it.3. Touch your right arm at the level of your heart and vibrate “ve-Geburah.”Imagine a small sphere of light forming where you touch.Move your hand horizontally to the same point on your left arm andvibrate “ve-Gedulah.”As you move your hand, imagine another line of white light being tracedhorizontally through the center of your body, intersecting the vertical col-umn about where your heart is. When the line reaches your left arm, imag-ine another small ball of light forming there. Then imagine a flow of energy"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"back and forth between them. Feel that energy as it passes through yourbody, and begins to produce a tingling sensation in your heart.4.Make a clockwise circle about 6\" across around your heart. Vibrate “le-Olahm.”As soon as you complete this circle, imagine a big pink rose blooming insideit, with its stem at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines of thecross. Feel the movements of its petals in your heart as it unfolds. When it iscompletely unfolded, imagine a rose-pink radiance being emitted from it inall directions. This radiance expands until it completely encloses the crossand your body.5. Vibrate “Amen.” Bring your arms down to your sides, relax as much as you can while stillstanding straight, and take a few moments to appreciate and feel every-thing that you have visualized so far. You should generate in yourself asense of satisfaction with what you have done so far, and joy in the result. 6. Let the above visualizations fade. Don't try to “erase” them, just stop giv-ing attention to their maintenance. If they continue to exist without anyeffort on your part, that's fine. If they disappear, that's fine, too.Main Ceremony.7. Advance to the east point of the circle. Draw a large pentagram with yourwand, or with the pointed fingers of your hand.The lines of all the pentagrams, and the circle connecting them, should beseen in a blue-white color. They should have a perceptible, three-dimen-sional thickness, at least equal to that of a clothesline or thin rope. Make a stabbing gesture at the center of the pentagram with wand orhand, and vibrate “Ya h w e h.”As you vibrate the name, imagine the inside of the pentagram becoming anopen window into the Realms of Air. Beyond the window, you should imag-ine some landscape that seems Airy to you. One image works especially wellfor me: the view from a Tuscan hill town, the sky an almost painfully bril-liant blue, creating a dome so vast and seemingly deep that it dwarfs all thehuman and natural features of the landscape into insignificance. The “BigSky” of the American Plains is a similar image. Whatever, you should feelthat the landscape is filled to overflowing with the force of Air, vast in"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"extent, all-penetrating, and etherial. Imagine that this realm extends toinfinity in the direction you are facing.Once you have the landscape firmly visualized, imagine a cool wind blow-ing into your circle through the pentagram. Feel the wind filling up the circleand blowing through your body and soul, leaving no part of you untouched.It blows out and replaces the impure Airy elements of your own nature withpure Airy power. Keep feeling this wind until you feel cleaned out and filledwith Airy power.Note: If you are banishing, you should next feel the power sweeping out ofyourself and the circle, back through the pentagram. After which you shouldimagine the “window” closing again. Same for all the following quarters.Take a few moments to stop and appreciate whatever degree of Airyness youhave managed to bring into the circle. Feel a sense of satisfaction with it,and vow to make it even better the next time. Then stop consciously sup-porting the images and feelings. At first they will fade, but with continuedpractice you will find that a residual feeling of the element will remain inthe circle throughout the rest of the ceremony.8. Move clockwise around the circle until you come to the south. Starting atthe center of the eastern pentagram, draw a blue-white line as you go.Face the south and draw a large pentagram. Make the stabbing gesture atthe center of the pentagram, and vibrate “Adonai.”Imagine the pentagram opening into the Realms of Fire. The landscape youchoose should present a feeling of intense, radiant heat, like that you feel onyour face from the Sun, only sourceless and omnidirectional. An appropriateimage might be Death Valley at noon, with shimmering waves of heat fillingspace in all directions. Or the surface of the Sun -- ultimate, incandescentheat. The landscape should feel full to bursting with the power of the ele-ment, and feel like it extends to infinity in the direction you are facing.When the landscape has been firmly established, feel the heat rushing intoyour circle through the pentagram. Feel it filling the circle and yourself,burning out any impurities and totally consuming them, then replacingthem with pure Fiery force. Continue until you feel completely purified bythe Fire and filled with its force.Take a few moments to stop and appreciate whatever degree of Fieryness youhave managed to bring into the circle. Feel a sense of satisfaction with it,and vow to make it even better the next time. Then stop consciously sup-porting the images and feelings."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"9. Move clockwise to the west, drawing a segment of the circle as you go.Face the west, and draw a large pentagram. Make the stabbing gesture atthe center of the pentagram, and vibrate “Eheieh.”Imagine the pentagram becoming a window into the Realms of Water.Imagine a watery landscape. I use either an infinite region filled with waterof a deep, almost violet blue color; or an underwater view of a reef withplenty of fish and plant life, and waves crossing the surface overhead.With the landscape visualized, imagine Water gushing into the circle andyourself, dissolving any impurities and diluting them into nothingness,replacing them with its own pure power. Keep feeling this until you feelclean and totally filled with Water.Pause to appreciate the Watery element you have managed to bring into thecircle. Feel satisfaction with it, and know that you can do even more thenext time. Then stop consciously supporting the images. 10. Move clockwise to the north, drawing the circle as you go. Face the north,draw a large pentagram. Make the stabbing gesture at the center of thepentagram and vibrate “AGLA.”Imagine the pentagram becoming a window into the Realms of Earth,beyond which you can see some landscape that seems supremely “Earthy” toyou. I use either a soft, warm darkness of infinite extent; a cave with ancientpaintings on the walls; or cultivated land with all sorts of food-crops grow-ing. The emphasis should be on the fertility and potential for life hidden inthe darkness of the Earth, rather than the view of Earth as cold, sterile stone.Imagine the Earthy power moving through the pentagram, filling up the cir-cle and penetrating your body, making any impurities so inert and heavythat they fall downwards out of your body, to be replaced by a pure earthforce. Keep feeling this until you feel clean and totally filled with Earth.As in the preceding quarters, pause to appreciate the Earthy element youhave managed to bring into the circle. Feel satisfaction with it, and knowthat you can do even more the next time. Then stop consciously supportingthe images. 11. Complete the circle by returning clockwise to the east, drawing the line asyou go. Return to the center of the circle and face east.Standing in the center of the circle, try to see all four landscapes at once, andfeel the power of all four elements focused on you through the pentagrams."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"12.Say: “Before me stands Raphael; behind me stands Gabriel; on my righthand is Michael; on my left hand is Auriel.” The names of the archangelsshould be vibrated.The angels should be imagined appearing as their names are vibrated. Eachshould be seen as an immense figure on the horizon beyond the landscape intheir quarter. You should have a definite sense of them as sapient, self-awarebeings of great power, come to aid you in your work. The landscapes repre-sent the natural, non-sapient force of the elements; the archangels representthe divine powers that rule and direct those elements.The archangels should have some form that signifies – in your mind – theirrulership over their elements. I see them as figures in robes the color of theirelements. Raphael has blond hair that moves in an invisible breeze; he holdsa fan or dagger in his right hand pointed towards you. His face has an aqui-line cast. Gabriel has dark hair with a bluish cast, dark skin, and holds a sil-ver cup towards you. His robes seem to move in an invisible current.Michael has hair and eyes like flames, a slightly fox-like cast to his face, andhis robes seem to be made of woven threads of fire.

Stand with your arms stretched out to the sides, and feet apart. Say:“About me flame the pentagrams...”See the four pentagrams and the lines connecting them suddenly flaring toan intense brightness around you. As they do so, imagine a fifth, equallybright pentagram forming about your body, its points congruent with yourhead, hands, and feet. Remember that the pentagram signifies rulership ofthe Spirit over the four elements, and that by identifying it you are claimingthat rulership for yourself. Try to feel yourself as Spirit, connected to the fourelements, but also above them.Say: “...and in the column shines the six-rayed star!”Your mood as you say these words should be one of triumph and exultation,a sense of complete success in the endeavor of invoking the elements. Imagine a large golden hexagram, the same width as your circle, forming inthe air above you. Rays of power shine radially outwards from each of its"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"points. The lowest point of the hexagram is congruent with the highest pointof the pentagram previously visualized.The hexagram signifies the planetary or “heavenly” realms that are abovethe worlds of the elements.

By claiming the power of the elemental Spirit,you are also declaring your freedom from the rule of the mundane world,and claiming the right to enter into and work in those higher realms. The Response.14. At this point, the invocation is effectively complete. You have finished set-ting up the conditions for a response from the astral light; now you mustgive that response a chance to occur. This is an utterly vital part of anyinvocation you will ever do; you may get some response while perform-ing the ritual, but the most important, the most vital, revealing, and con-sciousness-expanding part of the response nearly always takes place inthe quiet time after the active work has ended. You should now cease all active visualizations, and assume a relaxed,comfortable position, standing or sitting. Silently open yourself to theforces you have invoked, listen for them with your mind, your body, andyour aura. Don’t do anything, and don’t think about doing anything for atime; just absorb your magickal environment as passively as a “couchpotato” watching TV. When it seems, after a while, as if everything that is going to occur hasoccurred, do the ceremonial closing to complete the session.The Closing15.
