Our own, however, are chiefly of continental origin, while, so far asit is possible to speak with any positive opinion upon so dubious and involved a question, it wouldappear that the French systems are largely particular to themselves, subject of course to the factthat proceeding in all cases on certain general principles, to that extent they may be said to derivefrom one another, or at least from a common root. I have selected for inclusion one system which-- although it first came into notice at the beginning of the nineteenth century -- is likely to be newto my readers. It is worked with a piquet set of ordinary playing cards, which, as most people willknow, consists of the usual picture-pieces and the ace, 10, 9, 8 and 7 of each suit, excluding thelower numbers. The method has appeared, I believe, under more than one auspice, but theimputed author termed himself an Egyptian and claimed to publish his little treatise at Memphis,which, however, stands for Paris. It is not a very full method and is not free from confusions as itwas first issued. In the form which here follows it has been so far rectified and extended fromother French sources that it will, I think, serve the purpose as an alternative to the English systemgiven in the previous section. I must explain, however, that those who intend to make use of itshould obtain, if possible, a set of French or Swiss cards, in which the picture-pieces appear at fulllength, instead of with a head at either end, and all the numbers are marked Droit and Renverse attheir opposing poles, meaning right side up and reversed Otherwise, an English set may be somarked by the student. Important differences attach to the variations in question, so far as thetrump-cards are concerned, as they do indeed in the English method.It may not be impertinent to mention before proceeding that the origin of card-playing has beenreferred by some French writers to one Jacquemin from whom two sets were purchased in 1392to amuse Charles VI, King of France, during his days of distraction. It is at most obvious that thesimple historical fact can be only an episode in the French history of cards; the evidence isconcerning sale and purchase, and it would be fantasy to assume that the vendor in the specificinstance was also the inventing artist. Spain and Italy are sometimes said to have been inpossession of cards prior to the French people; it has been even speculated that they were broughtto Italy by Greek emigrants from Constantinople, that they drifted from Italy into Spain andthence to our Gallic neighbors. It is certain, in any case, that they were in Italy at the very timewhen their existence is first on record in France, for they are mentioned in a Florentine chroniclewritten towards the close of the fourteenth century, while so early as 1332 it is said that they wereprohibited in Spain by an edict of Alphonsus XI. If the latter statement rests on authority, it leavesthe reason doubtful, and I mention this point to add that we have little opportunity of decidingwhen cards were first used as a game of hazard; it has been thought that at their inception theywere designed for instruction or amusement, and contained no combinations of members, soessential for gambling arts. The earliest records which I have cited offer no indication of the cardsthat composed the sets, either as to design or quantity; therefore the symbols and numbers may ormay not have corresponded when first we hear concerning them to the Tarot packs, which --either independently or otherwise -- were certainly in existence about the same period. It isindubitable, as I have stated already, that these were the precursors of our playing cards, but thereare wide differences in most of the archaic sets. It can only be said that the scheme of symbolismwhich is comprised in the major trumps is unquestionably old, as it is indubitably of greatimportance, though nearly all that has been written heretofore upon the subject is referable to theA.E.

A separate section is devoted, however, to the Tarot elements, the higherconstruction of their meaning and its application in an exalted sense. It remains only to say thatFrench cartomancy in the eighteenth and nine-teenth centuries set the fashion to the wholeEnglish-speaking world, if not to Europe itself- that Alliette, or Etteilla, Mlle. Lenormand,Madame Clement and Julia Orsini were the prophets of all divination with all varieties of cards-and that, except in certain secret circles, where there is supposed to be a special tradition, we havedone little more than follow them.I will give, in the first place, the general signification of piquet cards according to variousauthorities, and these may be compared with the alternative renderings which have beenenumerated already in connexion with the shorter English method. It will be understood, as inother cases, that everything depends upon the insight, intuition, divining gift, or -- as it is calledsomewhat conventionally -- the clairvoyant faculty of the operator.A.E.

If an actual marriage is in question, removetwo cards, representing the lover and the lady whose fortunes are at issue. Place these cards, faceupwards, on the table before you. As usual, fair people are represented by Hearts and Diamondsbut those of dark complexion by Clubs and Spades. The attribution, between these lines, seems tobe usually at predilection or discretion, but Diamonds are sometimes taken to signify very fairpeople and blondes, while Spades are for actual brunettes and very dusky complexions.Lay out the rest of the cards three by three; in every triplicity which produces two of the samesuit, select the higher card of that suit and place it by the side of the other card which stands for the Querent. Throw out the rest for the moment, but they will be required later.When any triplicity produces entirely different suits, put aside all three in the rejected pile. Whenthe entire cards of the set have thus been dealt with in succession, take up the rejected lot, andafter shuffling and cutting as before, proceed in the same manner until you have drawn fifteencards and placed them by the side of the Querent.If the Querent is a dark man, he will not have his wish regarding the marriage contemplated unlessa tierce to the King in Clubs be among the fifteen cards. It may of course happen that the King hasbeen drawn to represent him. If, however; he be a Spade, then alternatively there must be a tiercein Spades.The same rule obtains if the Querent is a dark young lady, but in addition to a tierce in the suitthere must be the Ace of the suit also.If the Querent is a fair man or woman, then a tierce in the one case and a tierce and the Ace in theother must be found in Hearts or Diamonds according to the grade of their fairness.If the question concerns a marriage to take place in the country, it has been held by the expositorsof the system that a tierce to the King in Diamonds is indispensable. This seems to involve thesystem in respect of fair people, but it is only a confusion of expression. If Diamonds correspondto the Querent, that tierce must obviously be present, or ex hypothesi there will be no marriage;but if present the inference is that the Querent will get his wish in respect of locality as well as ofthe fact of marriage. On the other hand, if the Querent is referable to any other of the threeremaining suits, then ex hypothesi to attain his presumed wish for a country wedding, he musthave the tierce in Diamonds as well as in his own suit. It is not very probable that the alternativebetween town and country will arise as a subsidiary question, and if it does, it might be better todetermine it separately by the help of some other system. It serves no purpose to ignore theA.E.

The inference is that secondmarriages are rare.II6_bAeUcdY_^c_^9^XUbYdQ^SU6_bAeUcdY_^c_^9^XUbYdQ^SUShuffle and cut as before, and place on the table a card which is held to typify the Querent. Thepresence of the Ace of Spades, manifesting right side up, indicates profit in consequence of adeath that is to say, an inheritance or legacy. If the Ace is accompanied by the Seven, Eight, Nineand Ten of Clubs, there will be a large increment of money. The combination may be difficult tosecure, but very large inheritances are rarer than second marriages.III6_b<QgceYdcQ^TCY]Y\\Qb=QddUbc6_b<QgceYdcQ^TCY]Y\\Qb=QddUbcNo judgment can be given on the chances of a lawsuit, actual or pending, nor generally on thingsof this nature, unless the King of Spades comes out in the dealing. If that card is held usually torepresent the Querent, then it only follows automatically that a judgment is possible, and it is somuch the easier for him in such case. The shuffling, cutting and dealing proceed as before, and ifthe Ace in question serves to complete the quint major in Spades -- that is, the Ace, King, Queen,Knave and Ten -- it is to be feared that the suit will prove good for nothing, either by goingagainst the Querent or bringing him no profit in the opposite case. But if the Ace is accompaniedby the four Tens, the chances are excellent. They are said also to be more than good in anotherevent of the dealing which I forbear from dwelling on, as it is practically, if not otherwise,impossible for the fifteen cards -- which the dealing proposes to extract -- to be all of the redsuits. It is well known that compilers of works on cartomancy sometimes forget the limitsprescribed by their systems and get consequently into ridiculous plights.IV6_bQDXUVd6_bQDXUVdFor the discovery of a thief, the presence of the four Knaves is indispensable to any reading, and,as it happens, it is not utterly difficult -- though it is none too easy -- that the chances of the cardsshould produce them. The procedure is throughout as before. If the King and the Eight of Spadesturn up among the fifteen cards, this means that the thief is already in prison; if the Ace of Spadesis among them, the prisoner will be in danger of death; the presence of the Ace of Clubs, the Kingof Clubs and the Queen of Hearts will afford some hope that the person who stole will himselfmake restitution; lastly, the predominance of Diamonds offers ground for believing that the thiefhas been arrested, but on another charge than that which would be preferred by the Querent onhis own part.A.E.

The procedure isthroughout as before, except that the card selected is held to represent the person in duranceinstead of the Querent. The fifteen cards having been produced as the result of the working, theyshould be examined in the usual way. The presence of the Queen of Hearts, Knave of Clubs, Nineof Clubs and the four Aces will give ground for hope that liberation will be easy and at hand. Inproportion as these cards are absent, there will be delay in the desired event, and if none arefound, it is likely to be rather remote. On the other hand, the appearance of the Eight and Nine ofSpades, the King of Spades, and the Knave and Nine of Diamonds, will signify that liberty shall bescarcely obtained, except after many obstacles and much consequent postponement.VI6_bDbQfU\\Ubc6_bDbQfU\\UbcIt is assumed that the Querent is not himself on a journey but is consulting the oracles for one inwhose fortunes he is for some reason interested, by ties of friendship or otherwise. Proceed asbefore, selecting a card to represent the absent person. When the dealing is finished, the resultingcards should be consulted to ascertain whether they include the Ace of Hearts, the Ace ofDiamonds and the Ten of Diamonds, the presence of which will foreshadow probable news.Probability will be raised into certainty by the appearance of the Seven of Diamonds. If, however,the Ten of Spades is found in proximity to the card representing the person who is away on histravels, there will be reason to fear that he is ill; so also the Ace of Spades reversed will mean thathe is in other danger than sickness. If he is to succeed in the enterprise that has called him abroad,he will be escorted by the Nine of Hearts, the Ace and the King of Clubs. Finally, if the Eight ofDiamonds is found in relation to his own card, this means that he is on the point of returning.There is a variation of procedure in all the above cases, which consists in protracting the dealingtill twenty-one cards have been drawn instead of fifteen. It is put on record by the so-calledEgyptian, speaking from the seat of knowledge, that the predominance of red cards as the resultof operation in any given instance foretells great success for the person on whose behalf theconsultation is made. The Ace, Ten, Nine, Eight and Seven of Hearts are premonitory of news onwhich the Querent may be congratulated. The same cards in the suit of Clubs promise success in alawsuit, or a lucky number in a lottery. The same in the suit of Spades prognosticate news of arelative's death, or that of a friend, but whether there will be profit to the Querent is not socertain, having regard to the generally fatal nature of this suit, the constituents of which may besaid almost to constitute the greater misfortunes in cartomancy. The particular numbers in the suitof Diamonds carry with them the same kind of prevision as Hearts.So far the Egyptian and those who have followed in his footsteps and have extended his method.There are probably several other systems of fortune-telling by means of piquet cards; but as thereis no particular authority, so also, and certainly, there is no advantage in thus reducing theelements on which divinatory calculations can be made. The cards below seven in an ordinarypack have their special meanings and therefore their special use. It is obvious that a fuller readingA.E. Waite, “A French Method of Fortune Telling” Manual of Cartomancy and Occult Divination, Rider, 1912Page 9 of 10"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"can be obtained with a fuller set, and this is one reason -- apart from their incalculably superiorsymbolism -- why Tarot cards, with so many additional numbers, are richer than ordinary cardsfor the purposes of cartomancy. It should be understood, therefore, that in presenting the Frenchmethod I am not concerned with recommending it, except in respect of simplicity, to those whoare interested in such matters, and although, outside the modes of dealing, I have included fromanother source only the separate short signification of the two-and-thirty cards, there is no reasonwhy the student or reader should not take advantage of the full pack. Both within and without thepresent collection, there are ample opportunities to ascertain the significance of the smaller cards;their presence will not stultify the system for those who care to follow it; and, as I have indicated,they help the reading. When the eye of the intuitive mind is open, it is well in things of this kindthat the materials on which it can work should not be unreasonably restricted. The thirty-twopiquet cards are not the two-and-thirty paths of the absolute according to Kabalism, and so thereis no special magic in the lesser number, or if it resides anywhere deeply perdu it has not beengiven me to find it, a deficiency which I share apparently with those who invented the system, forthey have certainly failed to adduce it. -----Corrected and formatted by hand.A.E.
