GILBERTBristol,February1987INTRODUCTIONWRITINGto his friend LouisWilkinson,on7April1945,AleisterCrowleyremarked-inuncharacteristically charitablefashion--!Ifit had not been for Waite,Idoubtif,humanlyspeaking,Ishould ever havegotintouchwiththe GreatOrder.'Inevitably he prefixed this praisewithabuse:'Waitecertainlydid starta revival ofinterestin Alchemy, Magic, Mysticism, and all the rest.Thathisscholarship was socontemptible,his style so over-loaded, and hisegomaniasooutrageousdoes not kill to thepointofextinction,theworthof hiscontribution.'Even this ismutedcriticismforCrowley;moreoften he heaped abuse on Waitewithgusto,tingeingitwithvenomouspersonal attacksthatwere asunjustifiedas were his assaults on Waite'swriting.Hischaracterizationof Waite (in his novelMoonchild)as 'EdwinArthwait','a dull and inaccurate pedantwithoutimaginationor real magicalperception',is more a reflectionofhis self-perception. ButwhyshouldCrowley,flamboyant,indifferentto publicopinionand public morals,andwitha perpetualcircle of sycophantic acolytes, be so exercisedwiththe needtocondemna man he perceived as a fellowoccultist?Throughoutthe ten issues of his periodicalTheEquinoxCrowleymaintaineda stream of invective and abuse against A. E. Waite,condemningthe man, hisworks, his friends and allthathe stood for. As there wasvirtuallyno publiccirculationofTheEquinoxthese attacks seem futile, and can only be explainedby awishonCrowley'sparttojustifyhisownactions.Hehadwrittento Waitein1898,after readingTheBookofBlackMagic,and received in reply the adviceto go away and readEckartshausen'sTheCloudupontheSanctuary.HavingreadthebookCrowleyrealizedthatthere is ahidden,InteriorChurchbehindtheouterinstitutions;butwhenhesubsequentlyjoinedtheHermeticOrderof theGoldenDawnhe failed to find theInteriorChurch-forthe simple reasonthatit was never there. Such aChurch-theHolyAssembly-would,inevitably, haverequired fromCrowleywhathe didnotwishto give: therenunciationof hisself-centred nature.Thishe could only preserve by the practiceofmagic anditwas Waite's measured analysisofthefutilityand wickedness of magicthatsoenragedhim in later years."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"13__________INTRODUCTION__12Crowley'shostilitycentredon his awarenessthatWaite had perceived thetruenatureof magic andpointedtoanotherway-thatofthe mystic.Unwillingto acceptwhatheknewinwardlyto be true;Crowleyturnedto verbiage andvenom, at the same timebelittlinghimselfandensuringthatfuturegenerationsofoccultists shouldknowofWaite and be curious.AndwhowasWaite?ArthurEdwardWaite, the child ofAnglo-Americanparents, wasbornat a time of religious upheaval and left thisworldas it wasbusilyengagedintearingapart its social fabric. He was a prolific author,butonewhosebooks are, for themostpart,unknownand unread; he was notrecognizedas a scholar by.the academicworld,buthe remains the onlycomprehensiveanalyst of thehistoryofoccultismin all its many branches.Notthatheapprovedofthetermor the looseness of itsconnotations;to himselfhe was a mystic and anexponentof mysticism. He saw,whatothersbeforehimhad not seen,thatthere can be no finalunderstandingof mystical experiencewithout.an appreciation of thetraditions,outsidetheconfinesof theChurch,thatpreserved those practicesthatbringmystical experiencewithinthe reachof every manand.woman.He is not easyto understand. Hiswritingisdiffuse,oftenverbose,and peppered'witharchaisms;butit. has itsownpower and leavesthereaderwiththe feelingthatburiedwithinthe densely packed prose isamessageofimmensesignificance.This has been perceived by the more acuteofhis critics: DeanInge-ascourgeofsentimentalpseudo-mysticism-believedthatWaite had'penetratedvery nearto the heart of hissubject'(reviewofStudiesinMysticism,inTheSaturdayReview,2March1907).ButWaite refused tojettisonallthatwasincludedundertheheading of occultism. He sawwithinit, asSpurgeonsaid of the Talmud, 'jewelswhichtheworldcouldnotafford to miss'; and seeingthem,drewthemoutand displayedthemfor all tosee-all,thatis,witheyes to see.Many readersofWaite, and most self-confessedstudentsof 'rejectedknowledge',persist in seeing him as an occultist. Usually they find himwanting:RichardCavendish, inTheTarotadmired his energy inpursuingesoteric lorebutdescribedasiuncharacteristicallylucid'his preface toPapus'sTarotoftheBohemiansandkilled .Waite off in1940,'intheLondonblitz',thusdenying himhis lasttwoyearsoflife. MichaelDummett,inThe Game ofTarot,speaks ofWaite as having,'theinstincts, and to a large extent, the temperament,ofagenuinescholar; inparticularhehadthe scholar's squeamishnessaboutmakingfactualassertionsunwarrantedby the evidence'. And yet Waite was 'ascommittedanoccultistas those he subjected to his rebukes'. Evenmoreunkind-andquiteunjustified-wasShumaker'scommentin hisimportantbookTheOccultSciencesintheRenaissance.'An.occultistlikeA.E. Waite', he said, 'whose.attitudetowardalchemy resemblesthatofMontagueSummerstowardWitchcraft,istemperamentallyinclined to assume the possession ofprofoundwisdomby ourancestors' (p.162).He yet proceeded to pillage Waite's alchemicaltranslationstoillustratehisownwork.Sympatheticscholars have seen Waite in a differentlight.GershomScholempraised him forTheSecretDoctrineInIsrael:'Hiswork',he.said, 'isdistinguishedby realinsightintotheworldof Kabbalism';althoughhe addedthat'itis allthemoreregrettablethatit ismarredby anuncriticalattitudetowards facts ofhistoryandphilology'.Thatfailing in Waite wastheresultofunder-educationand his achievements in the field of 'rejectedknowledge'arethe more remarkablewhenit is realizedthathisschoolingconsistedoflittlemorethantwotermsat only onerecognizedinstitute.Thelackofacademictrainingwas the principal cause of Waite's peculiarliterary style,whichresulted in someofhisworkappearing far more abstrusethan was really the case, and evenmore of it seeming to be inconclusive. A masonicfriend of Waite's, B.H.Springett,referred to hisenthusiasmforthesignificanceof certain rituals and to hissettingouthis conclusions'withoutallowing himselfto becommittedto anystatementwhichtheordinaryreadermightconstrueintoadefiniteopinion'(SecretSectsofSyria,p. 59). However difficult his prosemightbe, there were manywhostruggledwithit successfullyand came to admirebothWaite and histhought.W.B.Yeats was one such; he saw Waite as'theone deepstudent'knownto him of LouisClaudede Saint-Martin-amysticalphilosopherextraordinarilydifficult to grasp. In similar veinJohnMasefielddescribed Waite as 'by far themostlearnedmodernscholar ofoccultism-s-andthis because Waiterecognizedthespiritualityof certainofthe alchemists.Waitehimselflookeduponhis studiesoftheoccult (or of'TheSecretTradition', as he preferred to call it) as of subsidiaryimportance-froma literarypointofview-tohis poetry. He was, after all,'theexponentin poetical andprosewritingsof sacramental religion and thehighermysticism' (hisdepictionofhimselfinWho'sWho).Even AleisterCrowleyadmired Waite'spoetry:''asa poet',Crowleyreluctantlyadmitted,'his genius wasundeniable'(inCampaignagainstUizite,anunpublishedpart of theConfessions).Others,more favourablydisposed to Waite,mighthesitate to endorsethatjudgement,butthey admiredhis verse for its own sake.'Poetryof greatbeauty',KatherineTynan called it;whileAlgernonBlackwoodsaw Waite'spoems~inflaminglanguageof greatbeauty, yet truesimplicity-c-asthe work of 'an inspired, outspoken mystic,nothingmore or less'.Whichis how Waitewantedthemto be seen. He was, above all, a mysticandwishedto beknownas such.Thathis studies of the occult arerememberedwhenhis mysticalwritingsare neglected is atributeto the folly of an agethatexalts theirrational,nota judgementupontheirmerits; for it is his analysis ofmystical experience and hisuniqueapproach to thephilosophyof mysticismthatare his truelegacy.It would,however, be unrealistic to expect a swiftrecognition"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"14A.E.WAITE---,MAGICIANOFMANYPARTS_ofhisimportancein the field of mysticism and onemustrestcontentwiththeknowledgethathiscontributionto thehistoryofideas is at lastbecomingappreciated for. its.trueworth.Butis the storyofhis lifeworththe telling?

Waite, who was duly delivered of a child.Captain and Mrs Waite were boarders in the house of Mrs Sarah Webb,WashingtonStreet,Cityof Brooklyn.This testimony calls for a certaininterpretation.DrMason was probably called in at theend of themonthin question, but my actualbirthdate wasOct.2nd.So, seventy-nine years later, Waite described hisownbirthto hisinquisitiveAmericancorrespondent,HaroldVoorhis-whosubsequentlyidentifiedtheboarding-houseand sent Waite adescriptionofthe site:206WashingtonStreet(which was onthecorner ofConcordandWashingtonStreets) inBrooklyn is now covered by the approach for the Brooklyn Bridge. It is two blocks from theBrooklyn end of the Bridge itself. The even number. side ofWashingtonStreet now has nota singlebuildingon it. After the bridge approachends-aftercovering about tenblocks-theremainder has been made into a rest-park.WashingtonStreet ends nearly opposite theCityHall in Brooklyn.1ThetimeofWaite'sbirthcan beidentifiedwithevengreaterprecisionthanthe place, for it isgiven-as1:00 p.m. localtime(5:36 p.m.GMT)on Friday,2October1857-onthehoroscopecast forhiminMarch1923 by anunknownastrologer.WhyWaite,whodisliked and disbelieved inastrology,shouldhavehad ahoroscopecast is aquestionthatis difficultto answer.

My friend Waite,besides taking over all mysticism, occultism,alchemy and transcendentalism for his province, has a hobby, like most good men. In hiscase,this hobby is the collecting of 'Penny Dreadfuls' of ancient date: the forties and early fiftiesare, Ibelieve,the golden age of this adventure.

Machen was alonely,introverted childbuthisloneliness,unlike Waite's,was chosenratherthanthrustuponhim: he had a settled and securehomelife,his roots lay deep in his native county, and he receiveda sound,roundededucationatHerefordCathedralSchool.Andyet,justas Waite's hopes ofOxfordhadbeen dashed, so had Machen's,broughtto an end by a drastic fall in hisfather'sincome. In 1880 hewenttoLondonin a vainattemptto be a medicalstudent,butfailedutterlyandreturnedin the following year to try his hand atjournalism.Thenhe began to experience the miseryofenforced loneliness, exacerbated bypoverty and alleviated only bylongexplorationsof the dreary new suburbs ofWest London.Whilehe waswanderingthroughTurnhamGreen,Gunnersbury,Willesden,andHarlesden,Waite also'walkedamongthe lanes of Middlesex'and'dreamedinwindingtracks which. arenowsuburbanstreets'throughMillHill, Acton, Hayes, andPerivale.Theymightalmost have passed eachotherunknown.Gradually Machen adapted,writingfor himself,translatingandcataloguingfor George Redway the publisher,5andpunctuatinghisemploymentwithbriefvisitshome-hisparents were bynowtoopoorfor him to stay forlongawayfromLondon..Hebeganto socialize, made friends, and met AmyHogg,whointurnbroughthim to Waite.Thefriendship wascementedfrom the start andcelebrated,muchin themannerofcharacters in Machen's fiction, by frequentvisits to taverns and music-halls.'Doyouremember',Machen asked Waite halfa centurylater,'howwe had beer at the old vanishedBellinHolborn,andwentto seeFaustattheLyceum?', andfurther,'howlong ago we explored Bermondsey,andhowtheBermondseybarmaids, onourcalling for gin,wouldoffer us\"TwoTwo's\"?'6Therewas, of course, a more serious side to their friendship.Bothmen weredeeplyimmersedinthe.literatureofoccultism; for Waiteitwas the raw materialof the critical studies he wasbeginningtowriteand the'stuffoutofwhichhis"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"63____________DORAANDTHECOMINGOFLOVE---.;;~62ownbeliefswere slowly and painfully taking on systematicform, while for Machencompilingcataloguesofnew andsecondhandoccultbookswas asignificantpartofhisworkforRedway-italso gave him thetechnicalbackgroundfor his earlyfantastic stories.

Thiswas a reworking of an American fortune-telling manual of1865-FutureFateftretoldbytheStars-supplementedby material from other popular books ondivination that Waite found among Redway's secondhand stock. Latereditionsof theHandbook-renamed TheManualof Cartomancy-aregreatly enlarged andfar more portentous; but in every edition Waite wisely refrained from placinghis name on the title-page.During1889he also took up what hecalled'my firstexcursioninjournalismproperly so called': a four-month stint atwritingTheCourseofEvents,a regularsocialandpoliticalgossip-columnof home newsforThe CivilandMilitaryGazetteofLahore.This was usually undertaken by A.P,Sinnett as part of his dutiesas managerofthejointLondonofficeof theGazetteand thePioneer,but forthat summer he was absent from London and Waite volunteered to write thecolumn on hisbehalf.'Ihave',he laterremarked,'darkrecollectionsof its burden.'The burden,moreover,was about to beincreased._'NOTVERSENOW,ONLYPROSE'79Sinnett wasalwayswilling to put money into new publishing ventures, andin1884he had helped Horatio Bottomley5-thenat a very early stage of hiscareeras afinancialadventurer-toestablishTheDebator,ajournal whichrecordedthe proceedings of 'local parliaments' (debatingsocietiesmodelled on theprocedures of the ·House of Commons). This wasfollowedin 1885 bythe.'CatherineStreet PublishingAssociation',an amalgamation of Bottomley'spublishingconcern with a number of printers in Catherine Street. Sinnett becamea director,broughtin the publisher Kegan Paul, and in1889took the first'steptowards Bottomley's grandiose design of a vastprintingand publishing empireby absorbingRedway.Bottomleysucceededin outbidding William Heinemannfor the firm of Triibner&Co., whose oriental list was highlylucrative,and theenlarged Association tenderedfor-andsecured-thecontract for printingHansard'sParliamentaryDebates.The immediate outcome of all this was the formation of the HansardPublishing Union Ltd., a vastconsortium that aimed to combine under one headevery operation of the publishing world from paper-making andprintingtopublishing and distribution. The initial sharecapitalof£500,000 was over..subscribedand for a time the company flourished, but when a secondshare issueof half a million pounds was launchedwithinayear,rumours of Bottomley'sfinancialdeviousnesswerealreadycirculating and little of it was taken up.

But all of thiswas in the undreamed future when Redwayceasedto be Redway and Waitefound himself at a loose end. Andjustas Sinnett had takenawayhispublisher,so Sinnett now hauled him out.ofthe pit of enforcedidleness.Among thejournalspublishedby the Catherine StreetPublishingAssociationwasTheBritishMail,a monthly thatprofessedto be a 'Journal of the Chambersof Commerce of the United Kingdom' but wasalso,in February1889,withoutan editor.

It is tempting to think that this eulogy of herfatherencouragedAnnie Horniman to look on Waitewithfavourwhen he enteredthe Golden Dawn laterthatyear,but she is unlikely to have recognized Waite'shand, for contributors and editors alike of Bottomley journals remainedanonymous.Indeed, Waite cultivated anonymity to such an extent inTheBritishMailthat in one issue, April 1890, he devotedfour columns to an unsigned, mockingreview of his own anonymous prospectus forAzoth:ortheStarintheEast-e-ebook he had yet to write (it waseventuallypublished in1893).Similar odditieswere a regularfeatureofTheBritishMail;when there wasinsufficientsecondhandcommercial and industrial news'to fill anissue,Waite suppliedessaysof his ownon suchuncommercialtopicsas hypnotism,Freemasonry,.philosophicalidealism,theRosicrucians,and astronomy (in which he maintained his early interest).

He disputed theantiquity of the Tarot andcondemnedLevi'shistoricalinaccuracies,especiallyhis distorted translations fromTrithemius-notthathistranslation ofLeviwasimpeccable:'Ihavenot confinedmyself',he said,'withinthe barren limits ofaslavishliteralism',and was duly taken to task for hisliberties,in a hostilereviewby Edward Macbean of the S.R.I.A.1By1896Waite had become thoroughlydisillusionedwithoccultism in general and recognized theinadequacyof Levi'sideas-e-theteis no way from man to God in hissystem-s-andhispersonallimitations: 'he was atranscendentalistbut not amystic'.But he stillfoundLevito be'themostbrilliant,the most original, the mostfascinatinginterpreter ofoccult philosophy in the West'(MysteriesofMagic,revisededn., p. xiii),Levirepresentedthe summit ofoccultism,but Waitewasseekingfor something more.Nor was there anything to be found inTheosophy-not,at least, aspresentedbyH.P.Blavatsky.·The Theosophical Society had been founded in1875,byMadameBlavatskyand Colonel H.

Twocollectionsof his stories were published:PrinceStarbeam,writtenin 1879 andissued,after.revision, in 1889; andTheGoldenStairs,publishedin1893by theTheosophical Publishing Society,whoclaimedthatthese 'Talesfrom the Wonder-World''willat once fascinate andinstructtheyouthfulmind'.It is to behopedthatmostTheosophicalchildren-whoalready suffered from'LotusCircles'inwhichtheywere systematically exposed to simplifiedTheosophy-weresparedthese stories,whichevensympatheticreviewers saw as'hardlylikely to bemuchappreciated by many juveniles,notnatives ofThibet,for some centuries tocome'(Eastern&UtesternReview).Waite wasmoresuccessfulwithfairy poetry.Whilehe wascontributingregularlyto}DungFolks'PaperhemetWilliamSharp(betterknownas hisCelticalterego,'FionaMacleod'),whohad taken over the'LiteraryOlympic'featurein 1887 andhadcommentedfavourably onASoul'sComedy,especially on itsfairytale'DreamTower' sequence.

Two 'subsidiary objects',whichfollowedfrom this, were'toillustratethe mysteries ofsanctityasexhibitedinChristianMysticism by reference to allconcurrentsources of esotericknowledgein Europe,and to testthatknowledgein thelightofChristianMysticism'.TheDirectorGeneral of theHermeticText Society was to be Waite, the Secretary Generalwas to be Philip Wellby, andDoraStuart-Menteathwas to be Treasurer.Therewas also to be aten-man'AdvisoryCommittee'of experts in various fields ofesoteric lore,butas Waitegotnofurtherthandrawingup a provisional list oflikelycandidates-almostall ofwhomwere his cronies in the ranks of the GoldenDawn-thelist ofprojectedtitles(whichincludedTheHiddenChurchoftheHolyGraalandothersof hisfutureworks)was evidently his, and his alone.TheHermeticText Society never descendedintotheWorldofAction,butothersocietiesdid.Onememberof Waite's proposed 'AdvisoryCommittee'whowasnota memberof theGoldenDawnwas the formereditorof theTheosophicalReview,G. R. S. Mead;2he would haveadvisedon'Neoplatonismand Gnosticism',onwhichsubjects he was anacknowledgedauthority(inTheosophicalcirclesat least; his associationwiththeTheosophicalSociety hadcondemnedhim-quiteunjustly-intheeyesof the academicworld).He was also, in1908,theleaderofthe 'soberer, saner andmoredecentmembers'of theBritishSectionof the Theosophical Societywhichwas.then embroiled in the 'Leadbeater Scandal'.Mead hadjoinedtheTheosophicalSociety in1884,becoming,in1889,theprivate secretary ofMadameBlavatsky andsub-editorofLucifer.Afterher deathhe becameeditorof thejournal,whichherenamedTheTheosophicalReview;edited thethirdvolume ofTheSecretDoctrine;and achieved suchprominencein the societythathe wasappointedGeneral Secretary for Europe. He didnot,however, follow AnnieBesant-MadameBlavatsky'seffective successor in thesociety-inheradmirationfor the seership of C. W. Leadbeater,whichMeadfelt was an'insidiousinfluence'in the society. In1906Leadbeater was accusedofteachingboyswhohad been placed in his care the practice ofmutualmasturbation,butwhenthe parents of these boyscomplainedprivately toAnnieBesant she refused tocondemnher pederastic ally andupbraidedthe parents formakingtheiraccusations.Theythenmadetheircomplaintspublic, Leadbeaterwascondemnedby ajudicialcommitteeof the society and forced to resign, andall seemed to be well.__THEHIDDENCHURCHANDASECRETTRADITION--.1QJBut in1907ColonelOlcott,thepresidentof theTheosophicalSociety, diedandAnnieBesant was elected to succeed him.Shortlyafter this anAmericantheosophist,DrWeller VanHook,openly advocatedthe desirabilityof Leadbeater'ssexual teachings andAnnieBesant invited Leadbeater to renew hismembership.Mead, and somesevenhundredothermembers of the British Section, immediatelyexpressed theiroutrageat Leadbeater'srestorationto grace byresigningenmasse.Notall ofthemsupportedMead in his desire topromotea scholarly approachto the'Comparativestudy of Religion and Philosophy',butthosewhodid helpedhim to found a newjournal,TheQuest,and a new societynamedafterit.Mead'sintentionwas'tofound acleansociety,an associationthatshouldbegenuinelyundogmatic,unpretentious,claimingno pseudo-revelations, andtrulyhonest inside andout,-togathertogethera groupof seekerswhodesiredgreatlyandearnestlyto beinstructedby anywhohadcompetentknowledgeof the many subjectswhichcould enterintothe wideprogrammeofourSpiritualQuest.\"Esotericism\"and''occultism\" were to be eschewed ascorruptingratherthanhelpful'('TheQuest-OldandNew',inTheQuestApril1926,p.297).He was alsoinsistentthatthe society should have aquarterlyJournal,and havingsettled on a name for it,TheQuest,he decided to give the society the same name.Towards the endof1908Mead drew in anumberof hisnon-Theosophical.friends, Waiteamongthem;a provisionalconstitutionwasdrawnup, and theofficers andcommitteeof the society were elected.

E. Waite waspreparingfor hisfirstcommunion,theprehistoryof theGoldenDawnwasbeingactedout.TwoEnglish Freemasons,R.W.Littleand W.J.Hughan,were advancedthrougha series of Grades in theRosicrucianSociety in Scotia (they had beenadmittedto the first, or Zelator Grade on 31 December 1866),so that they would be qualifiedto form a similar society inEngland.On1 June1867, atAldermanburyin theCityofLondon,theSocietasRosicrueianainAngliahelditsfirstmeeting,althoughit waslookedupon as areconstitutionrather than an inauguration, for the membersmaintainedthatthey were revivingadormantsociety that had been activeduringthe 1850s.Thissociety, inturn,wasthoughtto havepreservedtheethos, ifnotthe historicalcontinuity,of theoriginalRosicrucianBrotherhoodofthe earlyseventeenthcentury;thatsuch aBrotherhoodmay never have existed•didnottroublethemembers of theS.R.I.A.:whatmatteredwasthat they should preserveits principles.Thethreepamphlets(knownas theRosicrucianManifestos) onwhichtheRosicrucianmythwas founded, werepublishedinGermanybetween1614 and1616.They were theFamaFraternitatis,ConfessioFraternitatis,andChymischeHocnzeit(TheChemicalWedding);anthoughtto have been theworkof aprominentLutheranscholar,JohannValentinAndreae, and were possiblyissuedwitha politicalintent.Whetherornotthis was so, theycaughtthepopularimaginationandstimulated theologians, occultists, and satirists to write innumerable attacks upon,and defences of, theputativeRosicrucians.As for themythitself,itconcernedthe life andworkof oneChristianRosencreutz,a mystic and adept of thefifteenthcenturywhofounded,it wasclaimed;a secretFraternitywiththe aimofpropagatingthe esotericwisdomhe had acquiredduringhis travels in theHolyLand,Egypt,andNorthAJrica.Inadditiontotheir esoteric studies, themembersof hisFraternitysoughtforspiritualdevelopmentand'practisedactsofbenevolencev-especiallythe healingof the sick.AfterthedeathofChristianRosencreutz,in 1484, his body wasembalmedand sealedwithinaseven-sided vault, thelocationofwhichremained"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"106A. E.WAITE-MAGICIANOFMANYPARTS--,-_secret for 120 yearsuntil1604,whenit was discovered by chance,opened,andfound to contain not only the perfectly preservedbody,butalso secret manuscripts,an ever-burning lamp, andothermarvels.The vault was resealedand the Fraternity,revitalizedby thediscovery,continuedtoflourish-albeitinsecret-downthroughthe centuries.At various timesduringthe seventeenth andeighteenthcenturies' self-styledRosicrucianbodies arose, briefly flowered, and invariably faded away, leavingnothingbehindthemsavegreateror lesseradditionsto theaccumulatedstoreofesotericwisdom.TheS.R.I.A.,·however,wassignificantlydifferent from itspredecessors: firstly, it arose in acountrywhereit wouldnot be persecuted byeitherChurchor State; secondly, it displayed remarkable stayingpower(it is stillactive today); and thirdly, itconfineditsmembershipto freemasonswhowerealso professedChristians. By 1880it was well establishedas athoroughlyrespectablebodywhosemembersengagedinnothingmorenefarious than theintellectualpursuitof the occult sciences; and inthatyear the Society gained a newmemberwhoseinventive genius in the field ofoccultismwas second to none:DrWilliamWynnWestcott.1Westcottwas, asbefitteda Rosicrucian,a medicalpractitioneras well asbeingan active freemason and anenthusiasticbeliever inthereality of theRosicrucianmyth.He was also a kabbalist, a keentheosophist,and asupporter'fromits inception, in 1884, of Anna Kingsford and EdwardMaitland's'HermeticSociety',whichlaid great emphasis on theWesternas opposed to the Easterntraditionofoccultism.All these activities ledhimto recognize thecontributionthatladiescould-anddid-maketo theadvancementof occultknowledge,andhe developed thenotionofcreatinga secret society of men andwomen'forthepurposeof thestudyofOccultScience, and thefurtherinvestigationof theMysteries of Life andDeath,andourEnvironment'. Therewas also, soWestcottargued, everyjustificationfornotincludinga masonicqualificationand forincludingmembers ofbothsexes:'ontheContinentmany groups of Rosicrucianinitiatesandadepts hadadmittedmenwhowere not Freemasons, and even learnedwomen,totheirgrades and assemblies.Thismay have been adeparturefromtheoriginalrules of the Society, as first designed byC.R.ourFounder;it isa pointleft undecided by the earlyRosicrucianpublishedliterature,butthere areextantdocumentsto showthatwomenwereadmittedin the 17th and 18thcenturies'(TheRosicrucianSocietyofEngland,1915, p. 3).ButWestcottwasunwillingthatthe onus ofcreationshould be placed on his shoulders alone; anadditional,more esotericcreatorwas also needed.Being acompetentoccultist,Westcottaccordinglycreated the creator. Atsometimeduring1887Westcotthadobtained,fromwhatsource he never madeclear, a seriesof manuscripts in cipher, which proved,upondecoding, to be outlinesof the~nitiatoryrituals of an occult order. Alsoamongthemanuscriptswas the_'GOLDENDEMONSTHATNONECANSTAY'107name of aGermanadept-FrauleinAnna Sprengel, or Soror SapiensDominabiturAstris-togetherwithher address atStuttgart.Westcottpromptlywroteto herand, inNovember1887, received an effusive replyappointinghim to the Gradeof AdeptusExemptusandauthorizinghim to found' a new English Society oftheGoldenDawn.He wasfurtherempoweredto 'choosetwolearned personsinorderto make up the first three Masters', and these he duly selected fromwithinthe ranks of theS.R.I.A.He was by now Secretary-GeneraloftheSociety, and chose as his companionstwoequallyprominentmembers:DrW.R.Woodman(1828-91), the SupremeMagus(i.e. Head) of the Society and a learned kabbalist, and S.L.M. Mathers,2a memberoftheSociety'sHighCouncilwhohad alreadyexpandedthe ritualsonWestcott'sbehalfand convertedthem.intoworkableform.On1 March 1888the three Chiefs issued themselveswitha charterto found'Isis-UraniaTempleNo.3',and gave themselves rolesthatmirroredtheirpositionsin theS.RJ.A.:WoodmanwasImperator;Westcottwas Cancellarius (Secretary); andMathersPraemonstrator(effectivelyDirectorofCeremonies-intheS.RJ.A.he was atthattimeConductorofNovices).NowthattheOrderhad been founded,AnnaSprengel had become a liability andWestcottdisposed ofher-althoughnot beforeshe had'sent'him a variety of occultmanuscriptsand fivefurtherletters. InAugust1890 a finalletterarrived, from anunknownBrotherof theOrder,announcingthe sudden death of'ourlearned friend S.D.A.'. Carefulexaminationof the letters hasindicatedthevirtual certaintyof their having been forged onWestcott'sbehalf;3and it is almost as certainthathe forged theoriginalciphermanuscripts(certainly they were of very recent origin);buthowever reprehensiblehis actions may have been, they werenotcarriedoutfor personal gain.TheHermeticOrderof theGoldenDawnwas created in order tofurtherthe systematicstudyofthe occult sciences and wasimmediatelywelcomedbythe occultestablishmentof its day(althoughMadame Blavatsky had reservationsuntilshe was reassuredthatmembershipof theOrderwouldnotdeplete theranks of theTheosophicalSociety). It offered its members a sequence ofinitiatoryrituals of a very eclecticnaturethatcombinedEgyptian,kabbalistic, andRosicruciansymbolism,togetherwithprescribed courses ofstudyappropriateto each step in the five Grades oftheOuterorder-theGradesbeingthose ofNeophyte,Zelator,Theoricus,Practicus, and Philosophus. Each Grade above thatofNeophytewas relatedtooneof the tenSephirothof the kabbalistic Tree of Life,and thesecontinuedbeyond theOuterOrderinto a yet more secret Second Order,whoserituals weredistinctlymagical.TheSecondOrder,theRosaeRubeaeetAureaeCrucis,had existed from thebeginningbuthadworkedno rituals, andmemberswhoadvanced to becomeadepti of the SecondOrderdid so by means of passingexaminations.In 1892thischanged,forMathershad developed hisownhighlyimpressiveinitiatory"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"109____'GOLDENDEMONSTHATNONECANSTAY'__--=-~108rituals,baseduponthemythofChristianRosencreutz, for the5=6(each Gradewasnumbered)GradeofAdeptusMinor.AndwhereastheOuterOrderrepresentedtheoreticaloccultism,theSecondOrderexisted fortheworkingofspecificallymagicalrituals,althoughnotofthedebasedkind.associatedwithmedievalgrimoires.Bythetime.thataworkingSecondOrderhadbeendeveloped,theGoldenDawnhadsome150membersinthreetemples:Isis-UraniainLondon,OsirisinWeston-super-Mare, andHorusin Bradford.

Inotherwords, tocontinuetheirmagicalprogresswithBrodie-Innesastheirabsolute Chief.He didnottake thispositionopenly, however, and in his next letter, of 5August,he told Waite:'Irepresent nopartyor section.

There is no opinion that I could hold in such highestimation as youhaveeverymeans of knowing andhavedone suchadmirablework yourselfin the same direction' (letter of 25 May1901).Itisan extremelythorough study of Saint-Martin and Waitesucceededinthe difficult task ofpresenting Saint-Martin'sideasclearly andsystematically;butPapuscould nothaveread the bookcarefully,or he wouldhavetaken undoubted exception toWaite's statement that Martinism is 'a body ofmysticdoctrine, and not aMasonicRitedevisedby Saint-Martin toreplacethe Elect Cohens[i.e,Pasqually'sRite]'and to hisadviceto hisreaders'tobear in mind that upon historicalquestions'the criterion ofevidenceis notinvariablyso rigorous in Franceasit is in England(pp. 73, 459).Papuswas, infact,soimpressedthat heawardedWaitethedegreeof'DocteurenHermetisme'from his 'Ecole superieurelibre desSciencesHermetiques',Thedegreewasacademicallyworthless but Waiteeventuallyput it to good use whenit provided him with a pseudonym for his anthology of the writings of AndrewJacksonDavis.Once he had entered FreemasonryWaite broke withPapuswhenhelearnedof the bad odour in whichPapuswas heldby orthodoxmasonicbodies;but the man whoadvisedhim to make the break, Edouard Blitz, the head ofthe Martinist Order in America, would in turn provide him with somethingfar moresignificantthan Martinism.In1901Waitewasfirmlyestablishedwithin the GoldenDawn, but herealizedthat it waseffectivelya moribund body and both he andMarcusWorsleyBlackdenbegan to look for some meansto.reviveit-orat least to provide a substitute.Waite's own account of his entry intoFreemasonrymakes thisclear:A day camewhenBlackden and I began tothinkseriously of Freemasonry and towonderwhethera deeper insight into the meaning and symbolism ofRitualwould be gained byjoiningthe mostpredominantandworld-widecombinationof Rites...There is no question thatanimportantside of the tentativeconsiderationwaswhether,were such a course adopted,theOrderoftheGoldenDawnmightprofit thereby(SLY,p. 161).This wasnotexactlythe wholetruth,for Waitealreadyknew enough ofmasonicceremonial and its symbolism tosatisfythe needs of any reconstituted ritualswithin the GoldenDawn, and hisfurtherstatement'thatIdid notfailto anticipatean extreme probability of~eetingin the High Gradecircles,ifnotin Craft and"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"129------'BROTHERHOODISRELIGION'_==...:;..128Arch,withat least a fewothersofourowndedications,towhomsymbolismspoke alanguageandRitualopeneda realmofgrace'(SLT,p. 161) gives awrongemphasis, forthosefewfreemasonswhowere'ofour'owndedications'wereto befoundalreadywithinthe confines oftheGoldenDawn.ThemostprobablereasonforWaite'sseekingadmissiontoFreemasonryatthistimewas hisgrowingawarenessthatonlyby passingthroughtheCraftdegrees and theHolyRoyalArchwouldhe be able toenterthoseHigherDegreeswhoserites he so eagerly desired.

Waite was furious and promptlyresigned-takingwithhim years ofbitternessat whathe saw as shabbytreatmentby thesociety.Hetookhis revenge bysprinklingacidcomments-onboth Westcott and theSociety as awhole-throughouthis masterly study of Rosicrucianism,The______'BROTHERHOODISRELIGION'131Brotherhoodof the Rosy Cross(1924).He remained active in most of the additional degrees whose ranks he hadjoined, acting as secretaryfor both his Rose-Croix Chapter and Knights TemplarPreceptory for periods oftwentyandthirtyyearsrespectively.But his principalconcernin masonry now becamethedisseminationof hisideasthrough his writing.His first major'contributionto masonic literature' wasTheSecretTraditioninFreemasonry(1911),whichreceivedwide praise from the masonic and non-masonic pressalike.The masonicwriterW.J.Wilmshurst(who was a memberof the Independent and Rectified Rite) claimed that the book'unquestionablyexceedsin importance any that has yet appeared in regard towhatmay be calledthe problem of Freemasonry'(TheFreemason,25May1912);butJohnYarkercriticized thebook-albeitin the columns of theCo-Mason,theorgan of anunrecognized, androgynousbody-becauseWaite 'does not seek to hide hiscontempt,often expressedin uncourteous language, against allwhodiffer fromhim':which 'all' includedYarker(issue of January1912).By the time that the Fellowship of the Rosy Cross came into being, Waite'sactivities in the'HigherDegrees' had led him to see'morethan ever theunexpressed things that lie behind the Rites ' and he felt that another masonicwork was called for. He decided upon anencyclopaedia,foralthoughthere wereseveralalready in existence,'itseemed to me that here was the most convenientform in which to introduce amultitudeof personal views andstandpoints'(SLY,pp.203-4).In May1917he suggested the book to Ralph Shirley of Rider&Co., who took it up, andwithineighteenmonthshe had completed almost thewhole of the work. There washowever,muchargumentover illustrations andover money (he neverreceivedsatisfactoryroyaltiesand disputes over paymentof these dragged on for many years), whichdelayedthe book for anotheryear.Finally,in March1921,A NewEncyclopaediaofFreemasonrywas published. Waite'sdelight at its appearance was tempered by his expectation that'Thevestedauthorities and the diehards of dead Masonrymightrise up of course to curseme'(SLY,p.208).And so they did.Thereviewersin the scholarly masonic periodicals attacked itwitha will.WritinginArsQuatuorCoronatorum(Vol.33,1920),W. J. Songhurstcondemned'the arbitrary and bizarre arrangement of the subject matter:'tofind any particularsubject one has to resort to a system of guess-work, the Index affordingscarcelyany help'; and he listedwithglee Waite's errors of fact,examplesof his ignorance,and his abusive and unjust comments on earlier writers. It is a damningreview,but,alas,wholly justified, for the book isbothbadly constructed and unreliable.Nonetheless, it was wellreceivedby the non-masonic press and sold extremelywell, if not to the extent that Waitehimselfclaimedin1938:'Nolessthan nineteenthousand sets of the costly volumes have been sold'1(SLY,p.208).But for allthat it hasremainedWaite'sbest-known work, itservedhim ill: aprojected'revised"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"132A.E.WAITE-MAGICIANOFMANYPARTS----edition'never appeared and his total reward in royaltiesamountedtolittleover£300.·Hisbusinesscareer hadnotsucceeded inteachinghimhowto draw upcontractswithpublishers as wily asRalphShirley.Waite'sideas onFreemasonrywere neverwidelyaccepted inEngland,butinAmerica-largelyas aresultof fulsome praise inDrJoseph.

Threeotherideaswouldalso be involved by theMinistry.of aMysticservice-s-a possibility ofcommunicationwiththe.Divine;andtheway and the means thereof,withthetwowhoseek tocommunicate,namely,PneumaandPsyche-theSpirit andtheBride.

It will bewhollyaspirationaland devotional, and will embody the .aspirational MysticismoftheOldandNewTestaments of all religion. There will be a hymnalportion,selected fromthemetricalliteratureof Mysticism.Theinstructionalsection will be derived mainly from the lives..and teachings of the Mystics.

After the consecration, thepriest will partake of the elements, andthenall present, to signify thecommunicationwithDeity,whichis the end of the Mystic process.Theorder of procedure will beas follows:Theelements will be received by the deacon from the hands of the priesthimself, for he stands as theSpiritin Man.Thelady sub-deacon will receive them fromthe hands of the Pneuma,whois the propermediatorto the Soul, and she inturnwillcommunicatethem. to the body of the worshippers, as she is the properministranttothe Body. After an interval ofinteriorrecollection, the service will concludewithanact ofthanksgiving;asolemn charge, abenediction,and afinaljubilatoryhymn.Whenpromptedby genuine enthusiasm,propositionslike these are pleasing,butof little practical value.Thechurch. of the future can become actual only by evolving,and the modes of itsministrymust be left to evolvewithit.Theessential quality oflifeescapes.in the ready-made ritual. We are not afraid of the development ofanotherpriestcraft, we believe in the magnificence oftheexterior sign, and in thegrandeurofoutwardworship;but,withfull sympathy for the spiritwhichgovernsthem,we mustdeprecate these designs,whichhave only the elements of failure.
