[PAGE 3]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC  CHAPTER I"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC It is a matter of common knowledge among mystics that the evolutionary career of mankind is indissolubly bound up with the divine hierarchies who rule the planets and the signs of the Zodiac, and that passage of the Sun and the planets through the twelve signs of the Zodiac, marks man's progress in time and in space. Therefore it is not to be wondered at, that in the course of their investigations into the spiritual development of mankind, the writers have also encountered much that deals with the Zodiac which is the boundary of our evolutionary sphere at the present time. So much has been perceived in THE MEMORY OF NATURE that sheds light upon obscure pas- sages of the Bible, that notes have been made from time to time of different points, but how to collect and collage these dissociated writings into a united whole, has been a great problem for a long time. Even now, the writ- ers know and feel that what they are bringing forth is only a very, very weak attempt to set before the students that great body of facts which have come to them through the memory of nature. They feel, however, that this will give a new and more profound meaning to the old symbols, and that by [PAGE 4]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS passing on what has been found they put themselves in line to receive more light. Concerning the future evolution of planets; the Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception teaches, on page 256, that \"when the beings upon the planet have evolved to a sufficient degree, the planet becomes a Sun, the fixed center of the Solar System. When the beings there have evolved to a still greater degree, and consequently it has reached its maximum of brilliancy, it breaks up into a Zodiac and becomes, so to speak, the womb of a new Solar System. Thus the Great hosts of Divine beings who, until then, were con- fined upon that Sun gain freedom of actions upon a great number of stars whence they can affect, in different ways, the system which grows up within their sphere of influence. The planets or many-bearing worlds within the Zodiac are constantly being worked upon by these forces but in various ways according to the stage they have reached in evolution. Our Sun could not have become a sun until it set out from itself all the beings who were not sufficiently evolved to endure the high rate of vibration and the great lu- minosity of the beings who were qualified for that evolution. All the be- ings upon the different planets would have been consumed had they remained in the Sun. This visible Sun, however, though it is a place of evolution for beings vastly above man, is not by any means, the Father of other plan- ets, as material science supposes. On the contrary, it is itself an emana- [PAGE 5]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"tion fron THE CENTRAL SUN, which is the invisible source of all that IS in our solar system.\" \"Our visible Sun is but the mirror in which are reflected the Rays of en- ergy from the Spiritual Sun, the real Sun is as invisible as the REAL man.\" From this teaching it is apparent that the great spiritual hierarchies which are now guiding our evolution, have had their training for this path in previous schemes of manifestation, also that what THEY are now doing, WE shall some day do FOR OTHERS. Already the foremost among our race are treading the path of initiation, and have thereby advanced into stages, far beyond the general status of our present humanity. It has been learned that those who have gone through the Mercurial School of the lesser Mysteries, and have graduated from the School of the Greater Mysteries are now prepar- ing human evolution for the Jupiter Period. They have entered the planet Jupiter, by way of one of the Moons, which serves as a stepping stone. Oth- ers there are, unfortunately, who have gone the other way. We read in the Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception, that even as the whole population of the earth was at one time expelled from the present Sun because of their inability to keep up with the vibrations of the beings thereon, thus hindering them and being hindered themselves, so also it becomes necessary in the Lemurian Ep- och, to expel a number of the stragglers from earth. Thus the Moon was cast out into space to revolve as a Satellite around our present planet. Those [PAGE 6]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS unfortunates are gradually degenerating and the time will come when they will all go to the planet Saturn, which is the door to Chaos. Thence they will be expelled to inter-planetary space to await the time when, in a new system, there will be a favorable condition for their further evolution.  THE GATE OF LIFE AND DEATH Thus the Zodiac and the planets are as a book in which we may read the history of Humanity during past ages, and they also give a key to the future which is in store for us. In the famous Zodiac in the Temple of Denderah, Cancer is not pictured as we have it in modern days. There it is a beetle, a scarab. This was the emblem of the soul, and Cancer has always been known in ancient times, as well as among modern mystics, to be the sphere of the soul, THE GATE OF LIFE in the Zodiac whence the spirits coming into rebirth, enter our sub-lunary conditions. It is therefore aptly ruled by the Moon which is the planet of fecundation, and it is noteworthy that we find Capri- corn, which is its opposite, ruled by Saturn the PLANET OF DEATH AND CHAOS, who is mystically depicted as \"the reaper with his scythe and hour glass in hand.\" These two opposite signs are therefore turning points in the soul's career. Cancer and Capricorn respectively mark the highest ascent of the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Sun into the Northern Hemisphere, and its lowest descent into the South. We observe that during the summer when the Sun is in the sphere of Cancer and [PAGE 7]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC allied signs, fecundation and growth are the order of the day. But when the Sun is in the South, in Capricorn, we have winter, when nature is dead. The fruits of the summer are then consumed and assimilated by us. As a circle dance of the Sun among the twelve signs determines the seasons of the year WHEN DIRECT, causing the germination of myriads of seeds cast in the earth, also the mating of the fauna, which then makes the world alive with the sights and sounds of manifested life, and at another time leaves the world dumb, dull and drear in winter's gloom, under the sway of Saturn, so by the slower backward movement, known as the PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOX, does it produce the great changes which we know as Evolution. In fact, this preces- sional measure of the sun marks the birth and death of races, nations and their religions, for the pictorial Zodiac is a symbolical presentation of our past, present and future development.  CAPRICORN Capricorn, the goat, is not a goat at all as we know that animal, but part fish and part goat. Its Saturnine rulership, and the fact that it re- ceives the Sun at the dawn of each New Year, naturally by analogy associates it with the beginning of precessional epochs. It represents the stage in evolution covering transition from fish, through amphibia to the mammalian form. The belligerency of the goat is well known, and an apt symbol of the [PAGE 8]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS struggle for existence, in which the weak perish unless able to outdistance their foes. This phase of the matter is sometimes expressed in the symbol, when drawn as part fish and part antelope. Jacob, in the forty-ninth chap- ter of Genesis, pronounces blessings upon his children, which symbolize the twelve signs. There he speaks of Naphtali as a \"HIND\" let loose; thus a very apt symbol of Capricorn, for when the Sun is there at each winter sol- stice, it is starting a race through the circle of twelve signs, which it must complete in a given time--a year.  SAGITTARIUS When the Sun leaves Capricorn, by precession, it enters the sign Sagit- tarius, and this is pictured in the symbolical Zodiac as a Centaur, part horse and part man. Thus it shows aptly, the fact that we have evolved through the animal stage into the human. The centaur is in the act of draw- ing his bow, showing that there is something for which the human spirit, on"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"its pilgrimage through matter, is seeking, that it aspires to something that lies beyond it, as a lofty ideal, for the bow points upward to the stars.  SCORPIO The next step in human unfoldment is not so much along the physical lines as along the mental. Its nature is shown by the Sun's passage through the sign Scorpio, which is pictorially represented as a SERPENT or SCORPION, [PAGE 9]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC emblems of cunning and subtility. It is plain from this symbol that the faculty of the mind evolved by infant humanity was CUNNING, and we still see that that is a characteristic trait among the lower races, the lower classes and the lower natures even among our present-day humanity.  LIBRA But, when the Sun enters the sign Libra, 'THE SCALES,' by precession, the balance of reason gives him a new start upon the evolutionary path. Un- der the care of divine instructors man had at that time advanced to the point where because of this new faculty, reason, he could be made fully re- sponsible to nature's laws, and thus reap what he had sown, that he might learn the lesson of life by actual experience, be able to reason out the connection between cause and effect and in time learn to govern himself so as to progress further upon the path.  VIRGO Thus, under the guidance of the spiritual hierarchies, focused through the signs of CAPRICORN, SAGITTARIUS, SCORPIO, and LIBRA, were his physical, moral and mental attributes acquired, and he was equipped and mental at- tributes acquired, and he was equipped to commence the spiritual side of his evolution. The germ of this progress is hidden in the celestial virgin, the sign VIRGO, which is the vehicle of the immaculate conception, the heavenly mother of Christ; not of one Christ only, but of many. This is one of the most sublime signs of the Zodiac and one of the most mystical, so fraught [PAGE 10]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS with hidden meaning that its full import cannot be fully understood save when viewed by the internal light of spiritual illumination. Yearly, at the winter solstice, the immaculate Madonna is ascendant at midnight, when the new born Sun commences to rise to the task of growing the grain and grape, to save humanity from the cold and famine, which would inevitably result were he to remain in the southern declination. The Sun is therefore an apt symbol of the Savior, born to feed his flock on the spiritual bread of life."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"But, as we must have eyes attuned to light to see the sun, so must the Christ be born within before we can perceive spiritual light. As Angelus Silesius says: \"Though Christ a thousand times in Bethlehem be born And not within thyself, thy soul will be forlorn. The Cross of Golgotha thou lookest to in vain Unless within thyself it be set up again.\" Therefore, by the precessional passage of the Sun through the sign Virgo, the germinal impulse was given towards the birth of Christ within man. The MYSTIC MARRIAGE of the lower self to the higher, the IMMACULATE CONCEPTION, and the DIVINE MOTHERHOOD, which nourishes deep in its bosom, unseen by a scoffing world, \"THE NEW BORN CHRIST,\" are actual experiences of a growing number of people. And without the celestial prototype, fructified by the solar precession, this would be an impossibility; neither has this ideal [PAGE 11]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC been realized in such fullness during the past ages as today. The reason of this will appear when we take up the joint consideration of opposite signs of the Zodiac.  LEO A great future is in store for this offspring of the celestial virgin. Listen to the wonderful prophecy of Isaiah: \"For unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called WONDERFUL, COUNSELOR, the MIGHTY GOD, the EVERLAST- ING FATHER, the PRICE OF PEACE. Of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end.\" Humanity is to rise to a wonderful spiritual height and this is symbol- ized by the Sun's precessional passage through the royal sign Leo, pictori- ally represented by the king of beasts, the lion. this is an apt allusion to the King of Creation, who will then embody the three great virtues of the Master Man, Strength, Wisdom and Beauty. It is wonderful to trace the various phases of the religions given to the Great Aryo-Semitic Race from the time they were \"called out\" in the latter third of the Atlantean Epoch, to the end of the Aquarian Age, when a new race will have been definitely born. This aspect of the Zodiac will form the subject of the following pages. It will shed light on many of the most obscure passages of the Bible, as only study of this Cosmic Science can. [PAGE 12]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" When we consider the Zodiac in its religious as well as its evolutionary aspects, by means of the six pair of opposite signs into which the twelve may be divided, we also commence with Cancer and Capricorn, for the reason given in the previous article, namely: that these are the solstitial points where the Sun reaches its highest and lowest declination. Considered in this manner, we find that there are two sets of three pairs of signs, the first being Cancer and Capricorn, Gemini and Sagittarius, Tau- rus and Scorpio. In these pairs of signs we may read the history of human evolution and religion, in the early, the middle and the latter third of the Atlantean Epoch. This is also divisible into three distinct periods, namely: THE ARYAN AGE, from Moses to Christ, which comes under Aries-Libra; the PISCEAN AGE, which takes in the last two thousand years under Pisces-Virgo Catholicism; and the two thousand years which are ahead of us, called the AQUARIAN AGE, where the signs Aquarius and Leo will be illumi- nated and vivified by the solar precession, for the upliftment of the Son of Man (Aquarius), by the Christ within, the Lion of Judah (Leo), to the estate of Superman. It must not be thought, however, that the Atlantean Epoch only lasted while the Sun by precession went through Cancer, Gemini, and Taurus, a [PAGE 13]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC period of only six thousand and a few hundred years; far from it; but there are spirals within spirals and recapitulation takes place in the epochs and races, so that we may know what is the general destiny by looking at the Sun's passage through these signs and therewith taking this import and sym- bolism into consideration. It may also be said that the further we advance the smaller do the spirals become, the shorter the time in which a given im- provement is made, because of the proficiency we attained in former ages, and therefore it is extremely probable that this present is the last lap, that the coming Aquarian Age is the final preparatory school day which will fit us for the new age, the Sixth Epoch, and that this will begin when the Sun by precession enters Capricorn. This, of course, would mean that the Second Advent must take place just before that time, and though it seems to us that so many signs point that way, still it is a mere surmise and may not have any truth in it at all. Thousands of people have been misled during all the ages that we know of, to think that Christ would soon be here; it is, however, better that we are looking forward to it than if we should say with some, that it will never take place. In that case the Great Day would find us unprepared and we should find ourselves among the stragglers who are unfit to attend the wed- ding feast of the Higher Self to the lower because lacking the \"soul-body,\" the \"wedding garment,\" necessary to enfold them."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"[PAGE 14]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CANCER-CAPRICORN The Sun's passage by precession through the sphere of Cancer with its op- posite sign Capricorn, designates the early third of the Atlantean period, which was intensely watery as the whole earth was covered by a dense, drenching fog. The Niebelung, or \"Children of the Mist,\" lived then in the basins of the Earth. Cancer was not then represented by the same symbol as today; in ancient times it was pictorially figured as a beetle or scarab. This was the signature of the soul, for then mankind was much less body than soul. The sign Cancer is watery in its nature, and the fish part of Capricorn, the opposite sign, also helps to symbolize this state of life under water when the Sun went through the watery sign Cancer by precession. The Moon, the planet of fecundation, points mystically to this period of germination, when mankind first commenced to exercise the Creative function at the dic- tates of desire inculcated by the Lucifer Spirits. Thus mankind opened the Gate of physical Life through Cancer, and strayed into the terrestrial sphere, but opposite stood Saturn, the ruler of Capricorn, ready to slay them with his scythe, and usher them through the Gate of Death back into the spiritual realms where they are at home. Capricorn was the opposite of Cancer and embodied the ideal that as the goat climbs the mountains, so man must leave the basins of Atlantis and come up from the mist. [PAGE 15]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC  GEMINI-SAGITTARIUS Our condition during the middle third of the Atlantean Epoch is illus- trated in the Sun's passage through the sign Gemini, the twins, which aptly represent infant humanity. During this age the division of soul from soul by the veil of flesh, which we call the body, became more noticeable, for the atmosphere had already cleared to a considerable extend, and the facul- ties of the spirit had become more focused in its physical instrument. With this delusion of the personal self, there came at once the idea of \"me\" and \"thee,\" \"mine\" and \"thine,\" our individual interests commenced to clash with those of others, so that a tragedy such as that recorded between Cain and Abel became possible. Nor was the shedding of blood confined to human be- ings, for we learn from the Bible that \"Nimrod was a might hunter\". This savage ideal was expressed in the Celestial Centaur, Sagittarius, with his bow and arrow."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" But both of these pairs of opposites, Cancer-Capricorn and Gemini-Sagittarius, may be considered pre-historic hieroglyphics of a devel- opment accomplished in Sidereal years, long past, though none the less im- portant on that account. Our own times, with the development prescribed for them, are symbolically represented in the two pairs of signs within the fixed cross, the Bull, the Lion, the Serpent and the Man. For that reason the two pairs of opposites comprising the fixed signs, Taurus-Scorpio and Leo-Aquarius, are mentioned in the Bible, and we shall [PAGE 16]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS find that our modern systems of religion are full of allusions to the three pairs of opposites. Aquarius-Leo and the two adjacent pairs of signs, Aries-Libra and Pisces-Virgo. These three pairs of opposites are, as al- ready stated, emblematic of the development in the entire Aryan Epoch. In the EARLY third of this Epoch, the Sun by precession went through the sign Aries, the MIDDLE third of its find the Sun in Pisces, by precession, and during the last third the Sun will go through the sign Aquarius. Then the solstitial point Capricorn will see the inauguration of a new cycle or age. The spiritual preparation for this development commenced about thirteen thousand B.C., when the Sun by precession, was in the sign Libra, the Bal- ance, the last time. Different phases of this germinal impregnation of people then living were carried on during the precessional travel of the Sun through Virgo, Leo, and culminated in Cancer about eight thousand B.C. when the last of Atlantis was destroyed by water, substantially as related by the Egyptian priests to Plato. We shall see presently how the germinal ideals, given to humanity in those far. by-gone days have grown and flowered into factors of human development and spiritual standards of the greatest impor- tance.  TAURUS-SCORPIO In the latter third of Atlantis, egoism had developed to a far greater [PAGE 17]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC degree than before, the spiritual sight had been lost by the large majority of the people who then lived entirely on the material plane and gloried par- ticularly in their material possessions. THE BULL was very properly worshiped by them, being an emblem of strength necessary to conquer the material world. It was, on account of its prodi- gious strength, an invaluable aid in all their work. The proverb about \"the flesh pots of Egypt\" has remained illustrative to the present day, to show"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"how abundantly that animal supplied their physical need of food, the milk of the female being also an important article of diet. The possession of many cattle was therefore ardently desired by the ancient infant nations, and the worship of the Bull was inaugurated under the solar precession through Tau- rus during earlier Great Sidereal Years, and continued to the comparatively modern times, when the Sun by precession went through the sign of Celestial Bull for the last time. At that point when the Sun entered the sign of the Lamb, Aries, the Aryan religions were inaugurated. The religion of the Lamb is to hold sway for the next Great Sidereal Year, while the Sun by precession passes around the twelve signs of the Zodiac, as the religion of the Bull has held sway during the previous celestial year from the time the Sun entered Taurus, until it left the same sign on its next passage. New religions, however, are not revealed in their fullness at the [PAGE 18]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS beginning; they are started and go through a period of gestation long before the religion which they are to succeed ends its material existence, and similarly, and ancient religion about to be abrogated survives along after the religion which succeeds it has become the official source of upliftment for humanity. The original Semites, chosen to inaugurate the worship of the Lamb, Aries, during the Aryan Epoch, were taken from \"Egypt,\" the home of the Bull \"Taurus.\" Not our modern Egypt however. The story of Pharaoh, who endeavored to prevent their emigration and was drowned, has reference to Atlantis which was submerged thousands of years before Moses is supposed to have made his escape with the Israelites through the \"Red Sea.\" The facts underlying the story are that a multitude of people left the land where the bull \"Taurus\" was worshiped, (Atlantis or Egypt) whose inhabitants were then drowned, to seek a :promised land\" beyond the water which had engulfed an \"UNGODLY NATION.\" There they were dedicated to the worship of the \"Lamb\" Aries which had been slain in \"Egypt\" (Atlantis); through its blood these pioneers had been preserved from death, and it was thus \"the Lamb slain from the foundation of the (present) World\" which we call THE ARYAN EPOCH. Noah's escape presents another phase of the same occurrence relating that the mists which had enveloped Atlantis condensed to rain, and flooded the basis of the earth, leaving a clear atmosphere in which the Rainbow was seen [PAGE 19]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC for the first time at the opening of the New Age, the Aryan Epoch, where a new Covenant was made with the pioneers of the polity then ushered in. Atlantis was the home of the Bull, Taurus, and when the Sun, by preces-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"sion, was leaving that sign the last time, the Religion of the Lamb Aries was definitely ushered in. Thenceforth, the worship of the Bull was abro- gated and when any of the pioneer race, brought out from the ancient Atlantean dispensation by the blood of the Lamb, Aries, backslid and wor- shiped the Taurean \"Calf,\" they acted contrary to the law of progress and were therefore \"Idolaters,\" and an abomination to the divine hierarchs whose task it was to guide them during the ages preceding the advent of Christ. On account of repeated transgressions many were \"lost,\" and they are the Jews of today who still retain their Atlantean traits (see Cosmo-Concep- tion). Apart from the Astrological key, the Bible is truly a closed book, but with this key, the matter is different. In the Old Testament reference is made of two classes of animals: Bulls, which were Taurean, Sheep and Goats, which were Arian. These alone were used as Sacrifices. (Turtle doves were permitted as a concession to poverty). All the principal characters of the Old Dispensation were shepherds (ARIAN) and Christ also announces Himself as the Great Shepherd. In the New Testament we find another animal, the Fish, attaining great [PAGE 20]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS prominence, and the apostles were called to be \"Fishers of Men,\" for then the sun by precession was nearing the cusp of Pisces, the Fishes, and Christ spoke of the time when the Son of Man (Aquarius) shall come. Thus our evolutionary journey is mapped out in the hidden astrological allusions of the Bible. The student now has a line on the march of events, which it is well to keep in mind. Jesus taught the multitudes in parables but explained the mysteries of the Kingdom to His disciples. Paul gave spiritual meat to the strong, but the milk of doctrine to the multitude, for there has always been an esoteric and an esoteric side to every religion. Taking Taurus, the sign of the Bull, to symbolize the worship of that animal as practiced in Egypt, Persia and other countries at that time, then we shall find that the opposite sign, Scorpio, symbolizes the esoteric doctrine if the priesthood, who were the guardians of the ancient Atlantean Mysteries. In this connection we will note first that the sign Scorpio is repre- sented in the pictorial Zodiac by a Scorpion or Serpent, and we wish to im- press particularly on the student's mind that the Scorpion has its STING IN THE TAIL, while the Serpent has the VENOM IN ITS TEETH. This is very sig- nificant, as well shall see presently."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" On looking up the word \"serpent\" in the Bible, we shall find that there are about seven words that have thus been translated; but one of them, which [PAGE 21]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC was borrowed from Egypt, is NAJA. This word is found on the old tablets in the ancient temples of Egypt where Osiris, the Sun God, is hailed when aris- ing from the primordial deep. He was then crowned with glory and has the Uraeus Naja, AN EMBLEM OF COSMIC WISDOM. The Uraeus was a part of a serpent's body, with its head depicted as protruding from a point in the forehead just above the nose, where the human spirit has its seat; and Christ therefore referred to the ancient Serpent-Initiates, when He said: \"Be ye wise as serpents.\" In ancient Egypt the King wore a crown adorned by A DOUBLE SERPENT, URAEUS or NAJA, which seemed to protrude from his forehead when the crown was placed upon his head. This was to symbolize the fact that he held the double office of King and Priest by virtue of his sublime wisdom. In India, also, the guardians of the Mystery Teachings were called Nagas or Serpents. In the Icelandic \"Eddas,\" the Northern Vedas, Siegfried, the truth seeker, slays the serpent, tastes of its blood and them becomes wise. Nor, to elaborate on the statement made above, is it necessary to go outside our own religion for proof that the serpent is the symbol of wisdom, for the Christ Himself said: \"Be ye wise as serpents.\" The serpent is certainly not suf- ficiently sagacious to warrant a literal meaning of this saying; but when we understand that when the creative fire is drawn upwards through the serpen- tine spinal cord it vibrates the pituitary body and the pineal gland, [PAGE 22]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC connecting the Ego with the invisible worlds by opening up a hidden sense, the allusion is perfectly clear. There is, however, a lower phase of spiritual development, symbolized in ancient times by placing the Uraeus or serpent at the naval, to show that the mediumistic faculties in the solar plexus had been developed. Mediumship is a negative phase of spiritual sight or hearing possessed by a person who, under the control of an outside intelligence, prophesies. This undesirable phase of seership was represented in the Zodiac by the symbol of the Scorpion, which has the sting in its tail. In the Serpent, Initiate the Creative Cosmic Fire was drawn upward through the head to serve as a spiritual end; in the Medium the creative energy is expressed for selfish, sensual ends through the procreative organ ruled by Scorpio. The point between the eyebrows, whence the serpent of wisdom protrudes, is THE SEAT OF LIFE, whereas all that opens the womb is subject to THE STING"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"OF DEATH, contained in the Scorpion's tail. If we now turn with this information to our Bible, we shall find that a great many things, previously obscure, will become clear. As said, the Egyptian word for this Uraeus or serpent is Naja and it was borrowed by the Israelites who expressed the negative faculty of mediumship by affixing the feminine ending \"oth,\" giving NAIOTH; while those able to function con- sciously in the spiritual worlds were given the positive, make plural ending [PAGE 23]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC \"im,\" and were called NAIM. If we read the nineteenth chapter of first Samuel with this understanding we shall readily see that the incident there narrated was of a mediumistic nature. David had become afraid of Saul and he went with Samuel to \"Naioth.\" This is supposed by Bible translators to be a place, and maybe a village was so named. But if that was the case, it was because the people who lived in that place were Naoith, or mediums. They were called prophets in the chapter before us, and it is significant that as soon as anyone came within their camp, he commenced to prophesy or speak under control. Even Saul, who came there, anxious to get David away that he might slay him, was seized by the spirits and prophesied, to the amazement of all present. In the New Testament we are told that the Christ went to the city of Nain and there raised THE SON OF A WIDOW. In the Latin Testament, this city was not called Nain, but NAIM. And it is very significant that all three, Naim, Naioth and Endor, where the sorceress that assisted Saul is supposed to have lived, are in the same locality by Mount Tabor. Every Freemason knows that the brethren of that Order are called \"Sons of the Widow.\" And it is stated in the Bible that Hiram Abiff, the Master Builder of Solomon's Temple, was the Son of a Widow, a cunning craftsman. We cannot in the present article repeat the Masonic Legend which tells the [PAGE 24]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS reason why. This we have given the book on \"Freemasonry and Catholicism\" and also in our books on the Rosicrucian Philosophy. But suffice it to say that in the Bible story to which reference has been made, we have one of the Naim, a Widow's Son or initiate of the old Serpent School, for the priests of Egypt were \"PHREE MESSEN,\" children of light. Each had within, the an- cient Serpent Wisdom. But a new religion was being inaugurated, and it was necessary to raise the ancient Initiates to the Mysteries of the Coming Age. THEREFORE THE CHRIST, THE LION OF JUDAH, LORD OF THE NEW KINGDOM, WENT TO THE WIDOW'S SON OF NAIM and raised him up by the strong grip of the Lion's paw. And we may here emphasize that the first Initiate under the new system"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"was Hiram Abiff, the highest Initiate of the old system, who by this new initiation given him by the Christ, became a CHRISTIAN, pledged to bear the ROSE and the CROSS, which were the symbols of the New Mystery Teachings of the Western World and he was then given the symbolical name, Christian Rosenkreuz. Thus from the time when the Sun entered the sign Aries by precession, it became a crime for the chosen people to worship the bull exoterically, or to partake of the esoteric Serpent wisdom. And for a similar reason IT IS IDOLATRY WHEN PEOPLE OF THE WEST TAKE UP THE EASTERN RELIGIONS. HINDUISM, BUDDHISM AND KINDRED TEACHINGS. For in the Aryan Epoch, only the Aryan [PAGE 25]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC Religions, the religions of the Lamb, have the proper effect on the human evolution. All previous systems are detrimental to the Western people; and in time those also who are now in the East, the orientals, will be forced to embrace this religion, or be left far behind in evolution.  THE ARYAN EPOCH  ARIES-LIBRA The Aryan Epoch may be divided into three eras; but they are all served by the religion of the Lamb. The first division covers the time when the Sun, by precession, went through the sign Aries, the Lamb. Jesus was born when the Vernal equinox was in about seven degrees of Aries; so the twenty-three degrees which lie on the other side belong to the Old Testament period, when the chosen people were in captivity and lost in the wilderness of the world; the new religion had not then found its place. Then the Christ came and inaugurated this new teaching definitely. He came not to destroy the old prophecies and the law, but to give us something higher when they shall have been fulfilled. The sign opposite Aries is Leo, the scales or balance of Justice; and therefore we are told in the new religion that there will come a day of judgment, when Christ shall appear to give to every man according to the deeds done in the body.  PISCES-VIRGO Christ was the Great Shepherd, but He called His disciples to be \"fishers [PAGE 26]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS of men,\" for the Sun by precession was then leaving the sign of the Lamb and entering Pisces, the sign of the fishes. Therefore a new phase of the Aryan religions was opening up. The Bishop's mitre is also in the form of a fish's head."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" The New Testament, therefore, does not mention the Bull or the Lamb, but references to the fishes are numerous. We also found the celestial virgin prominent and the wheat ear of Virgo is the Bread of Life, to be gained only through immaculate purity. Thus Christ fed the multitude of fish (Pisces) and loaves (Virgo). Before the time of Christ, the new religion of the Lamb (Aries), could get no foothold. Moses, the erstwhile leader, could not bring the chosen people to the \"promised land.\" That was reserved for Joshua, the son of Nun. Joshua is the Hebriac for \"Jesus\" and the Hebrew word for \"Nun\" means \"fish\" (Pisces). It was thus foretold that the religion of the Lamb would attain prominence during the precessional passage of the Sun through the sign Pisces, the fishes. This prophecy has been fulfilled, for during the two thousand years which have elapsed since the birth of Jesus, the Western religion has been taught by a celibate priesthood, worshiping an immaculate virgin, symbolized by the celestial sign Virgo, which is the opposite of Pisces. This same priesthood has also enjoined the eating of fish and forbidden the use of flesh on [PAGE 27]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC certain days. When the children of Israel left the flesh pots of Egypt, where the Bull was slain, they left it by the blood of the Lamb. But in the Piscean dispensation no shedding of blood is enjoined and flesh eating is condemned as a sin at certain times, for man is now taught to forsake the lusts of the flesh and also lusting after the flesh. This ideal was tried under the Aryan dispensation, when the chosen people were yet in the Wilderness, so called, but without success; they would not have the heavenly manna. Now, however, man is being weaned from the can- nibalistic practice, and in the seven hundred years which remain before the Aquarian age is definitely ushered in, we will, in all probability, have made great strides, both in overcoming the lust of the flesh and the lust after the flesh. For Virgo, the immaculate celestial virgin, and the ears of wheat contained in the sign, show both these ideals as profitable to soul growth at the present time. Jupiter, the planet of benevolence and philan- thropy, which rules Pisces, has been a prominent factor in promoting altru- ism during the past two milleniums.  AQUARIUS-LEO It is often said, and rightly so, that the boy is father of the man. And on the same principle we may say that the Son of Man is the Super-Man; therefore, when the Sun by precession enters the celestial sign Aquarius,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"[PAGE 28]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the water-bearer we shall have a new phase of the religion of the Lamb, exoterically; and the ideal to be striven for is shown in the opposite sign, Leo. The Moon, which is the habitat of the autocratic Race Ruler and Lawgiver, Jehovah, is exalted in Taurus, the sign of the Bull, and all Race religions, even the Mosaic phase of the Aryan religion of the Lamb, demanded a sacrifi- cial victim for every transgression of that law. But the Sun is exalted in Aries, and when the great Sun spirit, Christ, came as High Priest of the Aryan religion, He abrogated sacrifice of OTHERS by offering up HIMSELF AS A PERPETUAL SACRIFICE for sin. By looking to the mother ideal of Virgo during the Piscean Age, and fol- lowing the Christ's example of sacrificial service, the immaculate concep- tion becomes an actual experience to each of us, and Christ, the Son of Man, Aquarius, is born within us. Thus, gradually, the third phase of the Aryan religion will be ushered in and a new ideal will be found in the Lion of Judah, Leo. Courage of conviction, strength of character and kindred vir- tues will then make man truly the King of Creation, worthy of the trust and the confidence of the lower orders of life as well as the love of the Divine Hierarchs above. This, the mystic message of Man's evolution, is marked in flaming charac- ters upon the field of Heave, where he who runs may read. And when we study the revealed purpose of God, we shall in turn learn to conform intelligently [PAGE 29]  EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC to that design, thereby hastening the day of emancipation from our present cramped environment to the perfect liberty of free Spirits, risen superior to the law of Sin and Death, through Christ, the Lord of Love and Life. It is for us to decipher this message, and solve the Riddle of the Uni- verse. [PAGE 30]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CHAPTER II THE MEASURE OF AMENABILITY TO PLANETARY  VIBRATIONS When judging a horoscope it is of prime importance that we take into con- sideration the social and racial standing of the individual, for configura-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"tions which are of great significance in the horoscope of an educated Cauca- sian, may mean little or nothing in the figure of a Chinese coolie and vice versa. Neglect of this factor would inevitably lead to false conclusions, as we shall now explain. It is a mystic maxim that the lower in the scale of evolution a being is placed the more certainly it responds to the planetary rays, and conversely the higher we ascend in the scale of attainment the more the man conquers and rules his stars, freeing himself from the leading strings of the Divine Hierarchies through the planetary aspects in such a manner that we do not hurt ourselves beyond recovery in the experiences of life. [PAGE 31]   PLANETARY VIBRATIONS But coupled with this guidance there is of course the measure of Free Will, which grows as we evolve. The child in our midst has really very little free will, being the subject not only to its parents but to the ser- vants, if such there be in the household, and to everybody with whom it is associated, all exercising control over it for its own good. As the child grows, this measure of restraint is by degrees relaxed, and in the course of years the child will learn to exercise its free will. This method has been followed by the Divine Hierarchies in the case of man. Infant humanity was absolutely guided by Divine rules without having any Will at all; \"Thus shalt thou do, or not do,\" were injunctions laid upon them which must be im- plicitly obeyed, otherwise the Divine displeasure was at once shown by such strenuous manifestations as appealed to infant humanity's mind, namely, lightning, thunder, earth-quakes and great visitations of plagues. This was for their collective guidance, for individual restraint there were strict laws, commandments and ordinances. Tribute must be paid continually to the Divine Leader and offered up on the altar as sacrifices, and for every of- fense against the law a certain sacrifice of material goods must be made. Fear was the dominant keynote of that dispensation: for \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of righteousness.\" This regime was carried on under the planetary conditions of Mars and the Moon. Mars, being the home of the dominant Lucifer Spirits, gave to mankind the energy necessary that [PAGE 32]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS evolution may be accomplished; this martial energy was of the very greatest importance, particularly of course in the earlier stages. The Moon, which is the home of the Angels, under their Divine Leader Jehovah, gave to infant humanity that child-like brain-mind which is amenable to rulership, and bends itself readily before authority. These with Saturn were the only planetary rays which affected mankind as a whole during the Lemurian Epoch, and if a horoscope were erected for any"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"of the people who lived then, it would be unnecessary to enter the places of the other planets, because they could not respond to their rays. Even today a great part of mankind has not evolved very far beyond that point, a large class, particularly among those we speak of as the lower races, and even the lower classes of our western world being dominated principally by these planetary rays. Under their impulses they act with automatic certainty in a specific manner, and it is possible to predict exactly what they will do un- der a certain aspect of these planets, because they live entirely in their emotions and are scarcely, if at all, responsive to the intellectual vibra- tions of Mercury. Neither can they appreciate such emotions as signified by Venus or its octave, Uranus,; they respond solely to the lower nature, the animal passions. They move under the impulses of Mars and the Moon respect- ing sex and sustenance. Their pleasures are of the lowest and most sensual nature, they live like animals altogether in the physical, and their creed [PAGE 33]   PLANETARY VIBRATIONS is \"eat, drink and be merry.\" Their desires run chiefly to \"wine and women,\" for they have not as yet awakened to the charm of song; Neither has beauty had a chance to enchant the savage heart at this stage of development for that comes from the Venus rays which are beyond such people. Woman is to the man of that stage only a beast of burden and a convenience. Meanwhile \"Father Time\" represented by the planet Saturn, keeps the score, and wields over them the whiplash of necessity to drive them forward on this evolutionary path, meting out to each the fruits of his labor at the harvest time between lives. When the man has cultivated the savage virtues of bravery, physical endurance, etc., he dreams in the post-mortem existence of new field to conquer, and sees where he was lacking and why his desires were frustrated because of lack of implements. Gradually the constructive martial ray and the Saturn cunning fertilize the lunar brain which he is building, so that in time he learns to make the crude implements necessary for the attainment of his primitive ambitions. Even today we see the same cunning traits of character, the same crude crafts displayed in and by the lower races for the purpose of irrigating land, mining ores or milling grain. All those earliest implements were the result of the planetary rays of Saturn, Moon and Mars, impinging on the primitive brain of infant human- ity. A little further along the path of evolution, in the Atlantean epoch, the [PAGE 34]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Lords of Venus and the Lords of Mercury came to the earth for the purpose of giving a further impulse to the mental and emotional development. It was the task of Venus to combat the lower emotions and raise the brutish animal"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"passion of Mars to the softer and more beautiful Venus-love. She was to add beauty to strength, and to attain that ideal the Lords of Venus fostered the plastic arts, painting and sculpture. These were not taught men of the gen- eral public at that time; the ideals which are to be developed in a race are always first taught to the most advanced ones in a mystery temple, and at that time initiation included no spiritual instruction, but consisted of an education in the liberal arts. Sculpture taught how the beautiful may be incorporated in physical form. It called attention to the body and ideal- ized the softly curved lines. The result is now incorporated in our own race body, for it should be thoroughly understood that in an mystery school an ideal is not taught today simply to be forgotten tomorrow or in the next generation, but ideals are inculcated so that in time they may become a part of the very life, soul and body of the race. Compare the race body of the modern civilized man with that of the Indian, the Bushman, the Hottentot, etc., and you will find that there is indeed beauty added to strength. It may be objected that we are degenerating compared with what is shown in the Hellenic Arts, but that is positively not so; it is rather that we [PAGE 35]   PLANETARY VIBRATIONS have not yet attained to that highest ideal. In ancient Greece the mystery temples occupied a much more prominent position than today; the beautiful form was idolized to the detriment of the mind notwithstanding the fact that Greece had a Plato and a Socrates. The Lords of Mercury who had charge of the development of mind, at the time when the Lords of Venus exercised their great influence on the emotions, had not then been able to make a univer- sally strong impression on the early humanity. We are well aware even today that it hurts to think, but it is easy to follow the emotions. At the present time the middle class of the West is much further advanced than the ancient Greeks because of the influence of these two planetary rays in our lives. Woman naturally excels in the highly imaginative Venus faculty, be- cause of her part in the creative function which aids in moulding the body of the race. On that account her figure has the graceful curves which naturally express beauty, while man has the worldly-wise intellect fostered by the Lords of Mercury, and is the exponent of reason, the creative agency of physical progress in the world's work. We always long for, admire, and aspire to what we lack. In days of sav- agery when kicks and cuffs were her daily fare woman longed for a caress from her lord. The Venus ray gave her beauty and made her an adept in the feminine arts which have conquered the masculine heart, so that now man [PAGE 36]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS plays the role of protector on the plea that woman is not mentally competent"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"meanwhile he is becoming that which he admires in her; he is more gentle and kind, Venus is conquering Mars, but the Mercury delusion of intellectual su- periority needs another influence to conquer it. And this, woman is now supplying by her aspiration. As she mastered martial brutality by Venus beauty, so also, will she free herself from Mercurial bondage by Uranian in- tuition. To primitive man, driven by the whip-lash of Saturnine necessity, when not by the animal lust and passions of Mars and the Moon, the world looks gloomy. Fear is the key-note of his existence: fear of animals; fear of other men; fear of the nature forces; fear of everything around him. He must ever be watchful and on the alert, vigilance is eternally the price of safety. But when evolution makes him amenable to the influences of Venus and Mercury; they will soften his emotions and brighten the mentality; he begins to regard love and reason as factors in life. The Sun also begins to brighten his outlook upon life, and sunshine in the nature of man during this phase of his evolution partly dispels the gloom of Saturn. Thus, by degrees, as man evolves and becomes responsive to the music of the spheres, one string after another in the celestial harp strikes the kindred chord in the human soul and makes him amenable to its vibrations, so that as a tuning fork which is struck, awakens the music in other tuning forks of even pitch [PAGE 37]   PLANETARY VIBRATIONS within reasonable distance, so the planets in our solar system have in evolutionary succession struck various chords that have found an echo in the human heart. But the strings on the celestial Lyre of Apollo are not all in harmony, some are in actual discord, and while man responds to some he must necessar- ily remain, at least partially, unresponsive to others. In fact, before it is possible to respond perfectly to the rays of Venus it is necessary for man to conquer Mars to a considerable degree, and bring him under control so that certain undesirable martial traits in his nature will be kept in the background, while others, which may be valuable, are retained. The Venus love which is willing to give all for the loved ones cannot dwell side by side in the heart with the Mars ray which demands all for self. Therefore the savage must learn to conquer himself in a certain measure ere he may be- come the more civilized family man of modern times. Under the unrestrained passionate rays of Mars and the Moon, parents bring children into the world and leave them to take care of themselves almost as animals do, for they are products of animal passion. The females are brought and sold as a horse or cow or else taken by force and carried away. Even so late as the mediaeval dark ages, the knight often carried away his bride by force of arms, practi- cally in the same manner that the male animals battle for the possession of the female at mating time."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" Thus we see that the first step toward civilization requires that a man [PAGE 38]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS conquer one or more of the planets to a certain degree at least. Unbridled passion such as generated by the primitive Mars rays is no more permissible under the regime of modern civilization, neither is the tenet that \"might is right\" any longer admissible, save in wars when we return to barbarism. The Mars quality of physical prowess, that at one time made it a virtue to at- tack others and take away property, is no longer admired in the individual. It is punished by various means, according to law, thought it is still ef- fective as far as nations are concerned, who go to war under this primitive impulse for purposes of territorial aggrandizement. However, as said, Mars has been conquered to a great degree in civil and social life in order that the Venus love might take the place of the Mars passion. As previously noted, the children of primitive man were left to their own resources, as soon as they had been taught to defend themselves in physical warfare. With the advent of Mercury another method is observable. The battle of life nowadays, is no longer fought with physical weapons alone. Brain, rather than brawn determines success. Therefore the period of education has been lengthened as mankind advanced, and it aims principally at mental accomplishments because of the Mercurial rays which accompany the Venus development of modern civilization. Thus man sees nature from a more sunny side when he has learned to respond to the Sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, [PAGE 39]   PLANETARY VIBRATIONS Moon and Saturn, even if only in a very slight measure. But although these various stages of evolution have gradually brought man under the dominance of a number of planetary rays, the development has been one-sided, for it has aimed to foster interest solely in things over which he has a proprietary right: HIS business, HIS house, HIS family, HIS cattle, farm, etc., are all vitally important, and must be taken care of. HIS possessions must be increased, if possible, no matter what happens to the possessions, family, etc., belonging to anyone else, that not being his concern. But before he can reach to a higher stage of evolution it is nec- essary that this desire to appropriate the earth, and retain it for himself if possible, must give way to a desire to benefit his fellowmen. In other words, Egoism must give way to Altruism, and just as Saturn by yielding the whip lash of necessity over him in his primitive days brought him up to his present point of civilization, so also Jupiter, the planet of altruism, is destined to raise him from the state of man to superman where he will come under the Uranian ray in respect to his emotional nature, where passion gen-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"erated by Mars will be replaced by Compassion, and where the childlike con- sciousness of Lunar origin will be replaced by a Cosmic consciousness of the Neptunian ray. Therefore the advent into our lives of the Jupiterian ray marks a very distinct advance in the human development. As taught in the [PAGE 40]   MESSAGE OF THE STARS Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception, we are to advance from our present Earth period into the Jupiter period, and therefore the Jupiterian ray marks that high stage of altruism which will then be a prominent factor in our relations, one with the other, and it will be readily understood that before we can really respond to the rays of Jupiter we must in a measure cultivate altruism, and conquer the egoism that comes through the Mercurial reasoning power. We have learned to conquer some of the phases of Mars and the Moon, we may have also learned to conquer some of the lower phases of Mercury and Venus; the more we have overcome these the better we shall be able to respond to the highest vibratory forces emanating from these plan- ets; yes, if we strive earnestly we shall some day be able to overcome even the highest stage of the Venus love, that always attaches itself to an ob- ject which is owned by us. We love our children because they are ours; we love our husbands and wives because they belong to us; we take pride, Venusian pride, in their moral characteristics or Mercurial pride in their accomplishments; but Christ set a higher standard: \"Unless a man leave his father and mother he can not be my disciple.\" The idea that we should ne- glect our fathers and mothers or that we must hate them in order to follow Him was far from His mind, of course, but father and mother are only bodies; the soul that inhabits this body of the father and mother is to be loved, not the mere physical garment. Our love should be the same whether the [PAGE 41]   PLANETARY VIBRATIONS person is old or young, ugly or beautiful. We should look for the beauty of the soul, for the universal relationship of all souls and not mind so much the relationship of the bodies. \"Who are my mother and my brothers,\" said the Christ, and pointed to his disciples, those who were at one with Him in His great work. They were closer to Him than any brother could be on ac- count of mere physical relationship. This attitude constitutes an upward step from the Venus love which places the emphasis on the physical garments of the love ones and leaves out of consideration the soul that is within. The Jupiterian love on the other hand takes cognizance only of the soul, re- gardless of the body it wears. The Mercurial or reasoning phase of mental- ity is also changed by response to the altruistic Jupiter. Cold calculation is out of the question. One who feels the expansive ray of Jupiter is big hearted where his emotions are concerned, his love; big hearted where all things of the world are concerned. \"A jovial fellow,\" is an apt expression. He is welcomed and love by everyone he meets because he radiates not the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"common selfishness, but a desire to benefit others that breeds in us a feel- ing of trust, diametrically opposed to the sense of distrust we instinc- tively feel when we come in contact with a Saturn-Mercury man. It is a matter of actual experience to astrologers endowed with spiritual sight that every man's planetary rays produce certain colors in his aura, in [PAGE 42]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS his aura, in addition to the basic color which is the stamp of the race to which the man belongs. The man with the thin, sickly blues of a commingled Saturn and Mercury, is to be pitied rather than censured for the avarice and gloom which are his constant attitude of mind; he sees everything in the world through the auric mirror which he has created around himself; he feels that the world is cold, hard and selfish, that therefore it is necessary for him to be more selfish and more cold in order that he may protect himself. On the other hand, when we see the divine blue ray of Jupiter tinted with perhaps the fine gold of the Uranian nature we realize how differently such an exalted individual must view the world from the other's sordid way of seeing things. Even those who have the faintest Jupiterian tinge are in a world filled with sunshine, flowers blooming, everything in nature gay and glad. Any by looking at the world through such an atmosphere they call forth from other sources a similar response, as the tuning fork previously mentioned generates a vibration in another of an even pitch. After what has been said it will not be difficult to understand that the Uranian characteristics, where love becomes compassion, give wisdom that is not dependent upon reasoning, a love that is not fixed upon one object alone, but includes all that lives and moves and has its being' being similar to the characteristics that are to be evolved by humanity during the [PAGE 43]   PLANETARY VIBRATIONS Venus period when perfect love shall have cast out all fear, when man shall have conquered all the lower phases of his nature and love shall be as pure as it is universally inclusive. When these Uranian vibrations are felt by advance in the higher life through aspiration, there is great danger that we may throw away the fetters of law and convention before we are really ready to govern ourselves by the law of Love divine, that we may disregard the laws that are in the world, that we may not render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, whether in obedi- ence or coin, that we may not be careful of avoiding the appearance of evil, that we may think that we have so far transcended the ordinary stage of hu- manity that we can live as super-humans, that the passion of Mars has in our cases been changed to Uranian compassion, which is sexless. Under such mis-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"apprehensions, many people who endeavor to tread the path disregard the laws of marriage and enter into relationships as soulmates and affinities. They feel the Uranian ray, but cannot quite respond to its sublime purity, there- fore they experience a counterfeit Venusian sensation which usually ends in adultery and sex-perversion, so that instead of the natural animal passion of Mars having been transmuted to the compassion of Uranus it has as a mat- ter of fact, degenerated into something that is far worse than the fullest sex expression of the martial rays committed in a frank and proper manner. This is a danger that cannot be too strictly guarded against and it behooves [PAGE 44]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS every one who endeavors to live the higher life not to try to aspire to the Uranian rays until he at first becomes thoroughly imbued with the altruistic vibrations of Jupiter, for more misery is brought into the world by those who have aspired too high and fallen low, then by those who are not suffi- ciently aspiring. \"Pride goeth before a fall,\" is an ancient and very true proverb, which it behooves every one of us to take to heart. The Christ took part in the marriage at Cana. Marriage is a regular Christian institu- tion, and must exist until abolished in the kingdom to come; there the bod- ies we have will not wear out and therefore there will be no need of mar- riage to generate new ones. Let it also be understood that the minister who marries cannot truly mate people, therefore the presence of the basic harmony for true marriage should be determined before the marriage ceremony. As we have seen in the foregoing, Mars, Venus and Uranus mark three stages in the emotional development of man. During the stage where he is only amenable to Mars, animal passion reigns supreme and he seeks unre- stricted gratification of all his lower desires in the intercourse with his fellowman but particularly with the opposite sex; during the stage where he becomes amenable to the rays of Venus, love softens the brutality of his de- sires and the animal passions are somewhat held in leash, he is even, under the higher phases of this planet, ready to sacrifice himself and his desires [PAGE 45]   PLANETARY VIBRATIONS for the benefit and comfort of the loved ones. When he has evolved to the point where we can feel the rays of Uranus, the passion of Mars gradually turns to compassion; there the love of Venus which is only for one par- ticular person, becomes all inclusive so that it embraces all humankind re- gardless of sex or any other distinction, for it is the divine love of soul for soul which is above all material considerations of whatever nature. The mentality also evolves through three stages according to the amena-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"bility of the person to the vibrations of the Moon, Mercury and Neptune. While man is only amenable to the lunar influence, he is childlike and eas- ily guided by the higher powers, which have led him through the various stages mentioned in our pervious chapters. Under the stellar ray of Mercury he gradually develops his intellectual powers and becomes a reasoning being. As such, he is placed under the law of cause and effect, made responsible for his own actions, so that he may reap what he has sown and learn thereby the lessons that human life has to teach him under the present regime. Be- ing inexperienced, he makes mistakes in whatever direction indicated by the afflictions to Mercury in his horoscope and consequently he suffers a cor- responding penalty of sorrow and trouble. It he has not the mentality to reason on the connection between this mistakes and the sad experiences grow- ing from them, during his life times, the panorama of life, which unfolds in [PAGE 46]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the post-mortem state, makes this clear,and leaves with him an essence of \"right feeling\" which we know as \"conscience.\" This conscience keeps him from repeating past mistakes, when the feeling generated has become sufficiently strong to overbalance the tendency to yield to the particular temptation which caused him suffering. Thus he gradually develops a spiritual consciousness which is above and beyond human reason, but which nevertheless is also connected with reason in such a man- ner that when the result has been reached, the man who has this Cosmic Con- sciousness knows the reason why such and such a thing is and must be, or why he ought to take a certain action. This Cosmic Consciousness is developed under the ray of Neptune and differs from that intuitional right feeling de- veloped under the ray of Uranus in the very important fact that while the person who has developed the Uranian quality of intuition arrives at the truth instantaneously without the necessity of thinking over the matter or reasoning, he is unable to give anything but the result; he cannot connect the various steps of logical sequence whereby the final result was reached. The man or woman, however, who develops the Neptunian faculty, also has the answer of any question immediately and is able to tell the reason why that answer is the proper and right one. The faculty of intuition built up from the Martial base of passion, through the Venusian stage of love, and the Uranian rays of compassion, [PAGE 47]   PLANETARY VIBRATIONS depends upon the ability of the person involved TO FEEL VERY INTENSELY. By love and devotion, the heart is attuned to every other heart in the universe and in this way it knows and feels all that may be known and felt by any other heart in the universe, thus sharing the divine omniscience that binds"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Our Father in Heaven to His children and through the direct heart to heart touch with that omniscience the person obtains the answers to whatever prob- lem is placed before him. The noblest men of all ages, Christian saints of the most transcendent spirituality, have attained their wonderful development through the spiritual rays of this planet because of the intense feeling of Oneness with the divine and with all that lives and breathes in the universe. But there are others who are not thus constituted and they are not able to walk that path. These, through the Moon, Mercury and Neptune have devel- oped their intellect and attained the same results plus the Neptunian power of idealization. This is very important point and it is only brought out in the Western Wisdom Teachings tell us that there is in addition a third factor in univer- sal advancement, namely, EPIGENESIS; the faculty whereby the spirit may choose a course that is altogether new and independent of what has gone [PAGE 48]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS before. We see the expression of this in all kingdoms relative to form, but in the human kingdom, epigenesis expresses itself as genius, a creative in- stinct, which makes man more akin to the divine than any other of his ac- complishments. This is developed under the Neptune ray when that planet is well placed in the horoscope. There is of course also such a thing as an evil genius, a destructive faculty developed under an afflicted Neptune. Only the most sensitive people in the world feel the rays of Uranus and Neptune at the present time. To feel these vibrations the connection be- tween the dense physical body and the vital body, which is made of ether must be rather loose for where these two vehicles are firmly interlocked the person is always of a materialistic turn, and cannot respond to the higher and more subtle vibrations from the spiritual world. But when the stellar rays from these two planets impinge upon a person whose vital body is loosely connected with the physical, we have what is called a sensitive. The direction and quality of this faculty depends upon the placement and the aspects of the two planets mentioned, however. Those who are particularly under the domination of an adverse aspect of the Uranian ray, usually de- velop the more undesirable phases of clairvoyance and mediumship. They eas- ily become the prey of entities from the invisible world who have no regard [PAGE 49]   PLANETARY VIBRATIONS for their victims' desire, even if in a weak manner these should protest. Such mediums are generally used in simple trance communications and in a few"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"cases known to the writer have lived very beautiful and happy lives because of implicit belief in the spirits that dominated them. In these cases the spirit-controls were of a better class than usually met with. But as this Uranian faculty is built up through Mars and Venus, passion is prominent in such natures and under the influence of obsessing spirits many of these people are driven into gross immorality. Vampirism and kindred dis- reputable practices are also engendered by the perverse use of the Uranian ray in mediums. Neptune may be said to represent the invisible worlds in more positive aspects and those who come under the evil rays of this planet are therefore brought in touch with the most undesirable occupants of the invisible worlds. Actual obsession whereby the owner of a body is deprived of his ve- hicle takes place under the ray of Neptune and no materializing seance could ever be held if it were not for this stellar vibration. Magic, white or black can never be put to practical use save under and because of this Neptunian vibration. Apart from this ray it will remain theory, speculation and book learning. Therefore the Initiates of every Mystery School, Spiritual; Seers who have full control of their faculty, and Astrologers are amenable in varying degrees to the ray of Neptune. The Black Magician and [PAGE 50]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the Hypnotist, who is a twin brother to him, are also dependent upon the power of this stellar ray for use in their nefarious practices. The highest human development at the present time, namely, the soul unfoldment which is undertaken in the mystery temples through initiation, is directly the result of the Neptune ray, for just as evil configurations lay men liable to assault by invisible entities, so the good configurations of Neptune are particularly required to enable a man to unfold by initiation his whole soul powers and become a conscience agent in the invisible worlds. Let us remember, however, that good or evil configurations are not the re- sult of chance or luck, but are the product of our own past acts; the horo- scope shows what we have earned by our past living and therefore what we are entitled to in the present life. Moreover it should always be kept in mind that THE STARS IMPEL BUT DO NOT COMPEL; because a man or woman has an evil configuration of Neptune or Uranus it is not unavoidable that they should go into active evil Mediumship and Black Magic and thereby makes life harder for themselves in the future. Their opportunity to do so and the temptation will come at certain times when the heavenly time markers point to the right hour on the clock of des- tiny. Then it is time to stand form for the good and for the right; being forewarned through a knowledge of Astrology one is also forearmed and may the easier overcome when such an aspect culminates."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"file:///C|/WINDOWS/DESKTOP/GLENNS~1/MAGICAL/messageofthestarsMaxHeindel1.htm [PAGE 51]   PLANETARY VIBRATIONS Thus we have seen that man is amenable to the planetary rays in an in- creasing measure as he advances through evolution, but the more highly he becomes developed spiritually the less he will allow the planets to dominate him, while the younger soul is driven unresistingly along the tide of life in whatever direction of the planetary vibrations impel him. It is the mark of the advanced soul that he keeps the true course regardless of the plan- etary vibrations. Between these two extremes there are naturally all graduations, some amenable to the rays of one planet, some to another. The bark of life of men and women is often driven upon the rocks of sorrow and suffering, that they may learn to evolve within themselves the will power that finally frees them from all domination by the ruling stars. As Goethe, the great mystic, said, \"From every power that holds the world in chains, Man frees himself when self-control he gains.\" And it may be asked, have we run the gamut of vibrations when we have learned to respond to all the seven planets which are mythically represented as the seven strings on Apollo's Lyre? In other words is Neptune the high- est vibration to which we shall yet respond? The Western Wisdom Teachings tell us that there are two more planets in the universe which will be known in future ages and that these will have an influence in developing qualities of so transcendent a nature that we cannot now understand them. The [PAGE 52]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS number of Adam, man or humanity, is nine, and there are nine rungs upon the stellar ladder by which he is ascending to God; up to the present time he has climbed only five of these rungs; Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, and not even the vibration of these has he by any means learned; Uranus and Neptune are slowly coming into our lives; they will not become active in the same manner and to the same degree that for instance, the Moon and Mars are at the present time until many ages have passed. But even when we have learned to respond to them there are two more which we shall know something later on; it is the opinion of the writers that these are probably not felt by any except those who have graduated from the Greater Mystery School and by the Hierophants of that sublime institution. In conclusion to this article on the Amenability of Man to Planetary Vi- brations we quote from the Rosicrucian Mysteries the article on Light, Color and Consciousness. \"Truly, GOD IS ONE AND UNDIVIDED. He enfolds within His Being all that is, as the white light embraces all colors. But He appears three-fold in"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"manifestation, as the white light is refracted in three primary colors, Blue, Yellow and Red. Wherever we see these colors they are emblematical of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. These three primary rays of Divine Life are diffused or radiated through the Sun and produce LIFE, CONSCIOUSNESS AND [PAGE 53]   PLANETARY VIBRATIONS FORM upon each of the seven light bearers, the planets, which are called the 'Seven Spirits before the Throne.' Their names are, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. Bode's law proves that Neptune does not yet belong to our solar system and the reader is referred to 'Simplified, Scientific Astrology' by the present writer, for mathematical demonstration of this condition. \"Each of the seven planets receives the light of the Sun in a different measure, according to its proximity to the central orb and the constitution of its atmosphere, and the beings on each, according to their stage of de- velopment have affinity for some of the solar rays. The planets absorb the color or colors congruous to them, and reflect the rest upon the other plan- ets. This reflected ray bears with it an impulse of the nature of the be- ings with which it has been in contact. \"Thus the divine Light and Life comes to each planet, either directly from the Sun, or reflected from its six sister planets. and as the summer breeze which has been wafted over blooming fields carries upon its silent, invisible wings the blended fragrance of a multitude of flowers, so also the subtle influences from THE GARDEN OF GOD bring to us the commingled impulses of all the Planetary Spirits and in that vari-colored light we live and move and have our being. \"The rays which come directly from the Sun are productive of spiritual illumination; the reflected rays from other planets make for added con- [PAGE 54]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS sciousness and moral development and the rays reflected by way of the Moon give physical growth. \"But as each planet can only absorb a certain quantity of one or more colors according to the general stage of evolution there, so each being upon earth, mineral, plant, animal and man can only absorb and thrive upon a cer- tain quantity of the various rays projected upon the earth. The remainder do not affect it or produce sensation any more than the blind are conscience of the light and color which exist everywhere around them. Therefore each being is differently affected by the stellar rays, and the science of As- trology, a fundamental truth in nature is of enormous benefit in the attain-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"ment of spiritual growth.\""},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"[PAGE 55]  WERE YOU BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR?  CHAPTER III  WERE YOU BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR? Have you ever looked through a kaleidoscope at the patterns formed there by the many little pieces of varicolored glass, and noticed how the slight- est disturbance of the position changes the pattern? Also, do you realize that it would be impossible, or almost so, to duplicate any pattern, no mat- ter how much you were to turn; there is such a variety of effect. Similarly when you look into the heavens night after night you will notice changes among the planets, in fact such is the variety of changes that occur among them that it would be impossible to duplicate the position which they hold relatively to one another while you are reading this, for almost twenty-six thousand years. Thus in the planetary kaleidoscope there is, we might say, an infinity of patterns. When we realize that human beings are entering the world constantly and that each being is stamped at the first complete breath with the planetary pattern then in the sky, everyone must necessarily be different from everyone else. Nor should this statement about stellar in- fluence create doubt when we consider that wireless saves of different lengths and different pitch sent out from a tiny man-made contrivance can [PAGE 56]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS make themselves felt and can register by mechanical operations involving ex- penditure of energy thousands of miles from their source. The planetary vi- brations from those great orbs in the heavens make themselves felt millions of miles away as surely, as easily, and with equal uncertainty. We know that the angle of the solar ray determines whether it is winter or summer. We also know the effect of the Moon upon the waters, and it is within the experience of all that we feel more buoyant when the atmosphere is clear and dry than when it is moist and murky. And what determines these atmospheric conditions but the planets, the circling stars? When we look up at this planetary kaleidoscope from time to time we see in the heavens various configurations which are pronounced lucky or unlucky according to whether they are formed between so-called benefices alone, such as Venus, Jupiter and the Sun, or planets said to be malefic such as Saturn, Mars or Uranus. When Jupiter and Venus are in close conjunction near the mid-heaven, it is a foregone conclusion that those who come into the world under this configuration will enjoy a measure of good fortune far above the average, and such persons would therefore me considered \"lucky\" in the ex- treme. On the other hand there are times when Saturn and Mars occupy the zenith position for souls that are born to suffer. But why should one suffer and another be born under a lucky star? Why do"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"the stars give good fortune to one and misfortune to others, and if we are [PAGE 57]  WERE YOU BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR? born to \"luck\": whether good or bad, what is the use or where is the incen- tive to individual effort? If there is a law of nature which is established beyond doubt it is surely the law of Cause and Effect. Every cause must produce an adequate effect and nothing which we see as an effect can be without a pre-existence cause. Moreover, if this is a universal law it must apply to the conditions of birth as well as to subsequent life. Following up this idea the next question is: If our birth under a lucky or unlucky star. Thus by induction of belief in Astrology requires also a belief in a previous existence as well as in future lives, for while we are now reaping in our horoscopes the effects of our past lives we are also by out acts lay- ing the foundations for a new horoscope which can only be worked out in a future life. \"How closely luck is linked to merit Does never to the fool occur; Had he the wise man's stone, I swear it, The stone had no philospher,\" said MEPHISTO sarcastically in \"FAUST\" and it is true. If we are born under a lucky star it shows that we have earned good fortune thereby indicated, by [PAGE 58]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS forethought, kindness, and our other virtues expressed in previous lives, for we cannot have friends unless we are friendly ourselves. If we happen to have Saturn and Mars instead of Venus and Jupiter near zenith, it shows that in the past we ourselves have not been kindly and friendly or we could not now express the opposite traits. But this is just the point where the study of Astrology should help us. It shows our limitations for the present and it points out the obvious remedies and HOW TO BUILD FOR THE FUTURE. Can the leopard change its skin? No. Can the lion cease to prey? Absolutely impossible. Can the flower cease to bloom or the mineral to crystallize? Certainly not; because they are under laws which are as unchangeable as the laws of the Medes and Persians. THEY HAVE NEITHER CHOICE NOR PREROGATIVE but must obey the dictates of the group spirit which guides them along their path of evolution. But in this respect we differ radically from those lower kingdoms, we have both choice and prerogative. WE MAY DO WHATSOEVER WE WILL and that is a factor which is never shown in the horoscope, a factor that may be made to play an all important role in every life. It is not enough to be born under a lucky star to have a lucky life, for the horoscope shows only the tendencies and the person who is so well endowed will without ques- tions have an abundance of opportunities to make his life fortunate in the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"very highest degree. BUT ONLY IN SO FAR AS HE EXERTS HIMSELF TO GRASP [PAGE 59]  WERE YOU BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR? OPPORTUNITY on the wing, will that which is foreshadowed in his horoscope come to pass. And similarly with the person who is afflicted by the con- junction of two malefics in the mid-heaven or anywhere else in the horo- scope. By his will, and the exercise of choice, which are his divine birth- rights, HE MAY RULE HIS STARS and make of the unlucky horoscope a fruitful life from a far higher standpoint than the other. The bark that has been tossed by the tempest harbors a job when the haven of safety is reached that is not equaled on the ship that has always said on smiling seas. \"Who never ate his bread in sorrow, Who never passed the midnight hours Weeping, waiting for the morrow, He knows not yet ye heavenly powers.\" From the higher standpoint those who are living in the lap of luxury are to be pitied when their lucky stars give them all the good things of this world and cause them to forget that they are stewards and that the day is coming when their souls shall be required of them with an accounts of their stewardship. They shall then be forced to confess that they have failed to use the substance entrusted to them in the proper manner; while others under the strain and stress of live, expressed by the horoscopical squares and op- positions, have wrung from their unlucky stars a measure of victory. What wonder then if the king's messengers, the circling stars, take from the [PAGE 60]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS unfaithful steward that which he had and give to the other, changing the latter's adversity to prosperity in later lives. Thus the pendulum of luck and loss, success and failure swings through many lives till we learn to make our own \"luck\" by ruling our stars. \"A god can love without cessation, But under laws of alteration We mortals need, in changing measure, Our share of pain as well as pleasure.\" And it is this necessity for change that is ministered unto us by the cir- cling stars which form configurations that we call good or evil, though they are neither from a higher standpoint; for no matter how good the horoscope, by progression of the stars evil configurations are sure to come and no mat- ter how evil, there are always new opportunities for good given by aspects of the Sun, Venus, and Jupiter to our planets at birth.

AMULETS, BIRTH-STONES AND PLANETARY COLORS In the windows of jeweler's shops and in cheap, ready made horoscopes one may often read that it is \"LUCKY\" for people born in a certain month to wear a particular stone or color. It means business to the jeweler and the as- trological prestidigitator who produced \"your horoscope\" by a turn of the [PAGE 61]  AMULETS, BIRTHSTONES, ETC. wrist from a box when you tell him in what month you were born. Both buy their instructive (?) literature at a nominal price per thousand, the prin- cipal cost being paper and printers' ink; there are no furrows in their foreheads from deep and earnest study of the problem. But as the counterfeit coin argues the existence of the genuine, so also the fallacious information flippantly dispensed by people who cater to the sense of mystery and wonder which is deeply imbedded in human nature argues the existence of a genuine science of mineralogical correspondences with the stellar rays impinging upon all who inhabit our sub-lunar sphere; and when this is rightly understood by the majority of people, for then it is THE RESULT OF ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE SCIENTIFICALLY USED, and therefore the outcome is as inevitable as that water runs down hill. The philosophy of planetary colors and mineralogy is that each of the Creative Hierarchies which is active in evolution works with the various classes of beings from mineral to man, and is responsible for the progress made by them. In the course of this work each Hierarchy naturally imparts to the beings with whom it labors some of its own nature and vibration. Thus each group of minerals, each species of plant and animal, vibrates to a certain keynote which blends with the vibration of the Group Spirit, and the [PAGE 62]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS particular sign and planet with which he is most nearly attuned. It has been taught by the Elder Brothers in the Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception, that: The Archangels, who were humans in the Sun Period when the present animals started their evolution with a mineral-like existence, are now the Group Spirits of the animals. The Angels, who were human in the Moon Period when the present plants commenced their evolution with a similar mineral constitution are now the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Group Spirits of the planets. Man, who reached the human stage in the Earth Period, is now working with the new life-wave which started its evolution on the Earth as minerals. He is not far enough advanced to assume the role of Group Spirit, that being reserved for the future. In the Jupiter Period he will give them life as plants have, in the Venus Period he will bring out their desires and emotions as animals, and in the Vulcan Period he will give them a mind and make then human. That, however, is all in the future. At present he is working with them to the best of his ability, smelting them into iron bridges, ships and skeleton skyscrapers; he is pulling them into wires which wind around the world; he is grinding from them gems that glit- ter and grace the great in our social structure, and thus he is gradually establishing an intimate relationship with them and preparing to take charge [PAGE 63]  AMULETS, BIRTHSTONES, ETC. of their evolution as a Group Spirit at some future time. It is well known to students of Astrology that an astrological reading based upon the month in which an individual is born is worth little, for all the people born in the same month do not have the same experiences by any means, but if we consider the DAY, the YEAR and the PLACE we get a horoscope that is absolutely individual and totally different in detail from the horo- scope of anyone else--and this is the point which concerns us for the present argument--the ruler is not the lord of the sign of the Sun is in, except for children born at Sunrise, when the Sun is on the Ascendant. IT IS THE RULER OF THE RISING SIGN, THAT IS THE DETERMINATOR WITH REGARD TO OUR MINERALOGICAL AFFINITY, because at the moment of conception when the seed-atom of our present mineral body was deposited the Moon was in that particular sign and degree, (or its opposite), and acted then as a focus of forces which have since crystallized into the vehicle we now wear. The following table shows the affinity of each of the twelve signs with certain gems, metals and colors, and in that chart there are the elements for making an effective talisman by any individual who has the knowledge of how to cast a horoscope and blend the ingredients according to the require- ments of the case. We have no scruples about telling how this is done, for it may help some to help themselves and others. The only harm it can do is [PAGE 64]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS that it might induce some unscrupulous person to make tailsman for money and even then, if he is conscientious about the work, whoever obtains them will not be cheated, the re-action being upon the one who prostitutes the spiritual science for material gain.

Paracelsus and also Agrippa, made considerable study of this subject, and with very impor- tant results; but its extensive consideration is outside the scope of this work, so the authors will confine their remarks to the essentials, indicating the way which others may pursue if they feel so inclined. To illustrate how the mineral elements may be used to advantage let us take the following example: Suppose that in a certain horoscope we find Sagittarius rising with its lord Jupiter on the Ascendant. Jupiter is then the ruling planet and so, according to our chart turquoise is the person's birthstone, tin, the metal with which he has affinity, and blue, his color. That means that it will help him express himself if he wears turquoise, an amulet of tin, and dresses in blue whenever consistent with custom. That is true of a certain extent, but it is only a small part of the truth, and it is by no means the best use that may be made of this knowledge. To indicate the better way, let us suppose that this person's figure shows severe afflictions by Mars and Saturn. Mars afflicts three planets; his metal is iron, Venus is the opposite of Mars; her metal is copper, and consequently copper is an antidote for the martial vibrations. Saturn afflicts one planet; his metal is lead. Jupiter is his opposite"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"[PAGE 66]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS and therefore the Jupiter metal, tin, is an antidote for the Saturian vibra- tions. With this in mind an amulet may be compounded of tin and copper not ex- actly in the ratio of three to one, but with a mind on the bulk of the various planets, their destiny and the strength of the aspects it is desired to overcome, a matter which involves further study. The work itself should be done under auspicious planetary conditions. A Mars amulet, designed to give energy to one with a weak figure would be most successful if made in a Mars-hour on a Tuesday when both the Sun and Moon are in martial signs as happened in April and November. The same with amulets made for other plan- ets. (See the Tables of Planetary Hours, in our SIMPLIFIED SCIENTIFIC AS- TROLOGY.) A gem or an amulet made on these principles is a focus of the stellar rays of the planets it represents and infuses vibrations of their nature into our auras all the while we are wearing it, just as surely as the wire- less receiver attuned to a certain pitch catches the waves within its range; and we may blend the colors in the same manner to obtain help from them. As a matter of fact, it is the complementary color which is seen in the desire world that produces the effect of the physical colors. If it is desired to restrain one whose Mars is too prominent, the gems, colors and metals of Saturn will help, and such a person should have as little to do with iron (tools, machinery, etc..) as possible, but if we want to help someone who is [PAGE 67]   BEST TIME TO BE BORN moody and taciturn, we may use the gems, colors and metals of Mars to advan- tage. In the final analysis the matter resolves itself into a question of judgment and common sense. With these, the knowledge concerning the essen- tials here given may be used by anyone to advantage.  WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO BE BORN? In the light of occult investigation of the subject it appears that birth is an advent we are powerless to control; therefore when we seem to control it in a slight degree we are really the agents of Destiny to precipitate or delay it till the proper moment has arrived. This view is also justified by the author's experience in Horary Astrology. The philosophy of Horary As- trology is that at the time one is impelled to ask a question concerning an important matter the heavens contain also the answer and a figure set is when the inquirer asks the question of the astrologer, if this is done in person; when it is done by mail the astrologer sets the figure for the time he reads the question in the letter."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" On a number of occasions we have received letters containing questions which bore marks of having been delayed by flood or fire, but the figure cast for the moment of reading gave the answer, showing that the delay had [PAGE 68]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS a part in the plan, nor should it surprise us that the great Intelligences which are the ministers of Destiny foresee and make allowance for contingen- cies beyond the grasp of the human mind. When the Infinite Mind bestows equal care upon the design of the anatomy of a fly, a mouse and a lion, may we not conclude that a similar attention to the minutiae prevails in all de- partments of life and that when we seem to delay or precipitate birth we are really aiding nature to takes its predetermined course as said in the open- ing sentence of this article. Nevertheless people often ask the astrologer when is the best time to be born; young astrologers also frequently want to know this, not that they have any idea of controlling birth but so that on seeing a horoscope or be- ing told a person's time of birth they may make a quick mental calculation as to whether the horoscope is good or bad. Such a judgment would of course, be founded only on the position of the sun by sign and approximate house, hence general in the extreme. It may be said however that other planetary positions being equal, it is better to be born when the Moon is increasing in light from the new to the full than when she is decreasing from the full to the new for the growing Moon always increases vitality and furthers our affairs. It is best to be born in April or August when the life-giving Sun is in its exaltation sign Aries or Leo, its home, for then we enter the sea of life on the crest-save and are backed in the battle of existence by an [PAGE 69]   BEST TIME TO BE BORN abundant fund of vim and energy. It is also good to be born in May or July when the life-light of the Sun is focused thought the exaltation sign or home of the Moon, Taurus or Can- cer, especially, as said, when the lesser light is increasing for those con- ditions, also furnish an abundance of vitality which is such a great asset in physical life. With respect to the time of day most favorable for birth it may be said that children born about sunrise, or during the forenoon from 8 to 12 while the Sun is tranversing the houses of friends and social prestige are the \"luckiest\" for they are helped on every hand. Children born between noon"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"and midnight are less \"lucky\" the nearer the Sun comes to the Nadir, and them the \"luck\" turns again in favor of those born in the early morning while the Daystar is ascending towards the eastern horizon. They will have to carve their own way in the world, but opportunities will be given them in abundance. We may therefore sum up our conclusions by saying that it is best to be born at Sunrise or in the forenoon, preferably in April or August when the Moon is increasing in light. Finally it should always be borne in mind that there is no \"luck,\" in the commonly accepted sense, for that which we have or lack in any respect is due to our own actions in the past, and in the future we may by proper ap- plication have what we now lack. [PAGE 70]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CHAPTER IV  READING THE HOROSCOPE  INTRODUCTORY When the student of Astrology has learned to cast the horoscope correctly by the study of our \"Simplified Scientific Astrology,\" or another reliable textbook, the next and most important part is to read its message. Astrol- ogy means \"Star Logic\" and we must seriously advise the student not to de- pend too much on authorities but to try to understand the basic nature of each planet, the influence of signs, houses and aspects: then by a process of reasoning to combine these and thus develop his own intuition which will serve him far better than the ability to quote like a poll parrot what some one else has said. We would also advise the younger astrologer not to bother too much with the descriptions of physical appearance indicated in the horoscope. It is foolish to spend hours in studying over a phase of the subject which is of limited value. We give descriptions of the different physical types, but do so for the purpose of aiding the student to determine at sight the probable sign and planet rising when a person comes who does not know his birth hour. [PAGE 71]  READING THE HOROSCOPE There are people for instance, who have a face perfectly resembling that of a sheep. If such a one were in doubt about the birth hour, we would at once look to Aries and experimentally try how Aries rising would fit with the other characteristics of that person; if we did so we should probably find our guess to be correct. Thus also the other signs and planets in signs ex-"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"hibit distinguishing characteristics of valuable aid to the student in the direction mentioned. The student should also endeavor to cultivate perfect confidence in the science of Astrology. There is NOTHING EMPIRICAL ABOUT CHARACTER READING AND DIAGNOSIS. In those respects it is plain as A B C. PREDICTIONS MAY FAIL because the Astrologer is unable to determine the strength of will of the person for whom he predicts, but the latent tendencies are always ac- curately foreshown. The writers have found that where they do not person- ally know the people who characteristics they read, their delineations are much deeper and more accurate than otherwise because then personal impres- sions and bias are absent and the mystic scroll of the heavens is more eas- ily read. There are three factors which bring to us the mystic message of the stars; the houses, the signs and the planets. Each house represents a department of life; the signs are divisions of the heavens which by their placement relative to the houses indicate our [PAGE 72]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS basic temperament and attitude towards life; and the planets are the mes- sengers of God which by their motion through the houses and signs bring to us the opportunities for soulgrowth which we need for our individual devel- opment. It is therefore necessary for one who wishes to learn to read a horoscope to become thoroughly acquainted with these three factors both separately and in their various combinations. The following descriptions may help to convey this knowledge:  THE HOUSES The houses are called \"Mundane Houses,\" to differentiate between them and the \"Celestial Houses\" namely the twelve signs of the Zodiac; but generally they are designated as \"houses\" only. It is the angle of the stellar ray which determines its effect in our lives, planets which are in the East affect our physical constitution, plan- ets in the South near the zenith are factors for good or ill where our so- cial position is concerned. If a planet is setting in the West at the time of our birth its ray strikes us in such a manner as to draw us to a certain type of marriage partner, and the planets under the earth, in the North, have an effect upon our condition in the latter part of life. Let us sup- pose for illustration of the point that someone is born at sunrise on a day [PAGE 73]  READING THE HOROSCOPE"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"when the Sun and Jupiter are in conjunction. Then they strike him from the eastern angle and give him splendid vitality. Another born on the same day at noon when Jupiter and the Sun are in the zenith position may have a very poor, weak body if other planets in the East are adverse, but the ray of the Sun and Jupiter falling or his birth figure from the South will certainly attract to him attention in his social sphere and make him the recipient of public favor and honor. Another born on the same day, when the Sun and Ju- piter are setting in the West may be an outcast if planets in the East and South so decree, but the benefic ray of the Sun and Jupiter from the Western angle will make him beloved of his mate and successful in partnerships. These facts have been ascertained by observation and tabulation. Therefore the twelve sections of the circle of observation as seen from the birthplace are truly said to rule or govern various departments of life and thus people born on the same day may have the most diverse experiences. The houses may be variously grouped according to the influence they exer- cise in our lives; there are \"angular,\" \"succeedent\" and \"cadent\" houses, also personal, spiritual, material, social and mystical houses. Of the ANGLES, the first house governs our personal self, and its oppo- site the seventh house, rules the one who is nearest and dearest to us, namely, the marriage partner. The fourth house determines conditions in our [PAGE 74]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS home and its opposite angle, the tenth house, shows our social standing in the community where we live. Thus the angles show collectively the sphere of our activities in life. Of the SUCCEEDENT HOUSES the second shows our financial status with re- gard to that which we acquire by our own efforts and the opposite succeedent house, the eight, shows whatever we may receive from others as legacies, etc. The other succeedent houses, the fifth and eleventh, show how our in- come may be spent, for the fifth house indicates the children of our body who have a legitimate claim to a share of our income, and the eleventh house shows the children of our brains, our hopes, wishes and aspirations which also draw upon our resources. Of the two pairs of CADENT HOUSES the sixth is the house of voluntary service which we perform as our share of the world's work for an equivalent share in the world's wealth, and the twelfth house shows how we may be com- pelled to labor without remuneration under prison restraint if we do not work willingly. The sixth house shows also the state of our health and the twelfth tells if hospital treatment is necessary. The other pair of cadent houses, the third and ninth show whether our"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"life and work will confine us to one place or require travel and changes of residence. In this respect the third house shows short journeys and the ninth house long travels. The PERSONAL HOUSES comprise the first, fifth and ninth. The first house [PAGE 75]  READING THE HOROSCOPE rules the constitution and peculiarities of the physical body. Planets and signs in that house put their stamp on it to make or mar according to the nature of its self-generated destiny. Our fifth house shows the quality of love-nature of the soul and the line of its expression if it follows the line of least resistance; and the ninth house shows as much of the spirit as we can apprehend in our present limited state. The MATERIAL TRINITY OF HOUSES consists of the second, sixth and tenth and shows the worldly possessions of man, his means of obtaining them and the enjoyment they bring him. Wealth, or its reverse, is shown by the sec- ond house, health, without which there can be no joy in any worldly posses- sion, is shown by the sixth house; and the public prestige which is the chief source of gratification to the average human being, is shown by the tenth house. The SOCIAL HOUSES are the third, seventh, and eleventh houses and in them is shown the nature of our relations and various classes of souls we meet in life. Brothers and sisters to whom we are bound by the time of blood are shown by the third house, the companion of our heart with whom our blood blends in another way, is shown by the seventh house, and the friends, more precious than pearls to whoever has earned friendship, are designated by the eleventh house. The fourth and last trinity of houses is composed of the fourth, eighth and twelfth. If them are hidden mysteries of the ante-natal life of the [PAGE 76]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS spirit, and the post mortem experiences immediately to follow the TERMINUS VITAE. On the material plane the fourth house signifies our condition in the latter part of life, the twelfth shows the sorrow which impresses us with the worthlessness of material things and the eighth indicates the na- ture of our exit from the world's stage. An illustration may further help the student to understand how the heav- ens influence our life through the twelve houses. Suppose we are out driv- ing and our road follows the seacoast, but a mile or so inland. A breeze is blowing from the ocean and as it passes over the country separating us from"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"the sea, it brings upon invisible wings messages from that land, which evoke pleasure or aversion according to their nature. In one place, an aroma of new mown hay fills us with delight; perhaps we are nauseated by the noxious smell of jasmine on the next stretch of our journey; and later become really ill from the stench of stagnant marsh-water. But then we enter a forest, and soon its grateful pine balm restores the normal health and spirits. In our journey from the cradle to the grave we carry the twelve houses with us in the auric atmosphere surrounding us, as the air envelops the fly- ing earth. Each house mirrors part of the life; each holds some of our life lessons; each represents how we have worked or shirked before in a given de- partment of life's tasks. At the appropriate time of life we reap from each [PAGE 77]  READING THE HOROSCOPE house what we have sown in past lives, that is, unless we forestall the har- vest in time. Is our eleventh house afflicted, do friends betray and for- sake us, do they leave us heartsick, or nauseate us like the scent of jas- mine and stagnant marsh-water? Then let us examine the horoscope for it reveals what is hidden in our auric atmosphere. The friends sensed us, and we then, through the eleventh angle, and something ill-smelling must be there. It may be, we long to be befriended, more than to befriend others. Let us cease to be like the sickly, debilitating jasmine, and seek to manifest the sturdy strength of the invigorating pine tree; then we shall find friend flocking around, admiring our strength. Not all have such sturdy natures, but we can attract equally by kindliness, as soothing to sorrowing hearts as perfume of new mown hay to the sense, and thus we may rid the house of friends of affliction. After the foregoing explanations, the houses may now be said to influence the affairs of life as follows: FIRST HOUSE rules the physical body and its constitution and appearance; it determines conditions in the childhood home while the person is under con- trol of the parents.

THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC On either side of the Sun's path there are a number of fixed stars which are so grouped that they may be conceived as forming twelve constellations, and as they have certain characteristic influences ancient sages named them for the animals which express similar traits. These constellations are called the NATURAL Zodiac and for all practical purposes it may be said that they occupy permanent positions relative to the other fixed stars of the firmament. This circle is divided into twelve sections starting at the first degree of Aries, which is occupied by the Sun at the vernal equinox. On account of the precession of the equinox the Sun does not cross the equator at the same point each year, but it has been found that the first 30 degrees from the point where the Sun does cross the equator at the equinox have an effect similar to that ascribed to the constellation Aries; the next thirty degrees radiate a Taurian influence and so on with the other ten"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"[PAGE 80]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS sections of thirty degrees each. Therefore the twelve sections measured from the vernal equinox are used exclusively in Astrology and called SIGNS of the Zodiac, to differentiate them from the CONSTELLATIONS. (For a thor- ough elucidation of the subject see \"Simplified Scientific Astrology,\" under the caption \"Intellectual Zodiac.\") These twelve signs of the Zodiac are variously divided according to their effect on humanity into Cardinal, Fixed and Common signs, also into Fiery, Earthy, Airy and Watery signs. What their influences are we shall endeavor to elucidate in the following sections.  THE CARDINAL SIGNS  Keyword \"Activity\" The Cardinal Signs are ARIES, CANCER, LIBRA and CAPRICORN. These signs are called Cardinal because when the Sun is in them he is in one of the four corners of the heavens; at a turning-point, where he is forced to take an- other direction. In Aries he is as far EAST as he can go; Cancer is the tropical point of the NORTH where he gives the PERPENDICULAR RAY at the Sum- mer Solstice, and consequently the greatest HEAT. Libra is the extreme WESTERN point of his path, where he turns away from the Northern Hemisphere, and in midwinter, at Christmas, he is in Capricorn at the farthest point SOUTH, where his HORIZONTAL RAY leaves the people of the North in winter's icy grip. The effect of the angels, the first, fourth, seventh and tenth [PAGE 81]  READING THE HOROSCOPE houses, is similar to the effect of the cardinal signs because these houses are at the East, North, West and South points of the horoscope. The nature and effect of cardinal signs and angles may be summed up in the words \"Ac- tion\" and \"Initiative\" (though each acts differently from the others,) therefore planets placed in cardinal signs and angles give zest to life ac- cording to the nature of the particular planet, sign and angle. \"Zodiac\" means a circle of animals. The symbols of three of the cardinal signs are animalistic: ARIES, the Ram; CANCER, the Crab; and CAPRICORN, the Goat. The fourth , Libra, the Scales, represents the ideal towards which this class must strive. None need poise so much as those under the impul- sive influence of the cardinal ray; therefore the Balance was set in the heavens to direct their aspirations.  THE FIXED SIGNS"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"  Keyword \"Stability\" The Fixed Signs are TAURUS, LEO, SCORPIO and AQUARIUS. Three symbols of the fixed signs are also bestial, violent and virulent; TAURUS, the Bull; LEO, the Lion; and SCORPIO, the Scorpion. The human figure of AQUARIUS, the Waterbearer, shows us the ideal towards which this class must strive. In- stead of fighting, preying upon, or poisoning others in the struggle for ex- istence they must learn to become humane, to be friends to all instead of foes. [PAGE 82]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS The influence of the fixed signs rouses the DESIRE nature, giving stamina and persistence in action. When fixed signs are on the angles (the first, fourth, seventh and tenth houses), they exert a well nigh irresistible force, impelling the individual along a certain line. He may be slow and plodding, but is sure to be PER- SISTENT in whatever he undertakes, and whatever talent he may posses in a certain direction will be exploited to its fullest extent. Setbacks which would take the courage from a person with cardinal signs do not daunt the man with fixed signs on the angels, he knows no defeat, and therefore he usually gains his goal in the end and achieves success by Concentration upon one point, and Persistence in following his chosen path. On the other hand such people are conservative to the last degree. They may see and desire improvements in various lines, but are exceedingly slow to adopt measures to accomplish the desired end; they never do this until thoroughly satisfied that a certain method will meet the requirements. In other words, people with fixed signs on the angels \"look before they leap;\" they look a long time and very, very carefully, but on the other hand, when they have once been won over to a certain cause they are faithful unto death, and no more ardent advocates can be found; their zeal is almost fanatical. On the whole, people with fixed signs may be said to be THE MOST RELIABLE PEOPLE in the world, either for good or bad. [PAGE 83]  READING THE HOROSCOPE  THE COMMON SIGNS  Keyword \"Flexibility\" Gemini, Sagittarius, Virgo and Pisces are called common signs, their in- trinsic nature being best expressed by the keyword, Flexibility. The forces working through the CARDINAL signs impinge upon the DENSE BODY and stir it to action."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" The power of the COMMON signs is MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL, giving purpose to action and incentive to nobility of life. Therefore people influenced by stellar forces focused principally through CARDINAL signs are the workers of the world, not the toilers, but EX- ECUTIVES, who accomplish things industrially, and who bring into concrete existence schemes, great or small, of value in the world's work. THE COMMON SIGNS ARE ALL DOUBLE; two of them are human: GEMINI, the Twins, and VIRGO, the Virgin; the third, SAGITTARIUS, the Centaur, is partly human; and only the fourth symbol, PISCES, the Fishes, is taken from the lower kingdom. None are violent, however, but intensely moral, intellectual and spiritual symbols. Unstable as reeds they are swayed hither and thither; nothing appeals to them permanently, they desire nothing as much as change. No matter how well placed, they can seldom resist the lure of an opening in another city, the farther away, the better. Therefore the old maxim: \"a rolling stone gath- ers no moss,\" applies particularly to this class, for their roving habits [PAGE 84]  READING THE HOROSCOPE usually keep them poor. They spend as fast as they earn, or faster. Thus these people drift upon the sea of life propelled by the currents of circum- stances. Outside conditions dominate them as they lack stamina to assert their own individuality. The foregoing is true of the great majority who are under the rule and influence of common signs; they respond to the LOWER PHASE simply because the higher side is too high for all but a very few at our present stage of development. Those who make a success in the world because prodded by the cardinal and fixed influences, call them indolent and good-for-nothing, but were the former bereft of the cardinal or fixed energy which goads them to action, and placed under the common ray, they would soon realize its lack of power and learn compassion for those who must so live all their lives. What then is the lesson these people have to learn? COMPARATIVE EFFECT OF CARDINAL, FIXED AND COMMON  SIGNS ON THE ANGLES While the nature of the cardinal signs is such that their rays stir our latent forces into action and promote change, the most prominent quality of the fixed signs is Stability; but the student must beware of confounding stability with inertia. The action induced by the rays of cardinal signs may be changed into other channels with considerable facility, all they want being expression; the direction in which they express themselves is a"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"[PAGE 85]  READING THE HOROSCOPE secondary consideration. Not so with the fixed signs, when their ray impels to action in a certain direction it is next to impossible to stay the force or change it. On the other hand, if they deny expression in certain lines, the obstruction is almost insurmountable. People of the fixed class lack ability to make their inventions commer- cially usable, a task for which the cardinal class is eminently fitted. Thus these two classes work hand in hand and between them they have trans- formed the wilderness of the world to a condition of comparative comfort, their efforts toward improvement are continually carried on, and in time the desert will be made to bloom like a rose. As material success depends on ability to cope with material conditions, the cardinal class is particularly fortunate, for it is the chief executive factor in the world's work, and reaps ready reward therefrom. The fixed class is not so prominently before the public, labors in laboratories and works experimentally to complete the processes and perfect the models which are later used in manufacture. Therefore this class also is a potent factor in life, and shares the material and financial success of the cardinal class. The common class is a sharp contrast. Forces focused through COMMON signs are MENTAL, therefore people ruled by them are averse to strenuous physical action which is the forte of the cardinal class; they labor only [PAGE 86]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS when lashed by the whip of necessity. They are also incapable of the slow by sustained effort put forth by the fixed class and are easily discourage by obstacles. Thus they are leaners not lifters. TOILERS who do the bid- ding of the incentive and executive classes are recruited from people ruled by COMMON signs. There is one sphere, however, where they shine, according to their ability to think. Being averse to work they have created a vantage-ground whence they may reap the benefits of the toil of others, of their inventive faculties and executive skill. To do this they become PRO- MOTERS who bring inventor and manufacturer together, AGENTS who mediate be- tween buyer and seller, PEDDLERS, venders and all other MIDDLEMEN who go be- tween producer and consumer and LIVE ON A COMMISSION; also LITERARY men who devote their talent to purposeless FICTION belong to the class actuated by the lower phases of the force in the common signs. The cardinal class is active, the common is restless, the fixed class is rigid, the common is flexible."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"  THE FOUR TRIPLICITIES The effect of the \"Triplicities\" is most marked in the rising sign and when the majority of the planets are grouped in one of them. A fiery sign (Aries, Leo or Sagittarius), on the ascendant, gives much vitality, but it also makes the person prone to fevers and inflammatory dis- orders; and when the majority of the planets are in fiery signs they make it [PAGE 87]  READING THE HOROSCOPE very difficult for the person to \"keep cool\" physically or mentally. A watery sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces) rising, gives much less stamina and predisposes to digestive, urinary and catarrhal troubles. If a person has many planets in watery signs his problem is to generate enough energy to keep warm, for this grouping gives a listless, indifferent disposition, ex- cept when Scorpio is rising or when many planets are in that sign. Airy signs rising (Gemini, Libra and Aquarius) give a nervous temperament and make the person liable to disorders of the lungs, heart and kidneys. Many planets in these signs give people literary and artistic inclinations. Earthy signs rising (Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn), give fair vitality but a secret fear of disease arrests the vital processes in the body and poisons these people so that they become victims of chronic ailments oftener than those of the other groupings. The throat, stomach and intestines are spe- cially threatened; rheumatism and gout are also frequently experienced. When a person has many planets in earthy signs it favors the acquisition of material wealth. THE SUN, THE MOON AND THE ASCENDANT We stated in our opening paragraph that there are Three Great Factors which convey to us the Mystic Message of the stars in general, namely, the [PAGE 88]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS \"houses,\" the \"signs\" and the \"planets.\" There are also three factors which play a specially important part in the individual horoscope, namely the Sun, the Moon and the Ascendant, which may be said to represent the spirit, the soul and the body. Properly viewed the Sun, Moon and Ascendant are not really three separate horoscopical principles but represent two composite parts which when united constitute the human being. The \"rising sing\" and the \"first house\" to- gether form an avenue for the fecundating influences of the Moon which there"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"crystallize and form the etheric matrix that moulds the physical particles from the maternal body into a new vehicle; hence the astrological maxim, that the ascendant at birth (or its opposite) is the Moon's place at concep- tion. This composite body is the part of the human being which is born and dies after a relatively evanescent period of existence. The other and immortal part of composite man which consists of the Ego and its finer vehicles is represented in the horoscope by the Sun and the Moon. The specific influence of these planets will be described when we have considered the rising sign.  THE RISING SIGN As taught in \"Simplified Scientific Astrology\" it is the angle of the stellar ray which determines in what department of life it will be most prominently active; and it has been found by observations that the sign ris- ing or ascending on the eastern horizon when a child is born is the [PAGE 89]  READING THE HOROSCOPE principal factor in determining the basic constitution and form of the physical body. Further investigations have shown that the reason for this fact is that at the time of conception when the seed-atom was planted in the ovum the Moon, which is the Cosmic agent of fecundation, projected its fer- tilizing ray through the sign and degree which later rises at the moment of birth, (or its opposite). For that reason the rising sign and degree con- tinue to be the avenue of ingress of the life-forces which build the body of the babe until the severance of the umbilical cord, and the nature of the rising sign is thus indelibly stamped upon the new vehicle and retained all through life. In this connection it should be noted that conception is not necessarily coincident with the physical union of the parents, sometimes two weeks or even more elapsing ere the auspicious moment awaited by the Recording Angels or their agents strike. At that time cosmic conditions are such that they will form a body which will facilitate the expression of the Ego seeking re-embodiment and aid it to work out its self-generated destiny. It should also be remembered by students that the moment of delivery is not the time of birth from the astrological point of view. The inhalation of the first complete breath usually accompanied by a cry, is the moment when the incom- ing Ego receives its stellar baptism. This renders it ever susceptible to the influence of the particular configuration of the stars existing at that moment, and therefore the stars affect each individual differently from all [PAGE 90]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"others, not even the horoscope of twins being alike. It is also strongly emphasized that according to this explanation we do not have a certain \"fate\" because we were born at a particular time, but we are born at a par- ticular time because we have a certain self-generated destiny to work out. That is very important distinction for its substitutes divine law for divine caprice, it eliminates the element of \"luck\" and inspires man to mastery of \"fate: by working with the Law. If we have made our present horoscope by our past actions in a past life, logically we are now preparing for future embodiment and may make it what we choose. If we strive to strengthen our body now, to overcome our faults, to cultivate new virtues, the Sun of our next life will rise under much more auspicious conditions than those under which we now live and thus we may truly rule our stars and master our fate. When the last three degrees of a sign are rising or when the first three degrees ascend at the time of birth the person is said to be born \"on the cusp\" between two signs and them the basic nature of the signs involved are blended in his or her body. Thus a person born when the three last degrees of Aries or the first degrees of Taurus were ascending would be neither purely Aries nor Taurus were ascending would be neither purely Aries nor Taurus but a mixture of the qualities of the two signs. The nature of the rising sign is also modified by the presence of [PAGE 91]  READING THE HOROSCOPE planets. The Sun and Mars increase vitality if well aspected but it af- flicted they incline to fever and inflammatory disorders but they also favor rapid recuperation, and make the nature alert and energetic. A well-aspected Jupiter rising also increases vitality but inclines to corpu- lence, if the planet is afflicted that makes the circulation sluggish and thus gives a tendency to disorders of the blood. The foregoing remarks about Jupiter apply to Venus in a lesser degree. Saturn rising lowers the vitality and favors chronic ill-health in later life, but at the same time he gives such a tenacious hold on life that though the person may pray to be released he cannot die. Mercury, Moon, Uranus and Neptune make the body more high-strung and nervous than the average, usable specially for pioneers in music, literature, higher thought, science and the electrical arts. Planets placed in the twelfth house are considered as being on the ascen- dant if within six degrees thereof, also all planets in the first house no matter how far from the rising degree; but if a sign be intercepted in the first house, planets placed therein will not have as strong an influence in the life as though the sign occupy the cusp. [PAGE 92]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"  CHAPTER V  THE INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS  WHEN RISING  ARIES, THE RAM Aries is mythologically represented as a ram and the symbol describes most accurately those born under its influence; a pointed and protruding sheep like nose, wide forehead, pointed chin and the resultant triangular face noted in many people, are unmistakable indications of their rising sign. Light brown or reddish tint of the hair is a pronounced characteris- tic of the Arian,; the body is slender and well formed; if the first part of the sign is rising the body is shorter, and the complexion darker than given by the latter degrees. Planets in the rising sign will modify the description however, and the student must use his knowledge of the character of the planets in conjunc- tion with the description of the Sign. The Sun and Mars make the complexion more florid, the Moon and Saturn make it paler and darker, Jupiter and Venus make the body more portly. Saturn shortens. Uranus and Mercury lengthens. This applies to all the signs, but is especially marked when a planet rises in the sign it rules. Mars in Aries rising would give fiery red hair and a [PAGE 93]  INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS face full of freckles. The Sun rising in Leo would give a florid complexion with flaxen hair, but if Saturn were there, instead it would shorten the body and darken the hair. Aries people are bold, self-confident and impulsive; they aim to lead, dislike to follow, are always ready to take the initiative in any movement that appeals to them, but often lack persistence to carry their projects to a conclusion over serious obstacles. The Sun, and Mars the Ruler, rising in Aries would intensify the above, but as a thorough explanation will be given under the heading \"The Intrinsic Nature of the Planets,\" the student is referred thereto. We may mention it here, however, as a peculiarity that Aries people live through fevers to which others succumb. We have known their hair to fall out, and the tem- perature to remain four degrees above the usual maximum for many hours with- out fatal result.  TAURUS, THE BULL Taurus is represented by a Bull in the Zodiac, and the bodies generated under this sign are usually short and stocky. They have a strong neck with"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"the bump of amativeness well developed, large lobe of the ear, heavy jaws, full face; nose short and stubby. Dark eyes and wavy hair frequently give them considerable beauty. The eye of the Taurian may never dart bolts of fire such as those wherewith the Arian would annihilate his enemies; it is [PAGE 94]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS softer, but under provocation it becomes sullenly expressive of the passive resistance wherewith these people win their battles. It then marks the difference between the impulsive Aries and the stubborn Taurus. The inner phalange of the thumb is large and heavy, the calves well developed and the foot chubby. In walking the Taurian usually plants his heel first, and heaviest. Taurus people are pre-eminently \"thorough and steadfast\" in everything they do: In love, in hate, in work or play, they persist in a given direc- tion, and neither reason nor argument will turn them. They are verbose and argumentative in defense of their actions or opinions; they grasp new ideas slowly, with difficulty and conservatively, but once comprehended and es- poused, they always remember what they have learned and defend their opin- ions to the last ditch. The Sun rising in Taurus gives an unusually firm physique, and accentu- ates the Taurus pride in strength. THE MOON, being the planet of fecundity, is exalted in this exceedingly fruitful sign; hence people with the Moon in Taurus have large families, particularly if the configuration is in the fifth house, for that designates children. Venus, the ruler of Taurus, rising in that sign, makes the form beautiful as well as strong, also giving artistic ability and musical inspiration. [PAGE 95]  INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS  GEMINI, THE TWINS When Gemini is rising the body generated is tall and slender, the arms and limbs are particularly long, fingers slender, hair dark, eyes hazel. Gemini people are quick, active and alert in all their movements, habitual restlessness being noticeable in the expression of the eyes, which differs in that respect from more fixed tendencies of the eyes of those born under the two preceding signs, although of course we do not mean that the Arian always looks angry and the Taurian stubborn, nevertheless, there is a settled tendency in those directions noticeable when these people are not occupied in a certain direction; but the Gemini people have an expression which is much more vivid, changeable and past finding out. They have acutely inquiring minds, and always want to know the reason why, but often"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"lack persistence to follow clews to the end, and thus they meet disappoint- ment. Being tactful they avoid giving offense even under provocation, and are therefore generally liked by all; though their own affections are not deep. Two distinct classes are born under this sign; one, too fond of read- ing, should cultivate independent thought, instead of repeating other people's ideas, or aping their manners; the other is scientific, well bal- anced and reserved; a model for any person. The Sun rising in Gemini brings out all the noblest traits of the sign; it makes the nature more settled and contented, gives more persistence and a particularly healthy and active body. [PAGE 96]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Mercury, the ruler, rising in Gemini, sharpens perception, gives ability as a writer, or speaker, but makes the person born with that position ex- tremely irritable, vacillating and fond of change of scene and employment. Such people are best fitted for traveling salesmen.  CANCER, THE CRAB The chief peculiarities of the crab are a clumsy body, slender limbs and powerful claws.; people born with Cancer rising express them all. They have a large upper body, augmented in later years by a prominence of the abdomen acquired by over-eating. The mandible or lower jaw is powerfully hinged to the cranium, the face is therefore widest between the ears, the mouth is also large, and the whole construction similar to the crab's claw. The face is full, the hair brown, the eyes blue, complexion pale and sickly, for the Cancer person has the least vitality of any. The limbs are extremely slen- der in proportion to the large upper body, so the structure appears \"top heavy,\" and he walks with a \"rolling\" gait. Cancer people are very fond of the home and its comforts, they are quiet, reserved and adapt themselves to conditions, hence they are easy to get along with; their anger is shortlived, and they hold no spite. Though lack- ing in physical prowess, they are no hypocrites, but always have the courage of their convictions; they voice and defend them too. [PAGE 97]  INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS The Sun rising in Cancer brings out and accentuates all the good qualities mentioned above, giving more ambition and pride; it also increases the vitality, and is a particular boon in that respect to people with Cancer rising on account of their very low life force. Cancer, with its rule; the Moon, governs the stomach and hence alimentation; Leo and its ruler, the Sun, have charge of the heart and circulation. If these signs and planets"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"are well placed in the horoscope, they counteract most other afflictions and a long lease of life is assured, but if they are afflicted, much sickness results unless intelligent care is applied to modify the omen. The Moon, the ruler, rising in Cancer, will give much instability to the natures, and Jupiter, being exalted there, will bring fortune and fame.  LEO, THE LION The lion is the king of beasts and even in captivity is an embodiment of stateliness and pride. The typical Leos of the Zodiac also express pride in every movement and a stateliness which will not escape attention of the keen observer; the expansive chest, the massive shoulders, the strong arm and the large head contrast noticeably with the more slender but still muscular un- der body; and as Aries has the sheep face, so the typical Leo has certain feline features. The complexion is florid, eyes large and full, blue or grayish in color, expressing laughter, cheerfulness and content. The whole [PAGE 98]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS frame is well knit and strong, having great endurance and recuperative power. It is really wonderful how the symbology of the signs is brought out in the different kinds of people born under them. People who are born under Leo always want to be noted; they are aggressive and want to attract atten- tion everywhere they go. They aim to be leaders, not followers. Leo rules the heart, and it is a marked characteristic that people with Leo rising unafflicted, have hearts bigger than their pocketbooks, they give generously of their time, money or knowledge without thought of self. If the Sun rises in Leo, this trait becomes almost prodigality, but if Saturn is there to afflict instead, he will counteract it sot that they will either circumscribe their gifts with conditions to such an extent that they retain practical control, or they will spend their means on themselves. Leos are honest and faithful; being children of the day star, they love light and truth, are above subterfuge and aim straight at their object. Their will is firm to attain by honorable means, They make good orators and hold their audiences by personal magnetism. They are very attractive to the opposite sex, and the lower nature should be held firmly in check, otherwise serious trouble and heartache may ensure. The French, as a race, are ruled by Leo, and afford ample illustration of this point. The Sun rising in Leo, unafflicted, gives a body of wonderful strength, vitality and recuperative power; superior in its wiriness to the body"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"[PAGE 99]  INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS generated by the Sun in Taurus; but if Mars is afflicted in Leo, palpitation of the heart will ensue. Saturn here will cause regurgitation unless care is taken in early years to avoid strain.  VIRGO, THE VIRGIN People born when Virgo is rising are above middle stature. The upper part of the head is much more developed than the lower, the weak chin, show- ing lack of will and the large brain indicating greatness of intellect, be- ing therefore earmarks of the Virgo. The face is thin, the complexion sal- low, the hair brown and the eyes hazel or grey. The feet are small, the toes turn inwards and give these people a peculiar labored walk. Virgo people are very quick and active in youth, they learn with facil- ity, and do not work hard for knowledge; they seem to breathe it in without an effort. They acquire linguistic and elocutionary powers most readily, are fluent writers but are often cynical, cold and unforgiving when they have been injured. They are extremists in their food, and make hygiene a fad; they often fancy that they have every imaginable disease, because Virgo is the sixth sign and has a certain affinity with the sixth house, denoting health the and disease. Mercury, the ruler, is also exalted here and gives pronouncement of all the good which otherwise might be expected from the Sun. Virgo people are slender in youth, but when the Sun of Life passes the [PAGE 100]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Meridian and begins to throw its shadows toward the East, we find in them a tendency toward corpulence of body, particularly of that part ruled by Virgo, namely, the abdomen. They neglect to take exercise, and naturally on this account a sluggish condition of the intestines may set in which retains the poisons in the body and robs life of its joys, making one indifferent. In this fact lies the greatest danger of the Virgo people. Once they get into the rut of sickness, they actually \"enjoy\" poor health. They love to talk over their symptoms with other people, and they resent any thought or suggestion given to them that they are not sick, or that they can get well. The presence of Saturn in Virgo, or the sixth house, accentuates this ten- dency in the very highest degree, and therefore it is an almost infallible sign that the native will have or be subject to chronic illness, the nature of the disease being denoted by the aspect, and the afflicting planets. In order to deal successfully with Virgo people when they have once be-"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"come subject to disease, and get them out of it at all, it is necessary to be firm almost to the verge of cruelty. But though one may seem cruel in enforcing upon them the regime that is necessary to bring them away from themselves, this is really the greatest kindness that can be shown, for once these people are in the grip of sickness they stubbornly refuse to let go; they will resort to the most cunning, even childlike schemes to excite [PAGE 101]  INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS sympathy, particularly from strangers, and they will represent any effort to show them that they are not helpless invalids. At the very slightest sug- gestion of a hopeful nature, they sometimes lost their temper in the most unwarranted manner. But when at last they are given the deaf ear by every- body, when people who are in their immediate environment can be persuaded to show them no sympathy, then they may come to themselves. They need a shock to bring them out and away from their condition. And until they get that they never can be cured. The Virgos make splendid nurses, if they can keep from taking on the con- ditions of the patient. The Virgo people never can bear to see blood shed or touch dead things. They feel bodily injury to others more that harm done to themselves, and are in fact splendidly described by the word \"chicken hearted.\"  LIBRA, THE SCALES Elegance may be said to express in one word the physical peculiarities of the Libran. The body is slender and graceful in youth, it becomes more plump as life advances, but even the portliness of the Libra body is pleas- ing. The complexion is smooth and clear, eyes are soft and blue with a kind expression; the mouth is unusually well formed and the teeth particularly fine and even. Libra people have extremely strong conjugal affection, so strong, in fact, that it overshadows all other considerations. The Leos love their [PAGE 102]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS families, but their hearts take in all the world besides; not so the Librans; they are ready for any sacrifice to give comforts to those in their own immediate home circle, but they are also prepared to sacrifice any other family for their own, if necessary. In most other traits the Librans express aptly the symbolism of their sign, a pair of scales, and their characteristics might be expressed in the word: \"Changeability.\" They are people of \"moods,\" because Saturn is ex-"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"alted here and weighs upon the mind; the changes are sudden and extreme; they may follow a fad with as much zest as if their life depended upon it, and them without a moment's warning, drop it and take up something entirely opposite there are no half-way measures in the swing of the scales. Being naturally given to change, they are most adaptable to circumstances, and do not fret over reverses, but set about with vim and vigor to restore their fortunes. Aries and Libra may be said to be the battlefields of the Sun and Saturn: Life and Death, Joy and Sorrow. The Sun is exalted in Aries, and vanquishes Saturn; hence the intrepidity of Aries people. In Libra the scales tip the other way; there Saturn is exalted, and conquers the Sun; this gives a softer tone to the Libran, whose kindly politeness contrasts markedly with the Arian's brusque address. Venus, the ruler of Libra, is not alone re- sponsible for this trait, Taurus people are blunt, though Venus rules. Venus [PAGE 103]  INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS rising in Libra gives artistic ability, Saturn turns the mind in scientific directions. Librans usually have well shaped hands and feet, and are very proud of them.  SCORPIO, THE EAGLE The nose is the most prominent feature of the Scorpio; it is large, heave, and hooked, resembling the bill of the eagle, the brows are bushy, the eyes sharp and piercing; the jaw is very heavy; the glint of the eye, and the set of the jaw indicate the great determination which is the most prominent characteristic of the Scorpio. The face is angular, complexion murky, and hair dark, with a peculiar ruddy tinge noticeable when the sun shines on it. The teeth are large and subject to early decay. The body is short and thickest, with a short, thick neck resembling that of the opposite sign, Taurus. Scorpio people always stand up for their rights, and never submit to im- position, through prone to ride roughshod over others. They are full of worries over things that may happen, but never do, and thus make life a bur- den to those around them. Sarcasm that stings like a scorpion is ever upon the tip of their tongue, yet their love is strong, and their aspirations lofty. Thus there are two natures struggling in the Scorpios and they need much sympathy and forbearance from their friends. In the hour of danger they never flinch, but perform deeds of heroism with a disregard for self that amounts to foolhardiness. The mind is sharp, cool and collected,"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"[PAGE 104]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS therefore Scorpio men make good army officers and excel in surgery. The Scorpio woman has a large family. The Sun in Scorpio accentuates the good traits, and gives a love mysti- cism; but Mars, the ruler, brings out the worldly side of the sign and makes scoffers and skeptics.  SAGITTARIUS, THE CENTAUR People born with Sagittarius rising are even taller that those born under the opposite sign, Gemini, the men in particular having large hands and feet. The size and weight of the bony frame is often too much for the ligaments of the spine to support, so these people often develop a decided stoop in later years. The face is long and well formed, the nose well pro- portioned, dark kindly eyes and dark chestnut hair. The body is very ac- tive, but requires much rest, as the recuperative powers are below the aver- age. The symbol of this sign shows that there are two widely different classes born therein. One, designated by the animal body of the Centaur, is frankly in for \"a good time,\" they are sporty, soldiers of fortune, of roving pro- clivities, fond of games of change, and ready to risk their all on the turn of a card, the speed of a horse, or a game of ball, while Aries or Scorpio people may become pugilists, and Taurus people take up wresting as a profes- sion. The sports of Sagittarius have no element of cruelty in them. Sagittarians when afflicted may become criminals, their crimes are never [PAGE 105]  INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS violent, however, but rather results of their indulgence of the animal na- ture. The other class is the extreme opposite, symbolized by the human part of the sign. Here is the man rising above the animal nature, bending the bow of aspiration and aiming at limitless space, signifying the loftiest longing of that immortal spark of incipient divinity we call the soul. This class is law abiding and of the highest morals; from it come the pillars of the church and beloved rulers of state famed for integrity, benevolence and jus- tice. The Sun rising in this sign is sure to bring preferment even to those born in lowly and obscure circumstances, and accentuate all good shown in the sign; so will Jupiter, the ruler. Sagittarius rules the thighs and therefore, naturally, configurations"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"from this sign, if afflicted are likely to cause accidents to those parts. And it is notable fact that Sagittarius are very liable to broken bones un- der circumstances where people under other signs seldom meet injury. In the eighth degree of Sagittarius we have the fixed star Antares, which has a very evil effect upon the sight. Two other nebulous spots in the Zo- diac have a similar influence. One is Ascelli in Leo 6, the other Pleiades in Taurus 29. The Sun, or Moon, in one of those places and adversely configurated with one of the malefics, Saturn, Mars, Uranus, or Neptune gives trouble with the eyes, according to the nature of the evil aspect; or vice versa, if Saturn, Mars, Uranus or Neptune are in one of the nebulous [PAGE 106]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS spots adversely configurated to the Sun or Moon a similar trouble will be experienced. Should a planet like one of the above named by in retrograde motion the aspect is much worse, for when the planet has ceased to retro- grade and goes direct in the Zodiac again, it will pass over which ever one of these nebulous spots it is close to a second time and thereby cause an added damage. There may be, however, a compensating side to this aspect, for it sometimes happens that while an evil configuration to one of these nebulous spots, (and Antares is the worst,) deprives a person of his sight, a benevolent configuration awakens in him a second-sight which will mitigate the loss in a degree that only those who have that sight can appreciate. The Sagittarian must learn to realize his ideals within instead of seek- ing them without. We are in this school of experience for the purpose of overcoming, and it is not by running away from one place to another that we gain experience. By staying in one place, by doing our very best to attain our ideals where we are, we make our ideals come true.  CAPRICORN, THE GOAT Capricorn rising gives a short, slender, narrow-chested body with a thin neck, thin silky dark hair, a pale peaked face with small, weak eyes. It makes the chin pointed and turned upwards, the nose pointed and turned down- wards, an impediment in the speech, ill formed lower limbs and an awkward [PAGE 107]  INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS walk. The vitality is very low, and these children are reared with great difficulty, but once infancy is past, they exhibit a tenacity that is truly amazing, and often become very, very old; they seem to dry up into a mass of wrinkled skin and bone that is all but imperishable, this, on account of the Saturn ray which rules Capricorn. It is noticeable also, that all who have that planet prominent in the nativity show the before mentioned wrinkling of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"the skin, even though they may retain corpulence conferred by other con- figurations. Ambition and suspicion are ruling characteristics, an inordinate desire for recognition of their claims to superiority and advancement; also suspi- cion that others are trying to subvert or withhold the covet prize, is ever with these people. It causes them much unnecessary worry, and may result in habitual melancholy, particularly if Saturn is afflicted. They ought to seek amusement outdoors, read funny stories and otherwise try to cultivate a sense of the humorous from childhood, for this is one of the saddest signs, and needs all possible encouragement. Capricorn people are successful in detective work, where secret practices are used to trap others. and persistence is required to ferret out a mys- tery, for they never give up. The afflicted Capricorn is very revengeful, and if by Mars, may shed blood to satisfy a grudge. The Sun rising brings [PAGE 108]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS out the Justice, Purity and Honor of the sign, makes Captains of Industry such as forward the great enterprises of the world.  AQUARIUS, THE WATER BEARER The stateliness and pride of those born under the sign of Leo are not missing in the typical Aquarian, but while in the Leo these qualities are of a lower, more bestial nature agreeable to the sign, they are manly pride and stateliness in the true Aquarian. Libra generates a beautiful body but more effeminate as it were, whereas the Aquarian beauty is truly manly or wom- anly; the fearless eye is kindly and drooping eyelashes are peculiar to this sign. The forehead is square, and the well developed poise tells of intel- lect, the large domed head shows the spiritual side of the nature and the chin is sufficiently developed to give purpose to all actions. Thus the typical Aquarian is the highest grade of humanity; but therefore, also ex- ceedingly rare, for the variants produced in each sign from the typical, by the interposition of one or more planets are so different that the type is often unrecognizable in the majority of its features. Aquarians are most loyal to friends, therefore they attract many, keep them through life, and are much benefited by them. Like Capricorn, this sign is ruled by Saturn, and he gives to the Aquarian the same retiring nature and tendency to melancholy which marks the Capricornian, but also the persistence in the following a given course; and whatever financial success comes to these [PAGE 109]  INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS people is the result of continued and patient effort; Aquarians are very de-"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"liberate and long suffering; they never act in a hurry, and therefore seldom have cause to regret their actions, save when reason has been stilled through play upon their sympathies, for under such circumstances they are readily imposed upon. the love nature is very strong, but they are not as demonstratives as the Leo. It is noteworthy that the qualities of opposite signs are always reflected; Leo in Aquarius, reflects love; Taurus mirrors the passion of Scorpio; the Gemini body is a reflex of the bony Sagittarius frame, etc. The Sun and Saturn bring out more prominently the good traits of Aquarius; this sign, where Saturn rules and Libra, where he is exalted, are therefore under his most benign influence. The Sun in Aquarius adds much hope and life to the nature, and thus counteracts the melancholy trait pre- viously mentioned.  PISCES, THE FISHES The typical Piscean is short, flabby and fleshy with a waddling gait not unlike those born under the sign Cancer, but differs from them by having a stouter body. The feet are often tuned in, but larger that those born under Virgo. The body is weak and deficient in recuperative force. The complex- ion is medium, the eyes blue, watery and expressionless, the nose large and flat. [PAGE 110]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS There is a strong tendency to mediumship among the Pisces people, and therein is a danger greater than any other on earth. No one should \"sit for development\" and degenerate into the tool of low spirits, but Pisces people in particular are \"lost\" if taken control of. They cannot free themselves, either in this life or the next, because generally inert and devoid of will- power. They are timid, and even the mean are tearful on the slightest provocation; they love leisure more than comfort, and do no work which is not absolutely necessary to keep body and soul together. They love change of scene, rove about considerably, generally in an aimless manner. Being fond of good things to eat and drink, particularly the latter, and lacking will to curb their appetite when afflicted, they frequently indulge their craving to such an extent that they become habitual drunkards. The Sun rising in Pisces gives more energy and ambition, Jupiter, the ruler, strengthens the morals, and Venus exalted in this sign, gives great musical talent, but accentuates the tendency to alcoholic indulgence, which mars the lives of so many splendid musicians. When many planets are in Pisces, the person will have a hard life, be- cause he or she will not want to take up life's burden, but will love to dream; such people become recluses; they seek to master the hidden arts, oc-"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"cultism and mysticism; are not guided by reason, but rather by their likes and dislikes, and unless they can find an occupation that is otherwise [PAGE 111]  INFLUENCE OF THE TWELVE SIGNS isolated from the ordinary business and trend of life they will feel out of place. They are prone to incur the enmity of people with whom they come in contact intimately, nobody seems to get along with them, and nearly every- body, whether he or she shows it or not, will take a dislike to them. There is, however, a higher side to Pisces; the person who finds himself with Pisces on the ascendant is at the end of one cycle of progress and at the beginning of a new. He stands, as it were, upon the threshold of some- thing higher. Therefore, he is usually not able to live up to the possi- bilities of the sign which requires self-sacrifice and non-resistance in ab- solutely Christlike fashion. The tendency is therefore to drift upon the sea of life and dream dreams of future greatness. This tendency must be counteracted by every effort of the will, for otherwise life will be a fail- ure, and later the stern whip of necessity will be applied to goad him or her into action. [PAGE 112]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CHAPTER VI THE INTRINSIC NATURE OF THE PLANETS The nature of gun powder which causes it to explode under certain circum- stances is neither good nor bad, the quality of its action being determined by the way its power is used. When it furthers the welfare of the community it is called good, and evil when used in a manner derogatory to our well be- ing; so also with the planets, they are neither good nor evil, each having its intrinsic nature and acting in a manner consonant therewith save as modified by the circumstances under which its powers are exerted. When we know the nature of a sign and the nature of a planet, we may combine the two, and thus obtain the correct reading of the stellar script by our own reasoning instead of depending upon authorities. For instance, the Sun is hot, full of vital force, and exercises an influence that buoys us up in the body and spirit. When its rays fall upon us with moderate strength it makes us stronger and more cheerful, for there is an atmosphere of generosity, out-going love and kindliness in the Sun. Thus if the Sun at birth is in the weak sign, Cancer, naturally the effect would be to modify the weak con- stitution described in the foregoing signature of the signs; the heat of the [PAGE 113]  INTRINSIC NATURE OF THE PLANETS"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Sun would give a more florid complexion to the Cancer person, the general health and recuperative powers would be materially augmented, not to speak of the changes that would be manifested in the disposition, giving more am- bition, hopefulness and buoyancy to the temperament. Suppose, on the other hand, that the Sun is in Aries when that sign is rising at the birth of a person, then the fire of the Sun, added to the fire of the sign Aries, will increase the boldness and the intrepidity of the person to such a degree that they may become foolhardiness, particularly, if Mars, the ruler of Ar- ies, is also there increasing the warlike tendencies. Those are traits of character, but the physical body will also suffer from this excessive hear, the blood will race through the veins of such a person like a Niagara of liquid fire, and fevers will be a frequent experience, as the superabundance of vitality burns out the physical easement. Were the cold, slow and slug- gish Saturn there instead of the Sun and Mars, he might squelch almost all of the Aries characteristics both mental and physical. If we consider Aries symbolized by a stove in which a fire is burning, it would make the same difference whether the hot Mars, or the cold Saturn, were placed there, as it makes a difference whether we pour oil or water into the stove. Similarly, all the other planets produce various results, according to their intrinsic natures and their various combinations. For the sake of lucidity, and ready reference, let us first set down the word which describes the most [PAGE 114]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS salient characteristics of each planet. The Sun...................................Life Venus................................Coalition Mercury.................................Reason The Moon...........................Fecundation Saturn.............................Obstruction Jupiter...............................Idealism Mars............................Dynamic Energy Uranus................................Altruism Neptune...............................Divinity In the foregoing, the essential natures of the planets have been given; where they are well aspected by another planet these natural characteristics are enhanced so far as the benefic planets are concerned, but when evilly aspected, the nature of Venus, which is love and rhythm, becomes folly, li- centiousness and sloth; the philosophy, law-abiding tendencies, mercy and lofty aspirations of Jupiter turn into lawlessness, disregard of others, and low pursuits; the lofty spirituality of the Sun will express itself as just animals spirits and physical health. In regard to the planets of the lower nature, good aspects of Mars turn the desires toward constructive objects, as well regulated activities, while evil aspects are responsible for the de-"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"structive expression of the desire nature. Saturn, when well aspected, gives mechanical and executive ability capable of directing the desire [PAGE 115]  INTRINSIC NATURE OF THE PLANETS nature. It shows the brainy, persevering man able to cope with, and con- quer, material obstacles; the organizer and the promoter; the scientific in- vestigator, who follows material lines. As Jupiter, well aspected, denotes the high-minded philosopher, the worth law-giver, the sincere and ardent priest, in fact, all who have high and lofty aspirations, so Saturn, when evilly aspected, denotes the evil-minded, creed-bound sectarian, the materi- alist, and enemy of society, whether church or state. As Jupiter gives the lofty, expansive and benevolent mind, so Saturn, evilly aspected, gives a sarcastic, concrete and narrow tendency. It is wonderful to contemplate how the planetary forces balance each other so perfectly that universal equilibrium is maintained despite the dis- turbances of the 1700 millions who inhabit the earth alone, not to speak of other spheres. Every moment of time our actions, individually and collec- tively, interfere with terrestrial equipoise, and were not this instantly restored, the earth must leave its orbit, fly off at a tangent and be de- stroyed. Nor are physical disturbances most potent in disturbing or restor- ing balance, it being a fallacy to confound solidity and rigidity with strength, as most thoroughly explained in our lecture No. 19, \"The Coming Force.\" A train has no strength itself, but must be solid because it is op- erated upon by an invisible gas called steam. There is no force in a rigid hammer; but when driven by a column of flexible liquid, like water, backed [PAGE 116]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS by an elastic cushion of compressed air, the force stored in the air, the force stored in the air drives the powerful hydraulic ram irresistibly through whatever comes before it. Likewise subtle, invisible, stellar rays are the factors which maintain our ponderous planet in its path, and spiritual disturbances generated by mankind are naturally the most subtle force which interferes with the earth's equipoise. Each planet has its opposite, and therefore every time we radiate the quality of one planet, we call forth a counter current of corresponding force, and by the action and reaction of those forces in and upon us and our environment we learn the lessons of life. Do we vibrate to the love ray of Venus, instantly Mars comes to tempt, and tries to turn love to lust, but it depends upon US whether we remain steadfast in virtue or yield to vice. Do we court the ideal of Jupiter; do we aim to elevate the standard of church or state, instantly the Saturnine forces invite to self-aggrandizement and appeal to the passion for power. With US it lies to remain true to the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"ideal and reap laurels that last through eternity, or yield to the promise of present gain or worthless gold which we repay in sorrow when Saturn turns and becomes the chastiser. Each horoscope shows the tendencies in even the humblest life, and opportunity continually knocks. May we all be prepared to meet it as spiritual astrologers. [PAGE 117]  INTRINSIC NATURE OF THE PLANETS  HOW TO TEST THE HOROSCOPE It sometimes happens that a momentary mental aberration causes even the best of mathematicians to make a mistake in his figures and if an error oc- curs when casting a horoscope an immense amount of labor may be wasted be- fore it is discovered. There is an easy method of verifying the figure in the main points by a glance at the position of the Sun. The cautious as- trologer never neglects to make use of this method, and we would specially recommend it to beginners who are naturally more prone to miscalculate that those who have long experience. When you have calculated the place of the Sun and entered it in its proper house and sign, note at once if its position coincides with its ac- tual place in the sky at the time of day when the child was born. If the birth occurred about sunrise, the Sun must be near the ascendant; if in the middle of the forenoon the Sun should be somewhere in the eleventh house, if near noon the Sun will be found near the Midheaven in a correctly cast horo- scope, and in the middle of the afternoon it is in the eighth house. A child born near sunset has its sun close to the cusp between the sixth and seventh houses, and if the birth occurs about 9 p.m., the Sun will be in or near the fifth house. When birth is at midnight the Sun is near the nadir, and a child born about 3 o'clock in the morning has the Sun in or near the second house. If you find that the Sun is in its proper position relative to the [PAGE 118]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS houses, you may confidently proceed with your calculations and place the other planets. If not, you have made a mistake which must be corrected before you go further. When someone hands you a horoscope calculated by another astrologer and asks you to read it, look first at the time of birth and then see if the Sun is in its proper position relative to the houses, and the right sign as de- termined by the month, for if you start to read from an improperly cast horoscope you lay yourself liable to ridicule. Suppose Saturn were on the ascendant and you accuse that person of being melancholy; when he denies the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"indications and you discover that Mars and Mercury should be there in Scor- pio, it is not probably that he will accept your explanations; he will more likely sneer at astrology and astrologers; nor can we deny that from his point of view such condemnation is justified. Therefore be careful to look at the Sun. Other mistakes may occur, but that is the most serious and the most easily detected."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"[PAGE 119]  CHILDREN OF THE TWELVE SIGNS  CHAPTER VII  THE CHILDREN OF THE TWELVE SIGNS  THE CHILDREN OF ARIES  Born March 20th to April 21st Aries is the home of Mars, the planet of dynamic energy, and is also the exaltation sign of the life-giving Sun, hence it is a very fountain of life and vitality as manifest in the sprouting of the millions of seeds which break through the earth's crust at spring time and change the white winter garment to a flower-embroidered carpet of green, making the forests a bridal bower for the mating beasts and birds. This great vital force also finds its expression in the children of Ar- ies; they bubble over with life and energy to such an extent that it is of- ten very difficult to curb them sufficiently to hold them within the bounds of safety and common sense. They are self-assertive and aggressive to a de- gree, always in the lead for they scorn to follow, turbulent and radical in all their thoughts, ideas and actions. They are venturesome to the verge of [PAGE 120]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS foolhardiness. We also find that they are greedy for the fruits of their labor, they never can get enough, and no matter how much they earn they are generally poor for they spend as freely and as thoughtlessly as they earn. They make splendid foremen and overseers, for, being so full of vital energy and ambition themselves, they have a faculty of infusing their energy into their subordinates or forcing them to work when necessary. But being too impulsive and reckless they lack the ability to originate for themselves. They are serious and ardent in all they undertake; they cannot go into any- thing half-heartedly, and therefore, if they once espouse a cause, social, political or religious, they will work for that cause with all the vim and vigor of their energetic nature. But if on the other hand an Aries child becomes addicted to a vice the whole intensity of its being is turned to- wards the gratification of that particular part of its lower nature. There- fore parents with Aries children have a great responsibility to set before them by precept and example the noblest and best form of conduct of which they are capable, for this is probably the most impressive sign in the zo- diac, and the habits formed, the lessons learned in childhood and youth will generally cling to the person through life and make him either very good or very bad. Be particularly careful to inculcate abstinence from alcoholic liquors, for if an Aries child becomes addicted to that he is beyond saving and often becomes subject to delirium."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"[PAGE 121]  CHILDREN OF THE TWELVE SIGNS  CHILDREN OF TAURUS  Born April 21st to May 22nd On the 21st of April, the Sun enters the zodiacal sign of the Bull, thought, and remains in that sign until the 20th of May and therefore chil- dren born between those dates partake in a great measure of the characteris- tics of this sign. Taurus is ruled by Venus the planet of love, and there- fore the children of thought have a basically amicable and kind disposition, but when they once have conceived an idea they cling to it with stubborn- ness, they are very resentful of contradiction and very difficult to con- vince that they have made a mistake; but when one has once succeeded in showing them that they are wrong their inherent love of justice and truth will prompt them to acknowledge their mistakes and try to rectify them. They have a very strong and determined will so that when they set up a goal for themselves or have made up their minds to do anything they usually keep on working with patience and persistence until they make a success of what- ever they have undertaken. They also have good executive ability and are able to take leading positions where they have others under their command. Although they are amicable and agreeable when in the company of others they have a strong tendency to seek solitude and to become very self-centered. They seem to set up unconsciously a barrier between themselves and other people so that it is difficult to become intimately acquainted with them. [PAGE 122]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Taurus children are very keen in their desires for material possessions and they are usually very fortunate also in acquiring them for besides having good earning power themselves they are often the recipients of inheritance. But they do not want wealth for the sake of having it as much as for the pleasure and comfort which they can get out of it; they are very fond of comforts and luxuries, art, music, drama and other refining influences of life. The children of thought have an abundance of vitality to start with, but they are very apt to go to excess in work or play, waste their energy and become ill as a consequence. They are particularly attracted to the plea- sures of the table. They revel in rich foods which later give them a ten- dency to digestive troubles, enlargement of the liver, heart disease and congestion of the kidneys. These diseases are very apt to make them uncom- fortable in later life, therefore parents should inculcate in them above all things the virtue of frugality, not only by precept, but by example, for these Taurus children, are very quick and they will readily see that \"mother"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"and father tell me to eat little but they eat all they want themselves.\" They should also be taught to take plenty of exercise as a means to promote health, for the children of thought are rather indolent in their manner. However, as said before, they have a most wonderful vitality PARTICULARLY IF THEY ARE BORN AT SUNRISE and although they may become subject to the [PAGE 123]  CHILDREN OF THE TWELVE SIGNS the diseases mentioned they will usually have a long life and a fair measure of general good health, wealth and happiness.  CHILDREN OF GEMINI  Born May 22nd to June 22nd The children of Gemini are wonderfully quick-witted and bright; they also have the ability to express themselves clearly and to the point, therefore they are always good company. Conversation never lags when they are present, in fact they are sometimes given to monopolizing it entirely, but then they are often so interesting that other people are glad to listen. They acquire learning very rapidly and are very well informed on most sub- jects. They have a good memory so that what they have won is not lost, that is of course, provided the horoscope is otherwise well-aspected and configurated. Where it is seriously afflicted we find the faults of the Gemini pointing in the opposite directions; then they may be inveterate chatterboxes, shunned by everybody who can possibly get out of their way. The great point to remember with these children is that they have the abil- ity of expression and a great deal may be done during the days of childhood to mould the character in such a way that it expresses itself in a manner congenial to others and to the general benefit of the child and its sur- roundings, and that will be of help to it later in life. The children of Gemini are, generally speaking, of a very kind and [PAGE 124]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS affable disposition, easy to get along with. They are able to adapt them- selves to other people and to circumstances so that they become all things to all men and in that way they usually make friends and few enemies. They are of a roving disposition and love to travel about from one place to an- other. They excel in scientific or clerical activities, as agents or repre- sentatives of others where their Mercurial talents find an avenue for ex- pression. From the moral point of view it is not good to have a flexible nature. The children of Gemini are only too easily made victims of flattery and therefore apt to be led unconsciously into paths of wrong doing. It should"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"be the aim of the parents of these children to hold before them the ideal of the straight and narrow path and emphasize the idea in their minds that that is never to be swerved from under any consideration. The children of Gemini are very high-strung and nervous and therefore they are easily worried and irritated, which is reflected in their actions and their bodily health. On that account parents with children born in this month ought to be lenient with them in their flashes of temper for they are very quick-spoken under wrath; they need a soothing answer rather than re- proof, in order that they may be helped to overcome while they are young and to strengthen their moral constitution in that respect. When the horoscope of a Gemini child is afflicted there is very apt to be some disorder of the [PAGE 125]  CHILDREN OF THE TWELVE SIGNS lungs and Gemini children will be much helped if they are taught proper breathing exercises and calisthenics. It will at least minimize the tenden- cies and may entirely overcome them. Gemini children usually grow very tall and straight. They are fine-looking people with a quick walk and brisk movements, and they may be either light or dark complexioned according to the placement and configuration of the planets.  THE CHILDREN OF CANCER  Born June 22nd to July 23rd The watery sign Cancer is one of the weakest in the zodiac so far as vi- tality goes and when it is upon the eastern angel of a person's horoscope it always gives a rather weak body; but usually this does not apply to the children born during the time when the Sun is in Cancer, for the Sun is the giver of life, and these children are therefore more fortunate with respect to vitality that those children who have Cancer rising. The children of Cancer are usually very timid and returning, yet they want and need friendship and sympathy, though they are very sensitive about seeking it; but when they get well acquainted they can at times be very ex- acting with their friends, even autocratic in their ways of ordering them about. At the same time, it must be said they are very conscientious in all things entrusted to them, and use considerable discretion in whatever they [PAGE 126]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS do, so that one may safely trust them to keep a secrete or execute a commis- sion. The sign Cancer is ruled by the restless Moon, and therefore changes of residence, position, vocation, and of all matters, are quite frequent in the lives of these children. At the same time they cannot be called fickle"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"and flippant for they are very tenacious whenever they have undertaken to do a certain work or undertaken a certain obligation; they they stay by it un- til it is finished. Neither do they run haphazard into anything; in fact, there are times when they are inclined to be too cautious. Especially where there is danger of injury they are almost cowards, and they are often given to anxiety and worry.  THE CHILDREN OF LEO  Born July 23rd to August 24th The sign Leo is ruled by the life-giving Sun, and it is called the royal sign of the Zodiac; therefore it confers upon the children which are born under its influence a noble, ambitious and aspiring nature. They are of the Master breed and make good leaders but poor followers. Being of a noble and lofty character themselves they scorn mean and sordid things nor will they stoop to do a low act even under great provocation or the strong urge of self-interest. The love nature is very strong and ardent. No inconvenience or sacrifice is too great to serve those they love. They are loyal and true friends through thick and thin. Leo is a fixed sign and gives its children [PAGE 127]  CHILDREN OF THE TWELVE SIGNS considerable will power, so that they are usually able to win their way to the top despite all handicaps and obstacles. They are very fixed in their opinions and if they espouse any cause they will usually stay by it and work for it in a most enthusiastic manner. They never do anything half-heartedly, for Leo being a fiery sign endows them with power, vitality and enthusiasm. Leo also gives it children a good memory. The foregoing tendencies are indicated when the Sun is fairly well aspected in the horoscope; but if it is afflicted by Mars, or any of the malefics, the na- ture is changed, so that the person becomes bombastic, blustering and domineering, one not to be trusted in any department of life, and an un- faithful, amorous husband or wife, or a disloyal friend, one who will not hesitate to stoop to any meanness. He is then just as bad as the Leo with the well aspected Sun is good, this on the principle that the brightest light always casts the deepest shadow. The principal fault of the Leos is a quick temper, but they do not hold spite, and when shown to have been wrong they are always ready to apologize and make amends. They are magnanimous, even to their bitterest enemies.  THE CHILDREN OF VIRGO Born August 24th to September 23rd Virgo, the Sixth sign of the zodiac, is ruled by Mercury, the planet of reason, expression and dexterity. It is said, and with considerable truth,"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"[PAGE 128]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS that love is blind, for were one to see faults in the beloved one the master passion never would find expression. Therefore the children of Virgo who are governed so much by intellect are not sympathetic, but inclined to be cynical, critical and skeptical of anything that is not scientifically de- monstrable to the reason and senses. They are very quick mentally, though only too often included to \"strain at a gnat,\" and though they seldom \"swallow the camel,\" they get into a rut where they become narrow-minded and bigoted. They are rather lazy themselves and found of taking things easy, but they like to drive others, and can be very masterful with subordinates. On that account they often cause enmities of a lasting nature, but whenever they become friendly with any one they also make very good friends and treat their friends well. The Mercurial disposition infused by this sign brings many changes of environment and therefore new associations and friendships are constantly being formed. They are very acquisitive and always looking out for ways and means of bettering themselves financially, socially and economically. It may also be said that they deserve promotion for they are industrious to a degree where they see that a reward may be gained thereby. They are also very ingenious and versatile, fond of the study of science, particularly chemistry, diet and hygiene, and many among them become extreme food faddists. As Virgo is the Sixth sign these people take on Sixth house [PAGE 129]  CHILDREN OF THE TWELVE SIGNS characteristics and are therefore very sensitive to suggestions of ill health, so that if they ever become enmeshed in the tentacles of diseases they frequently lack the necessary will power to extricate themselves with the result that they then usually become chronic invalids or perhaps rather they think themselves so, for it may be said that these people seem to re- sent any effort to cheer them up and get them out of the clutches of their particular illness, real or fancied. They seem in fact to ENJOY bad health, and they are always looking for sympathy, though as we noted in the begin- ning of this reading, they are very slow to grant the same to others. If they can keep out of the clutches of disease, they often become excellent nurses and have a splendid influence upon the sick.  THE CHILDREN OF LIBRA Born September 23rd to October 24th Libra is the seventh sign of the zodiac. The children which are born un- der this sign are ruled by the planet of love, Venus. The symbol of Libra in the pictorial zodiac is a pair of scales and this instrument describes graphically their principal characteristic. The children of Libra are very"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"ardent in anything they do; they take up a vocation or an avocation with a zeal and enthusiasm which for the time being excludes all other things form their consideration, but after a while they may drop it just as suddenly, take up something else as a trade, a fad or a hobby, and pursue that with an [PAGE 130]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS equal energy and absorbing interest. This is in fact one of their principal faults, as they find it very difficult to settle down to anything definite, and continue it with patience and persistence until they have achieved suc- cess. Libra is the sign where the Sun changes from the northern to the southern hemisphere; it crosses the equator there, and consequently the Sun is very weak at that point. It is the great life-giver going down into the dark winter months, and therefore Saturn, the planet of darkness, is exalted in Libra. Thus we find two natures very markedly expressed in children that are born under this sign; one is of the Sun which is cheerful and optimis- tic, the other is that of Saturn, which is morose and melancholy. And this expresses itself in the changeable nature of the Libra children; sometimes they are up in the seventh heaven, optimistic and enthusiastic, cheerful and happy, then as suddenly and without any seeming cause the scale swings and they seem to be down in the dumps of worry and melancholy just as if they had not a friend in the world. As a matter of fact they make many friends for they have a basically kind disposition engendered by the Lady of Libra, Venus, but they also have a quick temper, though fortunately they do not hold spite. They are exceedingly fond of pleasures in general and par- ticularly lean toward art and music. [PAGE 131]  CHILDREN OF THE TWELVE SIGNS  THE CHILDREN OF SCORPIO Born October 24th to November 23rd Scorpio is ruled by Mars, the planet of dynamic energy, and therefore the children born during that month when the Sun is passing through this sign are filled with a force that must have an outlet somewhere or somehow. They partake in all the Martial qualities, either good or bad, according to the way the Sun is placed and aspected, and they are always ready to take up an argument or a fight; either on their own behalf or for someone else; they are never content with half measures, either they go to one extreme or the other, good or bad. Those who show the good side of Scorpio have splendid constructive and executive abilities. They are brusque but honest and just, indefatigable workers, and always ready to sacrifice themselves for the good of others by rebelling against oppression or in other ways unselfishly work-"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"ing for the cause they have espoused. But those who show the bad side of Scorpio not only refuse to work themselves but become demagogues who incite others to anarchy and lawlessness and destruction. These people are social fire-brands and very dangerous to the community. But here is one redeeming feature about them and that is that they are not underhanded; whatever they do is open and aboveboard. The children of Scorpio usually have a very un- certain temper and a sarcastic tongue that bites like the sting of the scor- pion, when the turn that side of their nature. Therefore the parents of [PAGE 132]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS these children should take them in hand as early as possible and teach them self-control by every means within their power; also strive to soften the Mars ray and instil into them a more kindly spirit. This may be very dif- ficult because the sign Scorpio gives a very determined nature, still, in childhood's years it is plastic to a certain extent and can be best worked upon then. They have a very strong and vivid imagination, with a clear, sharp and penetrating mind, also a personal magnetism that makes them very attractive to those with whom they come in contact. They seem to be most contented in military life where there is sharp and strict discipline. Par- ticular care should be taken to teach these children sex hygiene, for the sign Scorpio rules the generative and eliminative organs, whose functions are stimulated by the presence of the Sun in Scorpio, so that if the person is not morally and physically clean, much trouble may be expected. These children also make excellent surgeons and if they are taught to use surgery only for constructive purposes they can do a great deal of good in the world. All this depends in a considerable measure upon the early training, for there is a destructive side to the Scorpio nature which would make it very dangerous from the spiritual viewpoint for such a person to take up a vocation that offers scope for malpractice; he would then contract a very heavy debt under the law of consequence, which must be paid in sorrow and suffering either in this or later lives. [PAGE 133]  CHILDREN OF THE TWELVE SIGNS  THE CHILDREN OF SAGITTARIUS Born November 23rd to December 22nd Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter, the great benefic planet, and it may be said generally that those who are born while the Sun is in this sign from November 23rd to December 22nd are well liked in the society where they move. They are of a hearty and jovial disposition, princes among men, hail-fellows-well-met, and their acquaintances are generally glad to see them. There are two very distinct classes born under this sign In the pic- torial zodiac, Sagittarius is represented as a centaur, half horse and half"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"man, and one class of those who come to birth unders its influence are well described by the animal part thereof, for they are of a sporty nature, ready to gamble on the speed of a horse at long odds or to stake their last dollar on a game of cards. They are fond of a \"good time right straight through\" and their moral nature is of low grade, aptly described by the animal part of the symbol, so that they have no scruples with respect to the indulgence of their appetites, passions and desires. They are lacking in respect for both law and ordinary morals, hence they are often found among the criminal class. But those children of Sagittarius symbolized by the human part of the centaur, aiming the bow of aspiration at the stars, are as different from the above as day is from night, for they are extremely idealistic, moral law-abiding, noble characters who win the respect of society in [PAGE 134]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS general and particularly of all with whom they come into intimate contact. Therefore they become in time the pillars of society and often receive posi- tions of honor and preferment in State or Church as judges or divines. They are very orthodox and conservative in their opinions and punctilious to a fault in their observance of all customs and traditions of the times wherein they live, but they are not progressive, for they value the opinions of their contemporaries very highly and are seldom induced to espouse any progressive ideas which might jeopardize the respect of the community en- joyed by them. They are firm believers in the necessity of red tape. Withal, however, they are charitable and benevolent, tender and sympathetic; they can always be relied upon to aid any altruistic movement, and through they are of a kindly nature and endeavor to avoid quarrels in their own be- half, they sometimes fight with great zeal and courage for others who have been injured and in whose behalf their sympathies have been enlisted, hence they make admirable lawyers. The Sagittarius are usually excellent conversationalists; they have quick and ready wit and are fond of indulging in oratory. Their exhibitions of memory and interesting way of relating experiences always hold the audience. They are very proud and have great confidence in themselves. [PAGE 135]  CHILDREN OF THE TWELVE SIGNS  THE CHILDREN OF CAPRICORN Born December 22nd to January 20th Capricorn is ruled by Saturn, the planet of obstruction, therefore the vitality of these children is very low and they are difficult to raise, but once infancy is passed the Saturnine persistence makes itself felt and they cling to life with an amazing tenacity so that they often become very old."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"They are very much subject to colds and their principal source of danger is falls and bruises. The children of Capricorn are usually bashful and timid in the presence of strangers but when they have become used to people they show their domineering nature and endeavor to make everybody around them conform to their will. The Saturnine quality of the sign makes them jealous and suspicious of the motives of others. Therefore they are very fond of detective work. They will follow a trail with unerring instinct and unwavering perseverance that never gives up as long as there is the remotest chance of success. It is good to be friends with Capricornians and bad to make enemies of them, for they find it very hard to forgive a real or fan- cied offense or injury and always brood over any wrong done to them. On the other hand, if they once give their confidence or friendship they are also consistent in that direction. They are very ambitious by other people and they have splendid executive ability because of the unusual qualities of [PAGE 136]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS forethought and concentration conferred by Saturn. They are born leaders and organizers but change under restrictions and dislike particularly to take orders from others. When they are placed in such a subordinate posi- tion and cannot have their way they become gloomy, taciturn, moody, pessi- mistic, irritable, and given to worry. The children of Capricorn usually have a disinclination for marriage and are seldom at ease if they enter into that state. The union is usually childless or children are few.  THE CHILDREN OF AQUARIUS Born January 20th to February 19th The children of Aquarius are of a rather shy, retiring nature. They like to keep their own company and counsel more than is good for them, for if this bent in the nature is allowed full scope, it has a tendency to breed melancholy and make them recluses. They have a quiet, unassuming manner which gains many friends for them and their home life is usually ideal. they are generally affectionate and of a very sweet and kind disposition; they are always ready to defer to the opinion of a loved one and ready to yield a point for the sake of harmony. Besides, Aquarius being a fixed sign they are very constant in their affection as well as in other things. Aquarius is an intellectual sign and its children usually have a good mentality, because the Saturnine rulership gives depth to the mind, and the Uranian ray gives them intuition and an inclination towards science, [PAGE 137]  CHILDREN OF THE TWELVE SIGNS literature and philosophy. They are remarkably persistent in whatever they"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"undertake, and therefore usually succeed in the long run. As Aquarius is the 11th sign it partakes also of the qualities ruled by the 11th House; therefore the children of Aquarius are usually well liked among their as- sociates and have many friends. The children of Aquarius are very proud and jealous of the esteem of others. Their principal fault is that on account of Saturnine traits they are somewhat given to worry. As with the Leos, they are strong in their likes and dislikes; they will do anything for those who have won their affection, but resent any attempt to drive them, and un- der such conditions are extremely stubborn; in fact they are very set in their mental attitude, and once an opinion has been formed it is not easily changed. They are so very sensitive to the mental conditions around them that it affects their physical well being perhaps more than they are aware of for this is one of the most sensitive signs.  THE CHILDREN OF PISCES  Born February 20th to March 20th The children of Pisces are of a marked negative disposition, subject to varying moods, and are, like the children of Aquarius, very sensitive to the mental atmosphere in their environment. For that reason it is of the great- est importance that parents of these children should guard them during childhood against the influences of bad companions, for the old proverb [PAGE 138]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS about \"bad company corrupting good manners\" applies with ten-fold strength to these children, and they will absorb good or evil with equal facility. So until they have learned to choose for themselves the good things, it is especially necessary for their natural guardians to shield them. They also have a strong tendency to mediumship and if they are taken into seances there is a great danger that they may become controlled. Moreover, having such an extremely flexible nature they can never exert sufficient will power to free themselves from the influence when once they have been subjected to it, and it may ruin their whole life. These children are very peaceable in disposition and suffer injury rather than fight for their rights, not because they do not care, for they are very jealous especially when born in the latter part of the sign, but because the Piscean nature is averse to exertion, and generally they do not want to take the trouble to fight for their rights. In plain English they are lazy. Therefore the parents should see that a certain amount of work is allotted to them during the earliest years, for it is then that the habits are formed and the nature is the most plastic. They can learn to be diligent with must less effort at that time than during the later stages of life. But once the children of Pisces have commenced doing a piece of work it will probably be a surprise to others to watch them and see the methodical way they go at it,"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"making every move count until the task has been completed with seemingly [PAGE 139]  CHILDREN OF THE TWELVE SIGNS very little effort on their part. Honesty is another of the virtues of the Pisces children; they are usually dependable and close-mouthed, so that they may be trusted with secrets in full confidence that they will not betray the trust. The children of Pisces are generally kind and sympathetic, cordial and suave in manner, qualities which will of course bring them many friends. They are notoriously fond of good things to eat, they revel in rich goods, and are also prone to be fond of drink. If these tendencies are allowed to work themselves out they will of course ruin the life, and besides bring on a train of disease. Therefore the parents of these children should endeavor by precept and example to teach them the simple life, frugality and control of the appetite during the years when habits are formed, besides guarding them against too strenuous exercise which even the children of Pisces will not shun in childhood when the abundance of life force impels them. Then later in life these lessons will not be without their fruit. The changes are that the child which by the help of the parent has learned in childhood to rules its stars will be both healthy and hearty, respected and loved be- cause of good habits, and will fully enjoy life. In short, these children need a very careful bringing up to save them from their evil tendencies and bring out the good, but that is just what such souls come to parents for. Their necessity is the parent's opportunity to make great and wonderful soul growth. [PAGE 140]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CHAPTER VIII  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE The Sun, being the center of the solar system, is recognized by all as the physical life-giver even when they do not believe in anything superphysical; it is patent to everyone from personal observation that the horizontal ray of the morning sun affects us differently from the perpen- dicular noon ray, and that in summer the rays carry a life-force which not only brings forth the verdure upon the fields, but also affects the human temperament, and endows us with vital energy, courage and a hopeful spirit foreign to the dark and gloomy winter months. This gloom is permanently no- ticeable in the temperament of people living in the far north, where the ab- sence of sunlight makes life a struggle that saps the spirit of frolic, while in countries where abundance of sunlight lessens the cares of exist- ence, the temperament is correspondingly vivacious and hopeful and sunny."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" In the horoscope, the angel of each planetary ray at birth determines the department of life it will affect. If the child is born at the noon hour when the sun is at the Zenith, the daystar will appear in the 10th house of the horoscope and bring preferment professionally. If the child were born [PAGE 141]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE at midnight when the sun is directly under the place of birth its influence would be through the Fourth House, and it would brighten the old age of the child then born. There are three unfortunate angels for the sun; Children born shortly af- ter sunset have it in the Sixth House, which indicates sickness, and as the Sun is life-giver this position lessens the vitality and recuperative pow- ers. Birth in the middle part of the afternoon places the Sun in the Eighth House. This is the house through which the death-dealing forces act, and logically, the Lord of Life is out of place in the House of Death. The Sec- ond House shows what income we obtain by our own efforts, and as the Eighth House is opposite the Second it reveals the sources of revenue for which we do not personally exert ourselves, that is to say, legacies, pensions or grants of a public nature. We have known people with the Sun in the Eighth House to acquire vast sums, millions in one case, by speculation in mu- nicipal necessities. Such persons are often threatened by death and some- times have many hairbreadth escapes, but even with the best of aspects to the Sun, a ripe age is seldom attained. When a child is born shortly after sunrise the Sun is in the Twelfth House, which is the avenue whence we reap our sorrows, and it has been our experience that the early life of such a person is encompassed by trouble of one kind or another. When the ascendant of a person is in doubt and the place in the Zodiac [PAGE 142]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS which seems to fit nearest brings the Sun into the Twelfth House, the writer has often found that the exact ascendant may be ascertained by asking the person if his childhood's life was clouded by poverty of the parents and consequent limitation for a number of years just after birth. This in all the cases where it has been found that all other events fitted in the horo- scope proved a successful method of determining the true ascendant, so that the number of degrees from the ascendant to the Sun, the latter located in the Twelfth House, would indicate the years of poverty, for the Twelfth House makes for limitation in that respect, especially when the Sun is there at birth. When the Sun by progression has passed through the Twelfth House"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"and comes into the ascendant, things begin to brighten for the person in- volved, and when in time it passes through the Second House he will have a period of financial success; but as stated the Sun in the Twelfth House, just above the ascendant, usually makes a very poor home for the child dur- ing the early years of life. If Pisces is there the cause will generally be found in slothfulness and a desire for drink on the part of the parents, which make them thus neglect their offspring. The qualities imparted by a well placed Sun are dignity, strength of will and courage, both physical and moral, a lofty pride and a keen sense of honor and responsibility which make a person eminently reliable, a sterling honesty and a hatred of anything small, underhanded or tricky. It makes him [PAGE 143]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE steadfast in love, staunch in friendship and generous even to enemies. A dignified, exalted or well placed Sun brings friendship from people in a po- sition to bestow substantial favors and aids the person materially in his endeavors to advance in life. When the Sun is afflicted and weak by sign and position the opposite qualities are manifested; bom-bastic self-assurance, and bluster, love of adulation and a desire to rule or ruin, but no courage to face opposition; indulgence of the lower nature and a waste of the vital force with a conse- quent loss of health and strength. When the Sun is weak the person is not to be depended on; he regards his promises as pie-crusts, made to be broken, and because of these traits such people always remain in obscurity. In the world at large the Sun signifies employers and those in immediate authority over the person, such as judges and other government officers, and when the exigencies of life bring a person in contact with them he will re- ceive at their hands whatever treatment is merited by his Sun. The Sun being masculine is significator of the marriage partner in a woman's horoscope (and the feminine Moon serves a similar purpose in a man's figure), hence a well placed Sun is one of the indications that a man will make a good husband, and an unaspected, weak of afflicted Sun gives him a tendency to neglect his hearth and home. [PAGE 144]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS As a general significator of health the Sun rules principally in mascu- line figures (and the Moon in feminine horoscopes), but both lights are im- portant. It may be said however, that the health of a man is not so much endangered by afflictions of the Moon as by a weak Sun, and vice versa, a woman suffers more if her Moon is afflicted than if her Sun is evilly"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"aspected.  THE SUN IN THE TWELVE HOUSES  THE SUN IN THE FIRST HOUSE The Sun is the source of vitality. The First House signifies are consti- tutional condition and the home of our childhood, hence the Sun well aspected in the First House adds to the vitality of the rising sign and aug- ments the recuperative powers. It brightens life during the days of child- hood and stabilizes the nature, making the person more cheerful and compan- ionable, ambitious to succeed in life, courageous in overcoming obstacles. The outlook on life is joyful and optimistic, hence the chances of success are increased. People with the Sun in this position love to lead and exer- cise authority over others; they are very jealous of the esteem of the com- munity, upright and honest in their dealings. When the Sun is afflicted in the First House it lowers the vitality, makes the person timid and vacillating, lacking in courage and ambition; [PAGE 145]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE hence the chances of a successful life are slim unless many aspects are good, thus modifying this condition.  THE SUN IN THE SECOND HOUSE This shows the person will find favor with people in a position to fur- ther his material prosperity and will be their help gain a comfortable liv- ing, but it also gives a tendency to squander money on the principle that \"what comes easy goes easy.\" Unless this trait be curbed it may bring about financial stringency, for it is not so much what we earn that counts as what we spend. We shall be poor with an income of a million if we spend two.  THE SUN IN THE THIRD HOUSE This favors travel and makes the person bright and observing, eager to investigate conditions and things, for it imparts a scientific turn to the mind. It is a good position for writers as it helps to bring them to public notice and favor.  THE SUN IN THE FOURTH HOUSE In one sense this is very unfortunate position because it deprives the person of the help of the solar influence during the major portion of life, which is on that account a constant uphill struggle, but as the Fourth House rules the latter part of life it is always a consolation to know that the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"[PAGE 146]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS declining years will be brightened by the Sun of success. That should make the burdens lighter to bear.  THE SUN IN THE FIFTH HOUSE The Fifth House rules courtship; children, pleasure, education and publi- cations; when the Sun is there it favors all these except children. It makes the person a favorite with the opposite sex, gives him much enjoyment of life, also success as a teacher, publisher or editor, but strangely enough, though the Sun rules the heart whence spring our children, his posi- tion in the Fifth House is distinctly unfavorable for their begetting. This is especially so if the fiery Fifth sign Leo is on the cusp. Then the fer- vent heat of passion seems to scorch the human plant ere it has time to grow. This tendency is modified to some extent when a watery sign is on the cusp, but when one of the partners has the Sun in the Fifth House the off- spring are never numerous.  THE SUN IN THE SIXTH HOUSE Seeing that the Sun is the Giver of Life it is evident that when it is confined in the Sixth House it is debilitated and the vital flow is ob- structed; therefore people who have the Sun in that position are par- ticularly liable to disease and slow to recuperate. On that account their [PAGE 147]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE diseases are frequent and long-drawn-out to an extent which often amounts to chronic invalidism. If the person is an employee of someone else he will be efficient in his work; he will have no difficulty in obtaining well-paid positions but he will be very touchy towards his employers and make frequent changes under the pretext that his abilities are not sufficiently appreciated. If he is an employer, this position of the Sun is good for success in business, but indicates trouble with servants, who will be domineering. If the configurations in the horoscope enable the person to shake off the grip of sickness the Sun in the Sixth House gives great ability in chemis- try, preparation of health-food, and makes the person a capable nurse or healer.  THE SUN IN THE SEVENTH HOUSE Partnerships are often unsuccessful because of the selfishness of the participants but he who has the Sun in the Seventh House will have no reason"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"to complain in that respect for he will always attract someone with a high sense of honor when in need of a partner, and as marriage is the most inti- mate of all partnerships, the Sun in the Seventh House is a particularly fortunate position in that respect, because it will bring the person a mate who is absolutely steadfast and true, one who may indeed be depended upon as [PAGE 148]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS a helpmeet in all the exigencies and vicissitudes of life till death do part. As there is no earthly treasure equal to such an enduring love this is perhaps the best of all solar positions. Should the person be unfortunate enough to become involved in litigation the Sun in the Seventh House promotes the favor of the judge and a success- ful outcome.  THE SUN IN THE EIGHTH HOUSE The Eighth House is the angle of incidence through which the death deal- ing forces act, and as the Sun is the giver of life it is evident that this position is extremely detrimental as far as vitality is concerned, and it often brings a promising life to an early termination. It also often hap- pens that when genius has gone begging all through life and passed the por- tal of death in obscurity it gains belated recognition, fame and immortality through this position of the Sun. As the Second House signifies the financial condition of the person and shows what he does with the money he earns, so the Eighth shows what comes to him apart from his own efforts, that is to say, inheritances, the wealth of the marriage partner, etc. Therefore the Sun in the Eighth House shows an increase of wealth after marriage but also a tendency of the mate to be [PAGE 149]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE over-generous and squander the means.  THE SUN IN THE NINTH HOUSE This position brightens the mind and imbues the person with high ideals and lofty ambitions. It makes him generously tolerant of other people's opinions--noble and kind-hearted. There is an inner urge to solve problems of life and learn the \"whys\" and \"wherefores,\" hence the mind turns naturally toward philosophy, religion and law. And as we always excel in the things we love, people with the Sun in the Ninth House make excellent statesmen, lawyers and ministers of God. They shine in all intellectual and scientific pursuits. Their mission often takes them into foreign lands."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"  THE SUN IN THE TENTH HOUSE This is one of the surest signs of general success in life. The person rises by the favor of those above him in the social scale and obtains posi- tions of responsibility and trust. He is much respected in the community and often honored by election to public office, and he may always be de- pended upon to justify the trust reposed in him.  THE SUN IN THE ELEVENTH HOUSE This is a good sign that the hopes, wishes and aspirations of the person [PAGE 150]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS will be realized; it attracts people in a position to befriend him and with an inclination to do so.  THE SUN IN THE TWELFTH HOUSE This is the signature of the lonely soul who as a recluse shuts himself off from his fellows. It brings with it a danger of conflict with the au- thorities or an inability to fit in with the family conditions and on ac- count of the ensuing trouble the person goes into voluntary or enforced ex- ile, living his life henceforth a stranger among strangers. Even when such extreme conditions do not prevail, the first third of the life is usually wasted in vain efforts to find a balance and settle down to some life work. Like the Sixth House position of the Sun, this also favors work with the sick in hospitals, chemistry and laboratory work, or work with prisoners; it gives a love of the occult and leads to curious lines of research.  THE SUN IN THE TWELVE SIGNS  THE SUN IN ARIES Aries is the exaltation-sign of the Sun and hence this is the most powerful position of the central orb. There it radiates a vital force of unexampled strength which gives to the person a wonderful fund of energy wherewith to [PAGE 151]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE withstand the onslaughts of disease and should be taken ill his powers of recuperation will quickly free him from the clutches of sickness. People having this position are principally liable to fevers on account of the fer- vent heat of the Sun in Aries. As Aries rules the head the excessive heat often dries up the scalp so that the hair cannot grow and the person becomes bald."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"  THE SUN IN TAURUS A favorable position for the financial fortunes but it also gives a tendency to extravagance, especially in dress, and makes the person extremely fond of the opposite sex, sometimes with detrimental results. It gives great physical strength and the person loves to show off that people may admire his prowess. Taurus rules the larynx and therefore the Sun in Taurus adds strength to the vocal organs and gives the person a strong, pleasant voice.  THE SUN IN GEMINI Gemini is a Mercurial sign and third in the gamut, hence this position gives a blended influence of the Sun, Mercury and the Third House. This favors expression of Mercury for it is the planet which stirs the vocal chords and produces sound in the Taurian larynx; it also favors writings and travel; the mind is brightened by the Sun in Gemini and when it is necessary or [PAGE 152]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS expedient to travel the person gains thereby physically and mentally. It gives a pleasant, affable disposition which makes him generally liked among his associates.  THE SUN IN CANCER Cancer is the fourth sign and is ruled by the Moon, hence, the Sun in Cancer is a mixture of the Sun, Moon and fourth House influences. In the natural horoscope (where Aries is on the Ascendant) Cancer is at the nadir, and with the Sun here, vitality is at its lowest ebb; therefore with this position one is apt to be indolent even when not sickly at all. He is harmless and avoids quarrels, hence is harmonious and agreeable in the home so long as he is not asked to work too hard. This position of the Sun makes the first part of the life barren of fruits but brings success in the later years. Cancer is a psychic sign and therefore the Sun in Cancer gives a tendency toward the occult, often with psychic experiences.  THE SUN IN LEO The Sun in Leo gives a masterful nature with a large measure of self-control, a keen sense of honor and a never-failing integrity. The per- son aspires to rule others but would scorn to take a mean advantage or to do anything to others that would not be in strict accord with the golden rule; [PAGE 153]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE the affections are deep and lasting. People with the Sun in Leo are"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"staunch defenders of those they love, but equally strong in their aversions. Leo is the sign which rules the heart. Whatever people with the Sun in Leo do is done with a concentration of purpose which compels success. They make true friends and if one must have an enemy, a Leo will prove more honorable and magnanimous than any other.  THE SUN IN VIRGO This is combination of the solar, mercurial and Sixth House influences. It shows the successful middleman between the producer and consumer, subtle, extremely quick to see what will work to his advantage in the promotion of business, pleasant and sociable, agreeable to all from whom he expects to gain, but domineering to employees and fellow workers; a smooth talker but not necessarily insincere; he merely looks out for number one. The Sun in Virgo makes good chemists, nurses and doctors, NOT SURGEONS BUT DRUG-DOCTORS; they are firm believers in medicine and lots of it.  THE SUN IN LIBRA Libra is ruled by Venus and is the seventh sign, hence the Sun in Libra com- bines the influence of Venus with that of the Sun and the Seventh house, [PAGE 154]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS with the result that the person loves the marriage partner so devotedly that he excludes everyone else; for of a person with that position it may truly be said that \"the Sun rises and sets\" in the marriage partner. Libra is also the exaltation sign of Saturn, and his influence is there at its best, giving an element of construction to the art of Venus. This is brought about as ability for architecture and the finer branches of decora- tive construction when the Sun is in Libra. This position also gives a fine, sonorous voice and vocal talent.  THE SUN IN SCORPIO The Sun in Scorpio, when well aspected, gives great energy, courage and in- dependence. It makes the mind active, and favors success in such occupa- tions as those of the surgeon or soldier. It also tends to improve the finances after marriage, but tends to extravagance. The Sun here afflicted gives the person a very blunt, brusque manner, a feeling that his judgment is better than that of others, and a tendency to ride rough-shod over anybody or anything that stands in his way. It often makes him indifferent to suffering, and may transform the surgeon into a vivisectionist."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"  THE SUN IN SAGITTARIUS This gives lofty ideas and a noble aspiring disposition aiming to rise by raising others. It makes the person benevolent, philanthropic and therefore [PAGE 155]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE beloved among his associates. He is often the recipient of honors and ap- pointments to positions of trust, and missions of a delicate nature, not could a better selection be made, for such people are the souls of honor. This position will also bring success in religion, law and statesmanship for it gives an expansive mind fitted to grapple with the greater problems of life.  THE SUN IN CAPRICORN This is a good sign that the person will rise in life by the aid of the good-will of people in a higher position than himself; it shows that he will merit their trust and acquit himself well in a position of responsibility and trust; it makes him careful, prudent, faithful and honest. Judges with that position cannot be bought but will administer justice as they see it, to all comers. It gives an all round love of fair play and wins for those who have it the respect and esteem of all in their circle.  THE SUN IN AQUARIUS This is a combination of the Sun, Uranus and the Eleventh House influences. It gives the person an intuitive perception of the inner nature of things and a touch with the forces and ideas of the spiritual realms which leads [PAGE 156]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS him to take up when possible, new and advanced cults, or methods of healing such as Naturopathy, Electro-therapy, Astro-therapy, Magnetic Haling, etc. He is also drawn to scientific research and ultra-intellectual or strange religions. This position gives much popularity and firm friends among people who are in a position to bestow favors and further the person's at- tainment of his ambitions.  THE SUN IN PISCES Gives a retiring disposition and favors success in occupations removed from the public gaze such as prisons, hospitals, institutions for the poor, etc. If the person incur enmity of others, he will be vindicated whatever they may do to hurt his reputation. People with the Sun in Pisces have a strong tendency towards psychism, mediumship and the occult in general."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" THE SUN IN ASPECT WITH OTHER PLANETS VENUS PARALLEL OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SUN calls out the artistic side of the nature, making the person fond of music, art and poetry; it strengthens the love nature and if the configuration occurs in the Seventh House it is a positive testimony of unalloyed marital bliss. In the Second or Eight House it leads to extravagance of the person or his mate; in Scorpio it is not [PAGE 157]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE good for the morals and in Pisces it leads to intemperance. These aspects strengthen the constitution, increase the popularity and make social inter- course smooth so that the person has many friends and keeps them. As the orbit of Venus is so small she never forms the sextile, trine, square or opposition to the Sun. MERCURY PARALLEL OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SUN. These are the only aspects formed between the two. They are good for the memory and mentality if Mer- cury is not closer to the Sun that three degrees, for then he is 'COMBUST' and his good qualities are burned up in the Sun's rays. It is most fortu- nate to have Mercury rise BEFORE the Sun at birth for he is the Lightbearer who holds the torch of reason before the Spirit which in the horoscope is symbolized by the Sun. When he rises after the Sun the mentality is not nearly so keen (unless other good aspects favor). THE MOON PARALLEL OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH SUN. No matter in what sign or house the conjunction of the Lights occurs the person will be so strongly marked with the characteristics of that sign that lacking knowledge of this true Ascendant even the most competent astrologer is likely to be misled and judge him to be born with the sign rising in which the conjunction took place, and whatever matters are ruled by the House in which conjunction [PAGE 158]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS occurs will play a very important part in the life. In the First House he is an out and out egotist with very little love for others save in so far as they serve his ends; in the Seventh, his world pivots on the mate; in the Tenth House or sign he will sacrifice all other considerations to rise in public life; in the Twelfth House or sign the conjunction will give a strong tendency to drink, bringing trouble; in the Third and Ninth Houses it will brighten the mind and induce travel from which he will benefit; in the Sec- ond House it will bring wealth, especially if in good aspect with Jupiter. But if the conjunction of the Sun and Moon is closer than three degrees it has a tendency to deplete the vitality and if the conjunction is also a"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"solar eclipse, AND THE CHILD SURVIVES, this will be particularly noticeable, all through life. People who have such close conjunctions or eclipses be- come listless, dis-spirited and out of sorts every time there is a new Moon. The conjunction or eclipse does not seem to interfere with the good effects in other departments of life. THE MOON SEXTILE OR TRINE TO THE SUN. The good aspects of the Sun and Moon make for general success in life, health, fair financial conditions, good home surroundings with faithful friends, and esteem in the community; they favor a rise in life because of the person's innate ability, which either [PAGE 159]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE gains for him the recognition of people in a position to help him rise, or impels him to carve his own way. THE MOON SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO SUN makes the person vacillating and un- settled in disposition, changeable and unable to pursue a settled course in life, rash to plunge into enterprises, but lacking the persistence or conti- nuity of purpose to carry anything to a successful conclusion. For that reason such people become failures in life, especially in their dealings with women and people higher in the social scale such as employers, the au- thorities, judges, etc. They always have difficulty in obtaining employment and keeping their positions when they obtain them for they are hyper-sensitive and ready to take offense, with or without provocation. These configurations also affect the health, rendering the body liable to colds and making recuperation slow when sickness has overtaken the person. SATURN SEXTILE OR TRINE TO SUN endows the person who is fortunate enough to so have it with some of the finest faculties in the gamut, for it brings out the best qualities in the two planets. It gives method, foresight and organizing, executive and diplomatic ability with the moral stamina to carry any project determined on to a successful conclusion despite delays and ob- stacles. Yet the person makes no enemies in so doing, for this configura- [PAGE 160]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS tion also makes him the soul of honor, kind and considerate; he would never stoop to do anything mean for he is very sincere and just in his dealings with all men, but on the other hand, when he believes a certain course of action to be right, he will never swerve therefrom through heaven and earth be moved against him. These aspects bring success in political or judicial positions also in connection with mining or agriculture. The person often benefits by legacy, but recognition and success are generally delayed till middle life."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"SATURN PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO THE SUN has a very detrimental effect where the resistance is fundamentally low; in Gemini and Sagittarius it gives a tendency to tuberculosis. It does least damage in the fixed signs where resistance is greatest, but even there when sickness gets a grip on the person it hangs on like grim death, for it lessens the power of the body to throw off disease quickly, hence recuperation is very slow. These aspects are extremely adverse to that which is generally termed success, but they give an abundance of experience, so they are excellent from the standpoint of the soul. It may be truly said of the person who has them, that \"the best-laid plans of mice and men gang aft agley,\" for no mat- ter how carefully he may plan his affairs he will be subject to delays and [PAGE 161]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE obstacles which thwart his desires. His marriage is unhappy and is likely to end in divorce or early death of the partner. He had difficulty in find- ing and keeping employment, trouble with employers and authorities, a fell- ing as if he were held in leash all his life and denied expression in any direction. These are the outward experiences but they are generated by the inner nature, and until that changes he must suffer the whiplash of neces- sity. In the first place he has a tendency to crawl into a shell and shut himself in and others out. He is a pessimist and a kill-joy, has little or no regard for the feelings of others and is very obstinate. In the horo- scope of a woman such an aspect signifies marriage to one much older who will hold her with a very tight rein; it augurs death of the husband and of- ten several marriages which are ended by death or divorce. These configurations often bring legacies, but either there is trouble and litigation over the bequests, or the person squanders the estate after he receives it. If Saturn is in his exaltation sign, Libra, the latter part of the life may be better because the person may have taken the lessons of life to heart and mended his ways. JUPITER CONJUNCTION, PARALLEL, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO SUN. The conjunction gives a tendency to apoplexy, especially if it occurs in Aries, but with [PAGE 162]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS that exception we may say that these configurations are sure indications of health, wealth and happiness. They give the person an abundance of vitality which is proof against very sever onslaughts of disease, and even when par- ticularly unfavorable planetary influences succeed in breaking down his re- sistance, recovery will be so rapid as to seem miraculous. This nearly im- pregnable condition of health is all the more unassailable because it is"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"backed by a disposition at once SUNNY and JOVIAL and that latter character- istic also makes the fortunate possessors of these aspects beloved by all with whom they come in contact. Everybody is glad to see the person with the perpetual smile, but they do more than \"smile\"--they earn the friendship universally bestowed upon them by deeds of kindness, by words of sympathy, cheer or hope as the occasion may demand. They are trusted by everybody be- cause they never betray a trust. They have clear heads, good judgment and executive ability so that they are well fitted to help others. These char- acteristics also favor their own financial fortunes, so they accumulate wealth, but theirs is never \"tainted money;\" they never benefit by the loss of others. They are religiously conservative and may be aptly described as \"pillars of society.\" They shine particularly in government work. [PAGE 163]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE JUPITER SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO THE SUN is bad for the health because it gives a tendency to form bad habits. The person is far too fond of the so-called \"good things of life,\" and very selfish in supplying his own com- forts; he never exercises nor denies himself so the circulation becomes sluggish and as these people have a superabundance of blood this sluggish- ness is productive of various noxious growths and functional disorders; sometimes a fit of anger raises the blood pressure to such a point that a vessel bursts and ends the life or leaves the person henceforth a useless wreck. These aspects give a bombastic haughty dispositions with an inordinate love of display and thus induce extravagance both in social and business af- fairs with the result that the person sometimes finds himself involved in debt which he cannot pay and then it is but a step to the bankruptcy court. A false price often prevents these people from working honestly for others; they would rather prey upon the public as gamblers, followers of races and other so-called sports where there is an opportunity to swindle people and get what they call an \"easy\" living until they land in the meshes of the law. Children with these aspects should be given special training in self-restraint, thrift and honesty; they will have a tendency to scorn and [PAGE 164]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS scoff at religion, but perhaps the memory of a devout mother may help to keep them straight. MARS PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO SUN. The conjunction gives a tendency to fever, especially if it occurs in Aries, the sign which gov- erns the head, but it is curious that people with that configuration seem also to be able to endure a much higher temperature than others, and come unscathed through such a siege of sickness as would ordinarily prove fatal."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"With that exception these aspects all produce a super-abundance of vital en- ergy which assures their possessor of the most radiant health all through life, they strengthen the constitution and make the person able to endure the harder tasks, and give him a dauntless determination and courage to face the greatest odds. Given a plan to follow he may be trusted to overcome all physical obstacles for he has both executive and constructive ability to- gether with an indomitable will which refuses to recognize defeat. The dis- position is frank and open but blunt and often brusque; they are too in- tensely bent on whatever they want to do to waste time in politeness and suavity; they brush the conventionalities aside without compunction and are therefore not liked by people of too fine sensibilities; they are, however, men and women of action and the foremost factors in the world's work; but for their enterprise and energy the world would move much more slowly. [PAGE 165]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE Aspects to the Sun and Mars are absolutely necessary to give zest to life; even adverse aspects are better than none, for where these planets are unaspected the person is listless, vapid and he will never amount to any- thing no matter how good the figure may be in other respects. MARS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO THE SUN also endows the person with an abun- dance of energy and the faculty of leadership, but these are turned to pur- poses of deviltry and destruction. The courage implanted by the good as- pects becomes foolhardiness, the person has loud, overbearing, swaggering manner and is ready to fight at the drop of a hat, he is always in opposi- tion to constituted authority and ready to rebel wherever he sees a chance. He has an extremely fiery temper but holds no resentment. On account of these qualities he is universally disliked both by employers and his fellow-workers, is always in hot water and never stays long in any place for he is an agitator and trouble-maker. These aspects also dispose to acci- dents in which the person may be maimed, also to gunshot and knife-wounds, to scalding-burns and to fevers, inflammatory complaints, boils and erup- tions. [PAGE 166]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS URANUS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO THE SUN makes the person intuitive, original, in- ventive and independent in his manner of conduct and personal appearance, also with respect to food and certain mannerisms; he is what people call ec- centric, often conspicuous, yet not offensively so; given to pursuits and studies which people consider \"queer\" such as occultism and astrology, but also delving into the unknown after nature's secrets concerning electricity or the like. He often becomes a successful inventor if other aspects give the mechanical ability to work out his schemes. Uranus rules the ether and now that we are nearing the Aquarian age his vibrations will in increasing"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"measure bring to our ken methods of using nature's finer forces and the people with the Sun sextile or trine Uranus will be the media to attract and interpret them for us as the aerials and receivers in a wireless station collect and transcribe the messages carried by the ether waves to which they are attuned. The person often rises in life through the friendship of people above him in the social scale. He is of a very high-strung tem- perament but has himself well under control, and rarely shows temper or an- ger. He is an out and out idealist. URANUS PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SQUARE OR OPPOSITIONS TO SUN makes the person very high-strung, nervous and of uncontrolled emotions ready to fly into [PAGE 167]  THE SUN, GIVER OF LIFE hysteria on any or no provocation. It predisposes to all nervous disorders such as St. Vitus dance, epilepsy and lack of coordination. it makes him impulsive and unreliable, without regard for the conventionalities highly impatient of any human restraint upon his liberty and committed to the theory of affinities, soulmates, and free-love, hence an undesirable mar- riage partner and likely to figure in divorce proceedings or scandals of an even worse nature. There is also danger of trouble on account of connection with anarchistic plots where the inventive faculty may find scope in the construction of ex- plosives and infernal machines. Unless these aspects are modified by other configurations these people are among the most dangerous to society. They are liable to accidents from lightning and electricity, and all through life they meet disappointment in every direction. NEPTUNE SEXTILE OR TRINE TO THE SUN favors the possibility of developing the spiritual faculties, for he intensifies the spiritual vibrations in the aura. Many people with these configurations hear the harmony of the spheres and if Mercury, the lower octave of Neptune gives the requisite dexterity they become musicians of high inspirational nature. In others it breed love of the occult which leads them into the higher life but they usually [PAGE 168]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS approach it from the intellectual standpoint of psychic investigators; a few live the life and obtain first-hand knowledge. NEPTUNE CONJUNCTION, PARALLEL, SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO THE SUN also brings the person in touch with the denizens of the invisible world by raising the vibrations in his aura, but these configurations attract the undesirable el- ement such as met at the ordinary spiritualistic seance. In a watery sign Neptune induces the person to drink to excess and then the resulting accel-"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"eration of the vibratory rate frequently causes him to perceive the ugly, gruesome forms abounding in the lower realms of the invisible world, which are real elemental entities and not figments as believed by people who hear him tell what he sees during delirium tremens. These aspects also make the person liable to be swindled by sharpers and confidence men, and easily hoodwinked. It cannot be too strongly impressed upon readers and students that judgment is never to be formed on any planetary aspect or position apart from the balance of the horoscope. The unblended, basic nature of aspects is given so that students may recognize innate tendencies and be alert to overcome the evil and to cultivate the good. The free will of the individual can al- ways modify the horoscope, as pointed out on pages 58 and 59, and in Chapter XXII of this book. (\"A word to the wise.\"--EDITOR.) [PAGE 169]  VENUS, THE PLANET OF LOVE  CHAPTER IX  VENUS THE PLANET OF LOVE In the 13th Chapter of Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians we find a eulogy of \"love.\" The word used in the authorized version is \"charity,\" but it ought to be read as \"love.\" Love suffereth long and is kind, love vaunteth not herself, is not puffed up, believeth all things, endureth all things. . .Whether there be prophecies they shall fail, whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away.\" He concludes that in time FAITH and HOPE will pass away because we shall know the things in which we now have faith and our hopes will have been realized, but love, he contends, remains for- ever. The keynote of Venus is \"love,\" \"harmony,\" and \"rhythm,\" and if we want to know her nature we may profitably read that chapter and substitute \"Venus' for \"Love.\" Venus vaunteth not herself, is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, rejoices not in iniquity but in truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, endureth all things. These sayings are all true when applied to Venus for she furnishes the unifying bond between all members of the human family in whatever relationship they may be placed. It is the love-ray of Venus piercing deeply the heart of the mother which breeds in her the tender care wherewith she nourishes her offspring through helpless [PAGE 170]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS infancy. Venus sounds the love call of the youth and the maiden, gives and takes, smoothing out all the difficulties in the conjugal career. She is ever burning incense upon the altar of affection and from her garden of love comes the flowers which scent even the most sordid souls with celestial per-"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"fume and raise them for the time being to the stature of gods. But when Venus is afflicted, all these sublime qualities become tainted and take a hideous aspect according to the nature of their affliction. Squares and oppositions turn love to lust which makes the person revel in sensual gratification; the perception of beauty which expresses itself as art becomes slovenliness, the tendency to self-sacrifice, the giving of one- self for others is turned to selfishness and the person will then seem to use others to escape any task or effort not to his or her liking, laziness being one of the most prominent characteristics of an afflicted Venus. Being feminine, Venus never reaches out toward others, but exerts a mag- netic energy which draws them to her. Therefore she represents in a man's horoscope those of the opposite sex to whom the person is drawn, but in a woman's horoscope Venus describes the person's own attraction for the op- posite sex and Mars the masculine planet shows who will be attracted by her charms. Venus is essentially dignified in Taurus and Libra, and exalted in [PAGE 171]  VENUS, THE PLANET OF LOVE Pisces, and therefore her influence is most powerfully felt when she is placed in those signs. She is weak and afflicted when placed in either of the martial signs, Aries or Scorpio, where she is in her fall, or when she is i the mercurial sign, Virgo. The best House position for her is the Sev- enth where her influence will make the marriage serene and blissful.  VENUS IN THE TWELVE HOUSES VENUS IN THE FIRST HOUSE has a tendency to spread sunshine over the child's home and make the early life happy. It gives an amiable character so that the person is well liked because of his social nature and friendly disposi- tion. It brings out the love of music, art and a desire for pleasure. This is what may be called \"a lucky position\" for it makes the person very at- tractive to all with whom he or she comes in contact and in that way it tends to give general success in life. It is also very good for the general health. VENUS IN THE SECOND HOUSE is an indication of financial success in life. People with Venus in this position are usually very popular and are thus helped by their friends to lucrative positions. At the same time this posi- tion makes the person very wasteful and prodigal so that it tends to make him spend more then he earns. The money is usually squandered on [PAGE 172]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"pleasure, dress and ornaments for self by a woman and for an amour by a man, and not infrequently leads to abuses which undermine the health. This position also shows gain by dealing in things ruled by Venus, such as dress goods, jewelry, music, etc. VENUS IN THE THIRD HOUSE has a particularly beneficial effect upon the mind, making the person cheerful, optimistic and inclined to look at everything from the bright side of life. It gives a love of music, art, literature and everything that has a refining influence, and unusual facility for express- ing one's self in a happy, appropriate manner, either in speech or writing. It gives love of travel; the person will enjoy himself on his journeys and benefit by them. It also makes relations with brothers and sisters and neighbors and the people in one's immediate environment congenial. VENUS IN THE FOURTH HOUSE shows happy conditions in the home, particularly in the latter part of life. It also indicates that an inheritance may be left to the person and that if he owns houses or lands he will gain much by them. VENUS IN THE FIFTH HOUSE makes the person unusually affectionate and as a result he or she usually experiences a number of love affairs all of which [PAGE 173]  VENUS, THE PLANET OF LOVE run their courses smoothly. In indicates that the marriage will be fruitful and production of lovely and loving children. It is a fortunate position for teachers and people connect with education institutions, also for those engaged in publication of literature and for gain by speculation in stocks or similar securities. VENUS IN THE SIXTH HOUSE gives the person faithful servants who will work for his interest if he is an employer. If he is an employee, it will make him well liked by his employers and fellow-workers. It is a fairly good po- sition for health provided the person does not abuse it. That is to say, the constitution is harmonious, but not very strong. If the health is guarded with care it will remain in good condition for life, but a very little abuse may turn the scales the other way and make the person an in- valid. VENUS IN THE SEVENTH HOUSE is one of the surest signs of domestic felicity. It signifies an early marriage and an increase of prosperity after that event. If the person finds it expedient to enter into partnership on a business basis the presence of Venus tends to make this relationship harmo- nious and beneficial. It is also a good sign that if litigation seems"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"[PAGE 174]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS necessary some way will be found to settle the matter without actual rup- ture. This position is good for actors, singers, and others whose calling brings them before the public in a vocal capacity for it ensures a kind and sympathetic reception on the part of their audience. VENUS IN THE EIGHTH HOUSE will bring gain by marriage, partnership or legacy if it is well aspected, but if it is afflicted it brings loss and disap- pointment in love, or an extravagant marriage partner, and legal trouble over a will. VENUS IN THE NINTH HOUSE is a very fortunate position if Venus is well aspected, for being so highly elevated here it exercises considerable influ- ence in life and makes the disposition exceedingly kind, sympathetic and helpful so that by these qualities the person becomes much esteemed and sought after, particularly in charitable or religious work, for this posi- tion also brings out the devotional side of the nature. It gives a love of music, art and drama as well as everything that has an influence for soul upliftment. Whenever the person journeys from one place to another for gain or for pleasure. Venus in the Ninth House will smooth the path before him and make his trip thoroughly enjoyable. If Venus is afflicted in the Ninth House the person will long to do or to be all the foregoing things, but [PAGE 175]  VENUS, THE PLANET OF LOVE will find it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible to accomplish his de- sire. VENUS IN THE TENTH HOUSE is one of the best signs of general success in the life when well aspected. The person who has this position becomes very popular, particularly with the opposite sex, and will rise in the social scale through marriage. It gives an ability to avoid trouble in life and extract from it all the pleasure there is in every situation. Comfortable financial circumstances attend upon the person all through life and foster a general attitude of optimism. When Venus is afflicted in the Tenth House the person is looked down on by those in his social environment and though he tries to ingratiate himself with those who are in the charmed circles, he will find himself left with snubs and insults. A hasty or ill-considered marriage is apt to make matters worse and bring him farther into disrepute, as a scapegrace. VENUS IN THE ELEVENTH HOUSE if well-aspected brings to the person hosts of friends who are willing and anxious to aid him in the realization of his hopes, wishes and desires, but it depends upon the nature and character of the sign wherein Venus is placed as well as on the strength of the aspects whether they will be able to do so or not. For instance, if Venus is in the"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"[PAGE 176]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Eleventh House in Aries or Scorpio, one of the martial signs where she is weak, and aspected only by sextiles from Mercury and the Moon, very little help can be expected of her compared to what she will give if she is in her own signs, Taurus or Libra, and aspected by trines from the Sun and Jupiter. In the case first cited, the friends drawn to the person may be ever so sin- cere in their wish to help but will not have the ability. In the latter case they will exert powerful influence and will accomplish wonders. If Ve- nus is afflicted in the Eleventh House it is very often found that the per- son attracts friends who impose upon him and use him for their own objects and when they have so used him to the fullest extend and he cannot serve their purpose any longer they throw him aside. VENUS IN THE TWELFTH HOUSE if well-aspected indicates that the person will benefit from the things signified by this House, viz., occupations connected with prisons, hospitals or charitable institutions, or by work in a chemical laboratory or by some such secluded occupation where he does not come in touch with the public. It also favors study and practice of the occult and gives a tendency to secret, clandestine love affairs which will probably run smoothly if Venus is well-aspected, but if she is weak by sign, or afflicted in the Twelfth House she will cause trouble through jealousy, divorce and [PAGE 177]  VENUS, THE PLANET OF LOVE scandal, or sickness in confinement on account of over-indulgence of the passions, particularly if Venus is in Scorpio which governs the generative organs, or in Taurus which gives the same effect by reflex action, where it signifies self-abuse.  VENUS IN THE TWELVE SIGNS VENUS IN ARIES lends ardors to the affection of Venus by blending them with the fire of Mars who is ruler of Aries and for that reason it makes the per- son very ardent in the expression of affection. This usually leads to popularity especially among the opposite sex and often results in a hasty marriage, but that kind of love is not and cannot be lasting. Eventually the fire of passion burns out the love and marriages brought about by this position are then fruitful sources of domestic unhappiness. This position also inclines the person to be rash and impulsive whenever his sympathies are appealed to, so that he often helps an unworthy cause. Venus in Aries also inclines the person to general extravagance in his expenditures. VENUS IN TAURUS is a splendid position for there she is essentially digni- fied and much stronger than in the other signs with the exception of Libra"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"[PAGE 178]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS and Pisces where she is respectively dignified and exalted. It is a very favorable position for financial affairs, especially gains derived through the person's own efforts in whatever vocation in life he may have chosen. It gives a friendly and sociable disposition with the ability to inspire re- ciprocal feelings in others. People with Venus in Taurus are very set in their opinions concerning correct form and decorum, correct in speech and once they have formed an opinion they hold to it very tenaciously. They are generous but not extravagant. VENUS IN GEMINI blends the beauty of Venus with the mercurial ability to ex- press so that people who have this configuration are able to choose their words with singular facility and infuse in them a rhythm which is like music to the ears of a listener. Therefore this is one of the positions which make poets, provided of course that other indications in the horoscope sup- port, for it should always be remembered by the student that no single as- pect or position is in itself sufficient to mark a prominent characteristic. To do this the whole horoscope must be blended. This position has a very refining influence on the mind, inclining to a literary or artistic career. It makes the person beloved of his brothers and sisters, neighbors and other people in his immediate environment. This position also inclines to [PAGE 179]  VENUS, THE PLANET OF LOVE marriage and frequently to more than one union. It favors traveling both for gain and pleasure, especially short journeys. VENUS IN CANCER blends the characteristics of Venus with those of the Moon and the psychic watery nature of Cancer. Therefore this position gives the person a very fruitful imagination and he or she is very part to come in touch with the inhabitants of the unseen world or at least take up some very devotional phase of religion; but this is dangerous because Venus is negative, attracting without selecting or discriminating hence makes liable to domination by spirit controls and the dangers of mediumship. VENUS IN LEO is compounding love, for Leo rules the heart and whoever has this position will be tender-hearted to a degree. Contrary to the commonly accepted ideas there is a cruel streak in Leo, but when Venus is there, there is no more loving and tender sign in the zodiac, besides being that Leo is a fixed sign Venus in this position makes for an unparalleled asser- tion of the affections when once they have been placed and an unswerving loyalty to the object thereof. Being that Leo is the fifth sign Venus in Leo also gives success in entertainment or educational enterprises and the blending of the Venus ray with the solar brings favor from those above the"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"[PAGE 180]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS person in the social scale. VENUS IN VIRGO, the Sixth House sign gives the person a deep and tender sym- pathy for the sick and people with this position make good nurses. This po- sition also favors occupation as a chemist, or a dietitian who is concerned with the preparation of foods for the maintenance or attainment of health. If the person has employees or subordinates under his management his rela- tions with those people will always be very pleasant, and they will serve him well. VENUS IN LIBRA, the Seventh House sign is essentially dignified and strong, This is one of the positions which testify to a fruitful and congenial mar- riage or successful partnership. It gives musical or artistic ability and makes the person popular in public life. If engaged as a speaker or singer it ensures an appreciate audience whenever he appears in public. VENUS IN SCORPIO is the worst position of all in which she may be placed, for here again the love ray of Venus blends with the martial fire of passion in the sign governing the genitals so that if there are no other redeeming and restraining influences in the horoscope love turns to lust and the un- bridled gratification of an exaggerated sexual desire, especially if the [PAGE 181]  VENUS, THE PLANET OF LOVE Moon or Mars are there. This is apt to undermine the constitution and though that may not be apparent for a long time the effect of such a sapping of the vitality will some time be felt and cause a general breakdown, but that, of course, is nothing compared with the moral effect of the practices indicated by this passion. It should be said furthermore for the benefit of those who have this position that it does not matter whether such abuses take place in wedlock or not; Nature does not care whether they have been legalized by man-made law or not. From her standpoint they are a violation of the law of life and will be punished whether sanctioned by society or not. This position also gives a love of luxury and anything that stirs the emotions or wherein the senses may revel. Curiously enough it also some- times gives a sense of deep religious devotion which them serves as an out- let for the overcharged feelings of the native. This position also creates jealousy and trouble in marriage and the reputation of the person is apt to be smirched. A well-aspected Venus in Scorpio is liable to bring a legacy. VENUS IN SAGITTARIUS. This is another of her strongest positions for there her qualities blend with those of Jupiter, the planet of benevolence, to foster love and good-will among men. Therefore also this position indicates"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"[PAGE 182]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS a genial and optimistic disposition, a sympathetic, kind and generous heart, a love of God expressed in religious devotion, or love of man shown by phi- lanthropy and charity. It indicates a refined mind, cultured, and fond of drama, art and music. It fosters the imagination and intuition and like the other double-bodies signs Gemini and Pisces, it inclines to plurality of marriages. VENUS IN CAPRICON, the Tenth House sign, gives social success and popular- ity, but Venus does not blend well with Saturn, the ruler of Capricorn. There is therefore a slight tendency to melancholy in people who have Venus in that position, Nor are they ever secure in the favors which they receive from other people or in their popularity, for Saturn has a tendency to throw them down when they have reached the highest pinnacle. Therefore, though this influence may help them to climb the ladder of advancement in social circles or in business they are never safe in their position. This influ- ence makes a person very jealous of honor and he takes it to heart when sometimes Saturn throws him down. Venus in Saturn's sign often causes the person to disregard the fact that disparity in ages is so fatal to happiness in marriage and hence if he marries young he takes someone who is much older than himself for a partner or if married in later years he selects someone [PAGE 183]  VENUS, THE PLANET OF LOVE who is still in the bloom of youth with the almost inevitable result that disagreement and dissolution of the marriage tie take place in the course of a few years. Frequently also people with this position of Venus marry for business or as a matter of convenience. In short Venus never reaches her legitimate expression of love in Saturn's House and therefore such unions are always a source of sorrow and disappointment to the contracting parties. VENUS IN AQUARIUS indicates a blending of the Uranian qualities, indepen- dence, impatience of restraint, disregard of convention, desire for originality, uncompromising sincerity and intuition, with those of Venus and as a result we find that people with this position refuse to be bound by the usual restrictive rules of society in their love affairs and follow their heart's inclination regardless of what others may say or think. They are firm believers in the theory of soul-mates, affinities, et cetera, and li- able to act in the most unexpected manner with such startling suddenness that neither they nor anyone else are able to foresee what they may say or do next. But at the same time they are so loving and sincere in their con- victions that friends never fail them and whatever success they attain in"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"[PAGE 184]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS life is usually due to the efforts of friends to help them to realize their hopes, wishes and aspirations. VENUS IN PISCES is in her own exaltation sign where she again blends with the benefic ray of Jupiter and as Pisces is a watery sign this position sig- nifies a powerful emotional nature, subdued and toned down by the element of sorrow inherent in the twelfth house sign. This position therefore indi- cates someone capable of feeling a sentiment such as that felt by our Savior when He said: \"Come unto Me all ye that are weak and heavy laden and I will give you rest.\" Thus Venus in Pisces indicates a nature yearning and aching to assist those who are afflicted by bodily ills or suffering from sorrow. This position also gives an intense love of music and when other testimonies concur, considerable ability to express either vocally or instrumentally, for music is the most wonderful outlet for the deepest emotions of which the human soul is capable. People with Venus in Pisces are especially liable to financial imposition on the part of others and trouble through an illegal marriage. [PAGE 185]  VENUS, THE PLANET OF LOVE VENUS IN ASPECT WITH OTHER PLANETS THE SUN PARALLEL OR CONJUNCTION VENUS calls out the artistic side of the nature, making the person fond of music, art and poetry. It also strength- ens the love-nature and if the configuration occurs in the seventh house it is a positive testimony of unalloyed marital bliss. In the second or eighth house it leads to extravagance of the person or his mate, in Scorpio it is not good for the morals and in Pisces it leads to intemperance, but gener- ally speaking, these aspects strengthen the constitution, increase the popularity and make social intercourse smooth so that the person finds many friends and keeps them. As the orbit of Venus is so small she never forms the sextile, trine, square or opposition to the Sun. MERCURY CONJUNCTION, PARALLEL OR SEXTILE TO VENUS (Note.--Venus and Mer- cury are never more than 76 degrees apart, therefore they can only form the conjunctions, parallels and sextiles, but not the trine, square nor opposi- tion.) These aspects make the person cheerful and companionable with a good-natured disposition and a desire for society. They also give the abil- ity for music and poetry, especially if in the Ascendant and are a general indication of success in salesmanship, for such people are suave, affable"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"[PAGE 186]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS and persuasive. THE MOON CONJUNCTION, PARALLEL, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO VENUS. The Moon is significator of marriage for a man and therefore the good aspects between Venus, the planet of love, and the Moon are good indications of a happy mar- riage when they occur in a man's horoscope. But in a woman's horoscope these aspects operate upon the health, for the Moon is the planet of fecun- dity and has rule over the female functions in particular which are so large a factor in the health of a woman; this latter is much strengthened by the good aspects of the Moon and Venus. These aspects make the person an orator with a fruitful imagination; give love of pleasure, music and art, and an engaging personality, very attractive to the opposite sex, because kindly, affectionate and sympathetic. They tend to general success in life and the person usually has sufficient for the day and the way. THE MOON SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO VENUS is an indication of trouble in marriage for a man, because the wife described by an afflicted Venus will be slovenly and of dissolute habits which will destroy domestic happiness. In a woman's horoscope it indicates disturbance of the female functions and it also gives a tendency to digestive troubles and poor circulation when in the [PAGE 187]  VENUS, THE PLANET OF LOVE horoscope of either sex. These aspects also give a liability to trouble through slander and public scandal. SATURN SEXTILE OR TRINE TO VENUS. The good qualities of Venus are love and affection and the good qualities of Saturn are tact, diplomacy, method, system, justice, thrift and economy. We may therefore judge that when these two planets are configurated in good aspect they make the person faithful and true, just and methodical, qualities which make for success in all de- partments of life. Therefore a person with these aspects will be much sought as a friend or advisor, or as a person to be trusted with any commis- sion requiring sterling honesty and ability. They make the person simple in his tastes and of impeachable morality, and give honor, esteem, health and easy circumstances. SATURN PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO VENUS brings out the evil qualities of the two planets and troubles which are thus generated usually come through the person's relations with the opposite sex. It makes him underhanded and scheming to gratify his passions often in an unusual manner and his perverted desires are usually directed against some one who is much younger than himself. If regular marriage relations are entered into, such a person is usually a demon of jealousy who makes life a burden"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"[PAGE 188]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS for the marriage partner on account of his suspicious nature. People with these afflictions are also stingy in all money matters and exceedingly avaricious. They have poor business judgment and are therefore liable to losses, failure and bankruptcy. JUPITER PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO VENUS is one of the nest signs of success and general good fortune. It favors the accumulation of wealth and the enjoyment of all the luxuries of life. It is a good indi- cation of a successful and happy marriage, social prestige and the respect of all whom the person comes in contact. It gives the person a jovial, op- timistic, generous and large-hearted disposition, and makes hospitable to a degree; interested and active in philanthropic measures, a liberal mind tol- erant of the views of others even where he differs radically, fond of plea- sure, traveling parties, and capable of enjoying life to the fullest extent. These aspects also give talent for music, especially if either planet is in Pisces. JUPITER SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO VENUS gives the same luxurious likings as the good aspects, but limits the ability to satisfy them; although such people make the most frantic efforts to present a fine front to the world, they are generally found out to be shams. Their lack of business ability is often responsible for failure and bankruptcy and they are very liable to [PAGE 189]  VENUS, THE PLANET OF LOVE suffer losses through the treachery of others. Love and marriage also are sources of sorrow for those whom Venus and Jupiter are afflicting. They are apt to be jilted before marriage or the marriage partner may prove faithless and may abscound. These aspects also produce and amorous nature likely to take liberties regardless of the laws of decency and to be faithless to mar- riage vows. They make people extremely self-indulgent and in Pisces they predispose to drink. MARS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO VENUS will give an ambitious, aspiring and ad- venturous nature, amorous and extremely demonstrative in its affection, very fond of sports and pleasures. It gives the person an abundance of energy and business acumen, consequently he has a splendid earning capacity but he wastes money for he loves above all things to make a great outward show and display. Being a free spender he is also very popular among his associates, and being, as already said, of an amorous nature he marries either very early or the marriage is a very hasty one. MARS CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO VENUS does not always operate in the same"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"manner, but is to be classed as a good or bad aspect according to circum- stances and the matter to be judged. For instance, Mars conjunction Venus makes the person less blunt and domineering, more kind and polite; it is [PAGE 190]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS therefore good in that respect; but the conjunction also strengthens he pas- sional nature, especially if it occurs in Scorpio; and in the Twelfth House it leads to self-abuse so that in those cases it is decidedly bad. MARS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION VENUS. See page 330. URANUS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO VENUS makes the person mentally alert, of quick intuitive perception and exceedingly magnetic, especially to the opposite sex; and he also attracts hosts of friends who will be a benefit and assis- tance to him. These aspects give love of art, music and poetry and are fa- vorable indications of a happy marriage often at a very early age, or one suddenly consummated. They also sometimes bring the person love of a pla- tonic nature. URANUS CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO VENUS. There is a doubt as to whether these aspects should be classed as good or evil, which must be settled in the individual horoscope where they occur for they may work either way, de- pending upon the other configuration. If Venus is otherwise afflicted in the horoscope, for instance the conjunction or parallel will further accen- tuate her evil qualities, but if she is well placed or aspected Uranus will bring out the nobler side. [PAGE 191]  VENUS, THE PLANET OF LOVE URANUS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO VENUS. The square or opposition always brings trouble through the sex relation: a hasty, ill-considered union, quarrels, divorces, public scandals through clandestine intercourse and kin- dred irregularities, with loss of friend, prestige and popularity, exile from home and family and sudden financial losses through unexpected or un- foreseen happenings. There is a general lack of balance, an erratic person- ality. NEPTUNE SEXTILE OR TRINE TO VENUS makes an inspirational musician. It gives a fertile imagination and deep emotions, a nature that is pure and chaste, hence occasionally it leads to platonic unions and companionship of the most esthetic nature. NEPTUNE CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO VENUS is to be judged on the same line as indicated in the case of Mars and Uranus.

People with these aspects should be particularly careful to avoid anything which has in it an element of chance or speculation, for they are sure to lose, especially in dealing with large companies or corpora- tions."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"[PAGE 192]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CHAPTER X  MERCURY, THE PLANET OF REASON Mythologically Mercury is represented as a \"Messenger of the Gods\" and this is the line with the occult facts, for when infant humanity had been led astray by the marital Lucifer spirits and had fallen into GENERATION it became necessary for the other divine hierarchies to take steps looking to a future REGENERATION and to further that object the Lords of Venus were brought to the earth to educate humanity in such a manner that love might be substituted for lust and men might thus be induced to aspire to something higher. While the Lords of Venus dealt with mankind in general the most precocious among them were taken in hand by the Lords of Mercury; whose wisdom-teaching is symbolically represented by the caduceus or \"STAFF OF MERCURY,\" consisting of two serpents twining around a rod and indication the solution of the riddle of life, or \"Whence have we come, why are we here, and whither are we bound?\" showing the pupil the spiral path of INVOLUTION by which the divine spark has buried itself in matter, also the spiral path of EVOLUTION by which humanity will eventually again reach the Father's bo- som, and the short road of INITIATION represented by the central rod around [PAGE 193]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS which the serpents twine. But to understand these Mysteries requires mind and reason. Mercury then is the mental educator of men and its place and position in the horoscope shows the status of the person's mind for whom it is cast. Being the Messenger of the Gods to the other planets Mercury has no voice of its own and is even more dependent for expression upon the aspects of other planets than the Moon which rules the instinctual mind. So Mercury is really a focus through which the faculty of reason finds expression in the human being to act as a brake upon the lower nature and assist in lifting us from the human to the divine. Many may and do feel deeply, they may also have valuable knowledge, but they will be unable to express their feelings or shore their knowledge with others if Mercury is lacking in aspects. Even a so-called evil aspect of Mercury helps to bring out what is within and is therefore better than none. When Mercury is so placed in relation to the Sun it goes BEFORE the lumi- nary it has the effect of materially brightening the mind, for the Sun rep- resents the Ego and it may therefore be said that then its path is illumi- nated by the lamp of reason. On the other hand if Mercury is so placed that it rises later than the Sun and thus follows AFTER the luminary The Ego learns more by afterthought than by forethought for it walks comparatively"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"[PAGE 194]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS speaking in the dark and must learn a great many of its lessons by experi- ence. As we have found that it is difficult for a number of young students to determine when Mercury goes before or after the Sun we may say in farther elucidation of that subject: When Mercury is in a lower degree of the same sign as the Sun or in any degree of the previous sign then as a matter of course he rises BEFORE the Sun. To illustrate: If the Sun is in twenty degrees of Cancer and Mercury is in five, ten or fifteen degrees of that sign or if he is in any degree of Gemini, then he rises BEFORE the Sun. But if he is in twenty-five degrees of Cancer which is a higher degree of the same sign, or if he is in any degree in Leo which is the sign succeeding Cancer, then he rises AFTER the Sun and loses part of his good influence. A retrograde Mercury is also a detriment to the faculty of reason. But in the year of life when Mercury by progression again turns direct, the rea- soning faculties will improve correspondingly. Mercury is strong in the airy signs, Gemini, Libra and Aquarius, but he is exalted and therefore most powerful in Virgo. Mercury has special rule over agents and messengers, salesmen, postmen and other common carriers, people engaged in advertising or printing, literary men, writers, reporters, secretaries, clerks, steno- graphers and typewriters, commission men and other middle men, demagogues, confidence-men and thieves. [PAGE 195]  MERCURY THE PLANET OF REASON  MERCURY IN THE TWELFTH HOUSE MERCURY IN THE ASCENDANT, OR FIRST HOUSE makes the person quick-witted and sharp according to the nature of the sign rising and the aspects of the planets which he receives. The fiery signs and the airy signs have the strongest influence in that respect. In Aries or Leo he is more impulsive than when rising in Sagittarius, but Gemini, Libra and Aquarius are best. When Mercury is rising in the watery signs Cancer or Pisces the intellect is dull, but rising in Scorpio where it is fired by the martial energy and armed with the venomous sting of the scorpion it has a somewhat similar in- fluence to that of Mars in Scorpio through not quite so pronounced. MERCURY IN THE SECOND HOUSE is good for gain through mercurial occupa- tions especially where the person is employed by someone else so that he ap- pears in a true mercurial capacity as agent, messenger, clerk, writer or"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"whatever else. MERCURY IN THE THIRD HOUSE and well-aspected has wonderful influence on the mental qualities of the native. It makes the mind serene and optimis- tic, inclined to study and research work. It gives fluency as a speaker and success by short journeys or travel and makes the relations of the person harmonious with his brothers. When Mercury is afflicted in the Third House [PAGE 196]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS it inclines to worry and pessimism, trouble and annoyance with sisters and brothers and when on short journeys. MERCURY IN THE FOURTH HOUSE gives instability to home conditions. It signifies the homeless wanderer who is always moving from place to place un- less a good aspect to Saturn comes in to steady him down. This is, however, a good aspect for people engaged in mercurial occupations which require a stationary residence, such as librarian, or literary men engaged in newspa- per work, employees in printing establishments, commission houses, agencies and kindred organizations. If Mercury is afflicted by Saturn the home con- ditions of the person will cause him a great deal of worry. MERCURY IN THE FIFTH HOUSE centers the mind upon education, amusements, courtships and children. If Mercury is well-aspected by Saturn or Jupiter it gives depth to the mind and makes the person successful in enterprises connected with education, publishing or public amusements. Good aspects from Mars or Venus give success in courtship but the adverse aspects of the planets make the person cruel; he is inconstant in affection toward those he professes to love, inclined to worry over affairs of his children, and su- perficial as a teacher. A good aspect from the Sun is an excellent indica- [PAGE 197]  MERCURY THE PLANET OF REASON tion of success in a government position, in an educational capacity. MERCURY IN THE SIXTH HOUSE makes the mentality too active for the person's own good, for he is extremely ambitious and therefore liable to over-tax himself to the detriment of his health, and the disability of the nervous system is most likely to express itself by a digestive disorder in the region governed by Virgo, the sixth sign, viz., the intestines. Such people are supersensitive to the conditions of others which affects their health bringing much trouble and worry in dealing with servants and subordi- nates. They are fond of the study of hygiene and diet and meet with consid- erable success in the practice of the chemistry of foods, particularly if Mercury is well-aspected. Adverse aspects of Saturn to a Sixth House Mer- cury make a chronic invalid of a most melancholy mind. The adverse aspects"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"of Mars and Uranus are fruitful sources of suicide through brooding over disease. MERCURY IN THE SEVENTH HOUSE and well-aspected makes the person popular in literary and scientific circles. It is a good position for public speak- ers and all who are engaged in mercurial activities of a public nature. But if Mercury is afflicted the Seventh House position brings a great deal of hostile criticism of a public nature and is liable to involve the person in [PAGE 198]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS litigation either to defend himself against libel from others or on account of libel committed by himself. A well-aspected Mercury in the Seventh House indicates a successful marriage to a relative or an employee, but when Mer- cury is afflicted either the person or the marriage partner is of a nagging nature so that the married life is spoiled by constant quarrels and disputes on account of fickleness and faithfulness. MERCURY IN THE EIGHTH HOUSE when well-aspected gives gain through liter- ary or scientific agencies, occupations or other mercurial pursuits provided they are carried on in partnership with someone else. This position also indicates that the person may receive a legacy and it is a good indication of the financial success of the marriage, but if Mercury is afflicted its position in the Eighth House indicates financial troubles for the marriage partner and litigation probably in connection with a legacy left to the na- tive. MERCURY IN THE NINTH HOUSE and well-aspected gives love of religion, science, letters and law, a studious mind capable of delving deeply into profound problems of life and being, philosophic and philanthropic tenden- cies, and desire to travel far if need be in the pursuit of knowledge. This position gives facility in speech and writing and success in religion, phi- losophy, law or science. The mind is broad, flexible and adaptable, there- [PAGE 199]  MERCURY THE PLANET OF REASON fore the person is liable to change his views several times in his life on the various subjects which he has studied, but there will always be a good reason for adopting another viewpoint. If Mercury is afflicted in the Ninth House he makes the person exceed- ingly unstable of mind, changeable as a weather vane in all his pursuits and activities. Such a person will never stay by anything long enough to try it out and therefore he will meet with a series of disasters all through life. Probably he may journey from one place to another in search of success but he will never find it until he learns to concentrate his energies upon one"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"thing. This position is also a fruitful source of trouble with the law or legal affairs. MERCURY IN THE TENTH HOUSE, well-aspected, shows adaptability and re- sourcefulness such as enable the person to cope with all the contingencies of life. It makes a successful lecturer, publisher or writer and is also favorable to success in one of the occult occupations. If Mercury is placed in one of the airy signs the power of expression is much enhanced. Fre- quently people with Mercury in this position have several occupations, but usually they succeed best in a subordinate capacity. MERCURY IN THE ELEVENTH HOUSE brings a great many acquaintances among literary, scientific or other mercurial people but none of them are [PAGE 200]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS sufficiently steadfast to be relied upon unless Mercury is very well-aspected. This position has a tendency to make a person critical and cynical. It sharpens his intellect, however, and gives him a good flow of language. MERCURY IN THE TWELFTH HOUSE, if well aspected gives a mind peculiarly fitted to delve into the mysterious, occult or secret things. This is espe- cially the case if Mercury is between the Sun and Midheaven, that is to say if Mercury goes BEFORE the Sun or rises earlier than that luminary, for then all the light that is in the spirit seems to shine forth and make the person intellectually keen and bright. Therefore this is a good position for de- tective work as well as scientific or occult research work. Chemists of great ability have been produced under this aspect for such people have the faculty of going into the most minute details in things which seem micro- scopic and unimportant to others. When Mercury is in the Twelfth House and afflicted, especially by Saturn or Mars, also when COMBUST or BEHIND THE SUN there is a danger that the mind may become clouded and insanity may result. It may also be noted that the affliction will vary according to the way Mer- cury is aspected; if by Mars or Uranus the subject may be exceedingly violent, if by Saturn he will become melancholy, but whatever the cause, if [PAGE 201]  MERCURY THE PLANET OF REASON Mercury is afflicted in the Twelfth House some form of limitation will re- strain the spirit, for the Twelfth House is the house of limitation and con- finement. Deafness is also the result of this position of Mercury when severely af- flicted by Saturn."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"  MERCURY IN THE TWELVE SIGNS MERCURY IN ARIES makes the person very argumentative, fond of disputes, quick at repartee, with a tendency to exaggerate though not necessarily by design. If well-aspected he is broad minded and tolerant of the opinions of others, of a studious nature, quick to grasp situations and ideas, neat and orderly. When afflicted Mercury in Aries makes people leap before they look, the mind is vacillating and there is a general recklessness about the person who is thus very unreliable and devoid of all sense of responsibil- ity. MERCURY IN TAURUS gives a mind that is not very soon made up but when it has once arrive at a conclusion it is almost as difficult to change as the laws of the Medes and Persians. However, being based upon thought and rea- son the judgment of these people is also extremely reliable. They believe thoroughly in the ancient adage that \"Silence is golden\" and are therefore [PAGE 202]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS close-mouthed. They are good counselors and can be depended upon to keep secret. At the same time they are not recluses, but have a pleasant, socia- ble disposition. They are fond of fun and recreation, they love music, art and literature, so they are thoroughly likable people if Mercury is well- aspected. But if Mercury is afflicted they become what the Scotch call \"DOUR,\" also obstinate, stubborn, secretive and avaricious. MERCURY IN GEMINI makes a person fond of change and travel. He is al- ways ready to investigate some new thing, or go to some other place for a change; in short, almost anything that is new appeals to him. At the same time if Mercury is well-fortified such people gain greatly by this fluidic state of the mind for they are shrewd and penetrating in their judgment so that they know good value when they see it and are not prejudiced by precon- ceived, set opinions. Therefore they are good business men and their abil- ity to see a point makes them particularly good lawyers. They also succeed well as traveling salesmen. MERCURY IN CANCER gives a clear intellect, a good memory and superlative adaptability. People with this position fit into any place or occupation they may find and adapt themselves to the opinions and ideas of others. They love praise and flattery, therefore they are careful not to do anything [PAGE 203]  MERCURY THE PLANET OF REASON whereby they may forfeit the good opinion of others. MERCURY IN LEO gives high ideals and aspirations, a positive, strong and"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"persevering intellect which scorns to stoop to low and mean acts, and de- spises equivocation; is blunt and out-spoken, quick-tempered, but kind-hearted and sympathetic. People with Mercury in Leo well-fortified have good organizing ability and make capable leaders. They love children and are also fond of pleasure. When Mercury is afflicted in Leo it makes the person fickle and inconstant in his affections, an unsuccessful gambler and speculator, a low and sensual nature. MERCURY IN VIRGO is at the zenith of his power for there he is exalted, consequently when well-aspected it gives a clear, logical, scientific mind, eloquence and the ability to express oneself fluently in a number of lan- guages. It gives the person a comprehensive, discriminating outlook upon life, his conclusions are usually practical and to the point because he also, like the Taurian Mercury, looks before he leaps. In short this char- acteristic is in a degree true of all the earthy signs. When Mercury is af- flicted in Virgo it makes the man irritable, petulant and selfish, always looking for flaws in everything he comes across. People with Mercury in [PAGE 204]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Virgo make excellent dietitians and chemists. They also have an unusual dexterity. MERCURY IN LIBRA, when well-aspected gives a broad, well-balanced mind with a love of art and music and an uncommon ability of expression. It brings success as a public speaker and sometimes as a singer. When Mercury is afflicted in Libra it indicates trouble by lawsuits through partnerships and an unfaithful marriage partner. MERCURY IN SCORPIO gives a shrewd mind, a keen aspiration, a quick wit and a sharp tongue with biting sarcasm that can sting like the scorpion. The disposition is bold and stubborn, headstrong and difficult to get along wit. But these people are extremely resourceful, dauntless, and able to overcome difficulties which would crush others. They are attracted to the occult, a a needle is drawn to a magnet. When Mercury is afflicted they are subject to disappointment in everything they undertake, quarrelsome, skepti- cal and cynical, always holding opposite views to others. MERCURY IN SAGITTARIUS. Though in detriment it is still a strong posi- tion of Mercury and if he is well-aspected it gives an exceedingly noble mind of a religious and philosophical turn, a mind which scorns the shackles of conventions where they interfere with freedom of thought and speech yet [PAGE 205]  MERCURY THE PLANET OF REASON does not fly into paths that are contrary to the commonly accepted standards"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"of moral usage and conduct. It always confines itself within the boundaries of law and order and people with Mercury in this position are therefore greatly respected in the community. Mercury in Sagittarius makes the person fond of travel to see the sights and scenery of nature and to investigate the customs of strange people. He is also fond of animals and pets. When afflicted it inclines to lawlessness, dishonesty, sophism and a twisted character. MERCURY IN CAPRICORN gives a critical and penetrating but somewhat sus- picious mind with a thoughtful and diplomatic disposition, These people make splendid spies and detectives, having the ability to ferret out secrets in the most uncanny manner. They also have the persistence of Saturnians derived from the sign Capricorn so that they never give up until their ob- ject has been attained. This position gives a love of science, par- ticularly chemistry. These people are much attracted to the occult, yet are practical and very thrifty. They hold on to what they get and always have something for a rainy day. When afflicted Mercury in Capricorn makes the person miserly, cruel, hard, malicious, vindictive and spiteful. [PAGE 206]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS MERCURY IN AQUARIUS gives the Uranian qualities of originality and inde- pendence and an unconquerable love of liberty to the mind so that people with Mercury in this position are apt to repudiate all the social conven- tions and live according to their highly idealistic conceptions. They often take no heed of fashion, and dress in a style entirely their own. They ad- vocate ideas on social subjects which are a thousand years ahead of the world's development, among them the theory of soul-mates and affinities which is causing so much trouble in the world today because it advocates have not yet grown to the spiritual stature where they can separate it from sex and live the true Uranian love-life which is altogether spiritual. The foregoing delineations apply particularly where Mercury is aspected by Uranus and the people described by them are the extreme product of Mercury in Aquarius. All who have this position, however, are very intellectual, they have high ideals and aspirations, a love of popular science and math- ematics and are usually attracted to the occult sciences also, especially to astrology, for they have a fine faculty for reading the horoscope. They are kind, sociable and fond of friends with the result that they usually attract large numbers of intellectual people to their circle of acquaintances. When [PAGE 207]  MERCURY THE PLANET OF REASON afflicted this position makes the person disloyal and ready to prey upon his friends, or criticize and slander them. MERCURY IN PISCES the occult water sign, seems to endow the mind with a"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"certain psychic faculty which is not so much intuition as imagination. They think or imagine that something must be so and so and it is a startling fact that they are usually correct, but this ability brings them dangerously near to mediumship if Mercury is afflicted or when Neptune, the higher octave of Mercury, is in the Twelfth House. Therefore this is rather a dangerous po- sition. If Mercury is afflicted by Saturn this position in Pisces makes the person liable to gloom and the mind will be subject to constant worry with a turn toward melancholy. Usually, people with Mercury in Pisces are of a kindly and benevolent disposition. This also is a good indication that suc- cess may be attained in chemistry and as a dietitian in the preparation of health foods. MERCURY IN ASPECT WITH THE OTHER PLANETS THE SUN IN PARALLEL OR CONJUNCTION WITH MERCURY. These are the only as- pects ever formed and are good for the memory and mentality provided Mercury is not closer to the Sun than three degrees, for then he is \"COMBUST\" and his good qualities are burned up in the Sun's rays. It is most fortunate to have Mercury rise BEFORE the Sun at Birth for he is then the Lightbearer who [PAGE 208]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS holds the torch of reason BEFORE the Spirit which in the horoscope is sym- bolized by the Sun. When he rises after the Sun the mentality is not nearly so keen (unless other good aspects favor). VENUS PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION OR SEXTILE TO MERCURY. Venus and Mercury are never more than 76 degrees apart, therefore they can only form the conjunc- tions, parallels and sextiles, but not the trine, square nor opposition. These aspects make the person cheerful and companionable with a good-natured disposition and a desire for society. They also give the abil- ity for music and poetry, especially if in the Ascendant, and are a general indication of SUCCESS in salesmanship for such people are very suave, af- fable and persuasive. THE MOON IN PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO MERCURY gives a receptive mind and a retentive memory, two very rare qualities and therefore these aspects, particularly the sextile and trine, are good indications of success in life, especially in one of the mercurial occupations, literary, clerical or traveling. People with these configurations are usually very verbose, particularly if the conjunction or trine occurs in airy signs or a sign of voice, for then the power of expression reaches a superlative degree [PAGE 209]  MERCURY THE PLANET OF REASON"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"and such people become able linguists and elocutionists; but unless there is some steadying influence people with configurations of Mercury and the Moon are not reliable because of their tendency to change their minds repeatedly in the most unexpected manner. They are inclined to look upon the bright side of life and are fond of pleasure, particularly travel. THE MOON SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO MERCURY gives a poor memory and lack of mental stability with a tendency to indecision and worry, liability to brain storms and hysterics. These characteristics make the person unpopular and as the saying is, \"unlucky.\" SATURN SEXTILE OR TRINE TO MERCURY acts as a brake upon the flighty mind and gives it a seriousness, depth and concentration which is of inestimable value in life. The forethought and profound reasoning ability indicated by these aspects insure success in whatever vocation the person may pursue. The patient persistence which permits no temporary failure to stand in the way of ultimate success; their caution and diplomacy make such people invin- cible in the long run. Therefore they generally become prominent in connec- tion with some serious enterprise such as secrete societies, the church or even politics or governmental affairs. They are in demand for high posi- tions in great undertakings where a steady hand is required on the helm. [PAGE 210]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS But they do not usually shine in public for they are very quiet, subdued and serious in their manner and demeanor; besides they are absolutely honest and fairminded, hence they make the very finest judges obtainable. SATURN CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO MERCURY gives depth to the mind, and forespiritual, together with all the other good qualities enumerated as re- sulting from the sextile and the trine if Mercury is otherwise well-aspected, but not in so full a measure, or at any rate the person does not seem to be able to externalize them as readily, hence does not meet the same assured success as given by the good aspects. He also suffers from the tendency to melancholy denoted by the square or opposition, especially if the aspect occurs in one of the common signs or in Capricorn, and if in Gemini it interferes sadly with the dexterity. Such people tend to drop ev- erything they take into their hands. These aspects also give an embarrass- ing timidity and if Mercury is afflicted the undesirable qualities enumer- ated as resulting from the square or opposition may be looked for. SATURN SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO MERCURY makes the person subject to trouble and delays all through life. He is thwarted on every hand by slan- der and secret enemies and this condition in time makes him bitter and [PAGE 211]  MERCURY THE PLANET OF REASON"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"sarcastic with the additional result that he is shunned by all who can pos- sibly get away from him. This in time leads him to become a recluse who shuts himself away to brood over his troubles. Such a person sometimes be- comes subject to melancholia of a most piteous character. These aspects also make the person cunning and untruthful. They give the same desire to study the occult conferred by the good aspects, but there is the great dif- ference that while the good aspects of Saturn and Mercury incline one to the study of occultism from unselfish motives, the bad aspects impel him to fer- ret out nature's secret for personal power or gain. JUPITER CONJUNCTION, PARALLEL, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO MERCURY is one of the finest assets in life, for it gives a cheerful, optimistic disposition with the ability to look upon the bright side of things and keep up the spirits in hours of adversity. The mind is broad, versatile, and able to reason correctly and to form a reliable judgment by careful deliberation. These people never give a hasty decision; they require time to think over whatever is presented to them, but once they have reached a conclusion it will be found incontrovertible. They are successful in law or literature and much respected for their honesty and sincerity. These aspects are particularly [PAGE 212]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS fortunate for people who travel for business or pleasure, for they will reap both benefit and enjoyment from a migratory mode of life; these aspects make them \"healthy, wealthy and wise\" beyond the average, and loved by everybody for the vital vibrations they radiate upon whomever they meet. JUPITER SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO MERCURY gives a vacillating and wavering disposition so that the person cannot make up his mind when more than one course of action is open, hence people with these aspects often lose their opportunities through procrastination and lack of judgment, and must there- fore often be classed as failures in life. They are liable to scandal and slander because of treacherous associates. They should not travel, for it will bring them loss and trouble. They should also be extremely careful in making contracts or agreements to do or deliver certain things at a specified time, for they will probably be unable to fulfill the requirements and thus trouble and loss will result. MARS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO MERCURY gives a keen, sharp, ingenious and re- sourceful mentality. It makes the person enthusiastic over any proposition which appeals to him and he has also ability to enthuse others and impress them with his views; an indefatigable worker in any cause which arouses his [PAGE 213]  MERCURY THE PLANET OF REASON"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"sympathies, but he is not visionary, and is interested only in concrete mat- ters. These people love argument or debate, and they have an inexhaustible fund of wit and good humor, sometimes blended with a vein of sarcasm which always strikes its mark, yet never viciously nor maliciously. They also have remarkable dexterity and are able to turn their hands to whatever task is allotted and do it with a speed, facility and expedition that is aston- ishing, to say the least. They cannot do anything slowly or by halves,; whatever they undertake must be done with a rush, and they put their whole energy into it so that they may accomplish the task and do it well, hence these aspects give success in life, in almost any line of endeavor these people may select, but most often in literature or the mechanical arts. MARS CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO MERCURY gives the same mental energy, en- thusiasm and dexterity as the definately good aspects, but whether these qualities are used for constructive and good purposes or for destructive and evil ends depends upon the sign, house position and other aspects. If the configuration occurs in a sign where either or both planets are strong and well-placed, as Mars in Aries or Capricorn, or Mercury in Gemini or Virgo, or if they are fortified by good aspects from the Sun, Venus or Jupiter, Mars conjunction or parallel Mercury will operate similarly to the sextile [PAGE 214]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS or trine, as stated in the foregoing paragraph, which see. But if Mars and Mercury are in one of the watery signs (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), or if either or both are afflicted by Saturn, Uranus or Neptune, the conjunction or parallel of Mars and Mercury will give the same evil tendencies as the square or opposition which are defined in the next paragraph. MARS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO MERCURY makes people quickwitted, sharp and alert, quick tempered, impulsive and excitable, liable to jump at conclu- sions and act before they think with the inevitable result that they are al- ways getting themselves or other people into trouble, hence they are danger- ous associates. They are born prevaricators and utterly incapable of making a straight statement. It is just as natural for them to color or exaggerate their statements as it is to breathe. They are vitriolic in their wrath and their tongues are more poisonous than the bite of a rattlesnake, hence they are either feared or hated by those who are unfortunate enough to be bound to them by environment; all who can, shun them. They are bullies who are bound either to rule or ruin wherever they are, and they allow no obstacle to stand in their way which can be removed either by force or slander. They are the acme of selfishness, swagger and consummate egotism. The foregoing [PAGE 215]  MERCURY THE PLANET OF REASON tendencies may of course be modified by other aspects, but if they are not,"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"such people are a menace to society. If either Mars or Mercury is placed in the Sixth or Twelfth House or in any other position so that the bad aspect acts upon the health, there is a liability to nervous prostration, brain fe- ver or insanity. URANUS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO MERCURY gives an original, independent and ec- centric mind impatient of the fetters of fashion, tradition and convention. Such a person is strenuous in his efforts to hew a path for himself in com- plete liberty. Therefore this is the hall-mark of the pioneers in thought and invention, the sign of genius. Their ideas and ideals are exceedingly lofty, progressive and inspiring, in fact too much so in the opinion of the average man or woman who looks upon their actions as vagaries, the outcome of a diseased mind. Nevertheless they have plenty of friends on account of their kindly and sympathetic nature. These aspects are good for a literary or scientific pursuit, also for invention, particularly along lines which have to do with air or electricity. URANUS CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL MERCURY. If Mercury is otherwise af- flicted the conjunction and parallel are to be judged as bad aspects and read accordingly, but if Mercury is otherwise well placed and aspected the [PAGE 216]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS delineation given for the sextile and trine will apply. URANUS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO MERCURY is the hall-mark of the true crank or anarchist who has extreme ideas in regard to tearing down the social structure and making reforms. People with these configurations are given to ranting and raving in public and their language is usually as cruel as the measures they advocate. Whatever ability they possess is usually turned to erratic purposes and they are often forced to make sudden changes on that account. NEPTUNE CONJUNCTION, PARALLEL, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO MERCURY gives a mind peculiarly adapted to the occult art, particularly if the conjunction occurs in the Third or Ninth House or the trines are from the watery signs Cancer and Pisces. Such people usually succeed in occult science and often develop a supernormal faculty. They are particularly good as magnetic healers. NEPTUNE SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO MERCURY gives a chaotic mind, liability to lack of memory, indolence and a disposition to dream the time away. There is a restless desire for fame and an inability to fit in anywhere. Such people are liable to fraud, deception and slander, also to commit sui- cide. [PAGE 217]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"  CHAPTER XI THE MOON, THE PLANET OF FECUNDATION From the Bible we learn that Jehovah made man in His image. We are also told that ANGELS visited Sarah and proclaimed the birth of Isaac. They also foretold the birth of Samson and Samuel and the ANGEL (not archangel) Gabriel came to Mary of Bethlehem to announce the coming birth of Jesus. According to occult science Jehovah and His angels are the guardians of the seed atoms, the basic factors in fertilization. The activities of the an- gels are directed to the maintenance of plant, animal and human life upon earth. To this end their forces are focused by the wandering Moon through the twelve signs of the zodiac; they impinge upon the foetus in a creative manner during the period of gestation from the time of conception to birth. Thus as the Moon measures the tides of the earth so also does she measure the soul's passage from the shores of eternity through the waters of the womb to the world of time. According to astrology Cancer is the home of the Moon. The ancient Egyptians pictured this sign as a scarab or beetle which was their emblem of the soul and they called Cancer THE SPHERE OF THE SOUL, for it is said that through this moist watery sign fertilized by the lunar [PAGE 218]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS ray the seed atoms are projected into the womb of the prospective parent who is thus prepared for the period of gestation; and occult science adds to this that the seed atoms of the animal kingdom, which is still mindless and therefore not amenable to lunar influences in that direction, are projected through the watery martial sign SCORPIO while the seed atoms of the inert plants our poured in through the Jupiterian sign Pisces just before the Sun enters Aries at the vernal equinox to awaken the plant seeds sleeping in Mother Earth, which have been fertilized by Pisces. Thus the human family has the longest period of gestation, the animal a somewhat shorter one and the plant the shortest of all. The Moon also measures the period of postnatal growth so that the period of CHILDHOOD, measured by the change of teeth is complete at about seven years of age when the Moon is SQUARE to her place at birth. The period of PUBERTY is ushered in at about fourteen years of age when the Moon is in OP- POSITION to her place at birth and is marked by the change of voice in the boy and the commencement of the menses in the girl. At twenty-one years of age the Moon by progression has traveled three quarters of the circle of the horoscope from its place at birth. This finishes the period of incubation and the human being is considered to be full-grown, capable of exercising a franchise and taking care of his own affairs. Thus the distance traveled by the New Moon during the prenatal period of gestation in the mother's womb"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"[PAGE 219]  THE MOON, PLPfET OF FECUNDATION and the distance traveled by the progressed Moon during the twenty-one years of post-natal development in the womb of Mother Nature correspond exactly. The Moon, like Mercury, has no basic nature of its own but serves to fo- cus the qualities of the signs and other planets upon the human mind. She governs the tidal air in the lungs and the colorless lymph in the body, also the digestive activity and the sympathetic nervous system which auto- matically takes care of the process of digestion. She also governs the cer- ebellum, the mammae, the feminine functions and parturition as already ex- plained. People who are strongly under the influence of the lunar rays are of an easy-going, dreamy, indolent nature, adepts as architects of air castles which never materialize or assume concrete shape. They are very sociable and generally easy to get along with. They succeed best as cooks, house- keepers or in some domestic occupation or in one which has to do with li- quids or a seafaring life. The Moon being female indicates the marriage partner for a man so that in a man's horoscope affliction of the Moon would not be so apt to cause trouble in health as in married life and the horoscopes of the two sexes should therefore be read differently with respect to the Sun and Moon. If Saturn afflicts the Moon in a woman's horoscope it will affect her health, but in the same respect to the Sun and Moon. If Saturn afflicts the Moon in a woman's horoscope it will affect her health, but the same aspect occurring in a man's horoscope will cause him trouble in married life. If the Sun is afflicted in a man's horoscope it will affect his health but in a woman's [PAGE 220]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS horoscope it would indicate trouble with her husband. At the same time how- ever it should not be forgotten that both the Sun and Moon are vital factors in the health of both sexes but one sex is more affected by the Sun, the other by the Moon. The Moon is the great time-marker of the universe. Without her our lives would be barren of events for although the Sun and the planets by their travel through the signs and houses indicate the years when certain tenden- cies shown in the horoscope may culminate in action, it invariably requires an aspect of the Moon to fertilize the aspect and make it bloom into physical manifestation. The Sun and the planets may therefore be likened to the hour-hand on the clock of destiny which shows the YEAR when each phase of our destiny which shows the YEAR when each phase of our destiny is ripe"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"for the harvest and the Moon may be likened to the minute-hand which shows the MONTH when the influences are due to culminate into action. In order to become fully conversant with the influences of the Moon we would advise stu- dents to read carefully the article on eclipses and new moon in our Simpli- fied Scientific Astrology.  THE MOON IN THE TWELVE HOUSES THE MOON IN THE FIRST HOUSE. When the Moon is rising in the First House at birth and particularly in common or cardinal sign she gives the person then born a very restless nature; he is constantly endeavoring to change his [PAGE 221]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION position environment and occupation, is ensouled by an insatiable wanderlust and always ready to roam. When the Moon is rising in a fixed sign there is a little more stability to the nature but even then the person will probably spend at least part of his time in a roving existence. People with the Moon in the First House are usually sensitives, especially if the Moon is in the psychic signs Cancer or Pisces. They have a very vivid imagination and are quite intuitive. This position of the Moon has a powerful influence upon health especially in a woman's horoscope and the aspects which the Moon re- ceives determine the strength of the constitution. It is also a sign of success in such occupations as bring the person in close touch with the pub- lic. THE MOON IN THE SECOND HOUSE signifies fluctuating finances unless for- tified by good aspects from Jupiter, the planet of opulence, or Venus the planet of attraction. Good aspects from the Sun make matters more settled in that respect. THE MOON IN THE THIRD HOUSE makes the mind extremely fertile in imagina- tion with a strong liking for mental occupations, especially such as do not require continuity but are subject to constant change, like editing and re- porting on newspapers where one must be on the alert for news and roam hither and thither for the purpose of gathering it. These people love the [PAGE 222]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS lime-light of publicity and if the Moon is strengthened by good aspects to Mercury they may reach a position of prominence. THE MOON IN THE FOURTH HOUSE well-aspected indicates fortunate home con- ditions, especially toward the close of life but if the Moon is afflicted we may judge the reverse. This position also gives a tendency toward psychic experiences especially if the Moon is in its own sign Cancer or in Pisces,"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"another watery sign. It also shows many changes of residence which will be fortunate or otherwise according to other aspects of the Moon. THE MOON IN THE FIFTH HOUSE in cardinal or common signs indicates a per- son of very changeable afflictions, fond of pleasure and gambling. It is a sign of a fruitful marriage particularly when in Scorpio. Even in a barren sign like Leo the Moon will give children when she is placed in the Fifth House. This question, however, should always be judged from both horoscopes of the prospective parents, for should one be entirely barren, the Moon in the Fifth House in Leo or Virgo in the other horoscope, would not be suf- ficient help to mend the matter. THE MOON IN THE SIXTH HOUSE is a poor position particularly in a woman's horoscope and any person with the Moon in that position will be better in a [PAGE 223]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION subordinate position employed by someone else than in a business venture of his own. Should he be placed in the position of employer he will find it difficult to keep servants or employees. They will change constantly. THE MOON IN THE SEVENTH HOUSE if well-aspected is fortunate for success in marriage, partnership and all dealings with the public for it makes the person popular. But if seriously afflicted it indicates a fickle, change- able marriage partner, loss through litigation, partnership and the general public which will then hold the person in disfavor. THE MOON IN THE EIGHTH HOUSE gives gain by marriage and legacy if it is well-aspected and it also increases the number of children though there is a change that some of them may die. But if the Moon is afflicted the finan- cial fortunes will change for the worse after marriage and if legacies do come they will bring lawsuits with them whereby the person will lose. THE MOON IN THE NINTH HOUSE when well-aspected gives a clean clear mind of a serious, religious, legal or philosophy turn according to the nature of the aspect. The person will travel far with both pleasure and profit for himself and sometime he will come into the lime-light of publicity. This position also gives a tendency to dreams and visions especially if the Moon [PAGE 224]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS is aspected by Neptune. If the Moon is afflicted the person will be too im- pulsive and jump to conclusions which are to his detriment. If he under- takes to travel he is liable to meet much trouble in consequence. He is also apt to make an ill-considered change in religion and be subjected to much censure on that account."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" THE MOON IN THE TENTH HOUSE is a sign of good fortune, popularity and prosperity if well-aspected. It brings the person prominently before the public and ensures favor especially from women, also the accumulation or property. It makes the mind deep and diplomatic, curious and inquisitive. When the Moon is afflicted the person is liable to incur hostility on the part of the public and reversals of fortune. Sometimes he becomes involved in public scandal and subject to censure. THE MOON IN THE ELEVENTH HOUSE if well-aspected gives many friends espe- cially among women, but if she is afflicted those who come to the person un- der the guise of friendship do so in the hope that he may be of benefit to them. THE MOON IN THE TWELFTH HOUSE if well-aspected gives success in such work as is performed in seclusion away from the public gaze, in prisons, hospitals or charitable institutions. There is also a liability to become [PAGE 225]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION involved in clandestine love-affairs but if the Moon is well-aspected the person will be able to keep this a secret. If the Moon is afflicted there is a danger of secret enemies, trouble and persecution.  THE MOON IN THE TWELVE SIGNS THE MOON IN ARIES gives a very independent type of mind which aims to hew out its own path in life whether right or wrong and is extremely quick to resent any interference from others. The person is ambitious and aggres- sive but lacks forethought, so that he is liable to meet with numerous setbacks. However, this position gives a dauntless courage and such people are not easily defeated. When they have failed in one direction they im- mediately try another venture and in the end their very persistence usually brings them into prominence in their line and gives them ultimate success, unless the Moon is afflicted; they they are prone to take up one occupation after another without giving themselves time to try honestly to make a suc- cess of any one. THE MOON IN TAURUS. This is the Moon's exaltation sign and her effect is therefore very powerful for good if she is free from affliction and well-aspected. Then the fixed nature of Taurus tones down the changeability of the Moon which also blends with the Venus ray. Hence it makes the [PAGE 226]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS disposition gentle, self-reliant and determined. It gives perseverance, forethought and kindness, therefore the person attracts all the good things"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"of life, health and wealth, friends and family, houses and lands with the ability to enjoy all these things for it makes him fond of pleasure, so- ciable and hospitable, a lover of art and music and all other things which make for the enjoyment of life. THE MOON IN GEMINI gives a wide-awake intellect, fond of literature and science, resourceful and able to cope with emergencies, broad, liberal and alert for progressive ideas which are taken up with avidity. Hence such people are much attracted to literary occupations, particularly in the news- paper field where they may flit from one subject to another as required by their extremely restless mind. This position also gives an inordinate love of traveling, and desire for positions where one meets many people. Hence it favors such occupations as those of traveling salesmen, canvassers, and the like. THE MOON IN CANCER gives a disposition which is kind, sociable and sym- pathetic, but indolent and averse to effort whether physical, moral or men- tal. These people love to drift with the tide and only bestir themselves when under the whiplash of necessity. They are often sensitive to physic [PAGE 227]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION conditions, especially if the Moon is aspected by Neptune or Uranus and the nature of the aspect determines whether the influence is favorable or unfa- vorable. This position also gives a love of home and the comforts to be ob- tained there. It promotes the digestion and consequently the health if the Moon is well-aspected. If afflicted it has a tendency to give digestive troubles. THE MOON IN LEO has an illuminating influence on the mind. It gives a strong, self-reliant and aggressive disposition with ability for organiza- tion; therefore people with the Moon in this position usually attain to leadership in their immediate circle. They are honorable in financial and social matters, fair and magnanimous in their dealings with others, and very popular with other people. THE MOON IN VIRGO increases the mental qualities if she is well-aspected; she gives a retentive memory, a love of study along scientific or occult lines and an ambition to excel. Chemistry is the favorite of these people among the sciences and they excel as dietitians. They are rather reserved and of quiet demeanor, disliking flattery or ostentation. Unless they de- vote themselves to dietetics they are more successful as the servants or em- ployees of others than in business for themselves. [PAGE 228]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" THE MOON IN LIBRA is a fortunate position for the acquisition of friends and public popularity for it makes the person kind, sympathetic and agree- able, optimistic and fond of social pleasures. This position also gives good reasoning powers and the ability to form a correct judgment, love of art and music, sometimes considerable ability as a performer if assisted by other aspects. THE MOON IN SCORPIO gives a courageous independent and energetic disposi- tion. The person who has this configuration will not tolerate interference with his plans or submit to imposition. He is often very abrupt in his man- ners and blunt in speech, quick-tempered and not to be coerced by threats, but singularly amenable to kindness. He has a strong and stubborn will and determination to carry out whatever he undertakes. This position also gives a considerable attraction toward the occult sciences but if afflicted may lead to excess gratification of the senses, trouble with women or difficul- ties in parturition. THE MOON IN SAGITTARIUS gives an alert and active personality, a love of walking, riding or any other form of physical exercise, a roving of disposi- tion and love of travel in foreign countries, a fondness of animals, espe- cially horses and dogs and an inclination for the study of religion, law philosophy or the science of occultism. These people are very optimistic, [PAGE 229]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION good humored, jovial, and ideal companions unless the Moon is afflicted, then her position in Sagittarius is conducive to indolence and self-indulgence. THE MOON IN CAPRICORN, if well-aspected, gives abundance of help from people who are higher in the social scale so that whatever success there may be will come through others, the person being too timid to push himself for- ward, besides being of a melancholy turn of mind which makes him exceedingly sensitive to real or fancied slights. If the Moon is afflicted it gives a liability to slander whether that is merited or not. This position also has a detrimental effect upon the digestion. People with Moon in this position often have an insane fear of coming to want and therefore they become avari- cious and miserly, denying themselves all comforts at the present time that they may have something for a rainy day. They have very little feeling for themselves and none at all for others. THE MOON IN AQUARIUS if well-aspected gives the person a very vivid imagination and the power of calling images up before the mind's eye in such a manner that they seem almost tangible; besides these people are not depen- dent upon the faculty of reason, for their intuition is also exceedingly"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"[PAGE 230]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS well-developed. In disposition they are sociable, kindly and courteous with the result that they attract many friends and are very popular in their en- vironment, and they are helped by their friends according to the aspects of the Moon. On the other hand if the Moon is afflicted this position shows one of an exceedingly erratic mind. THE MOON IN PISCES gives a receptive mind and a fertile imagination with a disposition to indolence and self-pity, vacillation and faint-heartedness, makes one fond of creaming rather than acting, therefore sorrow, trouble and self-undoing beset the path in life. This position not infrequently leads to mediumship, especially if Neptune is in adverse aspect, for these people are peculiarly sensitive to the flattery of spirit-controls and love any- thing that will stir their emotions. They are also very wordy in their ex- pressions. If a good aspect from Venus and Mercury enables them to take up music they play with extraordinary inspiration and feeling. If the Moon is afflicted in Pisces love-affairs are apt to bring the person into trouble. If Pisces is in the Twelfth House and the Moon there at birth this will give a liability on the part of the parents to drink and thus to neglect their children who may then become the wards of charitable institutions until they reach maturity. [PAGE 231]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION ASPECTS OF THE MOON TO OTHER PLANETS THE SUN PARALLEL TO OR CONJUNCTION WITH THE MOON. No matter in what sign or house the conjunction of the Lights occurs the person will be so strongly marked with the characteristics that sign that, lacking knowledge of his true ascendant, even the most competent astrologer is likely to be misled and judge him to be born with the sign rising in which the conjunction took place, and whatever matters are ruled by the house in which the conjunction occurs will play a very important part in the life. In the First he is an out and out egotist with very little love for others save in so far as they serve his ends, in the Seventh his world pivots on the mate, in the Tenth House or sign he will sacrifice all other considerations to rise in public life; in the Twelfth House or sign the conjunction will give a strong ten- dency to intemperance which will bring trouble in the life; in the Third and Ninth Houses it will brighten the mind and induce travel from which he will benefit; in the Second House it will bring wealth, especially if in good as- pect with Jupiter. If the conjunction of the Sun and Moon is closer than three degrees if has a tendency to deplete the vitality and if it is also a solar eclipse and the child survives, this will be particularly noticeable all through life. People who have such close conjunctions or eclipses"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"[PAGE 232]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS become listless, dispirited and out of sorts every time there is a new Moon. The conjunction or eclipse does not seem to interfere with the good effects in other department of life. THE SUN SEXTILE OR TRINE TO THE MOON. The good aspects of the Sun and Moon make for general success in life, health, fair financial fortunes, good home conditions with faithful friends and esteem in the community; they fa- vor a rise in life because of the person's innate ability, which either gains for him the recognition of people in a position to help him rise, or impels him to carve his own way. THE SUN SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO THE MOON makes the person vacillating and unsettled in disposition, changeable and unable to pursue a settled course in life, rash to plunge into untried ventures but lacking the persistence or continuity of purpose to carry anything to a successful conclusion. For that reason such people become failures in life; their dealings with women and people higher in the social scale such as employers, the authorities, judges, etc., are especially unsuccessful; they always have difficulty in obtaining proper employment and in keeping their positions when obtained, for they are hyper-sensitive and ready to take offense, with or without provocation. These configurations also affect the health; the body is [PAGE 233]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION liable to colds and recuperation is slow when sickness has overtaken the person. VENUS PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO THE MOON. The Moon is significator of marriage for a man and therefore the good aspects between Venus, the planet of love, and the Moon are good indications of a happy mar- riage when they occur in a man's horoscope. But in a woman's horoscope these aspects operate upon the health, for the Moon is the plant of fecun- dity and has rule over the female functions in particular, which are so large a factor in the woman's health, and this is much strengthened by them. These aspects give oratorical ability with a fruitful imagination, a love of pleasure, music and art. They give an engaging personality, very attractive to the opposite sex because kindly, affectionate and sympathetic, and they tend to general success in life; though the finances may be fluctuating the person usually has sufficient for the day and the way. VENUS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO THE MOON is an indication of trouble in marriage for a man, because the wife described by an afflicted Venus will be slovenly and of dissolute habits which will destroy domestic happiness. In a woman's horoscope it indicates a disturbance of the female functions and also gives a tendency to digestive troubles and poor circulation when in the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"[PAGE 234]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS horoscope of either sex. These aspects also give a liability to slander and public scandal as the person so afflicted is fickle and inconstant in his affections, of a sensual nature which loves to flit from flower to flower regardless of the sorrows caused by playing with the heart of others. MERCURY PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO THE MOON gives a re- ceptive mind and a retentive memory, two very rare qualities and therefore these aspects, particularly the sextile and trine are good indications of success in life, especially in one of the mercurial occupations, literary, clerical or traveling. People with these configurations are usually very verbose, particularly if the conjunction or trine occurs in airy signs or a sign of voice, for then the power of expression reaches a superlative degree and such people become able linguists and elocutionists; but unless there is some steadying influence people with aspects of Mercury and the Moon are not reliable because of their tendency to change their minds repeatedly in the most unexpected manner. They are inclined to look upon the bright side of life and are fond of pleasure, particularly travel. MERCURY SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO THE MOON gives a poor memory and lack of mental stability with a tendency to indecision and worry, liability to brain storms and hysterics. These characteristics make the person unpopular and [PAGE 235]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION as the saying is \"unlucky.\" SATURN SEXTILE OR TRINE TO THE MOON imparts all the best saturnine qualities to the mind and makes the person self-reliant, serious, sober and systematic, careful and thrifty in business affairs and gives success in life through tactful and diplomatic dealings with others. Such people are eminently responsible and trust worthy in all matters of honor and justice and gain great esteem in the community on that account. Their patience and persistence are inexhaustible. SATURN PARALLEL TO OR CONJUNCTION WITH THE MOON is not always to be classed as a bad aspect so far as the mental qualities go for in any case it depends the mind and gives greater power of concentration. If Saturn is strong by sign, in Libra or Capricorn, and the Moon is otherwise well-aspected, this position will also impart the virtues of Saturn though under all conditions it makes the mind gloomy and the person is subject to periodical spells of melancholy; but if Saturn is weak by sign, especially if he is in Aries and if the Moon is otherwise afflicted then his conjunc- tion is to be judged and read the same as the square or opposition."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" The effect of the conjunction also depends upon the department of life we are considering: for instance, as already said, the conjunction of the Moon [PAGE 236]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS and Saturn is good for concentration of the mind, but bad for the digestion, particularly in a woman's horoscope; it has also the tendency to obstruct the menses with all that that implies, and in a man's horoscope it indicates the death of the marriage partner. Similar distinctions should be made when reading the conjunctions of the other so-called malefics. SATURN SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO THE MOON is one of the signatures of sor- row in life for it makes the mind melancholy and full of worries so that the person is constantly carrying an atmosphere of gloom with him, and as thoughts are things this attitude of mind brings about delays and disap- pointments in every department of life. Such a person will experience dif- ficulties from people and things signified by Saturn, probably parents, and if he has money he may lose it and have difficult in getting more; thus he may be in poverty all his life. He will make more enemies than friends and become subject to slander and scandal, but the disfavor he meets is undoubt- edly merited for these aspects make the mind bitter and selfish; such people are unscrupulous, avaricious and entirely unfeeling with respect to others, hence they are under the whiplash of Saturn that the sorrow and troubles which they themselves are constantly feeling may make them more mellow. If the aspect is six, five or even four degrees from being exact and if Saturn [PAGE 237]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION is in the exaltation sign Libra these aspects are not quite so evil in the latter part of life. They may then imply that the person has learned his lesson and as a consequence he may find himself in easier circumstances. The adverse aspects of Saturn to the Moon are very bad for the health, par- ticularly in a woman's horoscope. There they indicate obstructions of the female functions. In the man's horoscope they either deny marriage or indi- cate the death of the marriage partner and their general tendency to ob- struct everything connected with the houses and signs wherein they are placed in the horoscope. JUPITER PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO THE MOON gives an op- timistic, noble and generous disposition. The open-hearted honesty, fair- ness and friendliness of such people make them universally popular. These aspects strengthen both the reasoning faculties and constitution; they give a strong mind in a strong body and hence a powerful personal magnetism which may be used to great advantage in healing the sick. They have lofty ideals and a fruitful imagination with the power of acquiring wealth which will"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"grow greater if used in philanthropic enterprises of which these people are prone to dream. These are some of the best aspects in the gamut and make [PAGE 238]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS for general success in life both physically and spiritually. JUPITER SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO THE MOON impairs the reasoning faculties and brings the person trouble through litigation, lack of fore-thought and indecision or dishonesty. People with these aspects are too fond of osten- tation and display, extravagant beyond their means and resources, prone to take desperate chances in gambling or speculation to rehabilitate their for- tunes and doomed to loss, slander and sometimes bankruptcy on that account. These aspects are also bad for health, in a woman's horoscope especially, indicating digestive and liver problems. MARS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO THE MOON gives a wonderful vitality and a strong physique so that the person is able to overcome almost any tendencies to ill-health, all of which are overruled by these aspects. The power of en- durance is increased to a maximum and the person can survive hardships to which people ordinarily succumb. They give a resolute, courageous, ener- getic and ambitious mind of a resourceful and eminently constructive turn' and they make the person quick but not precipitate in his decisions. Thus he gains the confidence and esteem of others and earns considerable money but the nature is extremely free and generous so that money does not stay by [PAGE 239]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION these people. They spend it almost as fast as they get it. MARS CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO THE MOON may be either good or bad ac- cording to the sex of the person and the department of life we are consider- ing. It strengthens the health and the vitality, particularly in the horo- scope of a woman. In the horoscope of a man it would indicate a robust marriage partner of a domineering nature. With respect to the mind it would make the person very impulsive, particularly if placed in one of the common signs or in the Third or Ninth Houses. It also gives a very bad temper but not so bad as the square or opposition. If Mars is in conjunction or paral- lel to the Moon in Scorpio there is an abnormal sexual desire which will not be denied particularly if Venus is there also. It makes the nature very restless and unsettled for it is like mixing fire and water. In watery signs it inclines to drink. MARS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO THE MOON gives a very quick temper with a tendency to hasty or impulsive expression and acts that may cause the person"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"a great deal of sorrow and trouble. These people resent rules or regula- tions or any other measures that tend to curb their desires or the gratifi- cation of their appetites in whatever direction, but if they are in [PAGE 240]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS authority they are very domineering and exacting in their demands for instant obedience upon the part of others, nor do they hesitate to use what- ever physical force may be necessary to compel obedience if they think they can do so without great danger to themselves. Sometimes they will even take desperate changes to satisfy their spite and having an improperly balanced mind they are foolhardy in their venturesomeness so that upon occasion they will attempt to do things which no one with a sane mind would try. On ac- count of the foregoing consciousness such people make many enemies and cause a great deal of suffering to others, particularly among members of their im- mediate family who cannot very well get away from them. If these aspects occur in watery signs, particularly with Mars of the Moon in Pisces the per- son is also an inveterate drunkard. From that standpoint of health they give a tendency to fever and accidents, trouble with the generative organs and operations which are usually unnecessary. These people are exceedingly prodigal with their money and are habitual prevaricators. URANUS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO THE MOON gives great originality and indepen- dence to the mind, which is quick, intuitive and very vivid in its imagina- tion; hence the person has inventive ability and is attracted to the occult arts and endowed with hypnotic or magnetic powers, also the intuitional [PAGE 241]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION ability to study and practise astrology. If the life is devoted to elec- tricity as a vocation the person will make a success of it. These aspects also give a peculiar fascination for the opposite sex and are likely to lead to a clandestine love affair or an unconventional union. URANUS CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO THE MOON gives similar mental and psy- chic tendencies and also the same liability to irregular love-affairs as the good aspects but these tendencies are not so pronounced. A secrete love-affair generated under the conjunction of Uranus and the Moon may have directly disastrous results similar to those mentioned under the bad as- pects. If the conjunction occurs in Cancer it tends to nervous indigestion; in Leo it inclines to palpitations of the heart, interferes with the rhythm of the heart-beat and gives a spasmodic action which will probably prove fa- tal when it has run its course. In Scorpio, it inclines to perverted prac- tices, in Sagittarius the reflex action would be felt in the lungs and similarly with the other signs."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" URANUS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO THE MOON makes the person erratic and touchy to a degree, a walking powder magazine ready to explode at any mo- ment, overbearing, conceited, intolerant, and shunned by all who can possi- [PAGE 242]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS bly get out of his way. If such people are employers nobody can work for them and if they are employees nobody will have them. They never remain very long in any place, but are either discharged or give up their position on the slightest provocation. People with these aspects are attracted to the occult arts but they never make a success at them because of their erratic mentality. Like the other aspects of Uranus and the Moon the square or op- position also indicates a clandestine attachment either on the part of the person or the marriage partner. If it occurs in the Seventh House of a man's horoscope it proves the wife untrue so that public scandal and divorce will eventually ensue. The bad aspects of the Sun and Uranus give similar indications in the horoscope of a woman. NEPTUNE SEXTILE OR TRINE TO THE MOON increases the faculty of imagina- tion to a superlative degree, especially if either of the planets is in the Ninth House. Then it favors prophetic dreams and visions which bring the person in contact with the invisible worlds. It indicates ability in the occult arts and success in their practice for it makes the nature exceed- ingly inspirational and it also gives a kind and sympathetic disposition. The spiritual qualities mentioned may not be apparent even to the person himself but then they are latent and capable of development. It is also [PAGE 243]  THE MOON, PLANET OF FECUNDATION safe to say that at some time or other during the life people with these as- pects will come in contact with and be very much attracted to the occult whether the qualities of the soul are subsequently developed or not. NEPTUNE CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL MOON indicates the same strong psychic features as the good aspects, particularly if Neptune is placed in the psy- chic signs Cancer or Pisces. Those who were born with the good configura- tions of Neptune during the fourteen years when it was in the airy scien- tific sign Gemini are now conquering the air and perfecting scientific inventions which will make us marvel, but the children who have been born under favorable configurations during the fourteen years Neptune has been going through the psychic sign Cancer are now growing up around us as a band of mystics and when they have reached mature years they will astonish us with their spiritual insight and power. Among other things they will de- velop the soul of music. NEPTUNE SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO THE MOON is also an indication of soul"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"qualities similar to those of the good aspects, but under the former con- figurations the person will be of a negative nature and is apt to become the prey of spirit-controls and subjected to mediumship, therefore he should not attend seances. [PAGE 244]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CHAPTER XII  SATURN, THE PLANET OF SORROW  KEYNOTE: OBSTRUCTION A fruitful method of acquiring knowledge is by comparison of similars and contrasts of opposites; thus lights and sidelights are brought out, which otherwise may escape attention. Applying this method to the Sun and Saturn, we remember that the keyword of the Sun is \"Life,\" and at the vernal equinox when the Sun is in Aries, the sign of its exaltation, we may readily note the powerful effect of the crestwave of vital fluid then poured over the earth. Nature is vibrant with life, which races through the forms of all kingdoms and endues them with such abundance of vitality that they are compelled to generate in order to take care of the overflow. Life manifests as motion; but the keynote of Saturn is Obstruction, therefore that is the planet of decrepitude and de- cay, and consequently when the Sun is in Libra, the sign of Saturn's exalta- tion, at the fall equinox, Nature is tired and ready for its wintry sleep. The human frame also is energized by the solar life contained in our food, which enters our system through the head and throat, governed by the exalta- tion signs of the Builders, the Sun and Moon, and is eliminated by the Sun [PAGE 245]  SATURN THE PLANET OF SORROW and Moon, and is eliminated by the activity of the liver and kidneys ruled by Saturn and his exaltation sign, Libra. In youth, when the Sun forces surge through the frame, assimilation and excretion balance, but as time goes on, \"Chronos\" or Saturn accumulates ob- structions in the organs of excretion, and elimination is gradually re- stricted, the avenues of life are dammed up, and decrepitude and decay turn the scales of life (Libra) towards the realm of death. Similarly in other departments of life; where the Sun makes the social favorite, by imbuing him with optimism and a bright sunny smile, Saturn makes recluses and sours existence with frowns and pessimism; where the Sun furthers our worldly affairs and makes things run smoothly, Saturn causes provoking delays of the most inexplicable nature; all the world seems to"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"conspire to frustrate our plans. In the Kingdom of God all things are balanced to produce the highest ul- timate good to all, and so the influence of Saturn is used to offset the exuberant life of Mars. The intrinsic nature of Saturn is OBSTRUCTION; he is slow and persistent as Mars is impulsive and quick to change; he takes no chances, but looks before he leaps, and his cold, calculating reason misses no flaws in any scheme. In the horoscope of a young soul Mars is dominant and the man grows along physical lines much as animals do under the law of the survival of the fit- test, but gradually the thumbscrews of Saturn are put on, squares and [PAGE 246]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS oppositions bring sorrow and suffering; Saturn is placed above Mars in the horoscope, to frustrate and check him, till it seems as if every effort were futile because of the Saturnian obstruction. Elijah could not hear the voice of guidance in the fire, the storm nor the earthquake, but when the tumult was over he heard \"the still small voice\" to cheer him; and likewise with us, while we yield to the unchecked Mars impulses our lives are too turbulent to admit of communion with the Higher Self, but when the sorrows of Saturn have chastened the unruly Mars spirit, when the night seems darkest, as in Elijah's cave, then we also hear the voice that shall speak peace after the storm. The leash of Saturn is not pleasant; we sometimes chafe, fret and fume while being thus held in leash, but meanwhile we ripen and are more fitted, when the obstruction is removed, to have or use that which Saturn delayed, for as we develop physical muscle by overcoming physical obstacles, so we cultivate soul power by the resistance spiritually engendered by Saturn. The teaching which he gives may be summed up in the motto: \"Patient persis- tence in well doing.\" Most of us when considering Saturn in the horoscope are inclined to look upon him as evil on account of the affliction be brings, but that is only a one-sided view, for there is nothing evil in God's Kingdom. What appears so is merely good in the making. When we remember that the destiny shown by [PAGE 247]  SATURN THE PLANET OF SORROW our horoscope is of our own making in past existences then we shall under- stand that Saturn only marks the weak spots in our horoscope, where we are vulnerable and liable to go wrong. When the weak points have been brought out through temptation, AND WE HAVE YIELDED, the punishment follows auto-"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"matically as a natural and logical sequence, for every wrong acts carries in itself the seed of punishment which brings home to our consciousness the mistakes we have made. We must hold clearly before our mind's eye that through the planets incline to a certain life of action we, as evolving Egos, are supposed to discriminate between good and evil and choose only that which is good. If we fail in this respect and YIELD to the temptation the transgression merits a just recompense under the laws of nature and these are the things signified by Saturn. WE ARE NOT PUNISHED BECAUSE WE ARE TEMPTED BUT WE ARE PUNISHED BECAUSE WE YIELDED. Supposing for instance that Saturn is in Cancer, then it is plain that in the past we have yielded to an inordinate desire for food, that in consequence our digestive organs have become impaired and that if we do not learn frugality and discrimina- tion in the choice of our good we shall be punished by digestive disorders. We will then be tempted to indulge in dainties and perhaps we will have an aversion for the simple foods which are best for us. The temptation, how- ever, will cause no trouble to the stomach unless we yield and satisfy our appetite. Then the food, and not an avenging Deity, automatically punishes [PAGE 248]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS us until we learn to curb our appetite. Similarly in other departments of life, if Saturn is on the Ascendant or in the Third of Ninth Houses and ad- versely aspected to Mercury or the Moon it causes us to brood over our troubles and fills our lives with gloom. It gives an obstruction there to warn us that we should be more sociable and not turn our faces away from the sunshine of life. God is at the helm of the universe, His ministers are continually working with us for good, there is really no reason for blues and if we cannot see it today Saturn is going to tighten his grip tomorrow and crush harder and harder until with the sheer courage of desperation we burst his bonds and jump out into the joy and sunshine of life. If it were not for the chastening, subduing influence of Saturn we should be liable to run amuck and burn out the lamp of life quickly in the exuber- ance of spirits. Saturn is well symbolized as Father Time with his hour-glass and scythe. He does not permit us to leave the school of life until the time has been run and the course is finished. Furthermore he gives to humanity many of its noblest qualities. When he lays a restraining hand upon the flighty Moon or Mercury, the swift \"messenger of the gods,\" he deepens the mind and makes it more serious and better able to concentrate upon the problems of life. He makes the mind resourceful and better able to cope with the difficulties of our existence. Tact and diplomacy, method and system, patience and perseverance, honor and chastity, industry and [PAGE 249]  SATURN THE PLANET OF SORROW mechanical ability, justice and fair-mindedness all come from Saturn when he"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"is well-aspected and it is only when we transgress the principles for which he stands that under the influences generated by his adverse aspects he pun- ishes us until he has brought us to our knees to pray to our Father in Heaven for forgiveness and strength to overcome our lower nature.  SATURN IN THE TWELVE HOUSES SATURN IN THE FIRST HOUSE and well-aspected is a fortunate sign for no matter how a person may be handicapped in the start of life the ultimate success is assured through the patience, persistence, self-control and re- straint of the person through a well-placed Saturn. Such people have a won- derful capacity for work. They seem never to tire and never to give up no matter what the obstacles. They have infinite confidence in themselves and their ability to accomplish that which they undertake and therefore they eventually win. But when Saturn is weak and afflicted in the First House it makes the person timid and averse to undertake responsibility; subtile, se- cretive, and distrustful of other people; of a gloomy disposition and in- clined to seek isolation. Such people are usually shunned by others and doomed to sorrow, disappointment, delay and general trouble through life. This is also a bad sign for health, particularly in the earlier years. [PAGE 250]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Bruises to the head, colds, and if Scorpio is rising, constipation; in our Leo poor circulation, in Cancer poor digestion, in Libra obstruction of the kidneys, renal calculi and other urinary difficulties and so on with the other signs. SATURN IN THE SECOND HOUSE when well-aspected and particularly in its ex- altation sign Libra, brings money by inheritance and ability to increase it by present economy, careful, conservative investments and similar methods. Some of the very wealthiest of the world's financiers have had Saturn in this position. They obtain the money wherewith to start from ancestors in- dicated by Saturn and from the saturnine ray in this house they derive the business acumen and far-sighted methods that enable them not only to hold their own as so many do whose wealth comes through Saturn but also to in- crease the inherited estate. If Saturn is weak or afflicted, however, the life is sure to be passed in poverty. SATURN IN THE THIRD HOUSE when well-aspected gives a serious, sober and thoughtful mind, capable of concentration and well able to grapple with the most profound sciences and other serious subjects in life. It gives tact, diplomacy, justice, honest and all the other saturnine virtues of the mind. When Saturn is afflicted in the Third House it indicates trouble with"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"[PAGE 251]  SATURN THE PLANET OF SORROW brethren, danger when traveling, delays and disappointments in obtaining an education. It also fills the mind with gloomy forebodings, worry and gen- eral despondency. SATURN IN THE FOURTH HOUSE, well-aspected, shows gain from inheritance, also success from investments and administration of houses and lands, agri- culture or mining property under careful and economical management. The success grows better as life advances. When Saturn is afflicted in the Fourth House it signifies the early death of one of the parents, in harmony and trouble in the home, loss of property and consequent poverty. This po- sition whether well or ill aspected makes the person a recluse in the latter years of life. SATURN IN THE FIFTH HOUSE when well-aspected by the Sun and Jupiter would be good for speculation in the things that are ruled by Saturn: houses, lands and mines. This position and its aspects would also give the person a chance of appointment to public office, especially in matters connected with education. If Saturn is afflicted in the Fifth House it indicates trouble, disappointment and delay in courtship, particularly during the earlier years, or else the affections are centered upon someone who is much older than the person whose horoscope is being judged. It decreases the number of [PAGE 252]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS children and indicates probable death of those who are born, also that they will bring a great deal of trouble to the person. SATURN IN THE SIXTH HOUSE, well-aspected, gives the person ability to handle employees and workmen in general in a most efficient manner, for though such a person is quiet and subdued he is at the same time firm and serious. He has a way about him which employees respect and which calls for instant obedience to his commands without causing the resentment called forth by a blustering, bellowing Mars. When Saturn is afflicted in the Sixth House it means a great deal of sickness in the life and if in a weak sign like Virgo the person is in dan- ger of becoming a chronic invalid, for one he is in the grip of sickness the recuperative powers are so poor it is almost impossible for him to recover. The nature of the principal illness will depend upon the sign that is on the cusp of the Sixth House or of the Twelfth, but usually with such people many complications set in after this. Also a person with an afflicted Saturn in the Sixth House finds it almost impossible to secure employment and it is evident that such a person has indeed a hard life, being unable to earn a living when able to be about."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"[PAGE 253]  SATURN THE PLANET OF SORROW SATURN IN THE SEVENTH HOUSE when well-aspected denotes a marriage partner endowed with the saturnine virtues, chastity and discretion, tact and dis- crimination, prudence and economy, which will be of great help to the person in building up his fortunes socially as well as financially; and this is a very fortunate position save for the fact that Saturn in the Seventh House, whether well-aspected or afflicted, indicates the early death of the part- ner. An afflicted Saturn in the Seventh House designates a glum, gloomy, cold and disagreeable companion who is always restraining and obstructing the person. \"Don't\" is the word most frequently on the tongue. It also gives trouble and loss through litigation and people with this aspect should never go to law or enter into partnerships for they will always be subject to treachery. SATURN IN THE EIGHTH HOUSE when well-aspected or placed in either of its own signs, Capricorn or Libra, gains my marriage or inheritance with the ability to properly care for whatever wealth is acquired in that manner. It is also a sign of long life and death from natural causes, but if Saturn is afflicted in the Eighth House or weak by sign, especially in Aries or Can- cer, the financial prospects of the person will be decidedly worse after marriage and chronic debility may be expected. [PAGE 254]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS SATURN IN THE NINTH HOUSE when Saturn gives a deep, serious and thought- ful mind with ability and inclination for the study of law, science and phi- losophy, physics or metaphysics. It is a splendid position for a president of a corporation or college, a judge or a divine. Such people always make their mark in the world, the scope of being naturally dependent upon the na- ture of the aspects and the line of endeavor selected by the person. When Saturn is afflicted in the Ninth House he makes a narrow-minded bigot, critical and sarcastic; he also gives liability to trouble and loss through law, danger on voyages and trouble in foreign lands. SATURN IN THE TENTH HOUSE shows a strong self-reliant and ambitious spirit with the patience and perseverance which make a person destined to rise in life. It is the signature of the self-made man, self-made by all the sterling saturnine ventures, tact, foresight, honesty and systematic ap- plication to business. Such people are destined to become captains of in- dustry, presidents of banks or hold other high positions involving great re- sponsibility. When Saturn is afflicted or weak by the sign he nevertheless gives the person who has him in the Tenth House, ability to rise, but when he does"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"rise it is by underhanded trickery and questionable business methods which [PAGE 255]  SATURN THE PLANET OF SORROW in the end bring exposure, downfall and dishonor. It is said that Napoleon had Saturn in the Tenth House. SATURN IN THE ELEVENTH HOUSE when well-aspected gives friends among the aged and wealth who will be of benefit to the person in helping him to real- ize his hopes, wishes and ambitions; but when Saturn is afflicted here he should beware of seeking friends older than himself, for they will always endeavor to make use of him for personal ends and desert him when he is no longer of use to them. SATURN IN THE TWELFTH HOUSE gives a secluded life in a position or oc- cupation where the person does not come into contact with the general pub- lic. When well-aspected it is good for success in an official capacity in public institutions, asylums, hospitals or prisons. When afflicted there is danger of being bed-ridden for many years, imprisoned, or employed in ob- scure positions.  SATURN IN THE TWELVE SIGNS SATURN IN ARIES is weak and therefore unable to express his best qualities to their full and legitimate extent even if well-aspected. Never- theless he gives a minor measure of poise, self-reliance, discretion and tact, industry, patience and perseverance. But when Saturn is afflicted in [PAGE 256]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Aries the person is quickly angered and apt to hold spite, and also of a jealous, malicious, and vindictive disposition. SATURN IN TAURUS when well-aspected makes a person slow of speech but that he says will have weight and be well worth hearing. It gives a quiet disposition, slow to decide, but stubborn in maintaining a position once taken. These people are close-mouthed, and my be trusted to keep their own and other people's secrets well. When Saturn is afflicted in Taurus, par- ticularly by Mercury he always causes trouble with the speech and gives a quick temper, especially if Mars is also an afflicting planet. This posi- tion makes financial difficulties. SATURN IN GEMINI when well-aspected gives a deep, one-pointed, orderly and scientific mind, adaptable to circumstances and able to cope with all the exigencies of life. Love of mathematics is usually pronounced and when literature is taken up as a vocation the more serious branches devoted to industrial and mechanical subjects are preferred. When Saturn is afflicted"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"in Gemini, it gives trouble through brothers and sisters, literature and law, danger on short journeys.

Nevertheless he gives reliable judgment concerning houses, lands, mines etc., and gains by investing in these things; when well-aspected, he favors thrift, economy and solid comfort in the home with quiet, peaceful and comfortable conditions in the latter part of life. He makes the person frugal and gives a good con- trol of the appetite. But when afflicted he indicates domestic infelicity, the person being held back in life by a gloomy kill-joy partner who is al- ways restraining every ambitious thought. Trouble, sorrow and disappoint- ment increase as the life advances and to this is added ill-health, for Sat- urn in Cancer indicates that the stomach is weak and the gums subject to pyorrhoea, hence there is inability to properly digest the food, so that un- less such people have sufficient will to curb their appetites they become the victims to chronic indigestion. Saturn in Cancer also indicates a reli- gious tendency and an inclination toward study of the deeper sciences. SATURN IN LEO when well-aspected gives favor from people higher in the social scale and success in obtaining public appointments where the Satur- nine virtues, tact, diplomacy, discretion and system, honor and executive [PAGE 258]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS ability are required. The constitution of these people is not overly strong by they may maintain perfect health by the conservation of energy as indi- cated by Saturn. When Saturn is afflicted in Leo however, they are cruel and quick-tempered, jealous, and do not scruple to stoop to underhanded methods to satisfy an ambition. This position also indicates heart trouble. SATURN IN VIRGO gives a studious, deep, scientific mind of studying the deeper problems of life. It indicates an innate ability to manage others. It gives a thrifty, economical and frugal nature, but when Saturn is af- flicted in Virgo the mind usually centers upon disease and the person be- comes a confirmed hypochondriac. These people are the nest customers of the patent medicine vendors for most of their ills are usually imaginary. This position does however, carry with it a liability to intestinal diseases. SATURN IN LIBRA is exalted and very strong and therefore his good aspects bring out all the fine saturnine qualities and on that account secure for the person public esteem and recognition. The marriage partner is chaste and pure as gold. This position also brings good health and long life, but when Saturn is afflicted in Libra the marriage partner is either treacherous or removed by an early death. If the person goes to law he is likely to lose, and become the object of public disfavor. He will also be subject to"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"[PAGE 259]  SATURN THE PLANET OF SORROW urinary troubles. SATURN IN SCORPIO when well-aspected gives a rare mechanical turn to the mind, a resourcefulness under the most difficult conditions, an indomitable courage and a patient persistence before which even the most difficult con- struction problems must give way. Hence such people make exceedingly able engineers and are invaluable in all pioneer undertakings; they blend the fire of Mars with the forethought of Saturn and are therefore invincible. They gain by legacy, economy and thrift and their financial fortunes are much improved after marriage. Good health and a long life are also indi- cated, but when Saturn is afflicted in Scorpio the marriage partner is poor, dull, egotistical and exacting and the person is liable to worry and ill-health; constipation and piles are the basic causes when then affect the nerves and the whole system. SATURN IN SAGITTARIUS when well-aspected gives a charitable and philan- thropic disposition with a desire to elevate humanity by self-help under just laws and true religious impulse. It couples all the saturnine virtues with the benevolent Jupiterian spirit of aspiration so that such people al- ways aim to work for the public good according to their ability and station in life. Therefore they are trusted, honored, respected and in much demand [PAGE 260]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS for positions where these qualities are of value, in social, industrial or religious circles. When Saturn is afflicted in Sagittarius he makes the person insincere, cynical and sarcastic, ambitious to fill positions of trust and honor but for selfish purposes, liable to become involved in law and lose thereby. This position also affects the lungs and the person should be very careful not to catch cold. SATURN IN CAPRICORN when well-aspected is strong and therefore his vir- tues are also pronounced, with honesty and integrity as staunch as the Rock of Gilbraltar and the determination to work toward the desired goal no mat- ter how long it may take. Hence in spite of all handicaps and obstacles people with a well-aspected Saturn in Capricorn ultimately achieve a large measure of success and are generally esteemed by their contemporaries. But when Saturn is afflicted in Capricorn the mind is gloomy and the person sees life from a biased point of view. There is a general sense of dissatisfac- tion which sometimes develops into a diseased mind. These people are cun- ning, underhanded and not to be trusted. SATURN IN AQUARIUS when well-aspected gives a humane outlook upon life, a sympathetic and friendly disposition, very distinct and deliberate speech and a seriousness in all affairs of life. These people therefore make"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"friends among the aged, the wealthy and the intellectual who are able to [PAGE 261]  SATURN THE PLANET OF SORROW help then rise in life.

This position also carries with it a tendency to heart trouble and varicose veins. SATURN IN PISCES when well-aspected gives a tendency to success in some quiet peaceful line of life where these people do not come into contact with the public, such as laboratory or research work or in connection with insti- tutions for the care of wards of the community; they are regular \"home-bodies\" but when Saturn is afflicted in Pisces it gives danger of confinement by a chronic disease or liability to imprisonment. The person makes many enemies who will be persistent in their persecution of him.  THE ASPECTS OF SATURN THE SUN SEXTILE OR TRINE SATURN endows the person who is fortunate enough to have it with some of the finest faculties in the gamut, for it brings out the best qualities in the two planets. It gives foresight, method and orga- nizing ability with the moral stamina to carry any project determined on to a successful conclusion despite delays and obstacles. Yet the person makes [PAGE 262]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS no enemies in so doing, for this configuration also makes him the soul of honor, kind and considerate; he would never stoop to do anything mean for he is sincere and just in his dealings with all men, but on the other hand, when he believes a certain course of action to be right he will never swerve there from through heaven and earth be moved against him. These aspects bring success in political and judicial positions, also in connection with mining or agriculture. The person often benefits by legacy, but recognition and success are generally delayed till middle life. THE SUN CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL SATURN. Either aspect has a very detri- mental effect upon health, especially in the common signs where the resis- tance is fundamentally low; in Gemini, Sagittarius and Pisces it gives a tendency to tuberculosis. It does least damage in the fixed signs where the resistance is greatest, but when sickness does get a grip on the person it hangs on like grim death, for this configuration lessens the power of the body to throw off disease quickly, hence recuperation is very slow. This is especially true in a man's horoscope; in a woman's figure it affects her husband's health."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" THE SUN SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO SATURN. These aspects are adverse to that which is generally termed success, but they give an abundance of [PAGE 263]  SATURN THE PLANET OF SORROW experience, so they are excellent form the standpoint of the soul. It may truly be said of the person who has either that \"the best-laid plans of mice and men gang aft agely,\" for no matter how carefully be may plan his affairs he will be subjected to delays and meet obstacles which will thwart his de- sires; his marriage often is unhappy and is likely to end in divorce or early death of the partner; there is difficulty in finding and keeping em- ployment, trouble with employers and authorities, a feeling as if he were held in leash all his life and denied expression in any direction. These are the outward experiences but they are generated by the inner nature, and until that changes he must suffer the whiplash of necessity. In the first place such a person has a tendency to crawl into a shall and shut himself in and others out. He is pessimistic and a kill-joy, has little or no regard for the feelings of others and is very obstinate. In the horoscope of a woman it signifies marriage to one much older, a person who will hold her with a very tight rein; it augurs death of the husband and often several marriages which are terminated by death or divorce. These configurations often bring legacies but either there is trouble and litigation over the bequests, or the person squanders the estate after he receives it. If Saturn is in Libra, his exaltation-sign, the latter part of the life may be better because the person has taken the lessons of life to [PAGE 264]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS heart and mended his ways. VENUS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO SATURN. The good qualities of Venus are love and affection and the good qualities of Saturn are tact, diplomacy , method and system, justice, thrift and economy, and we may therefore judge that when these two planets are configurated in good aspect they make the person faithful and true, just and honorable, diplomatic and tactful, systematic and methodical, qualities which make for success in all departments of life. Therefore a person with these aspects will be much sought as a friend and adviser, or as a person to be trusted with any commission requiring sterling honesty and ability. The make him simple in his tastes and of impeachable morality. Hence either is what one may call one of the luckiest aspects in the gamut. VENUS PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO SATURN brings out the evil qualities of the two planets and troubles which are thus generated"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"usually come through the person's relations with the opposite sex. It makes him underhanded and scheming to gratify his passions, often in an unusual manner, and his perverted desires are usually directed against someone who is much younger than himself. If regular marriage relations are entered into, such a person is often a demon of jealously which makes life a burden [PAGE 265]  SATURN THE PLANET OF SORROW for the marriage partner on account of his suspicious nature. People with these afflictions are also stingy in all money matters and exceedingly avaricious. They have very poor business judgment and are therefore liable to losses, failure and bankruptcy. During the earlier years people with these configurations should beware of dealings with older people who will be prone to take advantage of them, but later on it will be their turn to prey upon the young. MERCURY SEXTILE OR TRINE TO SATURN acts as a brake upon the flighty mind and gives it a seriousness, depth and concentration which is of inestimable value in life. The forethought and profound reasoning ability indicated by these aspects insure success in whatever vocation the person may pursue. The patient persistence which permits no temporary failure to stand in the way of ultimate success, also caution and diplomacy make such people invin- cible in the long run. Therefore they generally become prominent in connec- tion with some serious enterprise such as secret societies, the church or even in politics. They are in demand for high positions where a steady hand is required on the helm. But they do not usually shine for they are very quiet, subdued and serious in their manner and demeanor. They are absolute- [PAGE 266]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS ly honest, hence they make the very finest judges obtainable. MERCURY CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO SATURN. These aspects also give depth to the mind and forethought, together with all the other good qualities enu- merated as resulting from the sextile or the trine, if Mercury is otherwise well-aspected; but not in so full a measure, or at any rate the person does not seem to be able to externalize them as readily, hence does not meet the same assured success as given by the definitely good aspects; he also suf- fers from the tendency to melancholy denoted by the square or opposition, especially if the aspect occurs in one of the common signs or in Capricorn, and if in Gemini it interferes sadly with the dexterity; such people tend to drop everything they take into their hands. These aspects also give an em- barrassing timidity and if Mercury is afflicted the undesirable qualities enumerated as resulting from the square or opposition may be looked for. MERCURY SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO SATURN makes the person subject to"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"trouble and delays all through life. He is thwarted on every hand by slan- der and secret enemies and this condition in time makes him bitter and sar- castic with the additional consequence that he is shunned by all who can possibly get away from him, and that in time leads him to become a recluse [PAGE 267]  SATURN THE PLANET OF SORROW who shuts himself away to brood over his troubles. Such a person sometimes becomes a subject of melancholia of a most piteous character. These aspects also make the person cunning and untruthful. They give the same desire to study the occult conferred by the good aspects, but there is the great dif- ference that while the good aspects of Saturn and Mercury incline to the study of occultism from unselfish motives the bad aspects impel him to fer- ret out nature's secrets for person power or gain. THE MOON SEXTILE OR TRINE TO SATURN imparts all the best saturnine qualities tot he mind; it makes the person self-reliant, serious, sober and systematic, careful and thrifty in business affairs and gives success in life through tactful and diplomatic dealings with others. Such people are eminently reasonable and trustworthy in all matters of honor and justice and gain great esteem in the community on that account. Their patience and per- sistence are inexhaustible. THE MOON CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO SATURN is not always to be classed as a bad aspect so far as the mental qualities go, for in any case it deepens the mind and gives greater power of concentration, but if Saturn is strong by sign, in Libra or Capricorn, and the Moon is otherwise well-aspected this position also will impart the virtues of Saturn, through under all condi- [PAGE 268]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS tions it makes the mind gloomy and the person is subject to periodical spells of melancholy; but if Saturn is weak by sign, especially if he is in Aries and if the Moon is otherwise afflicted, then his conjunction is to be judged and read the same as the square and opposition The effect of the conjunction also depends upon the department of life we are considering; for instance, the conjunction of the Moon and Saturn is good for concentration of the mind, but bad for the digestion, particularly in a woman's horoscope, where it has also the tendency to obstruct the menses with all that that im- plies, and in a man's horoscope it indicates the death of the marriage part- ner. Similar distinctions should be made when reading the conjunctions of the so-called malefics. THE MOONSQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO SATURN is one of the signatures of sor- row in life, for it makes the mind melancholy and full of worries so that the person is constantly carrying an atmosphere of gloom with him and as"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"thoughts are things this attitude of mind brings about delays and disap- pointments in every department of life. Such a person will experience dif- ficulties from persons and things signified by Saturn, probably parents, and if he has money he may lose it and have difficulty in getting more. Thus he [PAGE 269]  SATURN, THE PLANT OF SORROW may be in poverty all his life. He will make more enemies than friends and become subject to slander and scandal, but the disfavor he meets is undoubt- edly merited for these aspects make the mind bitter and selfish and such people are unscrupulous, avaricious and entirely unfeeling with respect to others, hence they are under the whiplash of Saturn that the sorrow and troubles which they themselves are constantly feeling may make them more mellow. If the aspect is six, five or even four degrees from being exact and if Saturn is in his exaltation sign Libra these aspects are not quite so evil in the latter part of life. They may then imply that the person has learned his lesson and as a consequence he may find himself in easier cir- cumstances. The adverse aspects of Saturn to the Moon are very had for the health, particularly in the woman's horoscope. There they indicate obstruc- tions of the female functions. In the man's horoscope they either deny mar- riage or indicate the death of the marriage partner and their general ten- dency is to obstruct everything connected with the houses and signs wherein they are placed in the horoscope. JUPITER SEXTILE OR TRINE TO SATURN gives a strong character with a deep and profoundly philosophical mind, a benevolent disposition with a strong sense of justice and fair play. All the virtues of Saturn and Jupiter are [PAGE 270]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS combined by these aspects and people in whose horoscope they are found will consequently gain honor and esteem in the community where they are. They will be looked upon as the pillars of society and gain prosperity commensu- rate with the environment in which they are placed, for these aspects give sound financial judgment, the ability to grasp opportunity when it is met, benevolence, devotion to duty, religion and all good objects in life. JUPITER PARALLEL OR CONJUNCTION SATURN has the same beneficent influence as the sextile or trine, though not in as great a measure and if Jupiter is weak by sign or otherwise afflicted the aspects will probably count for very little, but in that case its effect upon the arterial circulation will be obstructive, giving a tendency to sclerosis of the arteries the same as the opposition and square. JUPITER SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO SATURN gives a diffident, vacillating mind unable to form decisions, always distrustful of others, indolent and"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"inclined to drift with the tide, often a ward of society either in the poor-house or the prison, for the character is basically dishonest. These aspects also give a tendency to arterio-sclerosis. [PAGE 271]  SATURN THE PLANET OF SORROW MARS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO SATURN gives a capable, determined and ener- getic nature capable of intense and sustained actions and of obtaining un- usual results thereby. The executive ability, dominant forcefulness and en- durance of these people are remarkable and consequently they are constantly accomplishing that others cannot achieve. On account of these qualities they always rise to prominent positions and are much esteemed on account of their ability but seldom liked for these aspects also make the character cruel and hard. They give a strong physique and general good health. MARS CONJUNCTION, PARALLEL, SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO SATURN. These are thoroughly bad aspects indicating a selfish, violent, harsh and cruel na- ture, quick-tempered and vindictive, absolutely dishonest and untruthful; unscrupulous and liable to public disgrace and imprisonment, also to acci- dent and a violent death, but if one of the planets is essentially dignified or exalted the evil influence is much enhanced. It should also be remem- bered that such serious defects do not result from one aspect alone and if the other configurations in the horoscope are good the foregoing delineation will only apply in a very mild measure. URANUS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO SATURN is fortunate for a public career in an officially capacity for it gives ambition and determination with ability to [PAGE 272]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS concentrate upon large problems and exercise authority, plan upon large problems and exercise authority, plan and systematize. It strengthens the intuition so that such people are guided by an interior insight when new and important steps have to be taken, therefore they are in demand and find po- sitions with large corporations where they win their way through sheer abil- ity. The mind is both mechanical and ingenious, hence this position often denotes the successful inventor, particularly along the lines of electri- city. URANUS CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO SATURN has an influence like the good aspects of the planets are elevated, in angles, essentially dignified or ex- alted, as Saturn in Libra or Capricorn or Uranus in Aquarius or Scorpio; but if the conjunction occurs in signs where either of the planets is weak, like Aries, Taurus, Cancer, or Leo then the influence will be detrimental and should be judged the same as the square or opposition."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" URANUS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO SATURN gives an unscrupulous, dishonest nature with an extremely violent temper. The outbursts are as sudden as a bolt from the blue and exhaust the person completely. These people are very eccentric and look at everything from a peculiar angle; they are treacher- ous, idle, indolent and altogether dangerous to the community. These [PAGE 273]  SATURN THE PLANET OF SORROW aspects also indicate chronic or incurable diseases according to the signs wherein they are placed, but as said, if the other indications in the horo- scope are good the influence of a single aspect will not bring out such evil characteristics and therefore the whole horoscope is to be carefully consid- ered before judging the influence enumerated for they may be materially minimized by favorable indications in the horoscope. NEPTUNE SEXTILE OR TRINE TO SATURN is good for success in worldly affairs for it brings out the saturnine virtues--honor, self-reliance, determina- tion, etc., by which the person gains the confidence and esteem of others, but the principal effect is spiritual and therefore only felt by those who are able to respond because of other aspects in the horoscope. To them it gives the ability to delve deeply into occult and mystical subjects, also to become proficient in the art and practice of them. NEPTUNE CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO SATURN has the same effect as the good aspects when it occurs in a sign where either of the planets are strong as Neptune is in Cancer and Pisces and Saturn in Libra and Capricorn. NEPTUNE SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO SATURN lays the person liable to loss by deception, treachery or fraud. [PAGE 274]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CHAPTER XIII  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE From each of the divine Hierarchies which have ministered at birth and evolution of humanity we have received certain qualities and faculties upon which we are being nursed from nescience to omniscience and from impotence to omnipotence in life's great school. From the Lords of Venus we received the priceless gift of love which links humanity in the tenderest affection of varying degrees and makes life beautiful. From the Lords of Mercury we received the no less valuable gift of mind which enables us to conquer the material world and provide ourselves with the comforts of life, but some- thing more is needed. The divine spark within us is every seeking an outlet and the greater the two qualities of love and intellect grow, the stronger"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"the upward urge, but this cannot be fully satisfied either if the Spirit seeks to raise itself to its divine source only through the love nature ex- pressed by Venus and culminating in its higher octave Uranus. The religious fervor then expresses itself as devotion of the most sublime nature but there is still a lack. Feeling without knowledge is incomplete. Nor can the inner urge be satisfied if through the mercurial channel of intellect it attempts to raise itself to the spiritual perception of Neptune, the higher [PAGE 275]  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE octave of Mercury, for though the intellect be sharp as a razor it is of no account when it is devoid of love. It therefore follows that ONLY BY THE WEDDING OF LOVE AND INTELLECT CAN WISDOM BE BORN. The mercurial knowledge in itself, through neither good nor evil, may be used for one purpose or the other. Even genius shows only the bent of this knowledge. We speak of a military genius, one who has a wonderful knowledge of the tactics of war, but a man of war, whether he be a Napoleon or a common soldier, is not be be classed as wise because he deliberately crushes the finer feelings of which we take the heart as symbol. Only when the mercurial faculty of mind is tempered, blended and balanced by the heart-born faculty of love generated by the Venus ray, is wisdom born of the union. And this is the quality which the planetary spirit of Jupiter is seeking to infuse into mankind to aid them in their spiritual evolution that they may rise above the material plane and soar to higher spheres. Therefore the Jupiterian ray makes people human, honorable, courteous, refined and generous, law-abiding and reli- gious, cheerful and optimistic. The true Jupiterian is aptly described as a jovial fellow, and he is usually large but his heart is almost too big to find room even within his capacious chest. The corners of his mouth are al- ways turned upward with a broad smile that can only be described as radiant and in his hearty good-feeling he is so demonstrative that when he shakes your hand the ligaments of your arm are almost sprained. He is \"hail [PAGE 276]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS fellow well met\" with everybody, always ready to give anything or anybody a boost. He seems actually grateful to you when you ask him to do you a favor and is never so happy as when working hard to help others. He would not harm a child and never gets angry on his own account but when moved to righteous indignation on account of the wrongs of others then he may be ter- rible in his wrath, yet he will never be cruel to the aggressor or the op- pressor, but show mercy and kindness even to them as soon as they have been vanquished. Such is the pure Jupiterian, but of course he is very seldom found at the present time. Nevertheless, an increasing number of people are beginning to walk the way of wisdom and show the Jupiterian traits. It is said that \"Opportunity knocks at every man's door,\" yet we often"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"hear people bewail their fate because they \"never had a chance.\" Saturn is blamed for our misfortunes when we have learned to study Astrology; we are so intently on the lookout for evil that we usually forget to look for the good, and thus miss our opportunity. It takes Saturn thirty years to go around the horoscope, by transit, and form aspects to all planets, but Jupi- ter, the most beneficent influence in the solar system, goes around once in eleven years and thus the good fortunes which he may brings are at least three times as numerous as the misfortunes brought by Saturn's evil aspects. As a matter of fact, we get from others just what we give, each is [PAGE 277]  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE surrounded by a subtle auric atmosphere which colors our views of others, and the thoughts, ideas and actions of others towards us. If we harbor meanness in our hearts, that colors this atmosphere so that we see meanness in others and in their actions towards us, we awaken this trait in them, as vibrations from a tuning-fork start another of the same pitch to sing. On the other had, if we cultivate the Jupiterian qualities of benevolence, his expansive smile, his cordial attitude of mind, etc., we shall soon feel the response in our circle of acquaintances and the beneficent aspect of Jupiter will them have greater effect in making our life and work pleasant. Jupiter is essentially dignified when found in Pisces, or in Sagittarius, the sign of aspiration. He is exalted in Cancer, the house of the Moon, for the seed-atom which furnishes the body of the incoming Ego is protected by the Moon into the sphere of Cancer but in Jupiter represents the spiritual part and therefore he presides at the ingress of the Ego itself into the body. He also rules the blood in which the indwelling spirit finds expres- sion, though his activities are confined principally to the arterial circu- lation. He furthers assimilation and growth, and therefore he also rules the liver. (Saturn rules the gall bladder.) Jupiterians are very fond of show and display. In their religious observances they love ceremonial and they are rather partial to the established church but often dislike any \"ism\" not sanctioned by society or correct form. [PAGE 278]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS When Jupiter is afflicted his influence makes the person lawless, sensu- ous, self-indulgent, gluttonous, extravagant and careless in the payment of his obligations, hence liable to loss of health, trouble with the law and consequent social disgrace. An afflicted Jupiter makes people sporty, fond of horse-racing and gambling.  JUPITER IN THE TWELVE HOUSES"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" JUPITER IN THE FIRST HOUSE when well-aspected is a good sign of health and general fortune in life. It gives a good-natured, kindly disposition, a nature which breathes cordiality, honor and uprightness. These people love pleasure, particularly out-of-doors, and are fond of traveling. They have considerable executive ability and are therefore sought for positions of im- portance and responsibility. There is an inclination to stoutness in later years. Jupiter afflicted on the Ascendant gives a tendency to self-indulgence, according to the sign wherein he is placed. If in Cancer the person becomes an inveterate glutton and literally makes a god of his stomach with the in- evitable result that in the course of years he becomes excessively stout, the liver being particularly enlarged and as a consequence he is subjected to sickness of a serious nature. In Sagittarius it makes him an inveterate gambler who would stake his soul on the toss of a coin. In Pisces he [PAGE 279]  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE becomes an incurable drunkard, in Scorpio a sensualist of the worst nature and so on with the other signs. It may also be said that whenever Jupiter is afflicted on the Ascendant the health suffers through some corruption of the blood. JUPITER IN THE SECOND HOUSE when well-aspected, particularly by the Sun or Moon, gives great financial prosperity in life and this is a fortunate position in that respect even when Jupiter is afflicted, but then the person is liable to loss under bad directions. When Jupiter is unaspected he gives no help; the person may then be poor and starve. JUPITER IN THE THIRD HOUSE when well-aspected gives a mind of a highly optimistic nature so that no matter what other obstacles there may be in life the person who has this position will always look at the silver lining of the cloud and in so doing forget the cloud itself. He will have excep- tional educational advantages and what is more the education which he re- ceives will be of great benefit to him. He will be popular among his broth- ers, sisters and neighbors and they will help to benefit him. Success is indicated by traveling, writing and publications. When Jupiter is afflicted in the Third House the person is liable to be in wrecks and accidents while traveling, but he will not be injured though he escape only by a hair- [PAGE 280]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS breadth. If Saturn afflicts he will become careless and indolent, thus for- feiting the respect and esteem of his immediate family, but if Mars is ad- verse they will mistrust him because of rash and imprudent acts."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" JUPITER IN THE FOURTH HOUSE when well-aspected is most fortunate for the home conditions, especially in the latter part of life. People with Jupiter in this position will do better in their place of birth than anywhere else. They will receive considerable help from the parents and probably an inher- itance from them. Their business affairs will be on a solid basis and run smoothly so that at the close of life there will be a considerable accumula- tion according to their station and the opportunities of their environment. They pass their days in peace and end them amid friends, wealth and prosperity. But when Jupiter is afflicted in the Fourth House the person should leave his native town early in life for the conditions there will be detrimental to this success. Lavish and extravagant expenditure, love of display and kindred costly tendencies will sap his resources and bring him into bankruptcy; besides a false pride will keep him from undertaking a radical reform even when he has awakened to the fact that he ought to do so if he would save himself and the only way out of it to make a new start will [PAGE 281]  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE be removal to another city. JUPITER IN THE FIFTH HOUSE and well-aspected increases the number of children and they will bring much profit and pleasure to the parents; it gives popularity and good friends who will be a help to the person, also a sociable and pleasure loving disposition. Gain by speculation is foreshown, high intelligence and success in educational work or the publishing or news- paper business. These people make fine teachers and have a very convincing way of putting things. If Jupiter is afflicted in the Fifth House, espe- cially in Sagittarius, it gives a tendency towards gambling and loss thereby, a love of sports, disinclination for work, and trouble with chil- dren. JUPITER IN THE SIXTH HOUSE gives good health and success in the care and cure of the sick, faithful servants, and the respect and esteem of all with whom the person comes in contact in the course of his occupation. But when Jupiter is afflicted in the Sixth House it gives a tendency toward liver troubles, enlargement of the liver, obesity and general disorders produced by over-indulgence of the appetite. JUPITER IN THE SEVENTH HOUSE gives a noble, great-hearted and sympathetic marriage partner who will bring the person favor, fortune and social [PAGE 282]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS prestige. It is an ideal indication for marriage, also for a person seeking to take a partner or enter into partnership. He may also be assured that the partner will be noble, sincere, honest and trust-worthy, and that suc-"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"cess will come by co-operation. It is an ideal position for a lawyer for it indicates success in law and the ability to reconcile opponents. But if Ju- piter is weak of afflicted the person will lose his lawsuits or suffer by misplaced confidence in his partner; marriage will be delayed or denied and when consummated trouble will arise through the indolence and self-indulgent habits of the marriage partner. Therefore wisdom would dictate that the person avoid such relationships. JUPITER IN THE EIGHTH HOUSE when well-aspected indicates financial gain by marriage, partnerships or legacy, but when weak or afflicted it indicates lawsuits and losses in connection with these matters. A well-aspected Jupi- ter in the Eighth House is also a sign of an easy and peaceful termination of the life when the full course has been run. JUPITER IN THE NINTH HOUSE gives a peaceful, noble, optimistic and kind-hearted disposition, with religious tendencies, broad-minded and tolerant of the opinions of others, but favoring the more orthodox and es- tablished lines of thought. The person is much esteemed in society and apt [PAGE 283]  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE to occupy prominent positions in church, state or in institutions of learn- ing or philanthropic associations. This position also gives a love of travel with pleasure and gain thereby. But when weak or afflicted by sign or aspect it gives arrogance and love of display which is our of proportion with the person's pocketbook, consequently there are lawsuits and liability to social discredit. It also shows danger when traveling. JUPITER IN THE TENTH HOUSE when well-aspected is one of the best indica- tion of an eminently successful and virtuous life, especially if he is sup- ported by Saturn, Sun and Moon, for then the person will rise to a high po- sition in the church, state or law and gain great wealth, honor and social esteem. Furthermore he will deserve all he gets for the character will be of superlative nobility. But if Jupiter be weak or afflicted in the Tenth House, particularly by Saturn or the luminaries, it shows that the character is not reliable. The person may rise but his evil deeds will find him out and therefore he will experience reversals of fortune and loss of prestige. JUPITER IN THE ELEVENTH HOUSE and well-aspected gives wealthy and influ- ential friends who may be relied upon to help the person to realize his hopes, wishes and ambitions. It also gives a sociable disposition and fond- ness for pleasure. In a man's horoscope it signifies that the marriage will [PAGE 284]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS be fruitful and that his children will be a credit and a help to him, but"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"before judgment is rendered in this respect the wife's horoscope should also be examined to see whether it concurs, for if not then the judgment must be modified. When Jupiter is afflicted in the Eleventh House either the person meets friends who are good and sincere in their desire to help him but lack the ability or less the friends whom he attracts come to him to be ben- efited. In either case he will not be helped much by friends but must de- pend upon his own resources to attain his desires. JUPITER IN THE TWELFTH HOUSE when well-aspected brings gain and success through occupations carried on in comparative seclusion such as laboratory work, work in hospitals or asylums in an executive capacity; or in a posi- tion in one of the fraternal orders which have to do with sick benefits or in the study and practice of the mystical or occult arts. If people with Jupiter in this position are personally indigent they receive much bounty from people or institutions of a fraternal or charitable nature, but if they are well-to-do they give lavishly to these purposes. If they have enemies they also have a way of turning them to friends. If Jupiter is afflicted it makes the person indolent and improvident so that in time he usually becomes the ward of one of the charitable institutions where he lives till the end [PAGE 285]  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE of life without either trouble or worry.  JUPITER IN THE TWELVE SIGNS JUPITER IN ARIES gives a high-spirited, energetic and ambitious mind, al- ways on the lookout and alert for new and progressive methods usable for ad- vancement in the world's work, it makes a true pioneer, neither too conser- vative not too impulsive, a thoughtful, but sympathetic disposition, sincere, honest and trustworthy, somewhat religiously inclined. It gives some legal of literary ability and a love of out-door games with popularity in social and business circles. But if Jupiter is afflicted the mind is not so conservative and well-balanced. There is a tendency to rash and impul- sive acts; impatience and temper are shown under adverse circumstances with a consequent loss of esteem and popularity. JUPITER IN TAURUS when well-aspected gives an eminently kind and sympa- thetic nature to all people but a deep-seated, tender and warm love for those towards whom the relationship warrants such expression. This position also attracts wealth and gives a generous disposition to aid in philan- thropic enterprises; yet Jupiter in the Second House or second sign is never lavish or extravagantly generous but rather conservative and inclined to in- vestigate the merits of any proposition before he extends a helping hand. On [PAGE 286]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"the other hand he is absolutely open-handed to those who are near and dear to him. His home and his family are all in all. When Jupiter is afflicted in Taurus it inclines to extravagant expenditures for show, display and gratification of the lower nature. Such people are great gourmandizers, fond of rich and savory foods that tickle the palate. They often experience financial difficulties and trouble with creditors, also such sickness as may result from the over-indulgence of their appetites according to other indi- cations of the stars. JUPITER IN GEMINI when well-aspected gives literary ability of a high class and if that is backed by the necessary education success in this line in certain. This position also gives an inventive turn to the mind, a love of mathematics and an attraction towards the occult. Jupiter in Gemini shows that travel will bring both pleasure and profit and it gives an honor- able, courteous and friendly disposition. But if Jupiter is afflicted the person is liable to meet with losses and trouble when traveling. He will have a number of hair-breadth escapes from accidents, legal and religious trouble, also difficulties with brothers, sisters and close relatives. JUPITER IN CANCER. The full effect of Jupiter for good or ill is never felt until the middle life and this is especially the case when he is placed [PAGE 287]  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE in the Fourth House or fourth sign, Cancer. When well-placed there he gives an exceedingly kindly and courteous disposition, that is at peace with all the world; he is endowed with a most vivid and fruitful imagination, a dreamer of Utopian dreams and a lover of the occult and mystical. There is also however, a practical side to the nature which makes him ambitious to attain worldly success and fortunate in his investment in houses, lands or mines, so that he will accumulate property and be well-to-do especially af- ter middle life. this position also indicates that the person may receive much help from his parents during life and an inheritance after their death. Jupiter in Cancer makes the person very fond of the pleasures of the table but if well-aspected he will probably keep himself within such bounds that his health does not suffer. If however, Jupiter is afflicted it inclines to inordinate gluttony which will eventually corrupt the blood and cause such disease and noxious growths as result from that condition. JUPITER IN LEO gives a truly noble nature, blending kindness and courage, self-reliance and loyalty, self-restraint and compassion, mercy and justice. It indicates, in short, a paragon of virtues nowhere excelled. It gives an abundance of vitality and a strong constitution so that it marks a leader [PAGE 288]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"physically, morally and spiritually, nor will such a person ever be content to follow. He craves positions of trust and responsibility, the greater the better. He will always be equal to the occasion and never abuse the confi- dence of those who have placed him there. Such people have an innate cul- ture and refinement. They are fond of everything that tends to the uplift of humanity, religious, sincere; sure to win recognition and success dealing in speculative investments. When Jupiter is afflicted in Leo the person be- comes cruel and sensuous, abnormally fond of pleasure and subject to loss by investments, speculation and gambling. JUPITER IN VIRGO gives a cautious, analytical and practical nature with an almost unerring faculty for discriminating between the seeming and the real, for sifting truth from error and arriving at facts. They cannot fer- ret out secrets by underhanded methods as Saturn in Capricorn which makes an ideal detective, but if Jupiter in Virgo is the judge no one is clever enough to hide the truth from him. A well-aspected Jupiter in Virgo indi- cates success with servants who will be found faithful and loyal, ready to do their master's bidding. It also indicates prosperity through business or professional vocations; but if Jupiter is afflicted in Virgo it gives a cynical carping and critical disposition, mistrustful of others and there- [PAGE 289]  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE fore liable to loss through servants or employees. Such people cannot suc- ceed in business and they will find it extremely difficult to obtain or keep a position. At any rate they will serve in a very inferior capacity. JUPITER IN LIBRA when well-aspected gives a kind, sympathetic and loving disposition, a conscientious, sociable and benevolent nature and an interest in all that makes for the uplift of humanity--music, art, literature, social intercourse, et cetera. On that account the person is popular, particularly with the opposite sex from whence gain and benefit may be expected. Success in the business and public life are shown. But if Jupiter is afflicted in Libra undue indulgence of the lower nature will bring trouble and public scandal with a consequent loss of popularity and prestige. JUPITER IN SCORPIO gives an ardent, aggressive and self-reliant nature, an enthusiastic, constructive and resourceful mind with the ability to meet all the exigencies of life in an efficient manner and it ensures success in practical everyday occupations, gives a large family and plenty of means to provide for them. This position also shows a tendency towards occult inves- tigations. But if Jupiter is afflicted in Scorpio it will bring loss and trouble through the indulgence of the lower nature in an inordinate measure, love of rich an expensive good and sickness on that account."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"[PAGE 290]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS JUPITER IN SAGITTARIUS when well-aspected gives good fortune and general success in life, a humane, broad and philosophical mind, a reverent and re- ligious disposition. Hence people with this position rise to the top and become leaders in their various spheres of life, finding places of prominence in church or state, scientific or philosophic enterprises or in- stitutions. If Jupiter is afflicted in Sagittarius it makes the person sporty, fond of cheap and gaudy display, extravagant and ready to take a chance on any gamble, causes loss of social standing if born in a better en- vironment, trouble through law, financial difficulties, narrow-minded sec- tarian views if incline to be religious. JUPITER IN CAPRICORN gives an ambitious nature, self-reliant and self-controlled with a desire to rise to a position of authority over others also the ability to dictate wisely and well. It gives a careful, economical disposition, and an abhorrence of waste; ingenuity, resourcefulness and some mechanical ability. These people are trust-worthy to a degree, sincere and honest in all their undertakings and hold every promise inviolate, therefore they usually rise to honor, esteem and general popularity. As already said their aim is to attain independence at the head of some business, but if [PAGE 291]  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE they do not succeed in that and have to work for others they are best suited to be in the employ of the government, either municipal or national. On ac- count of the implicit trust generated by their sterling characteristics of honesty, sincerity and faithfulness these people are often made the re- cipients of confidence from friends who feel the need of sharing their troubles with someone who can be depended upon either to give honest, disin- terested advice or else to keep the secrets told then inviolate. If Jupiter is afflicted in Capricorn it makes a miser who will hoard all he can scrape together and deny himself all except the barest necessities and is conse- quently despised by all who know him. JUPITER IN AQUARIUS when well-aspected gives a humane, optimistic, original and philosophic mind, fond of friends and the society of others particularly those who are interested in science or mysticism, literature and music, consequently he attracts people of that nature and they will be a benefit to him in helping him to realize his hopes, wishes and ambitions. He may possibly obtain a position of importance in some official capacity with secret or occult societies. This is a good indication of general suc- cess in life, but if Jupiter is afflicted it makes the nature restless, ner- vous and erratic with revolutionary or anarchistic ideas with disinclination"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"[PAGE 292]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS for serious work and such people are generally disliked and distrusted. JUPITER IN PISCES gives a charitable, sympathetic and hospitable nature which loves to minister to the outcasts of society. These people are veritable angels of mercy to all who suffer in body, soul or spirit. They are well known to those who are \"sick of in prison.\" Being of a sensitive nature and subject to the influences from the invisible world they not in- frequently have psychic experiences and become students of the occult. They love music, art and literature and if well-aspected by Venus, Jupiter in Pi- sces will give considerable ability as a performer; but if Jupiter is af- flicted in Pisces it gives a vacillating mind, a nerveless, cowardly nature indulging in all vices in the calendar and a generally despicable dispositon--a social parasite.  THE ASPECTS OF JUPITER THE SUN CONJUNCTION, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO JUPITER. The conjunction gives a tendency to apoplexy, especially if it occurs in Aries, but with that ex- ception we may say that these configurations are sure indications of health, wealth and happiness; they give the person an abundance of vitality which is proof even against very severe onslaughts of disease, and should a [PAGE 293]  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE particularly unfavorable planetary influence succeed in breaking down the constitutional resistance recovery will be so rapid as to seem miraculous. This nearly impregnable condition of health is all the more unassailable be- cause it is backed by a disposition at once \"sunny\" and \"jovial\" and that latter characteristic also makes the fortunate possessors of these aspects beloved by all with whom they come in contact; everybody is glad to see the person with the perpetual smile, but they do more than \"smile\"--they EARN the friendship universally bestowed upon them by deeds of kindness, by words of sympathy, cheer or hope as the occasion may demand. They are trusted by everybody for they never betray a trust; they have good clear heads, good judgment and executive ability so that they are well fitted to help others. These characteristics also favor their own financial fortunes so that they accumulate wealth, but theirs is never \"tainted money,\" they never benefit by the loss of others. They are conservatively religious and may be aptly described as \"pillars of society.\" They shine particularly in governmental offices. THE SUN SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO JUPITER gives a tendency to indulge in habits which are bad for the health; the person is far too fond of the \"good things in life\" and very selfish in supplying his own comforts; he exercises little and never denies himself, with the result that the circulation"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"[PAGE 294]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS becomes sluggish and as these people have a superabundance of blood their lassitude and indulgence is productive of various noxious growths and kin- dred disorders; sometimes a fit of anger raises the blood pressure to such a point that a vessel burst and ends the life or leaves the person thenceforth a useless wreck. These aspects give a bombastic, haughty disposition with an inordinate love of display and thus induce to extravagance both in social and business affairs with the result that the person sometimes finds himself involved in debt which he cannot pay and then there is but a step to the bankruptcy court. A false pride often prevents these people from working honestly for others so they would rather prey upon the public as gamblers where there is an opportunity to swindle other people and get what they call an \"easy\" living until then land in the meshes of the law. Children with these aspects should be given special training in self-restraint, thrift and honesty, above all, religion, for they have a tendency to scorn and scoff at religion, but perhaps a memory of a devout mother may help to keep them straight. VENUS CONJUNCTION, PARALLEL SEXTILE OR TRINE TO JUPITER is one of the best signs of success and general good fortune in life. It favors the [PAGE 295]  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE accumulation of wealth and the enjoyment of all the luxuries of life. It is a good indication of a successful and happy marriage, social prestige and the respect of all with whom the person comes in contact. It endows him with a jovial, optimistic, generous and large-hearted disposition, makes him honorable to a degree, interested and active in philanthropic measures, lib- eral in mind, tolerant of the views of others even where he differs radically, fond of pleasure, traveling, parties, and capable of enjoying life to the fullest extend; he loves expensive and ultra-comfortable things, a fine house, valuable books, pictures and other rich appointments. VENUS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO JUPITER gives the same luxurious likings as the good aspects but limits the ability to satisfy them; although such people make the most frantic efforts to present a fine front to the world they are generally found out to he shams. Their lack of business ability so often responsible for failure and bankruptcy and they are very liable to suffer losses through treachery of others. Love and marriage also are sources of sorrow for those whom Venus and Jupiter are afflicting. They are apt to be jilted before marriage or the marriage partner will prove faith- less and may desert them. These aspects also produce an amorous nature"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"[PAGE 296]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS likely to take liberties regardless of the laws of decency and make the per- son faithless to marriage vows. MERCURY CONJUNCTION, PARALLEL, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO JUPITER is one of the finest assets in life for it gives a cheerful, optimistic disposition with the ability to always look upon the bright side of things and keep up the spirits in the hours of adversity; the mind is broad, versatile and able to reason correctly and to form a reliable judgment be careful deliberation; these people never decide hastily; they require time to think over what is presented to them, but once they have reached a conclusion, it will be found incontrovertible. They are successful in law or literature and much re- spected for their honesty and sincerity. These aspects are particularly fortunate for people who travel for business or pleasure, for they will reap both benefit and enjoyment from a migratory mode of life. It will make them \"healthy, wealthy and wise\" beyond the average, loved by everybody for the vital vibration they radiate upon whomever they meet. MERCURY SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO JUPITER gives a vacillating and wavering disposition so that the person cannot make up his mind when more than one course of action is open, hence people with these aspects often lose their opportunities through procrastination and lack of judgment; they must [PAGE 297]  JUPITER, PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE therefore often be classed as failures. They are liable to scandal and slander because of treacherous associates, and should not ravel for it will bring them loss and trouble; they should also be extremely careful in making contracts or agreements to do or deliver certain things at a specified time for they will probably be unable to fulfill the requirements and thus trouble and loss will result. THE MOON PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO JUPITER gives an op- timistic, noble and generous disposition. The open-hearted honesty, fair- ness and friendliness of people with these aspects make them universally popular. These aspects strengthen both the reasoning faculties and consti- tution, so that such people usually have a strong mind in a strong body and hence a powerful personal magnetism which may be used to great advantage in healing the sick. They have lofty ideals and a fruitful imagination with the power of acquiring wealth which will grow greater if used in philan- thropic enterprises of which these people are prone to dream. This is one of the best aspects in the gamut and makes for general success in life both physically and spiritually. THE MOON SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO JUPITER impairs the reasoning faculties and brings the person trouble through litigation, lack of fore-thought and"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"[PAGE 298]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS indecision or dishonesty. People with these aspects are too fond of osten- tation aid display, extravagant beyond their means, lavish in their expendi- tures, prone to take desperate chances in gambling or speculation to reha- bilitate their fortunes and doomed to loss, slander and sometimes bankruptcy on that account. These aspects are also bad for health in a woman's horo- scope especially; they indicate digestive and liver troubles. SATURN SEXTILE OR TRINE TO JUPITER gives a strong character with a deep and profoundly philosophical mind, a benevolent disposition with a strong sense of justice and fair play. All the virtues of Saturn and Jupiter are combined by these aspects and people in whose horoscope they are found will consequently gain the honor and esteem of the community where they are. Thus they will be looked upon as pillars of society and gain prosperity com- mensurate with the environment in which they are placed, for these aspects give sound financial judgment and the ability to grasp the opportunity when it is met. SATURN CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO JUPITER has the same beneficent influ- ence as the sextile or trine through not in as great a measure and if Jupi- ter is weak by sign of otherwise afflicted the aspects will probably count for very little, bit in that case its effect upon the arterial circulation [PAGE 299]  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE will be obstructive, giving a tendency to sclerosis of the arteries the same as the opposition or square. SATURN SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO JUPITER gives a different, vacillating mind unable to form decisions, always distrustful of others, indolent and inclined to drift with the tide; often a ward of society either in the poor-house or the prison, for the character is basically dishonest. These aspects also give a tendency to arterio-sclerosis. MARS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO JUPITER. It is the nature of Jupiter to be somewhat conservative and dignified, but when blended with the fire of Mars it gives enthusiasm and an ability to influence of others and imbue them with the same feelings. It makes the nature noble, sincere, honest and straightforwarded. This aspect is also good for the financial prosperity of the person, for both Mars and Jupiter when well-aspected give good earning ability and favor accumulation. Jupiter is somewhat conservative in respect to expenditures, Mars is too free, but where the Martian and Jupiterian ten- dencies are blended by a good aspect the result is an ideal, generous na- ture, neither too lavish not too conservative, able to strike a happy me-"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"dium. These people have much ingenuity and constructive ability and whatever they do they put their whole heart in it. Hence they are success- ful in business, popular in society, fond of out-of-door sports and games. [PAGE 300]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS They love to travel and gain much pleasure by so doing. Mars rules the haemoglobin in the blood which is so important a factor in health and vital- ity, therefore the good aspects of Jupiter and Mars increase the red blood corpuscles with the result that people with these aspects have an abundance of health, vitality, power and endurance. MARS PARALLEL OR CONJUNCTION JUPITER strengthens the constitution and in- creases the vitality the same as the good aspects. It also indicates that the person is able to earn much money and uses it freely and generously, but the mental qualities are similar to those conferred by the bad aspects: sporty, swaggering, tricky, deceitful and untruthful, impulsive in judgment, but to be depended upon, and if the conjunction occurs in one of the watery signs, especially in Pisces, the person will probably be a drunkard, through this is not as certain as with the square or opposition. MARS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO JUPITER is the signature of the gambler and if one of the planets is in a watery sign, especially in Pisces, he will be a drunkard also, a tricky, dishonest and disreputable character who always acts through impulse. With respect to health we find that these people suf- fer principally from blood and liver complaints, the circulation is poor [PAGE 301]  JUPITER THE PLANET OF BENEVOLENCE and the blood is so rich that there is danger of apoplexy. URANUS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO JUPITER gives a broad, humane disposition and a tendency to delve into the occult arts and sciences. It favors an asso- ciation with secret orders and gives promise of prosperity in life. Such a person is honest and sincere, sociable, hospitable and likely to benefit a great deal from influential friends in official positions. This positions also gives executive ability and success in connection with institutions of learning. URANUS PARALLEL OR CONJUNCTION JUPITER gives similar indications to the good aspects but the influence is not quite so decided, particularly if ei- ther of the planets is weak by sign or otherwise afflicted. In that case it will be found that the tendencies conferred are more like those of the bad aspects. URANUS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO JUPITER gives am impulsive nature liable"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"to act in a sudden or unexpected manner to one's own undoing; loss by speculation, lawsuits and impulsive extravagance are also indicated, many changes both of occupations and residence, loss of friends and reputation.

During the sleeping hours these people are quite con- scious in the invisible worlds. NEPTUNE PARALLEL OR CONJUNCTION JUPITER gives an influence similar to that of the good aspects when Neptune and Jupiter are not afflicted, but if they are in a weak sign and aspecting the other planets by square or opposi- tion then the influence is similar to that one of the bad aspects of Jupiter and Neptune. NEPTUNE SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO JUPITER indicates lack of control of the emotions. The person is sensitive to the low psychic influences of the bor- derland between the seen and the unseen worlds but they are of an awe-inspiring and disgusting type, hence apt to cause hysterical conditions, such as involuntary trance and kindred disorders attendant upon negative psychism. From a material standpoint it gives danger of fraud through speculation or large companies and dealing with predatory interests should therefore be avoided. [PAGE 303]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION  CHAPTER XIV  MARS THE PLANET OF ACTION From the Bible we learn that Jehovah was the Creator of mankind for we find His angels announcing the birth of various notable personages. Thus the conclusion is inevitable that He and they preside over the generative function and impart the quality of fertility which at that time was looked upon as a token of the favor of God while barrenness was indicated as a sign of His displeasure. This is in accordance with the Western Wisdom Teaching which tells us that tin the earliest days when mankind was still in the mak- ing Jehovah and His angels guided them to great temples at the times of year when planetary conditions were propitious to generation, and men born under those harmonious conditions lived for hundreds of years without sickness of disease. It is noticeable that wild animals which are still entirely under"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"the guidance of their group-spirits and mate only at certain seasons are also immune from sickness. Jehovah still retains control over the fertil- ization of the animals which are attuned to His lunar vibrations through their twenty-eight pairs of spinal nerves that correspond to the twenty-eight days of the lunar revolution and His vehicle the Moon still [PAGE 304]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS measures the period of gestation for men and beasts. But the Bible also tells us of LUCIFER and his FALLEN ANGELS who taught humanity to take the prerogative of creation into their own hands and in- stilled into them the passion that has caused sorrow, sin and death, because the holy function of generation which was intended only for temporary pur- poses of propagation and which works so well under propitious planetary con- ditions has been desecrated and made subservient to the lusts of humanity at all times regardless of the stellar rays. Yet it is a mistake to think of the Lucifer spirits as evil, for under the sway of the angels humanity nei- ther good nor evil and having no choice or prerogative, but since though the martial Lucifer spirits we have learned to know good and evil we are also able to exercise of will power to shun the evil and choose the good, to flee from vice and cultivate virtue, thereby placing ourselves in harmonious co-worker-ship with God and nature and unfolding our divine possibilities so that we may become like our Father in Heaven. While Jehovah and His angels are thus working upon humanity from the Moon the Lucifer spirits who rebelled against His regime are located on the planet Mars and from them also we have received and are receiving many valu- able gifts, chief among them FIRE and IRON. It is well known that every LIVING body is warm, for the Ego cannot manifest in the physical world save [PAGE 305]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION through heat, or perhaps it should be said that heat is generated in the manifestation of the Ego. But without iron, which exists in the blood in the form of haemoglobin, there could be no oxidation and consequently no heat. That was the condition previous to the fall, so-called, when man-in-the-making was mindless. But then the Lucifer spirits came and in- fused iron into the blood, which made it possible for the Ego to draw into its vehicles and from that time the Ego became an INDWELLING spirit capable of evolving individuality. Thus had it not been for the Lucifer spirits man could not have become man. It is their fire and their iron that has made the world what it is today, good and bad according to the use man has made of it. The solar force focused through the Moon imparts vitality and the faculty of growth but the rays of the Sun focused upon us by the martial Lu- cifer spirits give us dynamic power and are the source of all activity in"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"the world. Power may be latent for milleniums, as exemplified in coalbeds, which are reservoirs of solar force; a furnace and engine are required to transmute and make it available as dynamic energy, but, once the sleeping giant has been roused from latency to potency it knows no rest or peace till it has expended the last ounce of its prodigious strength. Under strict control, and carefully guided into channel of useful activity, this Martian force is the most valuable servant of mankind; the most powerful agent in the world's [PAGE 306]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS work, an incomparable boon to humanity. But if it escapes control the ser- vant quickly takes mastery, its inimical power of destruction and devasta- tion is then as terrible as scourge as its beneficent use under guidance is an inestimable blessing. It is as precious as it is dangerous, eternal vigilance is the price of safety from its ravages, but without it the world would be wilderness. Mars, as a focus for the latent solar life, transmutes it into desire, passion and what we may call animal spirits. It is a consuming fire, more dangerous than all the nitroglycerine every manufactured, but also more pre- cious than any other blessing we can have or enjoy. The Hindoo preacher, nurtured in a land governed by Saturn, the planet of obstruction, says: \"Kill out desire.\" He dreams away his days in destitu- tion, but as \"temper\" conserves the edge of the steel that carves its way through all obstruction, so the well-directed energetic desires of the mar- tial Anglo-Saxson have wrought a marvelous transformation in the earth; they have reared a civilization beyond all which preceded it, and through perhaps brutal in many respects, there is promise in that also, according to the proverb: \"The greater the sinner, the greater the saint.\" Parents should take a lesson from a book of nationals and refrain from applying the Satur- nine wet blanket to the fiery Mars spirit of children. Saturn always says \"don't, don't;\" his aim is to repress and obstruct. A clear fire under [PAGE 307]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION proper control is useful, but death lurks in the smoke and noxious gases of a smothered fire; too many \"don'ts\" smother legitimate ambition and frus- trate accomplishment; they may drive hapless victims into ways of evil, for the dynamic energy of Mars must and will have an outlet, so beware. The worst faults of Mars are impulsiveness and lack of persistence, but he breeds no hypocrites as does an afflicted Saturn. From Mars we receive a number of our highly-prized virtues as well as"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"some of our worst faults. When well-aspected he gives a strong constitution and physical endurance, a positive, independent and self-reliant nature, de- termined and proud, generous and energetic, resourceful and quick to learn, especially when in Aries, Leo, Scorpio or Capricorn, but when he is weak by sign as in Taurus, Cancer, Libra or aspected by squares or oppositions he makes the person quick-tempered, obstinate and spiteful, inclined to drunk- enness and criminal acts, cruel and hard, a bully and braggart. People who have Mars prominent in their horoscopes are eminently practi- cal and play an important part in the world's work. They are especially proficient in occupations where iron and fire are used for constructive pur- poses or where sharp instruments are handled. Soldiers, surgeons and butch- ers, machine workers and iron founders, engineers and man in kindred occupa- tions are of the martial nature. They also excel in other positions where courage and intrepidity are necessary qualities. [PAGE 308]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  MARS IN THE TWELVE HOUSES MARS IN THE ASCENDANT, OR FIRST HOUSE, when well-aspected has a most ben- eficial influence upon the constitution, particularly if he is in one of the fiery signs, Aries, Leo or Sagittarius, or in the sign of his exaltation Capricorn, but sometimes when a weak sign like Cancer is rising and the other planets are much afflicted Mars in the Ascendant may infuse sufficient energy into the body to tide it over the critical period of infancy. This position also gives energy, ambition, courage, self-reliance and determina- tion which are exceedingly helpful characteristics in winning the battle of life. It indicates an enterprising and practical person who will shun no effort in order to succeed. When Mars is afflicted in the First House he nevertheless strengthens the constitution and gives muscular power and en- durance, but he makes such persons rash, impulsive, headstrong and fool- hardy. Thus they neglect the ordinary precautions to guard their health and become subject to fevers and other inflammatory diseases, also liable to ac- cidents and loss of blood by lesions of varying magnitude, danger from fire such as burns or scalds, according to the nature of the afflicting planet. In this respect the Sun is usually productive of fevers and inflammations. Jupiter gives liability to broken bones or accident by railroad or rolling stock, Uranus and Saturn falls and bruises and Venus disease caused by [PAGE 309]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION indulgence of the passional nature. MARS IN THE SECOND HOUSE when well-aspected makes the nature free and generous in financial dealings with others. The person has a splendid earn-"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"ing capacity and will make a financial success in any business or a martial nature involving the use of fire, iron tools or machinery. It is also an indication of money by marriage or legacy, but although the money comes fast and easily, the person will not accumulate wealth as he is very generous and fond of comfort and pleasure. When Mars is afflicted in the Second House money will come just as fast as under the good aspects at times, but at other times the bad aspects make the person outrageously extravagant and inclined to be reckless in financial ventures, with the inevitable result that heavy losses are incurred and the person may find himself without a cent in the world. A competence may be made and spent several times during life. These people never give up, however, and when they have met financial disaster they immediately start to build up anew on the ruins of the old. They are then usually successful for a time again, but they can never learn to be more careful and less extravagant, hence they are always liable to re- peated financial shipwreck. [PAGE 310]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS MARS IN THE THIRD HOUSE when well-aspected makes the mind keen, bright and alert, fond of argument, quick at repartee, ingenious, inventive and re- sourceful, with plenty of initiative and constructive ability. But when Mars is afflicted in the Third House it gives liability to accidents on short journeys, a quarrelsome nature specially liable to get into trouble with brothers, sisters and neighbors. These people are very critical to- wards everybody with whom they come in contact and therefore generally feared and avoided when possible. MARS IN THE FOURTH HOUSE when well-aspected gives a strong constitution which is maintained unimpaired even in old age; the digestive faculty is particularly good and consequently the health and strength are rugged. It makes the native exceedingly aggressive in his efforts to \"feather his nest\" and accumulate property for old age and rainy day. There is also likelihood of a legacy from his parents. This is a very fortunate position, especially if Mars is in Aries, Leo or Capricorn, but if Mars is weak as in Cancer or Pisces and afflicted by square or opposition, digestive troubles or dissipa- tion will undermine the vitality and the person will become more quarrelsome and disagreeable every day he lives. He will be liable to accident by fire in the home also to fevers and inflammatory diseases. People with Mars in [PAGE 311]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION this position should leave their native place as quickly as possible. This may in some measure relieve the trouble. MARS IN THE FIFTH HOUSE when well-aspected gives an ardent, demonstrative love-nature. It makes the person fond of athletic exercises, sports and"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"muscular effort, a clean, masterful man much admired by the opposite sex or a woman who is a real \"pal\" to her male companion. These people make excel- lent disciplinarians and are much beloved by their pupils if placed in posi- tions as teachers, or better still as principals for they make much better leaders than followers. But when Mars is afflicted in the Fifth House it makes the person very fickle in his affections. It is on with the new love even before he is through with the old, an all-around flirt and therefore likely to get into a great deal of trouble. Over-indulgence of the amorous nature is liable to sap the vitality and create dangerous physical condi- tions. In a woman's horoscope there is grave danger of death to a child in the horoscope of either sex. People with Mars afflicted in the Fifth House are also liable to loss through gambling and speculation in stocks, bonds and securities. MARS IN THE SIXTH HOUSE when well-aspected makes a quick, energetic worker who is likely to rise to prominent position in the employ of someone [PAGE 312]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS else, therefore the larger the firm in which he seeks employment the better. But he should not attempt to start in business for himself, for people with Mars in the Sixth House always succeed better when in the employment of someone else. This position also increases the vitality and should the per- son on account of other planetary configurations in the horoscope become subject to disease the dynamic energy and recuperative power of Mars will soon burn and leave it in better health than before. But a liability to trouble and quarrels with other employees or employer. Should the person be in the position of employer himself he will always be at a variance with his employees and subject to loss by theft and dishonesty through them. They will waste his goods and have no regard for his interests. An afflicted Mars in the Sixth House also gives a liability to fevers and inflammatory diseases, dangers of burns, scalds and gun-shots and accidents sustained in the course of employment. MARS IN THE SEVENTH HOUSE when well-aspected gives a capable, industrious and aggressive marriage partner, untiring in the promotion of the welfare of the family, a strong personality who is bound to rule but will do so in a [PAGE 313]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION kindly manner. This applies to both sexes, for when in a man's horoscope the marriage partner is indicated by Mars in the Seventh House she also will be masculine and will want to take the reins of government in her own hands. However, as Mars in the Seventh House gives a tendency to an early union when the parties are both plastic they accommodate themselves to these con- ditions more easily than if the marriage were consummated at a more mature"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"age. But if Mars is afflicted in the Seventh House it indicates an accident or sudden death to the marriage partner who will be of a domineering, quar- relsome nature and if one of the watery signs, Cancer, Scorpio not Pisces is on the cusp he will also be a drunkard and sex addict. This latter applies particularly if Mars is afflicted in Scorpio. Then he also brings on in- flammatory diseases of the genitals or rectum. MARS IN THE EIGHTH HOUSE and well-aspected brings financial benefit through the marriage partner or by legacy. In business it is also good for gain by partnerships, lawsuits or similar Eighth House matters. But when Mars is afflicted in the Eighth House the financial conditions grow worse after marriage through the extravagance of the marriage partner. Business partnerships and litigation should also be avoided for they are sure to [PAGE 314]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS bring loss. People with Mars in this position should not delay making their will for the end usually comes very sudden and unexpectedly. MARS IN THE NINTH HOUSE well-aspected gives a liberal, broad and progres- sive view upon all problems of life. People with Mars in this position are likely to take up some cause having for its object the social or spiritual upliftment of mankind in general and become very enthusiastic workers in the particular cult which has aroused their sympathies. They are fond of a rov- ing life and benefit by changing from one place to another, especially by travel in foreign lands. They have a clean, clear and alert mentality and a taking way or presenting their views to others. Therefore they make good missionaries in whatever line of propaganda they take up. But if Mars is afflicted in the Ninth House he makes people bigoted and fanatical in their views, regular ranters who disgust all whom they try to afflict with their ideas, whether they are religious or atheistic. People with an afflicted Mars here should never travel, but remain in their native place for they will always be in danger of accident on journeys and however much they may be disliked in their native place they will find a still worse reception in foreign parts."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"[PAGE 315]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION MARS IN THE TENTH HOUSE and well-aspected is one of the best signs of success in life for it gives an ambitious, enthusiastic nature with an inex- haustible fund of energy, so that no matter what obstacles are placed in his way the person is bound to rise to the top. It gives a masterful nature and good executive ability so that the person is well-qualified to conduct busi- ness and command others. These people succeed best in Martian occupations where fire, iron or sharp tools are used in a skilled manner, as by engi- neers or machinists, tailors or surgeons, et cetera. When Mars is afflicted in the Tenth House it gives the same energy and ambition as the good aspects but the person will then lack discrimination and overreach himself with the result that he will incur the enmity of other people who will accomplish his downfall and bring him into disrepute in the community. Thus the life will be filled with strife, struggle and unhappiness until the person has learned to hold himself in leash, regard the rights of others and abandon his auto- cratic attitude and self-assertion. This position also gives liability to accident and slander. MARS IN THE ELEVENTH HOUSE makes people leaders in their particular so- cial set, enthusiastic in the pursuit of pleasure, brings friends among mar- tial and athletic persons; gives energy and enthusiasm for realizing hopes, [PAGE 316]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION wishes and aspirations. But if Mars in the Eleventh House is afflicted it makes the person touchy and sensitive towards friends with consequent un- popularity and he is liable to overreach himself in his keen desire to real- ize his ambitions in life. MARS IN THE TWELFTH HOUSE when well-aspected may bring the person benefit from things denoted by this house, prisons, hospitals and charitable insti- tutions if employed in an official capacity as warden or surgeon; or as ad- ministrator of an estate or in detective work. But if Mars is afflicted in the Twelfth House the person is liable to trouble, sorrow and self-undoing all through life. He will incur the enmity of other people and may be con- fined in prison or an insane asylum. If Cancer or Pisces is on the cusp of the Twelfth House Mars will lead him to drunkenness and dissipation. If Scorpio is on the cusp the vitality will be sapped through sex or self-abuse. In any case Mars afflicted in the Twelfth House makes a social outcast unless there are other redeeming features in the figure.  MARS IN THE TWELVE SIGNS MARS IN ARIES gives an energetic, enthusiastic nature, impulsive, aggres- sive and impatient of restraint. No matter what the obstacles in the path these people will attempt the seemingly impossible and often succeed through"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"sheer audacity. They are original, resourceful, have considerable me- [PAGE 317]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION chanical ability and the more venturesome an undertaking appears the more it appeals to them. This position gives an abundance of vitality and a love of sport and muscular exercise. The person is just as enthusiastic in his enjoyment of recreation and pleasure as he is in his work and on that ac- count he gets a great deal out of life. But if Mars is afflicted in Aries it gives a violent temper and a liability to accidents, burns, scaldings, fevers and inflammatory complaints. The mind is also threatened. MARS IN TAURUS and well-aspected is a good indication of an early mar- riage. It shows good earning power and a free, generous disposition with regards to finances; it gives an interior strength of an unconquerable na- ture so that the person will always gain his ends by unflagging determina- tion and a quiet persistence that recognizes no defeat, but presses on to- wards the goal that he has set for himself despite all obstacles. It is also indication of money by legacy. But if Mars is afflicted in Taurus it gives an exceedingly stubborn, violent and vindictive nature. Such people will pursue their own way despite reason, argument or entreaty and if anyone attempts to thwart them in their purposes they never forgive. They also have good earning power but squander the money foolishly so that they are [PAGE 318]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS often in financial difficulties and if a legacy comes to them they are more likely to lose it through legal trouble than not and they are sure also to have domestic trouble. MARS IN GEMINI when well-aspected gives a keen, active and alert mental- ity. People with Mars in this position never beat about the bush. They are honest and outspoken and say just what they mean perhaps at times a little too bluntly, but at any rate they are not hypocrites. They love to measure their wits against others in debate and therefor this position makes for success in law or literature. They also succeed in the engineering profes- sions for they are resourceful, ingenious and mechanical, apt at learning and quick to grasp a problem or proposition. But if Mars is afflicted in Gemini it gives a cynical, sneering, caustic and critical disposition and makes these people feared and shunned on account of their disagreeable na- ture. These people are also vacillating and unable to make a decision. Thus they cannot be depended on to stand by their word or their promise and if they keep an appointment once in a while it happens by accident. They are always in trouble with brothers, sisters and neighbors and liable to ac- cidents when traveling. It also gives a predisposition to bronchitis, in- flammation of the lungs, pleurisy and pneumonia."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"[PAGE 319]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION MARS IN CANCER and well-aspected gives a bold, independent and fearless nature with a tendency to rebel against restraint, a home-loving disposi- tion, very industrious and ambitious to gather and protect all things which make for comfort and luxury, so that he is a good provider for the home in every respect. But at the same time people with this aspect aim to exercise unrestricted authority over everything and everybody within the home. They tolerate no other authority there. This position makes the temper rather uncertain and gives a tendency and a desire for change of occupation, sot that the person never really settles down to one line of endeavor but takes up a number of vocations and drops them suddenly. If Mars is afflicted in Cancer it brings domestic troubles, frequent and violent scenes and quarrels in the home with a tendency to move frequently from one place to another; inflammatory diseases of the stomach, and digestive ailments, also accidents by fire in the home through recklessness or carelessness. MARS IN LEO and well-aspected gives an active, industrious and honest na- ture, fearless and independent in all dealings with others, a keen sense of honor and responsibility, hence makes one eminently fitted to occupy a posi- tion of trust either in a public or private concern. These people are en- thusiastic and energetic either in work or play, lovers of sport and a good [PAGE 320]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS time generally. They are very ardent in their admiration of the opposite sex and woo the object of their affections with an intensity that carries all before it, overrides all obstacles and brings the matter to a speedy consummation. These people never beat about the bush but say what they mean in a manner that is often extremely embarrassing in its directness. They are strong and forceful in their arguments either for or against that which they believe or disbelieve and therefore they not infrequently arouse op- position on the part of those who differ from them. They are very venture- some and often take a pride in risk either in the pursuit of pleasure or business. When Mars is afflicted in Leo it gives a fiery, violent temper and a liability to fever inflammatory diseases, palpitation of the heart, hallucinations, biliousness. There is also danger of inordinate affection, trouble in courtship, loss of children and loss through speculations. An afflicted Mars in Leo gives the same daring as when well-aspected but the danger of accident is greater because the person with the afflicted planets becomes foolhardy and reckless. MARS IN VIRGO when well-aspected gives an ambitious nature and a quick intellect, able to grasp an idea and elaborate upon it. It strengthens the mental qualities and gives a scientific turn to the mind with an ability to"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"[PAGE 321]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION apply this faculty either in research work or in business. The people with this position are therefore energetic and enterprising in many of the world's industrial affairs. There their shrewdness and quick-wittedness brings them success and preferment. This is a good position for people who are engaged in any of the industries connected with the sick, such as nurses, doctors, chemists, the science of sanitation and hygiene, prepara- tion of health-foods and kindred occupations. If people with Mars in Virgo are themselves overtaken by disease this position gives them the ability to recuperate quickly and makes them less liable to become chronic invalids as so many other Virgo people do. When Mars is afflicted in Virgo it subjects the mind to worry and irrita- bility, with a tendency to brood over troubles in life which are mostly il- lusory. No matter how or where such people are employed they are always critical toward their fellow-employees and the employer and dissatisfied with everything connected with their work. They are also of a dishonest na- ture and cannot be trusted in a position of responsibility. This position also makes people over-indulgent of their appetites and subject to intesti- nal disorders. MARS IN LIBRA and well-aspected gives an ardent, demonstrative and loving nature which is very greatly attracted to the opposite sex and therefore it [PAGE 322]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS inclines to an early marriage. It also gives an enthusiastic love of art and beauty in all their phases and it makes the person very popular with the public or in societies of a social or religious nature. This is an excel- lent position for a lawyer, as it will bring much activity in this line and it is a good indication of general health. But when Mars is afflicted in Libra it makes the person very unpopular and subject to the opposition and criticism of the community; danger of public scandal on account of unfaith- fulness in sex relations, for Mars in Libra always produces a strong attrac- tion toward the opposite sex and if he is afflicted there the nature is amorous and fickles with the natural result that trouble arises by playing with the affections of others. MARS IN SCORPIO when well-aspected gives a keen, sharp and forceful men- tality, a rather blunt manner and an indifference to the finer sensibilities of others, consequently these people often make themselves disliked at first until others get used to them and realize that they are not such ogres as they seem. They are very ingenious and mechanical, with indomitable courage and inexhaustible energy which carry them over all obstacles whatever goal"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"they set themselves. In this respect they are very selfish and ready to sacrifice whatever stands in their way. They make good police officers, soldiers and surgeons and are able to fill any other position where a [PAGE 323]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION dominant authority is required, or skill with sharp tools. In a woman's horoscope it shows that the husband has good earning capacity, but is rather too free and generous with his means. It also indicates the possibility of a legacy. When Mars is afflicted in Scorpio it brings out the worse side of the passional nature and leads the person into sex excesses or causes addiction to solitary vice that saps the vitality, and unless corrected it is liable to bring the person to an early grave. In a woman's horoscope it indicates that the husband will squander his money on gratification of self, also that parturition will be a dangerous event. In either sex Mars in Scorpio indi- cates a quarrelsome nature and a biting tongue. MARS IN SAGITTARIUS and well-aspected gives an argumentative disposition and fondness of debating on subjects of serious nature such as law, phi- losophy and religion. It makes the person candid and open in all his deal- ings with others, full of enthusiasm and ambition, anxious to appear well in the eyes of the community, although he would scorn to cater to the ideas of others where they do not coincide with this ideas of probity and justice. These people make interesting and ideal entertainers, especially in later life for they are fond of traveling and are keen observers, hence they al- ways have a fund of interesting and instructive information which they are [PAGE 324]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS both willing and anxious to impart to their hearers. These people are also fond of sports and out-door exercise, in which they usually excel and a well-aspected Mars in Sagittarius is an ideal position for a lawyer. It makes for much success in that direction by sharpening and quickening the mental and oratorical faculties. When Mars is afflicted in Sagittarius he gives a sharp tongue and a quar- relsome disposition and there is a dishonest streak in the nature, therefore such people are often found generally disliked in the community and par- ticularly in social circles, for they seem to be always at variance with the ideas and opinions of others and adopt a most supercilious attitude toward those with whom they disagree. These people are also liable to meet with accidents when they travel and to sustain a number of broken bones. MARS IN CAPRICORN when well-aspected adds much strength to the character"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"for it gives an ambitious and enthusiastic disposition backed by an in- domitable courage and well-nigh inexhaustible energy together with a patient persistence and perseverance that are bound to overcome all obstacles and in the end reach the desired goal. Therefore people with Mars in this position are bound to rise in life, particularly if Capricorn be placed in the Tenth House. It invites respect and esteem of the community so that people with [PAGE 325]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION this position are often offered public appointments in addition to their private enterprises and they serve well in posts of honor for they are naturally fitted to take great responsibilities and carry on great enter- prises. The wider their scope of action the better they like it, for they are superlatively efficient. When Mars is afflicted in Capricorn there will be a similar ambition to do great things but the person will be rash, impulsive and headstrong so that he overreaches himself and takes upon himself more than he can carry through. He will also lack the persistence and perseverance necessary to overcome obstacles and as the disposition will be basically dishonest, through he may rise on account of his enthusiasm and pretentious nature to some prominence he is certain to be shorn of his authority before very long and become an object of scorn and derision in the community. There is noth- ing worse than an afflicted Mars in Capricorn. It also gives a liability to accidents affecting the limbs and its reflex action on the part of the body ruled by the opposite sign, viz., the stomach, gives a tendency to gastric troubles. People with this affliction also have a hasty temper and a vin- dictive disposition. MARS IN AQUARIUS when well-aspected makes the person quick-witted and in- tuitive, ingenious and original, enterprising and ambitious, a hard worker [PAGE 326]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS for success in whatever line he chooses in life. Hence he will gain friend- ship from others who are able to help him realize his hopes and wishes. These people are also very mechanical and ingenious, particularly in things connected with the electrical science. They also succeed well as managers, officials or workers in and for a philanthropic society or public utility corporation. When Mars is afflicted in Aquarius it makes the person too independent, bombastic and resentful of authority, blunt of speech and manner toward oth- ers, and resentful in the highest degree if he is not treated with what he considers proper respect and consideration, Hence such people over very difficult to get along with and often quarrel with everybody around them."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"There is a tendency to loss through gambling and speculation. An afflicted Mars in Aquarius also gives a tendency to trouble with the eyes because Aquarius governs the ethers; and by reflex action the opposite sign Leo may cause palpitation of the heart. MARS IN PISCES when well-aspected gives ability as a detective, warden of a prison or surgeon in a hospital and in kindred positions where the person does not come in direct contact with the public, but exercises authority in [PAGE 327]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION an obscure manner. It also gives a tendency toward secret love affairs which the person is able to hide from the public eye. But when Mars is af- flicted in Pisces the indulgence of clandestine intercourse will bring trouble into the life. There is also liability to suffer from the attaches of secret enemies and to become enmeshed in the net of the law and suffer imprisonment, or it may manifest as an inordinate love of strong drink which will then cause imprisonment and makes the person a ward of the community. Much trouble and many misfortunes are indicated because the nature is un- truthful.  MARS IN ASPECT WITH OTHER PLANETS THE SUN PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO MARS. The conjunction gives a tendency to fever, especially if it occurs in Aries, the sign which governs the head, but it is curious that people with that configuration seem also to be able to endure a much higher temperature than others, and come unscathed through such a siege of sickness as would ordinarily prove fatal. With that exception these aspects produce a superabundance of vital energy which assures their possessor of the most radiant health all through life. They strengthen the constitution and makes the person able to endure the hardest tasks; they give him a dauntless determination and courage to face [PAGE 328]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the greatest odds. Given a plan to follow he may be trusted to overcome all physical obstacles for he has both executive and constructive ability to- gether with an indomitable will which refuses to recognize defeat. The dis- position is frank and open but blunt and often brusque; such people are too intensely bent on what they want to do to waste time in politeness and sua- vity, therefore they brush the conventionalities aside without compunction and are consequently not liked by people of too fine sensibilities, but they are men and women of action and the foremost factors in the world's work; but for their energy and enterprise the world would move much more slowly. THE SUN SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO MARS endows the person with an abundance"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"of energy, the faculty of leadership, but they are turned to purposes of deviltry and destruction; the courage implanted by the good aspects becomes foolhardiness and the person has a loud, overbearing, swaggering manner and is ready to fight at the drop of a hat; he is always in opposition to the constituted authority and ready to rebel wherever he sees a chance, he has an extremely fiery temper but holds not resentment. On account of these qualities he is universally disliked by both employees and his fellow work- ers, always in hot water and never stays long in any place for he is an [PAGE 329]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION agitator and trouble maker. These aspects also dispose to accidents in which the person may be maimed, to gunshot and knife-wounds, also to scald- ing, fevers, and inflammatory complaints, boils and eruptions. Aspects to the Sun and Mars are absolutely necessary to give zest to life; even adverse aspects are better than none, for where these planets are unaspected the person is usually listless, vapid and will never amount to anything no matter how good the figure may be in other respects. VENUS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO MARS will give an ambitious, aspiring and ad- venturous nature, amorous and extremely demonstrative in its affection and, very fond of sports and pleasures. It gives the person an abundance of en- ergy and business acumen, consequently he has a splendid earning capacity, but no matter how much money he makes it just filters through his fingers, for he loves above all things to make a great outward show and display. Be- ing a free spender he is also very popular among his associates, and being as already said of an amorous nature he marries either very early or his marriage is a very sudden and hasty one. These aspects are also indications of money by marriage or legacy. [PAGE 330]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS VENUS CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL MARS does not always operate in the same manner, but these aspects are to be classed as good of bad according to cir- cumstances and the matter to be judged. For instance, Mars conjunction Ve- nus makes the person less blunt and domineering, more kind and polite, and is therefore good in that respect, but the conjunction also strengthens the passional nature, especially if it occurs in Scorpio, and in the Twelfth House it often leads to self-abuse so that in those cases it is decidedly bad. Therefore students must exercise judgment before classifying these as- pects. VENUS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO MARS gives a very voluptuous and sensuous disposition, liable to gross excesses in the gratification of the passions which will spa the vitality. It is likely to break down the health and con-"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"stitution, leaving the person a wreck on the sea of life if it is allowed free scope. These people are altogether too generous, especially where the opposite sex is concerned. They are very extravagant and on that account spend more than they can afford on themselves, besides what they squander on their many AMOURS, so that no matter how much money they make, they are gen- erally in financial difficulty, and not infrequently they figure as defen- dants in the debtor's court. If Mars or Venus is in Cancer, Scorpio or Pi- sces there is a tendency to such dissolute and dissipated living, such a [PAGE 331]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION craving for low pleasures that, if indulged, it will drag the human being down below the level of animals. MERCURY SEXTILE OR TRINE TO MARS gives a keen, sharp, ingenious and re- sourceful mentality. It makes the person enthusiastic over any proposition which appeals to him and he has also the ability to enthuse others and im- press them with his views. He is an indefatigable worker in any cause which arouses his sympathies, but he is no visionary, he is interested only in concrete matters. These people love argument or debate, and they have an inexhaustible fund of wit and good humor, sometimes blended with a vein of sarcasm which always strikes it mark, yet never viciously nor maliciously. They also have remarkable dexterity and are able to turn their hands to whatever task is required and do it with a speed, facility and expedition that are astonishing to say the least. They cannot do anything slowly or by halves; whatever they undertake must be dome with a rush, and they put their whole energy into it so that they may accomplish the task and do it well; hence these aspects give success in life, in almost any line of endeavor these people may select, but probably most in literature or the mechanical arts. [PAGE 332]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS MERCURY CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO MARS gives the same mental energy, en- thusiasm and dexterity as the definitely good aspects but whether they are used for constructive and good purposes or for destructive and evil depends upon the other aspects, house position and sign which they occupy. If the configuration occurs in a sign where either or both are strong and well placed, as Mars in Aries or Capricorn, or Mercury in Gemini or Virgo, or if they are fortified by good aspects from the Sun, Venus and Jupiter, Mars conjunction or parallel to Mercury will operate similarly to the sextile or trine as stated in the foregoing paragraph, which see; but if Mars and Mer- cury are in one of the watery signs, Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces, or if either or both are afflicted by Saturn, Uranus or Neptune, the conjunction or par- allel of Mars and Mercury will give the same evil tendencies as the square or opposition which are defined in the next paragraph."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" MERCURY SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO MARS makes people quick-witted, sharp and alert, quick-tempered, impulsive and excitable, liable to jump at conclu- sions and act before they think with the inevitable result that they are al- ways getting themselves or other people into trouble, hence they are danger- ous associates. They are born prevaricators and utterly incapable of making an exact statement. It is just as natural for them to color or exaggerate [PAGE 333]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION their statements as it is to breathe. They are vitriolic in their wrath and their tongues are more poisonous than the bite of a rattlesnake, hence they are either feared or hated by those who are unfortunate enough to be bound to them by environment; all who can, shun them. They are bullies who are bound either to rule or ruin wherever they are and they allow no obstacle to stand in their way which can be removed either by force or slander. They are the acme of selfishness, swagger and consummate egotism. The foregoing tendencies may of course be modified by other aspects, but if they are not, such people are a menace to society. If either Mars or Mercury is placed in the Sixth or Twelfth House or in any other position so that the bad aspect acts upon the health, there is a liability to nervous prostration, brain fe- ver and insanity. THE MOON SEXTILE OR TRINE TO MARS gives a wonderful vitality and strong physique so that the person is able to withstand almost any tendencies to ill-health, which will be overcome by it. The power of endurance is in- creased and the person can survive hardships to which people ordinarily suc- cumb. It gives a resolute, courageous, energetic and ambitious mind of a resourceful and eminently constructive turn. It makes the person quick but not precipitate in his decisions. Thus he gains confidence and esteem of [PAGE 334]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS others and earns considerable money, but the nature is extremely free and generous so that money does not stay by such people--they spend it almost as fast as they get it. THE MOON CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO MARS may be either good or bad ac- cording to the sex of the person and the department of life we are consider- ing. It strengthens the health and the vitality, particularly in the horo- scope of a woman. In the horoscope of a man it would indicate a robust marriage partner of a domineering nature and with respect to the mind it would make the person very impulsive, particularly if placed in one of the common signs or in the Third or Ninth House. It also gives a very bad tem- per but not so bad as the square or opposition. If Mars is in conjunction or parallel to the Moon in Scorpio it gives an abnormal sex desire which"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"will not be denied, particularly if Venus is there also. In watery signs in inclines to drink, and in any place it makes the person restless and un- settled, for it is like mixing fire and water. THE MOON SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO MARS gives a very quick temper and a tendency to hasty or impulsive expressions and acts that may cause such people a great deal of sorrow and trouble. They resent rules or regulations or any other measures that tend to curb their desires or the gratification [PAGE 335]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION of their appetites in whatever direction. But if they are in authority they aver domineering and exacting in their demands for instant obedience upon the part of others, not do they hesitate to use whatever physical force may be necessary to compel obedience if they thing they can do so without too great danger to themselves. Sometimes they will take desperate chances to satisfy their spite. Having an improperly balanced mind they are foolhardy in their venturesomeness and upon occasion they will attempt to do things which no one in his sane mind would try. On account of the foregoing char- acteristic such people make many enemies and cause a great deal of suffering to others, particularly among members of their immediate family who cannot very well get away from them. If these aspects occur in watery signs, par- ticularly with Mars or the Moon in Pisces the person is also an inveterate drunkard. From the standpoint of health they give a tendency to accidents by fire and water, to fevers and acute inflammatory diseases, wounds and gunshot, diseases of the genitals, too copious menses, danger in parturition and indigestion. SATURN SEXTILE OR TRINE TO MARS gives a determined and energetic nature capable of intense and sustained action and of obtaining unusual results [PAGE 336]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS thereby. The executive ability, dominant forcefulness and endurance of these people are remarkable and consequently they are constantly accomplish- ing what others cannot achieve. Hence they always rise to prominent posi- tions and are much esteemed on account of their ability, but they are seldom liked, for these aspects make the character cruel and hard. They give a strong physique and general good health. SATURN CONJUNCTION, PARALLEL SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO MARS are throughly bad aspects indicating a selfish, violent, harsh and cruel nature, quick tempered and vindictive, absolutely dishonest, untruthful and unscrupulous, giving liability to public disgrace and imprisonment, also to accident and violent death, and if one of the planets is essentially dignified or exalted the evil influence is much enhanced. It should also be remembered that such"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"serious defects do not result from one aspect alone and if the other con- figurations in the horoscope are good the foregoing delineation will only apply in a mild measure. JUPITER SEXTILE OR TRINE TO MARS. It is the nature of Jupiter to be somewhat conservative and dignified, but when blended with the fire of Mars it gives an enthusiasm and an ability to influence others and imbue them with the same feelings. It makes the nature noble, sincere, honest and straightforward. This aspect is also good for the financial prosperity of [PAGE 337]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION the person for both Mars and Jupiter when well-aspected attract money, but they differ in regard to disbursement. Jupiter is somewhat conservative in that respect, but where the Martian and Jupiterian qualities are blended by a good aspect the result is an ideal, generous nature, neither too lavish nor too conservative, but able to strike the happy medium. These people have much ingenuity and constructive ability and whatever they do they put their whole heart into it. Hence they are successful in business and popular in society. They are fond of out-door sports and games. They love to travel and gain much pleasure by so doing. Mars rules the haemoglobin in the blood which is so important a factor in health and vitality therefore the good aspects of Jupiter and Mars increase the red blood corpuscles with the result that these people have abundance of health, vitality, power and endurance. JUPITER PARALLEL OR CONJUNCTION MARS strengthens the constitution and in- creases the vitality the same as the good aspects. It also indicates that the person is able to earn much money and uses it freely and generously, but the mental qualities are similar to those conferred by the bad aspects. The person is tricky, deceitful, untruthful, impulsive in judgment and not to be depended upon. If the conjunction occurs in one of the watery signs, [PAGE 338]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS especially in Pisces he will probably be a drunkard though this is not as certain as with the square or opposition. These people are generally ple- thoric and liable to apoplexy. JUPITER SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO MARS is the signature of the gambler and if one of the planets is in a watery sign, especially in Pisces he will be a drunkard also, a tricky, dishonest and disreputable character who always acts through impulse. With respect to health we find that these people suf- fer principally from blood and liver complaints; the circulation is poor and the blood is so rich that there is danger of apoplexy."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" URANUS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO MARS gives an energetic and ambitious disposi- tion, an original, ingenious, alert, intuitive mind which is resourceful in the highest degree and able to cope with great difficulties under trying circumstances. Therefore people with these configurations are naturally of an inventive turn of mind and successful in bringing their ideas to realiza- tion. Their inventive genius expresses itself usually along electrical lines, aviation or other unusual directions for these aspects are one of the marks of the pioneer of the Aquarian age, where science and intervention will reach out in directions that are now undreamed of even as possi- [PAGE 339]  MARS, THE PLANET OF ACTION bilities. But while these people are dreamers of dreams they are also prac- tical, energetic and enterprising in a sufficient degree to make their dreams come true in the world. They have a wide vision and a noble nature which rises over all petty distinctions of race, creed or color and recog- nizes in all human beings the divine spark which is the basis of universal brotherhood. They may not be exactly religious in the orthodox sense of the word, but their ideas are truly cosmic, hence they are often mistaken for visionaries by those who do not understand them. URANUS CONJUNCTION, PARALLEL, SQUARE, OR OPPOSITION TO MARS gives an er- ratic and eccentric disposition, a violent temper of the worst nature, an unusually resentment of even the slightest restraint and gives the person a stubborn, headstrong and dogged determination to go ahead in any line of ac- tion upon which he has decided no matter what the outcome. He will listed to neither reason nor entreaty but follows his own course in defiance of all. People with these configurations often become anarchists of the red- dest type for they do not stop even at the shedding of blood if other testi- monies in the figure concur. They are cruel, hard and cold with out a spark of true love through they may be in flamed with passion of the most burning intensity. This is particularly the case when Mars is square Uranus and [PAGE 340]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS either planet is placed in Taurus or Scorpio. In a woman's horoscope Mars square Uranus usually leads to seduction no matter where placed, but if in Taurus or Scorpio escape is almost impossible. The other characteristics of these planets in these configurations work themselves out according to the signs wherein they are placed so that their placement in Taurus or Scorpio work upon the sex which is governed by these signs. When one of these plan- ets is in Scorpio if the person takes up the profession of surgery be will become very cruel and unfeeling, ready to operate for the mere pleasure of causing pain and in consequence or in pursuit of this passion he will prob- ably take up vivisection and develop an unusual ingenuity in torturing his victims. With Mars or Uranus in Scorpio or Pisces he will be underhanded to"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"tricky though he may show a very different front to the public. In Aries it will make a rattlebrain, in Gemini and Virgo an unusually quick mentality but quick in seeing only how to trick others, in Sagittarius it will make the person very materialistic, atheistic or fanatical against the estab- lished religion or society; thus the planets blend their nature with each individual sign.

[PAGE 341]   PLANETARY OCTAVES  CHAPTER XV  PLANETARY OCTAVES Before considering the effect of Uranus and Neptune in the various signs and houses it may be expedient and illuminating to study their relations to Venus and Mercury which are their lower octaves. That such a relationship exists has been sensed by various astrological authors who by speculation and observation have learned a great deal about these two planets. What they have brought out does great credit to their sagacity, but not having had the benefit of esoteric training it is not to be wondered at that they have become confused on certain points which we shall now explain so that students of the esoteric philosophy may see how these explanations dovetail into the general philosophy of the Western Wisdom School, and thus bear out the statement that Uranus is the higher octave of Venus and Neptune the higher octave of Mercury. The Western Wisdom teaching of the Rosicrucian states that man-in-the-making was plant-like and bi-sexual during the Hyperborean Epoch and thus able to create from himself without the necessity of co-operation with anyone else. But at that time he was without a brain and unable to [PAGE 342]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS think, therefore in the Lemurian Epoch the angels directed one-half of the sex force upward to the part which is now the head and used it for the for- mation of the brain and larynx. The process is plainly traceable in the antenatal development of the foetus which accounts for the intimate relation between the sex organs, the larynx and the brain, observable in the change of voice which takes place when the boy reaches puberty and the mental dis- ability which follows the unrestrained abuse of the generative function. Thus it may be said that the sex function whereby new bodies are created in"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"the physical world, and become our physical children, is closely connected with the brain and larynx which man uses to conceive the children of his brain and mind and give them vocal expression by the larynx. It is a matter of common knowledge to astrologers that man is incited to perform the gen- erative function of the begetting of physical children by the love-ray of Venus; likewise that the ray of reason emanating from Mercury is responsible for the begetting of the children of mind and their vocal expression by the larynx, so that both Mercury and Venus are creative in their functions, one upon the physical plane, the other upon the mental plane. Mercury is usually associated with reason and intelligence; to him is as- cribed rule over the cerebrospinal nervous system, which is the medium of transmission between the embodied spirit and the world without. Thus as Neptune signifies the sub- and superhuman intelligence who live and move in [PAGE 343]   PLANETARY OCTAVES the spiritual realms of the universe, but who work with and upon us, so Mer- cury indicates the human intelligence focused upon the terrestrial, physical world wherein we live from birth to death. Therefore it may be said that Neptune is the octave of Mercury, but there is a deeper sense. Reference to a textbook of anatomy of physiology will show that length- wise fissures in the spinal cord divide it into three parts which enclose a hollow tube. Each of these columns is ruled by one of the Hierarchies in closest touch with us; the lunar, martial and mercurial; one of the other predominating, according to the stage of evolution of the individual. In the spinal canal the rays of Neptune kindle the spinal spirit fire whereby the human spirit is enabled to pierce the veil of flesh and contact the worlds beyond; this vision is colored according to the column of the cord most actively excited. In the childhood days of mankind the creative force which is now turned outwards to build ships, houses, and railways, tele- phones, etc., was used inwardly to build the organs of our body, and as the surrounding physical world is photographed upon the table of a camera obscura, so the spiritual world was reflected in the spinal canal. There man behold the first lunar God Jehovah, whose Angels were his first tutors. Later a part of Angels, who under the leadership of LUCIFER had rebelled against Jehovah and who are now exiled on the planet Mars forced entrance to [PAGE 344]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the spinal cord of man and incited him to abuse of the generative function. The spiritual inner vision of mankind faded when \"their eyes were opened and they saw they were naked;\" then they lost touch with the higher self, they saw only the person, and the docile creature of Jehovah was soon transformed to a savage and a brute under the impulses of the Lucifer Spirits, the hier-"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"archy of Mars but by their promptings man has also learned to conquer mate- rial obstacles, build outwardly and become architect of the world. To counteract the unmitigated selfishness bred by the Martian Angels, and to make mankind humane our Elder Brothers from Mercury, human like our- selves, whose high state of evolution required the high vibration generated and prevailing in close proximity to the Sun, were required to invest the spinal cord of man also, and through their labors civilization has taken on a different form, mankind is again beginning to look inwards. At the present time the right cerebral hemisphere is governed by Mercury, and the pineal gland, its higher octave, is ruled by Neptune who also has dominion over the spinal canal which is the avenue whereby one pole of the creative energy was originally turned upward for the building of the brain. The ray of Neptune carries what occultist know as the Father fire, the light and life of the Divine Spirit, which expresses itself as will. This it focuses in the voluntary nervous system of the physical body governed by [PAGE 345]   PLANETARY OCTAVES by its lower octave Mercury which acting through the right brain galvanizes the body into speech and action, expressing the will of the indwelling spirit. By this diversion of the creative energy the human being ceased, as al- ready said, to be a physical hermaphrodite, a complete creative unit, and was them compelled to seek a mate in order to propagate the species, Therefore the Son, the Cosmic Christ, focused the love-ray of the Life Spirit upon Uranus, (ruling the pituitary body), who transmits it to the vi- tal body where Venus, the lower octave of Uranus gives it expression in propagation and growth. Between the Divine Spirit and Life Spirit on the one hand and their coun- terparts, the physical and vital bodies, on the other hand, is the Human Spirit ruled by the Sun, and its counterpart, the desire body, ruled by the lesser light, the Moon. But this is debatable ground contested by Jupiter and Mercury on the one side, Saturn and Mars being on the other. The ray of Uranus is gradually forging a SECOND SPINAL CORD by drawing the lower love-ray of Venus upward and transmuting it to altruism, conquer- ing for it the dominion over the sympathetic segment of the present spinal cord and THE LEFT CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE now ruled by the passionate hierarchy of Mars, the Lucifer Spirits. This work has been completely accomplished by the Adepts, therefore they have no need to marry for each is now a complete creative unit on both the spiritual and physical planes, having turned the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"[PAGE 346]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS bi-polar creative force, masculine and feminine, upward through the double spinal cord, illuminated and raised in potential energy by the spinal spirit fires of Neptune (Will) and Uranus (Love and Imagination). This creative energy conceives in the twin hemispheres of the cerebrum, ruled by Mars and Mercury, a vehicle fit for the expression of the spirit, which is then sent out and objectified in the world BY THE SPOKEN CREATIVE WORD. This is the secret of how the Adepts form a new body without going through the womb, and some day all humanity will attain to this standard of perfection as SPIRITUAL HERMAPHRODITES; then we shall no longer be \"a little lower than the angels\" who create by similar methods but we shall be higher than they are now for we shall have the reason and intellect which they lack, in addition to the complete creative power. [PAGE 347]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM  CHAPTER XVI URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM The love ray of Venus goes out to the mate and blood relations but by a good aspect of Uranus it is raised beyond the realm of sex love to cosmic proportions, to love such as that which christ must have felt when he wept over Jerusalem and said that, as a hen fathers it brood under its wing, so would he have loved to father them to his bosom. The people who have this Uranian love therefore become builders of society; associated with every good and uplifting movement. An adverse aspect of Uranus to Venus on the other hand, has the most degrading effect on the Venus function, for it leads to disregard of the laws and conventions of society and to perversion of the sacred creative function. Love is a much abused word, and the emotion thus miscalled is usually so tainted with desire that it is Martian passion rather than Venusian love. Coalition, the keyword of Venus, suggests a most intimate union, a blending of the very souls of two or more people who compose a family. But ALTRUISM, the keyword of Uranus, hints at such an all-embracing love as our Saviour felt. Thus Uranus is the octave of Venus and anyone ready to enter the path [PAGE 348]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS of preparation which leads to initiation must gradually learn to outgrow the Venus love which makes the immediate family all in all and begin to culti- vate the all-embracing Uranian altruism."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" This goal is high and those who aim so high often fall very low. When we essay to transcend the Venus love and cultivate the Uranian altruism we are thus in great danger, and the most promising live are sometimes wrecked by the pernicious theory of soul-mates, which leads to clandestine love affairs and perversion of the creative function. But remember this--altruism does not require return of the love bestowed upon others, it has absolutely no concern with sex; it will not lessen the love for our family, but they being nearest to us will feel the increase of our love to a greater degree than those further away, and unless our love brings forth such fruit it is not Uranian and will not further us upon the path of attainment. Seeing this is so, we may readily understand that the great majority of humanity cannot yet respond to the higher side of Uranus, and its effect upon the morals is therefore principally perversion of sex, clandestine love affairs, free love, and disregard of conventionality; that is, of course, when aspected by squares and oppositions. Under such conditions it makes people unconventional and erratic, rebellious at the least restraint, very independent and brusque in manner, fond of pioneer work, and investigation [PAGE 349]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM of unusual things. They take to the higher mechanics, electricity, aviation, and the like, as a duck to water, and are rather proud of their attainments. They find prominence in literature, science, philosophy, and especially in the occult arts. Uranus also gives a high grade of musical genius when configurated with Venus, and if Uranus is well fortified in by position and aspects it qualifies the person for leadership in an unusual way. It may also be said that the effects of the Uranian ray are very sud- den and unexpected, whether for good or ill, it comes like a bolt out of the blue, and as we respond most easily to its evil side, these effects are gen- erally disastrous in nature. When Uranus is on the Ascendant it adds length to the body, so that the true Uranian are usually very tall.  URANUS IN THE TWELVE HOUSES URANUS IN THE FIRST HOUSE, even when well-aspected, makes the person very odd and eccentric in his habits, so that he seems to delight in doing ex- actly the things that are against the conventions and customs, just so that he may appear odd. He always finds an original way of doing things, differ- ent from that of all other people, and is very self-satisfied in his opinion that his methods and ideas are better than any one else's. If opposed he will defend his ideas to the last ditch, if Uranus is in any way afflicted. But when Uranus is well-aspected in the First House there is usually a [PAGE 350]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"tolerance for the opinions of others. a spirit of give-and-take which avoids the hard feelings generated by an afflicted Uranus. Uranus on the Ascendant also makes the person very restless, there are many sudden changes in the life and it will, of course, depend upon the aspects prevailing at the time whether the changes are for good or ill; but at any rate the call of the far fields that look so green, are constantly before the mind's eye, sot hat the Uranians are always ready to be the pioneers in new undertakings or a new cause, just so that it is something that has not been tried before, and so offers a chance of risk and adventure. URANUS IN THE SECOND HOUSE, which governs finance, naturally indicates a restless and unsettled state of the finances of the person. There will be many ups and down, and even though such a person may have other good aspects that quality him to reason accurately concerning other matters, it will be found that in the financial department he is unable to protect himself against these sudden and unforeseen losses, or gains. For him there is no such thing as a staid and solid investment, for the most unlooked-for-con- ditions are likely to turn up and either net him an altogether unlooked-for increase or else bring about an equally unaccountable loss, all with such [PAGE 351]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM suddenness that there is no way of changing the matter. Therefore it is ab- solutely impossible to give financial advice to such people, for even if they invested in a proposition as solid as the proverbial rock of Gibraltar, it is doubtful if an earthquake would not unsettle it. URANUS IN THE THIRD HOUSE. The Third House governs brothers and sisters, neighbors, education, and the mental or intellectual faculties. Therefore this position strengthens the intuitional abilities of the person, and gives a certain predisposition towards what is commonly called psychic faculties. Uranus rules the ether, hence the Third House position should make it easy for the person to cultivate spiritual sight, especially if Uranus is well-aspected with the Sun, Moon, Venus or Mercury. If Uranus is afflicted in the Third House it indicates quarrels with neighbors, brothers and sis- ters, probably a breaking up of the family ties, also that the education will be interfered with through the erratic, self-willed conduct of the per- son, and the mind will be more or less unsettled, and changeable as a weather-vane. An afflicted Uranus in the Third House also predisposes to accidents according to the nature of the afflicting planet, and particularly when on short journeys. These people, it may also be said, are subject to adventures and strange happenings on their journeys such as do not usually befall other people. [PAGE 352]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" URANUS IN THE FOURTH HOUSE. People who have Uranus in the Fourth House ought to leave their place of birth as soon as possible for they cannot suc- ceed there. Both the parents and their whole neighborhood and environment will be antagonistic to them. If it so happens that the parents are wealthy they will try to disinherit a child with Uranus in the Fourth House. Even if his Seventh and Eighth Houses be well fortified, it is very doubtful if he would win in a contest for his share of the patrimony, as the public sen- timent in his birthplace, where such a suit would probably be tried, would be so much against him that he would lose in the end. It would also be di- sastrous for such a person to marry and establish a home of his own, for peace, harmony and contentment cannot exist where the spasmodic and erratic Uranus is; that is to say, if it is afflicted. If it is well-aspected it is also doubtful if such a person would ever attempt to establish a home, for his sympathies would be too large and he would probably be identified with wider activities--a home or homes on a larger and more universal scale. This position also gives a very strong attraction towards occult science. URANUS IN THE FIFTH HOUSE. The Fifth House rules educational activities, publications, pleasures, courtship, and childbirth. The erratic Uranus in [PAGE 353]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM this House will in the first place give some very unconventional ideas con- cerning the intercourse and relation of the sexes and usually leads to a clandestine relationship contrary to the laws of the land. A woman with this condition in her horoscope is particularly prone to be taken advantage of even though she may not consciously be guilty of inviting undue advances. It also makes parturition very difficult and if a child is brought to birth there is danger of loss by some sudden accident or unusual disease. If other influences in the horoscope give a leaning toward literature, a person who has Uranus in the Fifth House will be found to espouse some unconven- tional cause, like socialism, anarchism, or kindred movements, and if Uranus be afflicted by Saturn, Mars, or Neptune, the articles written by him, or the paper published by him or with which he is connected will probably in- cite to bloodshed, conspiracy, and treachery, which will bring the person into trouble with the authorities. If on the other hand, Uranus be well-aspected from the Fifth House in a horoscope indicating literary ten- dencies, the ideas advocated on account of this Uranian influence will prob- ably be so Utopian, idealistic, and altruistic that they will be beyond the contemporaries of the person. The love nature will also be of such a high idealistic strain that few if any will be able to respond, and this may also [PAGE 354]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS mitigate in a large measure the physical trouble indicated in parturition."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"A person with a well-aspected Uranus in the Fifth House would not gamble, and if one who has an afflicted Uranus there attempted it, he would naturally meet with loss, no matter how careful he might seem to be. With respect to the pursuit of pleasure indulged in by these people, we shall find them attracted to all new and strange things. At the present time the most of them are probably longing for the day when it will be possible for them to race in the clouds and drive aeroplanes more recklessly than they are now driving automobiles. URANUS IN THE SIXTH HOUSE. The Sixth House governs the employment and service, also health and disease, therefore the erratic, spasmodic Uranus in the Sixth House predisposes to occupational diseases of a strange nature, asphyxiation, mental and nervous disorders, such as epilepsy, and St. Vitus dance. Even if Uranus is well-aspected, these tendencies are not entirely abrogated, at least, a person with Uranus in this position will be very ner- vous and highstrung under all conditions. With respect to employers and fellow-employees this position makes the person very irritable; he is brusque and abrupt to all connected with his work and therefore liable to [PAGE 355]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM trouble in employment or with employees. This position gives a tendency to- wards mediumship and undesirable phases of psychic experiences. If Uranus is much afflicted there is also danger of obsession and insanity. URANUS IN THE SEVENTH HOUSE, indicates a romantic, sudden, or ill-con- sidered marriage. Sometimes a common-law or other irregular form of union is consummated under this position. Often the marriage partner is a person never thought of as a mate until the Uranian ray impels to marriage on the spur of th moment. People with Uranus in the Seventh house are usually unfortunate in their marriage relations, because the marriage partner has the spasmodic, incon- stant, independent Uranian nature, chafes under the limitation and cannot remain true to any one person, but becomes inveigled into clandestine rela- tions with the result that the marriage is often dissolved in the divorce court and separation and estrangement follow; there is quite often a public scandal in connection with these affairs, or it may indicate the death of the marriage partner, all according to aspects. People with Uranus in the Seventh House should never go to law, for no matter how just their cause may be they are most likely to be thwarted or checkmated by some strange, unforseen or sudden circumstances whereby they [PAGE 356]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"are apt to lose their case. They should also avoid public office or posi- tion, for no matter how honest they may be themselves they are likely to become involved in scandal and trouble on that account. In short, this Sev- enth House position of uranus is bad for dealings of any kind with the pub- lic or with law or partners. URANUS IN THE EIGHTH HOUSE is a good omen, for it indicates that when life has been lived to its fullness the end will come suddenly and thus the person will be spared the long and pitiful suffering so often incident to the transition from the physical to the spiritual worlds. But knowing this it also behooves such people to have their house in readiness and order, so that when the end comes at 30 or 90 they have their affairs in shape. This position often brings an unexpected legacy through the marriage partner when well-aspected; but if Uranus is afflicted the person may become involved in litigation on account of or in connection with the estate of someone deceased. People with Uranus in the Eighth House often show great interest in oc- cult subjects and become well versed in mystic lore. It also gives a pre- disposition to dreams and psychic experience. [PAGE 357]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM URANUS IN THE NINTH HOUSE gives a progressive and independent mind, or an original and inventive turn, sometimes amounting to genius; the intuition is highly developed and these people indulge in constructive dreams of such a nature as transform the world in the course of time--that is, provided Uranus is well-aspected. Nevertheless they are generally looked upon as cranks because their ideas are so Utopian and far in advance of our present stage that the ordinary human beings cannot grasp them. On the other hand, if uranus is afflicted in the Ninth House, particularly if by Mars, these people become red anarchists and are not even averse to shedding blood in order to attain what they believe is the ideal; they become fanatical in whatever cause they espouse. This position of Uranus also indicates trouble in travel, particularly on voyages, and danger of accidents. It is one of the signs which make the ex- plorer and pioneer in the discovery and development of new countries. URANUS IN THE TENTH HOUSE indicates an original, eccentric character, with a contempt for conventions, who follows his own ideas regardless of what other people say or think, hence such people are often looked upon as black sheep and estranged from their kindred, but this they do not seem to [PAGE 358]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"regard as a misfortune; they are ready to offer up all, even life itself, for absolute freedom. These characteristics also bring them into public discredit and disfavor. The life is full of sudden changes for better or worse according to the other planetary aspects prevailing. If Uranus is much afflicted these people never make a success in life, but meet with con- tinual sorrow, trouble, disappointment and reverses. When Uranus is well-aspected genius will come to the fore and is likely to find recognition in some measure at least, probably by pioneer work of some kind. URANUS IN THE ELEVENTH HOUSE. Uranus being lord of the Eleventh Sign, Aquarius, is more at home in the Eleventh House than in any of the others, therefore he exerts a strong influence in bringing about strange and eccen- tric friendships with people of an original, creative, or inventive turn of mind who will be a benefit to the person if Uranus is well-aspected. This also indicates that through such friendships the wishes, hopes and aspira- tions will be promoted and reach a successful culmination. If on the other hand, Uranus is afflicted in this house, friends are apt to turn traitors or at least use the person for their own selfish ends as far as possible. URANUS IN THE TWELFTH HOUSE indicates loss of reputation, exile, and es- trangement from one's kin and country, much sickness at various times of [PAGE 359]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM life and confinement in hospitals, if Uranus is without configuration with any other planet or even if well aspected. But if seriously afflicted it indicates confinement in prison at some period of the life, or restraint in a sanitarium on account of mental trouble, also much annoyance by the under- handed action of others. When well-aspected it brings success in connection with the occult arts or occult institutions, also by the invention of chemical processes which remain secret with their discoverer instead of be- ing protected by patent. These people are haunted all through life by a vague fear of impending disaster.  URANUS IN THE TWELVE SIGNS URANUS IN ARIES gives an original, independent nature, full of energy and ambition, ingenious, resourceful and capable of coping with difficulties, especially those of a mechanical or electrical nature. These people have a very impulsive, abrupt and brusque manner which often arouses resentment and opposition in others even though no offense may have been intended. They are seldom satisfied to remain in one place, but are fond of changes and rove about a great deal. Changes of place and position are often forced upon them because of the before-mentioned blunt way of speaking."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"[PAGE 360]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS URANUS IN TAURUS gives a very intuitive nature but stubborn and self-willed, so that when these people have made up their minds nothing in the world will turn them, but they cling to their purpose or idea with the quiet determination and persistence which neither persuasion nor threats can alter. If Uranus is afflicted they are suspicious and jealous, also subject to very sudden and unexpected reverses in financial affairs. But if Uranus is well-aspected the opposite may be judged, and comfortable financial cir- cumstances may be looked for. URANUS IN GEMINI gives a highly original, intuitive and versatile nature, fond of scientific pursuits in general, but particularly those studies which have to do with electricity, aviation, or other similar out-of-the-way sub- jects. These people are broad-minded and thoroughly progressive, pioneers in all things new and modern. Among other things they generally have an in- clination for the study of occultism and astrology. They are well liked among brothers, sisters, and neighbors. All this providing Uranus is well-aspected; but if Uranus is afflicted the mind becomes eccentric and full of vagaries which make the person a nuisance and a crank, disliked by everybody, particularly brothers, sisters and neighbors. This also brings trouble and liability to accident in the course of short journeys. [PAGE 361]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM URANUS IN CANCER. Cancer is a psychic sign and when Uranus is there it indicates that the person is a sensitive, attuned to the psychic vibrations and capable of cultivating these powers, but whether for good or ill depends upon the aspects. If Uranus is afflicted there is a tendency to nervous in- digestion for Cancer rules the stomach, and if this is not attended to seri- ous stomach trouble may be expected. These people are liable to separation from their families, though usually much against their will, but as they are generally of a very uncertain temper, irritable and impatient, they are usu- ally to blame for this condition and are only getting their just desserts. URANUS IN LEO gives a very determined nature, rebellious and impatient of restraint or contradiction, with strong likes and dislikes, and an utter disregard of the conventions where the passional nature is involved. The personality is strong, forceful and self-assertive, therefore these people often incur the displeasure of others and create much opposition. They are very inconstant in affairs of the heart--\"on with the new love\" before it is \"off with the old.\" In a woman's horoscope an afflicted Uranus shows dif- ficulty in childbirth, perhaps the death of a child by accident or in a sud- den, unexpected manner, also a strong tendency towards palpitation of the [PAGE 362]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"heart. When Uranus is well-aspected in Leo both courtship and domestic af- fairs run much more smoothly and it indicates original and inventive genius, particularly along educational or journalistic lines, also for entertainment and amusement of the public and gain thereby. URANUS IN VIRGO, when well-aspected gives a keen, original, scientific and mechanical mind, a strong and well developed intuitional faculty and a keen business bent which will make for success in life, and financial gain by the employment of others. But if Uranus is afflicted in Virgo, the person is apt to become subject to strange ailments, a hypochondriac of a fractious and irritable turn of mind, a burden to himself and those who have to be around him. This posi- tion is also full of disappointment in the aims and ambitions of life, espe- cially because of limitations in the employment or in dealing with employ- ees, which the person seems unable to overcome. URANUS IN LIBRA, when well-aspected gives literary and artistic ability of an unusual and original nature where the person follows independent lines of endeavor and expression, often in connection with occultism. This posi- tion also gives a keen intuition and an attractive personality, a vivid [PAGE 363]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM imagination. It signifies partnership, union, or marriage to someone who will be of a Uranian character and of much benefit to the person. But when ill-placed or afflicted, Uranus in Libra brings sorrow, trouble, domestic difficulty and death of the marriage partner by a sudden or strange ailment or accident. Or perhaps the union may be dissolved in the divorce court, for people with the temperament described by an afflicted Uranus in Libra simply cannot remain true to one person. This position also indicates trouble with the public or the authorities on account of eccentric, anar- chistic, or socialistic activity. URANUS IN SCORPIO, when well-aspected gives the person a forceful and de- termined will, bound to overcome all obstacles and achieve that which he sets out to accomplish by persistence, perseverance and dogged determina- tion; the mind is sharp, shrewd and secretive, capable of grasping details and concentrating deeply upon whatever problem may be in hand. There is an originality and mechanical ability amounting to genius and a love for sci- ence, both occult and physical. But when ill-aspected, Uranus in Scorpio lays the person liable to ac- cidents and even assassination or sudden death by explosions, electricity, aeroplanes or kindred unusual agencies. It also gives a tendency to trouble"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"[PAGE 364]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS with the genitals on account of unbridled abuse of the sacred creative func- tion, self-abuse or perversion. URANUS IN SAGITTARIUS gives a very strong intuitive faculty with a ten- dency to dreams, visions, and a very vivid imagination. This position also gives a strong inclination towards an out-of-the-ordinary belief, including the theory and practice of the occult arts. When well-aspected this posi- tion gives a strong grasp of the religious and educational problems of the day, with a philanthropic desire to work for the upliftment of humanity, a desire to travel for the educational advantages thereby to be obtained, and success in gaining these points under favorable aspects in the progressed horoscope. When afflicted, Uranus in Sagittarius gives a very eccentric and erratic mentality, particularly with respect to law and religion. There is a rebel- lion against the social condition which often brings trouble with the au- thorities, also a desire to force one-sided views upon the world despite all protests and at all risk, characteristics which eventually bring discredit and disfavor. URANUS IN CAPRICORN, when well-aspected gives an ambitious and enterpris- ing disposition, a serious, persevering nature, and an acute sense of re- sponsibility, with original ideas of business that bring success, especially if some line is selected that is connected with the electrical or aerial [PAGE 365]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM arts. If Uranus is afflicted it gives an erratic and eccentric mind, self-willed and stubborn, bound to either rule or ruin, quarrelsome and at odds with society in general and relatives in particular. Hence this posi- tion gives a great deal of sorrow and trouble in life, frequently involving sudden changes of employment and environment. URANUS IN AQUARIUS, when well-aspected is at its very best, for he is ruler of this sign and therefore in harmony with its vibrations. Hence this position strengthens the intuition and originality, and directs the energies into humanitarian lines of endeavor, unselfish devotion to the cause of friendship, and a sincere desire to help all who are in trouble. These people make many friends and generally realize their hopes, wishes, and am- bitions because they are of such an unselfish nature that they desire what is good for humanity at large rather than that which is for personal gain."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"This position also gives considerable mechanical ability, originality and inventive genius. But if Uranus is afflicted in the sign Aquarius, though the ambitions may be as strong and sometimes as good, and as pure as with a well-aspected Uranus, they will be of such an erratic nature that it is impossible to [PAGE 366]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS realize them, and they bill bring trouble with friends, or pretended friends, who will seek to use the person for their own selfish ends, causing much sorrow and disappointment. URANUS IN PISCES, when well-aspected indicates a love of the occult arts and ability for development along these lines. It brings friends and as- sociations which favor these studies. But when ill aspected it leads to mediumship, obsession, and even insanity, if this tendency to intercourse with spirits is followed to its conclusion. This position makes the mind flighty, erratic, and the person will be subject to unexpected misfortune, scandal, or suicide. All through life, even when fortune smiles and the skies are clear to all outward appearance, these people are haunted by a vague fear of impending disaster. ASPECTS OF URANUS TO THE OTHER PLANETS THE SUN SEXTILE OR TRINE TO URANUS makes the person original, inventive and independent in his manner of conduct and personal appearance. With re- spect to food and certain mannerisms, he is what people call eccentric and conspicuous, yet not offensively so, given to pursuits and studies which people consider \"queer\" such as occultism and astrology. But he also loves [PAGE 367]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM delving into the unknown realms after nature's secrets concerning electric- ity and often becomes a successful inventor if other aspects give the me- chanical ability to work his schemes out. Uranus rules the ether and now that we are nearing the Aquarian Age his vibrations will be felt in increas- ing measure, bringing to our ken methods of using nature's finer forces and the people with Sun sextile or trine Uranus will be the media who attract and interpret them for us as the aerials and receivers in a wireless station collect and transcribe the messages carried by the ether waves to which they are attuned. These people often rise in life through the friendship of someone above them in the social scale. They are of a very high-strung tem- perament but have themselves well under control, and rarely show temper or anger. They are also out-and-out idealists."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" THE SUN PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO URANUS makes the person very high-strung, nervous, of uncontrolled emotions and ready to fly into hysteria on any or no provocation. It predisposes to nervous disorders such as St. Vitus dance, epilepsy and lack of coordination. It makes people impulsive, unreliable, and lacking in regard for the conventionalities, highly impatient of any restraint upon their liberty and committed to the [PAGE 368]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS theory of affinities, soul-mates and free love, hence these people are unde- sirable marriage partners and likely to figure in divorce proceedings or scandals of an even worse nature. There is also danger of trouble on ac- count of connection with anarchistic plots where the inventive faculty may find scope in the construction of explosives and infernal machines. Unless these aspects are modified by other configurations such people are among the most dangerous to society. They are liable to accidents from lightening, electricity and all through life they meet disappointment from the most un- expected quarters. VENUS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO URANUS makes the person mentally alert, or quick intuitive perception and exceedingly magnetic, especially to the op- posite sex; and it also attracts hosts of friends who will be of benefit and assistance to him. These aspects give love of art, music and poetry and are a favorable indication of a happy marriage, often at a very early age or suddenly consummated. The good aspects between Venus and Uranus also some- times bring to the subject love of a platonic nature which then acts as an inspiration in the life. VENUS CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO URANUS. As in the case of Mars conjunc- tion to Venus, so also in the case of Uranus conjunction to Venus, there is a doubt as to whether this aspect should be classed as good or evil. This [PAGE 369]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM must be settled in the individual horoscope where it occurs, for it may work either way, depending upon the other planetary configurations and the stu- dent will therefore have to use his judgment as to how he classes it. If Venus is otherwise afflicted in the horoscope, for instance, the conjunction or parallel will further accentuate her evil qualities and act like the square or opposition, but if she is well placed or aspected, Uranus will bring out the nobler side, the same as the sextile or trine. VENUS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO URANUS. The square or opposition always brings trouble through the sex relation--quarrels, divorces, public scandals through clandestine intercourse and kindred irregularities, with loss of friends, prestige and popularity, exile from home and family and sudden fi-"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"nancial losses through unexpected or unforseen happenings. There is a gen- eral lack of balance, an erratic personality. MERCURY SEXTILE OR TRINE TO URANUS gives an original, independent and ec- centric mind impatient of the fetters of fashion, tradition and convention. Such a person is strenuous in his efforts to hew a path for himself in com- plete liberty. Therefore this is the hall-mark of pioneers in thought and invention, the sign of genius. Their ideas and ideals are exceedingly [PAGE 370]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS lofty, progressive and inspiring, in fact too much so in the opinion of the average man or woman who looks upon their actions and vagaries as the out- come of a diseased mind. Nevertheless they have plenty of friends on ac- count of their kindly and sympathetic nature. These aspects are good for a literary or scientific pursuit, also for invention, particularly those which have to do with air or electricity. MERCURY PARALLEL OR CONJUNCTION WITH URANUS. If Mercury is otherwise af- flicted the conjunction and parallel are to be judged as bad aspects and read accordingly, but if Mercury is otherwise well placed and aspected the delineation given for the sextile and trine will apply. MERCURY SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO URANUS. Mercury in square or opposition to Uranus is the hall-mark of the true crank or anarchist with extreme ideas to tear down the social structure and undertake a radical reform without the ability to build up something better. People with these configurations are given to ranting and raving in public and their language is usually as cruel as the measures they advocate. Whatever ability they possess is usually turned to an erratic purpose and therefore they are ostracised and disliked wherever they go. They are often forced to make sudden changes to escape the consequences of their erratic conduct. [PAGE 371]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM THE MOON SEXTILE OR TRINE TO URANUS gives great originality and indepen- dence to the mind which is quick, intuitive and very vivid in its imagina- tion, hence the person has inventive ability; he is attracted to the occult arts and is endowed with hypnotic or magnetic powers, also the intuitional ability to study and practice astrology. If electricity is adopted as a vo- cation the person will make a success of it. These aspects also give the person a peculiar fascination for the opposite sex and are likely to lead to a clandestine love affair or an unconventional union. THE MOON CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO URANUS gives mental and psychic ten- dencies similar to those of the good aspects and also the same liability to"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"irregular love-affairs, but these tendencies are not so pronounced and a clandestine love-affair generated under the conjunction of Uranus and the Moon may have distinctly disastrous results similar to those mentioned under the bad aspects. If the conjunction occurs in Cancer it indicates nervous indigestion; in Leo it inclines to palpitation of the heart, interferes with the rhythm of the heartbeat and gives a spasmodic action which will probably prove fatal when it has run its course; in Scorpio it inclines to perverted practices; in Sagittarius the reflex action would be felt in the lungs and similarly with the other signs. [PAGE 372]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS THE MOON SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO URANUS makes the person erratic and touchy to a degree, walking powder magazine ready to explode at any moment, overbearing, conceited and intolerant, shunned by all who can possibly get out of his way. If such people are employers nobody can work for them and if they are employees nobody will have them. They never remain very long in any place, but are either discharged or give up their position on the slightest provocation. People with these aspects are also attracted by the occult arts but they never make a success at them because of their erratic mentality. Like the other aspects of Uranus and the Moon, the square and opposition also indicate a clandestine attachment either on the part of the person or the marriage partner. If Uranus occurs in the Seventh House of a man's horoscope it proves the wife untrue and a public scandal and divorce will eventually ensue. The bad aspects of the Sun and Uranus give similar indications in the horoscope of a woman. SATURN SEXTILE OR TRINE URANUS is fortunate for a public career in an of- ficial capacity for it gives ambition and determination with ability to con- centrate upon the work in hand and to exercise authority, plan and system- atize. It strengthens the intuition so that such people are guided by keen [PAGE 373]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM interior insight when new and important steps have to be taken, therefore such people are in demand and find positions with large corporations where they win their way through sheer ability. The mind is both mechanical and ingenious, hence this position often denotes the successful inventor, par- ticularly along the lines of electricity, aerial navigation and kindred pioneer lines. SATURN CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO URANUS has an influence like the good aspects if the planets are unafflicted, elevated, in angles, essentially dignified or exalted, as Saturn in Libra and Capricorn or Uranus in Aquarius or Scorpio, but if the conjunction occurs in signs where either of the plan- ets is weak or afflicted, like Saturn in Aries, Cancer or Leo, then the in-"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"fluence will be detrimental and should be judged the same as the square or opposition. SATURN SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO URANUS gives an unscrupulous nature with an extremely violent temper. The outbursts are as sudden as a bolt from the blue and exhaust the person completely. These people are very eccentric and look at everything from a peculiar angle--treacherous, idle and indolent, malicious and altogether dangerous to the community. These aspects also in- dicate chronic or incurable diseases according to the signs wherein they are placed, but as often said, if the other indications in the horoscope are [PAGE 374]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS good the influence of a single aspect will not bring out such evil charac- teristics and therefore the whole horoscope is to be carefully considered before judging the influences enumerated, for they may be materially minimized by other favorable indications in the horoscope. JUPITER SEXTILE OR TRINE TO URANUS gives a strong, independent and positive personality with an ingenious, inventive and original turn of mind. Whatever he undertakes he will carry to a conclusion or die in the attempt. This position also gives a broad, humane and benevolent disposition and a tendency to delve into the occult arts and sciences. It favors association with secret orders and gives promise of prosperity in life. Such a person is honest and sincere, sociable, hospitable and friendly to all, hence likely to benefit a great deal from influential friends in an official posi- tion. This position also gives executive ability and success in connection with institutions of learning. JUPITER CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO URANUS gives similar indications to the good aspects but the influence is not quite so decided, particularly if either of the planets is weak by sign or otherwise afflicted. In that case it will be found that the tendencies conferred are more like those of the bad aspects. [PAGE 375]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM JUPITER SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO URANUS gives an impulsive nature liable to act in a sudden or impulsive nature liable to act in a sudden impulsive, erratic or unexpected manner to his own undoing. Loss by speculation, law- suits and impulsive extravagance are also indicated, many changes both of occupation and residence, loss of friends and reputation. It signifies one of an ostentatious nature given to sham and camouflage and subterfuge, gen- erally disliked for his insincerity and double dealings; a confidence man, bunko man or cheap gambler."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" MARS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO URANUS gives an energetic and ambitious disposi- tion, an original, ingenious, alert, intuitive mind which in resourceful in the highest degree and able to cope with great difficulties under trying circumstances. Thus people with these configurations are naturally of an inventive turn of mind and successful in bringing their ideas to realiza- tion. Their inventive genius usually expresses itself along electrical lines, aviation, or in other unusual directions, for these aspects are one of the marks of the pioneer of the Aquarian Age, where science and inven- tions will reach out in directions that are now entirely undreamed of even as possibilities. But while these people are dreamers of dreams they are also practical, energetic and enterprising in a sufficient degree to make their dreams come true in the world. They have a wide vision and a noble [PAGE 376]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS nature which rises over all petty distinctions of race, creed or color and recognizes in all human beings the divine spark which is the basis of uni- versal brotherhood. They may not be exactly religious in the orthodox sense of the word but their ideas are truly cosmic, hence they are often mistaken for visionaries by those who do not understand them. MARS CONJUNCTION, PARALLEL, SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO URANUS gives an er- ratic and eccentric disposition, a violent temper of the worst nature, an unusual resentment of even the slightest restraint and gives the person a stubborn, headstrong and dogged determination to go ahead in any line of ac- tion upon which he has decided no matter what the outcome. He will listen to neither reason nor entreaty but follows his own course in defiance of all. People with these configurations very often become anarchists of the reddest type for they do not even stop at the shedding of blood, if other testimonies in the figure concur. they are cruel, hard and cold, without a spark of true love though they may be inflamed with passion of the most burning intensity. This is particularly the case when Mars is square Uranus and either planet is placed in Taurus or Scorpio. In a woman's horoscope Uranus square Mars usually leads to seduction no matter where they are [PAGE 377]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM placed, but if in Taurus or Scorpio escape is almost impossible. The other characteristics of these planets in these configurations work themselves out according to the signs wherein they are placed so that their placement in Taurus or Scorpio works upon the sex which is governed by these signs. When one of these planets is in Scorpio, if the person takes up the profession of surgery he will become very cruel and unfeeling, ready to operate for the mere pleasure of causing pain and in consequence or in pursuit of this pas- sion he will probably take up vivisection and develop and unusual ingenuity in torturing his victims. With Uranus or Mars in Scorpio or Pisces he will"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"be underhanded or tricky though he may show a very different front to the public. In Aries it will make a rattlebrain, in Gemini and Virgo an unusu- ally quick mentality but quick in seeing only how to trick others. In Sag- ittarius it will make the person very materialistic, atheistic, or fanatical against the established religion or society. Thus the planets blend their individual natures with the sign. NEPTUNE SEXTILE OR TRINE TO URANUS gives inclination towards the occult or mystical side of life, and if either is placed in the Tenth House the person usually becomes a leader or authority in these lines, he wins at least local recognition and if other testimonies concur his fame will be [PAGE 378]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS national or international. Such aspects will bring direct touch with the spiritual world and success in dealing with the inhabitants of that plane. It is also productive of dreams and visions of a prophetic and inspirational nature. It strengthens the healing powers and will consequently enable the person to do a great deal of good for his suffering fellow-men. These as- pects give a highly developed intuition which amounts almost to mind-reading. There is a love of travel and exploration of the physical world as well as of nature's finer realms. Nor are such people altogether dreamers, they have a strong will with excellent executive and organizing powers which will aid them in realizing their hopes, wishes and ambitions to rise in life and be at the forefront of whatever profession they select. NEPTUNE CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO URANUS are convertible aspects; if the planets are well placed by sign and otherwise well aspected, their effect will be similar to the sextile or trine, though not so pronounced, but if they are cadent weak by sign, and afflicted they are only a little less evil than when aspected by square or opposition. NEPTUNE SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO URANUS brings underhanded, deceptive in- fluences into the life which aim to undermine the reputation and make the [PAGE 379]  URANUS, THE PLANET OF ALTRUISM person suffer scandal and public disfavor, sudden and unaccountable reverses in business are met with, or trouble in social affairs. there is the same love of travel and exploration as given by the good aspects but the person cannot accomplish his aims with the same facility, or if he does it is to his disadvantage and brings added trouble. He is also drawn towards the oc- cult or mystic side of life, but his path is beset by dangers of mediumship and obsession and all through life he is filled with premonitions of danger and a vague dread of impending disaster which he can neither account for nor dispel by will or reason, hence uncertainty overshadows the life as a cloud"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"and robs him of peace and contentment."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"[PAGE 380]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CHAPTER XVII. NEPTUNE, THE PLANET OF DIVINITY As URANUS is the octave of Venus and acts principally upon the love na- ture, aiming to elevate mankind in matters personal and social, so Neptune is the octave of Mercury, and altogether spiritual in its aims. As Mercury is Lightbearer of the physical Sun, so Neptune is Lightbearer for the spiritual Sun, (called Vulcan by the Western Mystics). Intellectuality, ruled by Mercury lifted us above the animal and made man, man; the Spiritu- ality ruled by Neptune will in time raise us beyond the state of the human and make us divine. Neptune really signifies what we may call \"the gods\" commencing with the supernormal beings we know as Elder Brothers, and compassing the innumerable hosts of spiritual entities, good, bad, and indifferent, which influence our evolution. Its position and aspects denote our relation to them; malefic aspects attract agencies of a nature inimical to our welfare, benefic con- figurations draw upon the good forces. Thus, if Neptune is placed in the Tenth House, trine to the ascendant, the person involved will have the op- portunity to become a leader or prominent in a movement along mystical lines [PAGE 381]  NEPTUNE, THE PLANET OF DIVINITY as denoted by the exalted position of Neptune. His body will be capable of receiving the finer vibrations, and of coming in touch with the spiritual world, as denoted by the trine of the ascendant. On the other hand, when Neptune is placed in the Twelfth House, whose nature is passive and produc- tive of suffering, that position indicates that at some time, perhaps under a square form the midheaven, the evil forces, among whom are spirit-controls, will be drawn to that person and endeavor to obtain posses- sion of the body. the conjunction of Neptune with the ascendant will make the body sensitive and usable for spiritual purposes, as well as the trine. Given the opportunity afforded by the first aspect mentioned, the man may become a pupil of a mystery school and a factor for great good in the uplift of mankind; placed under the affliction of the second aspect, he may become a helpless tool of spirit-controls: an irresponsible medium. But there is one factor which is never shown in the horoscope, and that is the will of man. He is bound at some time in life to meet with the expe- riences denoted by his horoscope, and the opportunities there indicated will be placed before him one by one in orderly succession, as the clock of des- tiny marks the appropriate time; but how he, the free and independent spirit, meets that fated experience, no one can determine beforehand, and the man in whose horoscope the first mentioned benefic configuration occurs"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"may not be sufficiently awake to the great opportunity before him to catch [PAGE 382]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS it on the wing, it may have flown before he realizes it was there. Yes, he may never become aware of the fact. On the other hand, the person in whose life the square indicates the assault by spiritual forces mentioned, may develop his spiritual muscle by resisting the onslaught and become a victor instead of being vanquished. Forewarned is forearmed. Neptune was not discovered until 1846, but we should err greatly if we supposed the influence ascribed to it fictitious on that account, for as the person born blind lacks the organs to see the sunlight and colors, so most of humanity is still lacking the sensibility which makes them amenable to the vibrations of Neptune. (See Chapter on that subject, also on Planetary Octaves). But we are gradually developing finer feelings and becoming more able to respond to his influence. At first this influence is mostly felt by sensitives who become occultists when of a positive nature and mediums when negative, others gain from it the cunning common alike to the criminal and the detective, or it impels the weakling to take drugs which in another man- ner produce dreams and visions similar to those obtained by the mediumistic process. Neptune strong in the figure gives a very vivid imagination and an artis- tic nature, poetic, musical or literary, a fondness of ease, comfort and beautiful surroundings. The person is easily swayed by the emotions, and when Neptune is afflicted may become subject to trances, fainting, hysteria, [PAGE 383]  NEPTUNE, THE PLANET OF DIVINITY or psychic storms. There is a love of travel, preferably by water. When Neptune is weak by sign or afflicted it also inclines to drink or drugs, it robs the person of ambition and makes him an indolent loafer or cheat, thoroughly dishonest, or if the horoscope is otherwise good he may become the prey of other people who will rob or defraud him. People with an afflicted Neptune should particularly avoid dealings with large corporations or they may be subjected to swindles of the most fantastic nature.  NEPTUNE IN THE TWELVE HOUSES NEPTUNE IN THE ASCENDANT, OR FIRST HOUSE. Neptune is by nature occult, prophetic and spiritual. The Ascendant signifies the body wherein we func- tion and thus by combination of these ideas we find that Neptune on the As- cendant will give a particularly sensitive body capable of feeling the finer vibrations in nature, and according to the aspects which the planet re-"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"ceives, these will be either good, bad or indifferent. If Neptune is strong and well aspected to the Sun, Jupiter or Uranus, we may judge that there is an intensely mystical nature latent in the person. Whether or not it will be developed is, of course, another question depending upon opportunity and environment. On the other hand, if Neptune is afflicted, it indicates a [PAGE 384]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS very low mentality, perhaps even insanity. In any case the nature is vi- sionary, romantic and generally unpractical, at least from the worldly stan- dard. The prophetic, inspirational and visionary faculties are usually highly developed when Neptune is unafflicted in the First House. There is a love of art and music, a desire for luxury and whatever gives power and tone to life. But when Neptune is afflicted in the First House the nature is in- dolent, procrastinating and changeable; perverted tastes and desires come to the front and impel to acts of indiscretion which may bring grave conse- quences. There is indication of prostitution of the spiritual faculties; a deceptive, dishonest disposition, also a tendency to mediumship and spirit obsession. NEPTUNE IN THE SECOND HOUSE and well aspected brings gain through all things in which water plays a prominent part; also through mystic and occult matters and societies. But if Neptune is afflicted the financial affairs of the person will always be in an uncertain, chaotic state. NEPTUNE IN THE THIRD HOUSE, when well aspected enhances the mental facul- ties to a considerable degree. It gives ability in the direction of inspi- rational writing and speaking, high ideals, a devotional mind. But when Neptune is afflicted in the Third House the mind is of a low order, cunning, sometimes imbecile and idiotic, with weird and uncanny feelings and per- [PAGE 385]  NEPTUNE, THE PLANET OF DIVINITY verted appetites. Neptune in the Third House also gives a tendency to many journeys, frequently by water, but whether or not they are successful de- pends upon the aspects. NEPTUNE IN THE FOURTH HOUSE, when well aspected, gives a spiritual atmo- sphere to the home with unusual conditions for soul-growth through the rela- tionships there formed, but when afflicted it brings fraud and deception, unhappiness and distrust, peculiar problems and many changes of residence. There is also a liability to extreme poverty at the close of life, even con- finement in a public institution of charity. NEPTUNE IN THE FIFTH HOUSE, strong and well aspected, indicates a suc- cessful courtship of one of a highly advanced spiritual nature, success as a"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"teacher of mystic matters, and gain by investment in things ruled by Neptune, aquatic sports and any other business in which the watery element is strong. NEPTUNE IN THE SIXTH HOUSE, well aspected, is a favorable indication of latent psychic faculties which may be developed with profit from the spiritual point of view. But when afflicted it predisposes to the prostitu- tion of spiritual faculties by mediumship, etc. Thus the person may become subject to spirit control and run grave danger of obsession. It also [PAGE 386]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS indicates trouble and loss through employees and a liability to chronic wasting diseases and deformity. Usually these tendencies are then accentu- ated by a sensuous nature and a self-indulgent manner of living. NEPTUNE IN THE SEVENTH HOUSE and well aspected indicates a marriage to tone of an occult, inspirational nature, generally a platonic union of the most soul-satisfying nature, a true companionship of two who are really mates. It also shows success as a public speaker on occult or mystical sub- jects. But when afflicted, Neptune in the Seventh House shows an emotional mediumistic, unreliable marriage partner, or there may be fraud or deception in connection with the marriage, perhaps one of the partners committing bigamy. this position also indicates one of the parasites that prey upon the public in general, or of those who become victims of public disfavor, all according to the nature of the aspects. They show whether or not this is merited. NEPTUNE IN THE EIGHTH HOUSE, when well aspected, gives gain through the marriage partner, but not through the ordinary channels of business; it comes in a peculiar manner. This position is also favorable for occult in- vestigation and often enables the person who has it to obtain information at [PAGE 387]  NEPTUNE, THE PLANET OF DIVINITY at first hand. But when Neptune is afflicted in the Eighth house it brings a loss by fraud or deception of the marriage partner, financial troubles with estates or corporations and a strange, unusual ending to the life. NEPTUNE IN THE NINTH HOUSE is very favorable for the cultivation of spiritual faculties; when well aspected, it brings strange visions and un- usual intuitional forebodings and presentiments, also profit and pleasure in connection with long journeys or voyages. When Neptune is afflicted in the Ninth House it makes the mind fearful and anxious, always on the QUI VIVE with vague forebodings; it inclines to"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"travel but brings trouble in that connection, also danger of legal complica- tion and loss on that account. NEPTUNE IN THE TENTH HOUSE, when well aspected indicates one of high as- pirations and inspirations, spiritually inclined, who has the ability to rise to leadership, fame and honor, in connection with some mystical society or in scientific research. This position of Neptune also indicates an ac- cident to one of the parents, probably by water, while the person is still a child, but when the planet is well aspected a legacy often accrues. Neptune in the Tenth house and trine to the Sun or Moon are sure signs of [PAGE 388]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the ability to cultivate the spiritual sight in this life. A number of well-known seers have this aspect. When Neptune is afflicted in the Tenth House it indicates fraud, decep- tion and dishonesty which in time will bring their reward of sorrow, trouble and scandal. NEPTUNE IN THE ELEVENTH HOUSE and well aspected shows a person of high spiritual aspirations and the ability to attract others of a similar nature who will be of help to him in realizing his desires, hopes and wishes. When Neptune is afflicted in the Eleventh House it indicates deception and treachery on the part of people who pose as friends; this will bring loss and trouble. Therefore people with this position should be particularly careful whom they cultivate and admit their friendship. NEPTUNE IN THE TWELFTH HOUSE, well aspected, brings success in research work of a scientific or occult nature which is carried on in secret or far from the haunts of men. It also indicates a secret soul-satisfying or clan- destine but honorable relationship with someone which will bring benefit to both and it not infrequently happens that this friend is in the spirit world, but the relations is much more close in such cases than it can ever be between friends who are both in the physical body. When Neptune is af- flicted in the Twelfth House it gives a liability to confinement and [PAGE 389]  NEPTUNE, THE PLANET OF DIVINITY restraint in a public institution such as a hospital, asylum, or prison, on account of secret but powerful enemies, a chronic and noisome disease or in- sanity due to perverted practices.  NEPTUNE IN THE TWELVE SIGNS NEPTUNE IN ARIES, when well aspected fills a person with religious enthu-"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"siasm, though not always of the orthodox kind, and gives him the energy and ambition to push forward to the front rank in whatever line of thought and belief he espouses. There is a desire to elevate humanity to a higher and more noble plane of life and on that account this configuration or position usually brings the person forward as a public character or more or less im- portance, according to the general aspects and tenor of the horoscope. But when afflicted, Neptune in Aries brings out the destructive tenden- cies. There is a similar desire to raise humanity to realms of happiness, but the methods are anarchistic and it incites to murder of those whom the person conceives to be the enemies of society, by bomb plot or assassina- tion, and lays the person liable to imprisonment on account of conspiracy against the government or others in authority. NEPTUNE IN TAURUS gives a kindly, companionable disposition and an incli- nation towards the beautiful and artistic in nature. He is fond of music [PAGE 390]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS and the pleasures of life. This is also a good omen for the acquisition of land or property. But when Neptune is afflicted in Taurus it gives a sensu- ous and passionate nature and a strong tendency to gourmandize which in time is bound to bring trouble and sorrow in its wake. NEPTUNE IN GEMINI, well aspected, is one of the best indications of un- usual mental faculties, for Neptune is the octave of Mercury the planet of mind, logic and reason. Hence this position develops the occult, prophetic and inspirational faculties. It makes the person sensitive to the finer in- tuitional and inspirational vibrations in nature. It is the signature of genius in one direction or another according to the conditions in the horo- scope. It gives the gift of oratory and unusual literary ability, and makes the person a fine mechanician or mathematician; in short, there is no field of endeavor where mental ingenuity is required, that the person with Neptune in Gemini, well aspected, does not excel. But when Neptune is afflicted in Gemini it indicates inability to concen- trate to any good purpose. The mind is restless, chaotic and wavering, in- clined to cunning, fraud and deception, or at best it makes the person a visionary and a dreamer who is apt to become the dupe of others. There is generally trouble with brothers, sisters and neighbors who cordially dislike [PAGE 391]  NEPTUNE, THE PLANET OF DIVINITY the person in whose horoscope this aspect is found. NEPTUNE IN CANCER, when well aspected, gives an intuitive, sympathetic"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"and lovable nature quick to understand the sorrows and joys of others and ready to feel for them or with them. Hence these people are generally very much liked, both in the home and in their immediate circle of acquaintances. This position also brings them in touch with the finer forces of nature and enables them to cultivate such spiritual faculties as psychometry and a spe- cies of intuition whereby they can get in touch with whomsoever or whatso- ever they wish for the help and benefit of others. They are very versatile in the spiritual direction and may reach great heights by devotion, which is strongly expressed in them. But when Neptune is afflicted in Cancer it gives a very self-indulgent disposition which generally exerts a baneful in- fluence in the home, perhaps more by inuendo than by direct malicious ex- pression. This position also gives peculiar tastes and appetites which are apt to cause great trouble to the alimentative system and there is a strong inclination for drugs or drink. NEPTUNE IN LEO, when well aspected, gives a generous, sympathetic and warm-hearted disposition, a sociable nature, fond of pleasures and artistic pursuits. These people have considerable ability and success in educational [PAGE 392]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS pursuits because of an intimate understanding of the nature of others and the faculty of imparting to them whatever knowledge they possess themselves. They are very conscientious in their dealings with others and successful in affairs of the heart. But when Neptune is afflicted in Leo it makes the nature super-sensual and therefore liable to disappointments in love. These people are governed by impulse rather than by reason; they lack the stamina to face an issue, are cowardly, fickle and not to be depended upon; they incur a general dis- like among their acquaintances. NEPTUNE IN VIRGO. Mercury, the planet of mind, reason and logic is ex- alted in Virgo, and the occult, prophetic, inspirational, spiritual, devo- tional and musical Neptune is the octave of Mercury, hence the blending of the Mercurial and Neptunian qualities produced by Neptune in Virgo gives ex- ceptionally fine mental faculties with the addition of inspiration, pro- phetic ability, devotion to high ideals when Neptune is well aspected, for Neptune adds gentleness and sympathy to the cold Mercury; though such people are rather odd in their ideas and inclinations, especially with respect to marriage, which they usually regard from the platonic standpoint. [PAGE 393]  NEPTUNE, THE PLANET OF DIVINITY If Neptune is afflicted in virgo it gives hypochondriac tendencies and an imagination of having all the ills and ailments in the universe which makes"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"the person's life miserable. There is also a tendency to become the play- thing of spirit controls, not only with respect to mediumship but such people are liable to direct obsession and when this calamity has once oc- curred it is very difficult to free the body from the obsessing entity. NEPTUNE IN LIBRA, when well aspected, gives a musical, poetic and artis- tic temperament and indicates a union of a highly spiritual nature which will be of great comfort and satisfaction to the person. When Neptune is afflicted in Libra, there is a tendency to clandestine, unconventional and illegitimate relations, either of the person himself or of the marriage partner, according to the nature of the aspects to Neptune. It indicates a weak and over-emotional nature which incurs and merits the dislike for those in its immediate environment. NEPTUNE IN SCORPIO, well aspected, gives a desire to delve into the se- crets of nature and thus it is a good position for those who work in scien- tific or occult research. It gives energy, enthusiasm and inspirational perception beyond the realm of reason and augurs successful accomplishment of whatever is undertaken. But when afflicted it gives a terrible temper, a [PAGE 394]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS sensuous and passionate nature, an inordinate desire for drink or drugs and a tendency to drowning either by accident or design. NEPTUNE IN SAGITTARIUS, when well aspected increases the inspirational, devotional and religious tendencies in the horoscope. It brings dreams, vi- sions, and occult experiences. There is love of travel and a great enjoy- ment of the pleasures thus obtained. When Neptune is afflicted in Sagit- tarius the subjects become liable to fears and forebodings; dreams of danger and visions of distress prey upon the mind, making life miserable. Some- times they have great desires to travel but are unable to gratify them, or if they do they have trouble or accidents to contend with. NEPTUNE IN CAPRICORN, when well aspected gives a serious and contempla- tive nature, able to concentrate upon whatever matters come before it, hence such people are successful, keen and far-sighted business men, usually work- ing on a large scale, or if the nature of the other aspects of the horoscope draws them toward secret work they make excellent detectives capable of solving the most intricate problems, or researchers along psychic lines; in fact they excel in any occupation where deep thought and concentration are the keys to success. [PAGE 395]  NEPTUNE, THE PLANET OF DIVINITY But when Neptune is afflicted in Capricorn it makes the nature melan-"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"choly, secretive and very often deceitful. These people re generally re- cluses and shun the society of their fellow-men. NEPTUNE IN AQUARIUS, when well aspected, gives an altruistic or utopian disposition with a desire to emancipate the whole world from whatever so- cial, mental, moral or physical ills the person may be able to perceive. Hence these people are usually too far in advance of their time and age to be understood. They are regarded as dreamers and visionaries, idealists and, as in a sense, dangerous to society because of their originality and independence of conventions. At the same time they are very popular with the most progressive people in society. They easily apprehend Nature's finer forces and are therefore the pioneers in exploration of hitherto undreamed-of fields. When Neptune is afflicted in Aquarius it gives similar ideas and ideals in regard to conventions. But it is only too liable to bring such people and their lives into discredit and disgrace. NEPTUNE IN PISCES, when well aspected gives a love of mysticism and a tendency to investigate the occult. Sometimes these people develop their spiritual faculties and obtain first-hand knowledge. They are compassionate towards others, unobtrusive, retiring in their manner, well like also often [PAGE 396]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the recipients of aid from others, cheerfully and willingly given. When Neptune is afflicted in Pisces the person is liable to suffer through mediumship, obsession and deception of secret enemies. There is danger of imprisonment and a tendency to indulge in drink or drugs which will end in sorrow and self-undoing. NEPTUNE IN ASPECT WITH OTHER PLANETS THE SUN SEXTILE OR TRINE TO NEPTUNE favors the possibility of developing spiritual faculties, for Neptune intensifies the higher vibrations in the aura and as some express themselves best through music these aspects make them unusually sensitive to echoes from the heavenworld, which is the realm of tone. Many people with these configurations hear the harmony of the spheres and if Mercury, the lower octave of Neptune, gives the requisite dexterity they become musicians of a high inspirational nature. In others it breeds a love of the occult which leads them into the higher life, but they usually approach it from the intellectual standpoint as psychic inves- tigators. A few live the life and obtain first-hand knowledge.

In a watery sign Neptune induces the person to drink to excess and then the resulting acceleration of the vibratory rate frequently causes such a person to perceive the ugly and gruesome forms abounding in the lower realms of the invisible world, which are real elemental entities and not figments of his fancy as believed by people who hear him tell what he sees during delirium tremens. VENUS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO NEPTUNE makes an inspirational musician. It gives a fertile imagination and deep emotions, a nature that is pure and chaste, hence occasionally it leads to platonic unions and companionship of the most ecstatic nature. VENUS CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO NEPTUNE is to be judged on the same line as indicated in the cases of Mars and Uranus. VENUS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO NEPTUNE makes the person liable to sorrow, loss and trouble, especially through the marriage partner or anyone else in whom he trusts. People with these aspects should be particularly careful to avoid anything which has in it an element of chance or speculation for they [PAGE 398]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS are sure to lose, especially in dealing with large companies or corpora- tions. MERCURY IN CONJUNCTION, PARALLEL, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO NEPTUNE makes a man peculiarly adapted to the occult art, particularly if the conjunction occurs in the Third or Ninth House or the trines are from watery signs--Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces. Such people usually succeed in occult science and often develop a supernormal faculty. They are particularly good as magnetic healers. MERCURY SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO NEPTUNE gives a chaotic mind, liability to lack of memory, indolence and a disposition to dream the time away. There is a restless desire for fame frustrated by inability to fit in any- where. Such people are liable to fraud, deception and slander, also to temptation to suicide. THE MOON SEXTILE OR TRINE TO NEPTUNE increases the faculty of imagination to a superlative degree, especially if either of the planets is in the Ninth House. Then it favors prophetic dreams and visions which bring the person into contact with the invisible worlds. It indicates ability in the occult"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"arts and success in their practice. It makes the nature exceedingly inspi- rational and it also gives a kind and sympathetic disposition. The spiritual qualities mentioned may not be apparent even to the person [PAGE 399]  NEPTUNE, THE PLANET OF DIVINITY himself, but them they re latent and capable of development. It is also safe to say that at some time or other during the life persons with these aspects will come in contact with the occult and be very much attracted, whether the qualities of the soul are developed or not. THE MOON CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO NEPTUNE indicates the same strong psychic faculties as the good aspects, particularly if Neptune is placed in the psychic sign Cancer. Those who have been norm with the good configura- tions of Neptune during the fourteen years when it was in the airy scienti- fic sign Gemini are now conquering the air and perfecting scientific inven- tions which will make us marvel, but the children who have been born under favorable configurations during the fourteen years Neptune has been going through the psychic sign Cancer are growing up around us as a band of mys- tics and when they have reached mature years they will astonish us with their spiritual insight and power. Among other things they will develop the soul of music in a hitherto unprecedented manner. THE MOON SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO NEPTUNE is also an indication of the soul qualities similar to those given by the good aspects, but under the former aspects the person will be of a negative nature and is apt to become [PAGE 400]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the prey of spirit-controls and subjected to mediumship, therefore people with those aspects should be very careful not to attend spiritualistic se- ances, \"sit in silence\" or use other methods of occult development. SATURN SEXTILE OR TRINE TO NEPTUNE is good for success in worldly affairs for it brings out the saturnine virtues, forethought, honor, self-reliance, determinations, system et cetera, by which the person gains the confidence and esteem of others, but the principal effect is spiritual and therefore only felt by those who are able to respond because of other aspects in the horoscope. To them it gives the ability to delve deeply into occult and mystical subjects, also to become proficient in the art and practice thereof. SATURN CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO NEPTUNE has the same effect as the good aspects when it occurs in a sign where either of the planets are strong as Neptune is in Cancer and Pisces and Saturn in Libra and Capricorn."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" SATURN SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO NEPTUNE lays the person liable to loss by deception, treachery or fraud in worldly matters and if he should undertake to investigate or practise the occult art he is liable to become the prey of spirit-controls and be led into mediumship with consequent danger to the [PAGE 401]  NEPTUNE, THE PLANET OF DIVINITY health, and liability to attempt suicide. JUPITER SEXTILE OR TRINE TO NEPTUNE gives an inspirational mystical na- ture and ability to fill a position connected with occult orders, that is to say, where the character is sufficiently developed so that Neptune can make the influence felt for then this position brings out all the noblest and most spiritual strength of both planets, and occult experiences are not in- frequently the result. At any rate, during the sleeping hours these people are quite active and conscious in the invisible worlds and often bring expe- riences back with them as dreams or visions. JUPITER CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO NEPTUNE gives an influence similar to that of the good aspects when Neptune and Jupiter are not afflicted, but if they are in a weak sign and aspecting the other planets by square or opposi- tion them the influence is similar to that of the bad aspects of Jupiter and Neptune. JUPITER SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO NEPTUNE indicates lack of control of the emotions. The person is sensitive to the influences of the borderland between the seen and the unseen worlds but they are often of an awe-inspiring and disgusting type, hence apt to cause hysterical conditions, involuntary trance and kindred disorders attendant upon negative psychism, [PAGE 402]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS but from a material standpoint it gives danger of fraud through speculation or large companies and dealing with predatory interests should therefore be avoided. MARS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO NEPTUNE intensifies the emotional nature and gives a leaning toward the study and practice of occultism and mysticism. When other testimonies in the horoscope concur, the martial energy directed toward the psychic subjects denoted by Neptune often helps the person very materially in his aim to penetrate into the invisible worlds in a conscious manner. MARS CONJUNCTION, SQUARE, PARALLEL, OR OPPOSITION TO NEPTUNE makes the nature coarse and sensual, impulsive and irascible, militant and extravagant in speech and action, self-indulgent to a degree in whatever direction his"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"passions may lead him and unable to exercise restraint over himself in any direction. It gives a fanatical spirit which may express itself in either religion or atheism and under favorable conditions such people are liable to become victims of discarnate spirits who may either use them as a medium or by obsessing them. It gives a tendency to lawlessness and participation in anarchistic schemes or plots. [PAGE 403]  NEPTUNE, THE PLANET OF DIVINITY URANUS SEXTILE OR TRINE TO NEPTUNE gives inclination towards the occult or mystical side of life, and if either is placed in the Tenth House the person usually becomes a leader or authority in these lines, he wins at least local recognition and if other testimonies concur his fame will be na- tional or international. Such an aspect will bring direct tough with the spiritual world and success in dealing with inhabitants of that plane. It produces dreams and visions of a prophetic and inspirational nature, strengthens the healing powers and will consequently enable the person to do a great deal of good for his suffering fellow-men. These aspects give a highly developed intuition which amounts almost to mind-reading. There is a love of travel and exploration of the physical world as well as of nature's finer realms. Nor are such people altogether dreamers, they have a strong will with excellent executive and organizing powers which will aid them in realizing their hopes, wishes and ambitions to rise in life and be at the forefront of whatever profession they select. URANUS CONJUNCTION OR PARALLEL TO NEPTUNE are convertible aspects; if the planets are well placed by sign and otherwise well afflicted, their effect will be similar to the sextile or trine, though not so pronounced, but if they are cadent, weak by sign, and afflicted they are only a little less [PAGE 404]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS evil than when aspected by square or opposition. URANUS SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO NEPTUNE brings underhanded, deceptive in- fluences into the life which aim to undermine the reputation and make the person suffer scandal and public disfavor, sudden and unaccountable reverses in business are met with, or trouble in social affairs. There is the same love of travel and exploration as given by the good aspects but the person cannot accomplish his aims with the same facility, or if he does it is to his disadvantage and brings added trouble He is also drawn towards the oc- cult or mystic side of life, but his path is beset by dangers of mediumship and obsession and all through life he is filled with a vague dread of im- pending disaster which he can neither account for nor dispel by will or rea- son, hence uncertainty overshadows the life as a cloud and robs him of peace and contentment."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"For influence of Pluto see pages 728-734. [PAGE 405]  THE DOCTRINE OF DELINEATION  CHAPTER XVIII THE DOCTRINE OF DELINEATION IN A NUTSHELL Students of the Stellar Science will find the following Table very useful in delineating horoscopes for though the planets confer many more character- istics than there given, as shown in the general reading which opens the chapter wherein the places and aspects of each planet are given, the follow- ing keywords give in a succinct manner the quintessence of the characteris- tics conferred by each planet according to whether it is well or ill aspected. When the student has mastered the meaning of the positions and aspects of the various planets as given in the preceding chapters he may with the greatest of ease give a good delineation of the effect of each aspect by combining the key-words in this Table and elaborating upon them. for in- stance, if reading a horoscope where the Sun is trine Saturn, put down the description given in the Table as follows: \"The vital, venturesome and authoritive Sun trine the deliberative, per- severing, tactful, cautious, methodical and thoughtful Saturn (then elaborate) will give John a tenacious hold on life and endow him with both courage and caution, so that while he may seem venturesome at times he will [PAGE 406]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS always carefully calculate the obstacles to be overcome and not attempt any- thing foolhardy, but accomplish his object once he has decided to go ahead. He will be systematic, orderly and methodical, also persevering in whatever he undertakes after due deliberation and forethought, hence his efforts will generally be brought to a successful issue. In dealing with others he will be thoughtful and tactful, hence usually able to obtain his desires by di- plomacy. On account of these qualities he will be generally successful in life and he will lay up a fair fortune, for Saturn is also the planet of ac- quisitiveness.\" In a similar manner students may combine the key-words of all the other planets and aspects from this Table and elaborate on them as they can. This will enable them to give a good reading of any horoscope with a little prac- tice.

[PAGE 409]  THE DOCTRINE OF DELINEATION THE STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS OF THE PLANETS SHOWN BY ELEVATION, EXALTATION, CRITICAL DEGREES, ETC. The foregoing delineation of the effects and influences of the planets in the various houses and signs, also by aspect and position such as parallel and conjunction, sextile, square, trine and opposition, are subject to wide modification according to the other configurations of the horoscope, and ac- cording to whether the planets are essentially dignified or in their detri- ment, exalted or in fall, or placed in critical degrees. The following table of planetary powers will show at a glance the signs in which the various planets are strong or weak; and when the student known in what sign a planet rules or is exalted it is only necessary to remember that it has its fall or detriment in the opposite sign. Thus the Sun rules Leo and is exalted in Aries. Hence it is very powerful in those signs, and as the op- posite signs are Aquarius and Libra it is at once apparent that when placed in these signs the Sun is comparatively weak. Another important factor which it is necessary to take into consideration is elevation. The closer a planet is to the Midheaven, the more highly it is elevated and the more pow- erful it is. Consulting the table of planetary powers we find that Mars rules Aries and is exalted in Capricorn. Let us suppose that in a horo- scope, Mars is found placed close to the Midheaven in Aries or Capricorn and [PAGE 410]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS square to the Sun which is near the Ascendant. Then the evil will be very much greater than if Mars were in Libra or Cancer, the signs of his fall and detriment, and the Sun placed in the Midheaven elevated above Mars. Similarly, if the Sun were placed in Aries, its exaltation sign, close to the Midheaven in high elevation and trine to Jupiter in its own sign, Sagit- tarius, then both planets are very strong and their effect would be much more marked than if they were placed in the signs of their fall and debil- ity. By memorizing this table and bearing in mind the matter of elevation, the student will be able to form a much more accurate judgment of the effect of planets in any particular horoscope than if this is not taken into con-"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"sideration.

It takes the Moon about 28 days to go around the Zodiac and she moves with an average velocity of 13 degrees. Thus if we start with the first point of Aries and measure one day's travel, the second day will commence at the 13th degree and the third at the 26th; the fourth commences at 9 degrees of Taurus and the fifth day she starts at 21 degrees of the same sign; on the sixth day she reaches 4 degrees of Gemini; on the seventh day she starts at 17 degrees of Gemini and completes the first quarter by reaching the cusp of Cancer on the morning of the eighth day. It is evident that she will strike the same degrees of the signs composing the other three quarters during the three weeks it takes her to complete the circuit, and thus we may easily memorize the critical de- grees in the following manner: IN THE CARDINAL SIGNS--Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn, the first, thirteenth, and twenty-sixth degrees are critical. IN THE FIXED SIGNS--Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius, the ninth and"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"twenty-first degrees are critical. IN THE COMMON SIGNS--Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces, the fourth and seventeenth degrees are critical. [PAGE 412]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS It has been found that when a planet is within orb of three degrees of one of these critical points it exercises a much stronger influence in the life than it would otherwise. Therefore students will also do well to re- member this and should a planet be in a sign of fall or detriment, but in a critical degree, it is thereby strengthened and will do more good or bad ac- cording to its nature and the aspect it has. On the other hand, if a planet is in its exaltation sign, highly elevated and in a critical degree, its as- pects will be exceedingly powerful and make themselves felt much more in the life than would otherwise be the case.  MERCURY BEFORE AND AFTER THE SUN Another important point which is only too often overlooked is the posi- tion of Mercury with regard to the Sun. When Mercury is in a lower degree of the same sign as occupied by the Sun, or in any degree of a preceding sign, he rises before the Sun and, so to speak, carries the rays of the Day Star forward. But when he is placed in a higher degree of the same sign as the Sun or in the sign following that occupied by the Sun, then he rises af- ter the Orb of Day and is, so to speak, overshadowed. Therefore it has been found that when Mercury, the planet of mind, logic and reason, rises BEFORE the Sun, it gives a keener, better intellect than when he follows the lumi- nary. [PAGE 413]  THE DOCTRINE OF DELINEATION  ARE YOU HELPING YOUR STARS? One not infrequently hears students of Astrology express their annoyance at the way the stars work. They complain that the evil directions are al- ways on time and marked in their effect, while very often the good direc- tions seem to have little or not influence and they wonder why. Have you ever realized that you cannot possibly get something for nothing, any more than you can create something out of nothing. This holds good whether you want a loaf of bread, a position, favors, or anything else. If at any time you seem to get something without paying for it, you will have to settle later, and settle with interest, for it is nature's law of Justice that nothing is given for nothing. There must be an equivalent in one way or an- other; the scales may be tipped in one direction for a long time, but as surely as the pendulum swings equally to one side of the neutral point, so"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"surely will the scales of justice swing, and swing until the balance is reached. This holds good in Astrology; it is said that \"God helps the man who helps himself;\" you may also say that THE STARS HELP THE MAN WHO HELPS HIM- SELF, for they are God's ministers and it should always be remembered that THE STARS SHOW TENDENCIES, THEY MARK TIMES WHEN OPPORTUNITIES ARE RIPE, BUT THEY NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES COMPEL ANYONE TO ACT IN THIS, THAT OR THE OTHER MANNER. But neither are the directions haphazard events, they are lessons and experiences for us, of which we may avail ourselves, or not, as [PAGE 414]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS we choose within certain limits. For instance, the Moon comes to a square of Mars, and it will bring to us an opportunity to lose our temper, and get into trouble thereby, then when the trouble is over and we sit down to re- flect on the occurrence we will most likely say to ourselves: Well, what fools we were to allow a little thing like that to play havoc with our hap- piness. On the other hand if the Astrological student uses his knowledge in the proper manner, then he should know what the effect of the Moon square Mars will be, he should resolve beforehand to be calm and say: Here is an opportunity for me to rule my stars. I am going to keep my temper well un- der control so that no matter what happens, I shall maintain my equilibrium. Then, when the opportunity comes along to lose his temper he may stand firm. Although he may feel the passions surging WITHIN, he may stand outwardly quiet, keep a cool head and when the danger is past he will have gained a victory and learned the lesson which it was intended he SHOULD learn. Or suppose it is a square of the Moon to Saturn; this will cause people to worry and look upon the dark side of life, but the astrological student may say to himself when such a configuration is approaching: No, I am not going to worry; worry will not help matters, it hinders, because it takes from me all my strength, wherewith otherwise I could overcome conditions. I am go- ing to look at the bright side of the matter and see what I can do to remedy [PAGE 415]  THE DOCTRINE OF DELINEATION this trouble. As a matter of fact most of the things we worry about never come to pass, and if the student can learn under this planetary direction to keep his equilibrium, to stop worrying, then he has ruled his stars and learned an important lesson. Thus, if he helps his stars be learning the lessons which they re endeavoring to teach him, the evil directions will not have the same power over him as if he simply sits down and folds his hands saying: \"Well, I cannot help it, I am under the evil directions and naturally things are bound to go wrong in every particular .\" There is in the horoscope a"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"dominant factor, namely, the Individual Will; bear in mind that the HORO- SCOPE SHOWS ONLY TENDENCIES AND IT HAS NO POWER WHATEVER TO COMPEL YOU; COM- PULSION IS FROM WITHIN YOURSELF. You, in the final analysis, are the dominant factor in that horoscope, and can by an exercise of sufficient will power rule your stars. It is admitted that we are all weak, and therefore not able to exercise the necessary will power at all times; but that is ex- actly why these evil directions are sent to us, to enable us to cultivate a stronger will to do the right thing at the right time and it depends upon ourselves whether we shall be compelled by circumstances from without or by our own will from within. Surely that is the proper way, and astrological students above all other people ought to be able to guide their lives safely amid the rocks and shoals of existence, because they have proper warning, [PAGE 416]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS they know what is coming, and they should prepare for it. On the other hand it is asked: Why do the good directions not bring a corresponding measure of benefit? And the answer to that question is, for the same lack of co-operation. It is as absolutely necessary to help our stars in one direction as to hinder them in the other. Are you out of a po- sition with perhaps the family exchequer running low and no means in sight wherewith to replenish it; but your hopes centered upon a strong favorable direction such as perhaps a trine of the progressed Moon to the ruler of the Sixth House or the Sun? Under these conditions you feel sure, from an as- trological standpoint, that you are going to obtain a good position which will put you on easy street. Very well, you may be sure that the opportu- nity will come, but do not expect it to be laid in your lap without a single effort on your part; if a thing is worth having it is worth going after, it is worth making the very best efforts to get it; do not neglect any detail, dress yourself carefully, but not showily when you go to see the person who has it in his power to bestow the favor, remember, first impressions are im- portant; have all your ammunition ready in the shape of recommendations and everything else that you would have were you not depending upon an astro- logical aspect to help you get the position. Use every proper means if im- pressing the prospective employer with your ability and you may depend that your effort will be successful, for YOU HAVE HELPED YOUR STARS, you have [PAGE 417]  THE DOCTRINE OF DELINEATION grasped your opportunity. Or, are you about to embark in a business venture with some one else and you feel very confident because the Moon is trine to the Sun and Venus in the Seventh House? Be careful that you do not lay aside your caution on that account, thinking that under such a direction no one can come into your partnership who is not all right. If you do, you ne- glect your part and you will have no reason whatever to blame the stars if"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"later on it is shown that the person is not all you expected him to be. Nothing is needed in the world today in the same degree that we need common sense, and this applies to the department of astrology, as well as to every other department of life. Opportunity may be likened to a toboggan slide between ourselves and our desires; it is necessary for us to make an ad- equate initial effort in order to launch our sled upon this incline, but once we have done our part, then everything will go along swimmingly under favorable directions, for then the stars are with us to impress others in our behalf, or to strengthen our penetrative power so that we may know what is best for us. If you want to know positively the power of directions, even transits, as will call the actual position of the stars in the sky, take an ephemeris and note the moon's aspects for the current month. When the Moon is in opposi- tion to Mars you will find in people a general lack of energy and ambition, they would rather tear down than build. When we have a conjunction of Mars [PAGE 418]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS and the Moon, people will be active and energetic, but impulse rather than common sense will govern, hence they will accomplish little good, and may do harm without intention. But when the Moon and Mars are trine, there will be a general desire among people to do something of a constructive nature, and they will meet with success in such efforts. And last, but not least, when the Moon is square to Mars it will make people irritable, quarrelsome, de- structive, ready to fly at each other, unreasonable and unmanageable. [PAGE 419]  MIND AND THE RULING PLANET  CHAPTER XIX  MIND AND THE RULING PLANET When we wish to study the character, disposition and temperament of any- one we must first realize that the mind is the keystone of the arch of the human personality. But character, disposition and temperament do not depend so much upon the quality of mind, whether it be keen, sharp, and alert or slow and plodding, as upon what channels it takes for its expression. In- tellects of the first magnitude are sometimes put to perverted use to the detriment of the community and the individual who thus misuses his divine heritage, while a slow and very inferior mind may minister to many in lowly but loving meekness and reap sheaves of soul-growth thereby. Thus it is not sufficient to determine the quality of the mentality; we must also ascertain what is the channel of its expression. To judge that or any other matter thoroughly really involves consideration of the horoscope as a whole,"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"separately and apart from its bearing upon all other matters. But in a gen- eral way the character and disposition may be learned fro the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Ascendant and the ruling planets. It has become the custom of many astrologers to take the lord of the [PAGE 420]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS rising sign as the ruler of the horoscope. That is correct in Medical As- trology because the Ascendant represents the body, but when we want to judge the character which is the combination of all the forces focused through the horoscopical wheel of life the matter is different. Then we must find what planet has the most dominant influence in the life and that is then the life ruler regardless of whether or not it is the ruler of the Ascendant. To find that planet look first to the lord of the Ascendant. If he is el- evated, essentially dignified or angular and strongly aspected, remember, it matters not whether the aspects are good or bad as long as they are close and plentiful (for if it were only the good aspects that made the ruler then there would be only good people in the world. But we know that there are people of all shades of character and therefore it is necessary to select the ruler according to the aspects, regardless of whether they are good or bad), and above all, if the aspects are close, then the lord of the Ascen- dant is also the ruling planet, for he will exercise the most potent influ- ence in the life. On the other hand if another planet is more highly elevated than the ruler of the Ascendant, if it is exalted, essentially dignified or placed in an angle and its aspects re more plentiful or closer than the aspects of the lord of the Ascendant, the judge that that planet will be the ruler of the horoscope and exercise a dominant influence in the life regardless of the [PAGE 421]  MIND AND THE RULING PLANET fact that it is not the ruler of the rising sign. But if there are two planets running neck-and-neck in the race for rulership, so to speak, with no strongly marked difference in favor of one or the other so that it is difficult to make a choice, do not utterly dis- card one and choose the other, for then they will both be very active in the life and must be classed as co-rulers. THE INFLUENCE OF RULING PLANETS  WELL ASPECTED THE SUN AS RULING PLANET"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" When the vital, courageous and ambitious well aspected Sun is ruler, it gives dignity to the whole nature, a lofty price that would not stoop to do anything small, mean or degrading, a fine and noble courage that may show itself on occasion as much by disdainfully ignoring the attacks of an adver- sary whom he considers too far beneath his notice as by a fight to the death for a principle. There is an intense craving for recognition and leadership which will make it very difficult for him to occupy a subordinate position; also an intense warm-hearted, affectionate and demonstrative nature. VENUS AS RULING PLANET When the refined, luxurious and musical well aspected Venus is ruler of the horoscope it gives tender, loving, even amorous nature which craves love [PAGE 422]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS as we all desire air, for love is the very life breath of such people. They are extremely fond of children and usually have many pets which serve as av- enues for their expression of love. They are also pleasure-loving and fond of social intercourse, neat and artistic in their ideas and in the decora- tion of their homes. They love jewelry and anything else that adds beauty to the life; they are luxurious in all their tastes, very amiable and much beloved by all; their greatest faults is an inordinate love of ease and an aversion to soiling their hands. MERCURY AS RULING PLANET When Mercury the planet of reason, expression and dexterity is the well aspected life ruler it gives a keen, quick-witted mind which craves knowl- edge as a thirsty man craves water and absorbs it as readily, a mind that solves, apparently without effort, the most intricate problems. Thus there is ability in the various branches of mental endeavor, science and lit- erature, but these people are also very apt and forceful orators and have an extraordinary dexterity so that they can usually turn their hands to any- thing. They are fond of traveling and very successful as salesmen and agents. [PAGE 423]  MIND AND THE RULING PLANET THE MOON AS RULING PLANET When the romantic, imaginative and restless well aspected Moon is the life ruler, the people born unders its influence are indeed rolling stones and far fields always look greenest to them. Therefore they have an over- whelming desire for travel and change which generally does not permit them to stay in one place longer than necessary to earn the money which will en-"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"able them to go to the next. They have a most vivid and fanciful imagina- tion and a romantic nature entirely foreign to any practical endeavor; list- less, restless and unstable as the tide that comes and goes, flotsam and jetsam upon the sea of life. They are generally mediumistic, though usually unconsciously so, but are otherwise quite harmless through utterly irrespon- sible and untrustworthy where anything requiring an effort is concerned. SATURN AS RULING PLANET When the serious, sagacious and profound well aspected Saturn is life ruler, the people born under its influence are of a profoundly thoughtful, serious nature. They have a keen sense of responsibility and are full of forethought, hence trustworthy and reliable advisors; they are systematic, orderly, and have good executive ability, frugal in their tastes, thrifty and saving; just to a degree, but their justice is cruel, hard and [PAGE 424]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS untempered but the slightest degree of mercy. They are chaste, sober and exemplary in their lives but they have neither mercy nor pity for those who are unable to overcome faults or habits or who otherwise become delinquent to the laws of society. They care little or nothing for pleasure or the so- ciety of others and generally keep their own counsel and company; they are highly respected, esteemed and trusted in the community but neither care for nor merit the LOVE of their fellow men. JUPITER AS RULING PLANET When the jovial, genial and generous well aspected Jupiter is life ruler, the people born under his influence are ensouled by a great desire for honor, respect and esteem in their community. Therefore they aspire to be pillars in the church, legal lights, or to fill an honored position in the pulpit; failing this they enter by preference one of the progressions as lawyer or doctor. They are cordial, genial people with a jovial smile and a hearty handshake that make one glad to meet them wherever the go, so they are always welcome. They are law-abiding and just but inclined to temper their justice with mercy; and while they themselves live lives beyond re- proach they are kind, forgiving and lenient to those of a weaker morality whose lives are smirched by sin and crime, hence they are philanthropic and [PAGE 425]  MIND AND THE RULING PLANET always ready to give to charity and benevolent work. They are not only re- spected and esteemed but beloved in the community where they reside. MARS AS THE RULING PLANET"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" When the enthusiastic, energetic, constructive and militant Mars is the well aspected life ruler, the people born under the influence of this dy- namic rays are eager for the fray and battle of life. They are ensouled with an ardent desire to conquer the world. To them it does not so much matter what they do so long as it affords an adequate outlet for the con- structive energy which, figuratively speaking, threatens to burst them un- less released. The bigger and more difficult the undertaking, the more they exult; hence they become the pioneers and pathfinders of civilization, the engineers and contractors who build our cities and the highways and byways that connect them, who develop the resources of the world and turn them over to others to use. They are extremely impatient of restraint and will brook no interference with their plans or methods. These people govern others and bend them to their will by the whiplash of sheer force for they have neither tact nor diplomacy but win by the merit of might. They earn money easily and spend it as lavishly and foolishly. They are extremely extravagant and [PAGE 426]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS when reverses come they are down and out for the time being but they never stay down, the indomitable inner force soon accomplishes rehabilitation and with it the old reckless ways of living reassert themselves. They are gen- erally foolhardy to a degree, hence liable to accidents and a violent end. URANUS AS RULING PLANET When the original, romantic and eccentric well aspected Uranus is life ruler the character is idealistic, unconventional and utopian. These people are generally out of patience with the conventional ways of living and de- termined i their efforts and endeavors to break the shackles of society and live a bohemian life. They are full of fads and given to usually beliefs, too advanced for the majority. At the same time they are pioneers of a new age in which many of the ideas we now consider utopian will be modified so that they will be held by all. These people are also the inventors of the world, in touch with the higher worlds where ideas merge from the Divine Mind to impinge upon the minds of those who are sufficiently sensitive to grasp them and bring them to birth for the use of humanity. The Uranians are very headstrong and always ready with an argument to defend their ideas and secure a convert to their cults; odd in dress, in food, in ideas, they are a class apart. [PAGE 427]  MIND AND THE RULING PLANET NEPTUNE AS RULING PLANET"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" When the occult and mystical well aspected Neptune is life ruler we have a person of a most peculiar power whose chief mark is a strange expression of the eye which must be seem to be appreciated. It is as if he looked right through and through whatever is before him, but it is not necessary to discuss this type for there are so few that they are very seldom encountered by the average astrologer and only an occultist can know and judge another occultist. THE INFLUENCE OF THE AFFLICTED RULING PLANETS When the life rulers are afflicted by the conjunction, parallel, square, or opposition from the other planets, especially from the malefics--Saturn, Mars, Uranus and Neptune--they affect the life in an inimical manner which may be outlined as follows: THE SUN AS RULING PLANET When the cowardly and arrogant afflicted Sun is life ruler, people born under his debilitating influence are egotistical in the extreme, full of swagger, self-importance and arrogance. If they obtain authority over any- one whom they think they can overawe they will rule such dependent with a rod of iron, trample upon his tenderest feelings without a twinge of con- science or compunction, but if they themselves come under the authority of [PAGE 428]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS another these spineless weaklings will then cringe, creep and cater to the slightest whim of their master though they hate him with an intense hatred that is only kept in check by their fear. They whine and wheedle at the faintest frown though ready to spring and devour him if only they dared. It is the signature of one of the most despicable characters in the gamut. VENUS AS RULING PLANET When the slovenly, slothful and lazy afflicted Venus is ruler of the horoscope the persons are sensual and profligate, untidy and slatternly, of depraved, perverted tastes and utterly disreputable in their conduct; they are social parasites. They use loud and obscene language and are fond of music of a clanging, jarring nature. They love revelry and debauch, their affection expresses itself in coarse lusts, unbridled passion, free love and moral perversion. They revel in spangles and tinsel, loud, clashing colors and cheap imitations of beauty and worth. MERCURY AS RULING PLANET When the untruthful, dishonest and clumsy afflicted Mercury is life ruler the people under his influence are either entirely mentally unsound so that"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"they must be confined for their own good in proper institutions, or they are so cunning that they are able to hide their mental bias and prey upon [PAGE 429]  MIND AND THE RULING PLANET society as thieves, pick-pockets, defaulters and criminals of similar na- ture. They are notoriously untruthful and prefer misleading others to tell- ing the truth, even where it is of no benefit to them. They are either dull of comprehension or of such consummate cunning that they seem to be driven by a resistless force to get the nest of some unsuspecting person. They ex- cel as confidence men, badgers and in similar unsavory occupations, They are thoroughly unreliable and dishonest in all their dealings; neurotic and perverted, scabs on society. These people are also inveterate talkers and always ready to criticize, slander or ruin the reputation of others. They are a menace to society in all their activities. THE MOON AS RULING PLANET When the changeable and visionary afflicted Moon is life ruler it makes the persons extremely restless and averse to labor of any kind, fidgety and always on the move; if they cannot travel from one city to another, they move from one house to another and from one situation to another as often as possible and they infuse the same restlessness into whosoever they come in contact with. If the afflictions are very severe the mind suffers and their mental phases coincide with the changes of the orb of night. [PAGE 430]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS SATURN AS RULING PLANET When the morbid, melancholy and malicious afflicted Saturn is life ruler he robs life of all joy and brightness so that these people become recluses and melancholy misanthropes; so miserly and avaricious that they will starve themselves and forego the comforts of life even when they have ample means to satisfy them. They are cruel, hard and suspicious of the acts and mo- tives of others and if they take up work as a detective they become human ferrets, blood-hounds who will hound their prey to death and gloat over his misery. If anyone frustrates such people they will hold spite forever and aim to get even, if it takes a lifetime. But the end of these people is al- ways bad, sometime or other they overreach and fall into the trap they have set for others. They usually die an ignoble death and the world gives a sigh of relief when they pass out. JUPITER AS RULING PLANET When the indolent, bombastic and egotistical afflicted Jupiter is the"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"life ruler the person is often a parasite on the social tree, a gambler, confidence man and speculator, sporty, fond of display and ostentation; he wears loud clothing, paste diamonds and cheap jewelry. He is usually met with in pool rooms, on race tracks and in similar places; playing poker or playing the ponies are among his favorite means of earning a living; he is [PAGE 431]  MIND AND THE RULING PLANET very loud and egotistical anxious to attract attention no matter how; he of- ten figures in court proceedings on account of shady transactions or immoral conduct or unpaid bills, for he is an adept at obtaining credit for every- thing he wants and never pays the price of his expensive tastes if there is any way of avoiding a settlement of his debts. Among the laboring class he usually figures as a demagogue and agitator, inciting to strikes and riots, but he is always ready to sell out a striking union to the employers. We find them among the typical Italian padrones, as keepers of sweat-shops, and in similar occupations. MARS AS RULING PLANET When the arrogant, egotistical and foolhardy afflicted Mars is life ruler the person is an egotist of the first water, bound to attain to his wishes by force or destruction if other means fail; in fact he prefers to bulldoze others to do his will rather than to have them submit without a struggle. He is a first-rate slave driver, section boss on the railway, in a construc- tion camp and similar places, a liar, braggart, bouncer, or pugilist, a daredevil wiling to risk his life and the lives of others at any moment and in any undertaking. [PAGE 432]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS URANUS AS RULING PLANET When the stubborn, erratic and independent afflicted Uranus if life ruler the mentality is usually so obsessed in one direction or another that such people become fanatics and generally also there is an excessive sensuality and perverted taste. They are always ready and anxious for an argument as a means of airing their ideas but they are so hypnotized by their own par- ticular fad that they are never convinced and can never see when the argu- ment goes against them. They always espouse the most radical and unconven- tional ideas. NEPTUNE AS RULING PLANET When the mediumistic, neurotic and self-indulgent afflicted Neptune is life ruler, the persons are of a dreamy, neurotic and negative nature, apt"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"to become the medium of disembodied spirits or even obsessed by them. They are likely to evolve psychic powers of a low grade such as involuntary clairvoyance, crystal gazing, etc., and if they are unable to develop these faculties they often simulate mediumship and other psychic gifts for the purpose of duping or defrauding others. They have a strong faculty of imitation and easily become adepts at deception. [PAGE 433]  MIND AND THE RULING PLANET  THE SIGNS AS MENTAL SIGNIFICATORS When the CARDINAL Signs, Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn, are on the angles, that is to say, the Ascendant, Midheaven, Fourth and Seventh Houses, it is a general indication that the person is mentally alert, quick to grasp an idea, active and enthusiastic in whatever work he undertakes; one who has organizing and executive ability and is capable of carrying whatever enter- prise he may start to success; a bold, brave indomitable spirit. This is especially true when many planets are in Cardinal Signs and these people may be classed as the business men of the world. When the FIXED Signs, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius are on the angles it indicates a thoughtful but slow and plodding type of mind which requires time to come to a decision. They always look before they leap but when they have made up their minds they adhere to the course mapped out with a remark- able patience and perseverance which in the end insure success. They are very reliable and can be depended upon to keep their word and meet their ob- ligations. Their principal fault is that they are too apt to get into a rut and become narrow-minded. They are very original and may be classed as the inventors of the world. These delineations are especially true when many planets are in Fixed Signs. When the COMMON Signs, Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces, are on the angles the mind is flighty and superficial, wavering and versatile. These [PAGE 434]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS people are often very quick to grasp a point and form a decision, but just as ready to forget and change their minds. They are adepts at imitation and often pretend to virtues or abilities entirely foreign to their nature. They are easily swayed by the winds of emotion; one moment they may be highly elated over some small matter and the next a trifling trouble bows them down to earth. They are inconstant and unreliable in all their dealings with others because they do not know their minds two minutes in succession. They constitute the agents and middlemen of the world, where they occupy a subordinate or serving position. These delineations are par- ticularly apt when many planets are in Common Signs."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"  MENTAL EFFECT OF THE RISING SUN When there are no planets on the Ascendant the rising sign has consider- able influence on the type of mind. ARIES rising gives an energetic, enthusiastic and ambitious type of mind, but inclined to rash and impulsive acts and a quick temper. TAURUS rising gives a stubborn, headstrong and selfish nature, envious, cov- etous and malicious when angered. GEMINI rising gives a quick, alert and versatile mind, easily adaptable to conditions but so fluidic that it lacks the ability absolutely essential to [PAGE 435]  MIND AND THE RULING PLANET sustained effort and lasting success. CANCER rising gives a negative, imaginative and receptive type of mind, sometimes of a rather morbid nature, reserved and mistrustful; but when such a person has made up his mind to do something he is usually very tenacious in his adherence to his ideas; sympathetic, hospitable and kind. LEO rising gives a frank, open, ambitious mind; a powerful will and a proud, honorable and kind disposition but inclined to be hasty, quick-tempered, sensual and apt to go to extremes. VIRGO gives a critical, scheming and ingenious mind, able to evolve ideas galore but usually lacking the initiative to carry them out unless prodded by others. These people are very selfish, self-centered and reserved. They do not take other people into their confidence and they seldom become really familiar with anyone. LIBRA rising gives an easy-going but kindly and sympathetic type of mind which is unable to grasp or cope with the exigencies of existence. There- fore these people drift along the stream of life, taking as much of the sweet as they can get and using every effort to avoid the bitter. They crave approbation and in return adore their friends and are usually bound up in them. [PAGE 436]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS SCORPIO rising gives a dual type of mind. This is one of the most mystical of the twelve signs. Some times it is symbolized as an eagle representing the lofty, aspiring type soaring as does the eagle into the ether. At other times it is typified as a serpent which crawls in the dust, and again as a"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"scorpion. There is also considerable occult significance in the fact that the serpent has the sting in its head and the scorpion has it in its tail. But for the present purpose we will judge the two latter as one. The Scorpio type of mind denoted by the eagle is thoughtful, reserved and inclined to lofty ideals' dignified in demeanor, proud and with perfect con- trol of the temper. These people are very reserved and generally keep their own counsel. The other type when Scorpio is represented by the serpent is entirely different; deceitful, shrewd and secretive; past finding out; sensual and unforgiving; jealous and passionate, with a very sharp tongue and fiery tem- per. SAGITTARIUS rising gives an energetic, aspiring, benevolent mind but rather lacking in ambition. These people are usually of an ardent, affectionate disposition and sometimes very demonstrative. CAPRICORN rising gives a tactful, diplomatic, deep and thoughtful type of mind but selfish, envious and covetous. These people are apt to get into a [PAGE 437]  MIND AND THE RULING PLANET rut and become very narrow, and when they are crossed they hold spite and plan revenge. They are self-reliant and persistent in whatever they under- take. AQUARIUS rising gives a good intellect, a friendly, sympathetic and humane disposition, but these people are very original and independent; they will brook no interference with their vagaries and pursue their own course re- gardless of what others say or think, sometimes even against their own rea- son and just to assert their independence. PISCES rising gives a sentimental and romantic type of mind, inclined to worry and restlessness, apt to turn to the occult, and to mystical ideas. The mind is very sensitive and often takes in the conditions of others with the effect of unsettling and troubling the person. [PAGE 438]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CHAPTER XX  YOUR LUCK IN LIFE Health, wealth and happiness are to most people the prime objects of life, and whoever has them is rightly considered lucky, though as we have endeavored to show, luck is very closely linked to merit, and we have earned"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"what we have either in this or former lives and what we lack in fortune or ability we may acquire in this or later lives by good use of our opportuni- ties. Thus health and disease, vocational ability, social and financial for- tunes, marriage, etc., are shown in the horoscope as outlined in the follow- ing pages.  HEALTH AND DISEASE The subject of health and disease is thoroughly elucidated in that part of the book which deals with medical astrology, but those who do not care to go into the depths of the subject will find the following general hints helpful in determining the matter for ordinary purposes. The main indicators of health and disease are the Sun, Moon and Ascen- dant, together with the planets in the First House or just above the Ascen- dant. The twelve signs of the Zodiac confer a vitality of differing degrees [PAGE 439]   YOUR LUCK IN LIFE and when there are no planets near the rising sign it is of much greater im- portance than otherwise. The signs may be classified as follows: Aries, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Sagittarius are strongly vital signs. Gemini, Virgo, Libra and Aquarius are moderately vital. Cancer, Capricorn and Pisces are signs of weak vitality. Both the Sun and the Moon affect health in all horoscopes, but the Sun is the particular significator of health for men and the Moon has the same function in a woman's horoscope. Thus, if a boy is born at a New Moon which is a total eclipse, he will have very poor chances of surviving. The same may be said of a girl born at the Full Moon when that is eclipsed. If the Sun is strong by sign, well aspected by Mars or by the benefics, if he is in essential dignity, exaltation or elevation in a male horoscope, it indicates the possession of a strong vitality and presages a life blessed by good health. If the Moon is similarly placed in a woman's horoscope the same effect follows. On the other hand if the luminaries are in weak signs in the Sixth or Twelfth Houses or afflicted by Saturn, Mars, Uranus or Neptune, the vitality is weak and much sickness will result unless, from childhood, care is taken to follow the laws of health and hygiene. It must be borne in mind that THE HOROSCOPE SHOWS ONLY TENDENCIES which work out infallibly if we drift with"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"[PAGE 440]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the tide of life. But on the other hand, it does no show the factor of the human will, which being divine may enter in and by proper efforts in the right direction correct, at least in a large measure, the limitations. It is a good indication of health when a strong sign rises with Jupiter or Venus close to the Ascendant and well aspected. But if a weak sign is on the Eastern horizon, and the life forces are further sapped by Saturn, Uranus or Neptune in the rising sign, a life of suffering is foreshown. With respect to Mars it has been found that his presence on the Ascendant strengthens the constitution when he is well aspected but predisposes to fe- verish or inflammatory complaints when he is afflicted. It should be understood that the Sun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon and Jupi- ter do not afflict save by square or opposition, whereas the conjunction and parallel of Saturn, Mars, Uranus and Neptune are considered inimical as well as the square or opposition. The afflictions from CARDINAL Signs, Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn, indicate acute ailments which usually run their course and leave no par- ticular trace. The afflictions from FIXED Signs, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius, in- dicate organic or hereditary tendencies which are difficult to conquer and [PAGE 441]   YOUR LUCK IN LIFE usually become chronic. The diseases indicated by COMMON Signs, Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces, are convertible. They may be entirely overcome or run their course until they become chronic, according to the mental temperament of the person in whose figure these are found. The places of the malefics, Saturn, Mars, Uranus or Neptune always indi- cate weak points in the anatomy and the place of Saturn is particularly sen- sitive; no matter whether he is afflicted or not it is always a danger point. By knowing the parts of the body which are ruled by the different signs it is easy to see where the weak limits in the chain of human health are located: Aries rules the head and face. Taurus rules the neck and throat. Gemini rules the lungs, arms and shoulders. Cancer rules the breast and stomach."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":" Leo rules the heart and dorsal region of the back. Virgo rules the abdominal parts. Libra rules the kidneys and lions. Scorpio rules the genitals and rectum. Sagittarius rules the hips and thighs. Capricorn rules the knees. Aquarius rules the ankles. Pisces rules the feet. [PAGE 442]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Thus if Saturn is placed in Leo it will indicate that the person is sub- ject to heart trouble. If it is in Pisces it will indicate cold feet. The hot and inflammatory Mars afflicted in Aries, the sign which rules the head, would indicate a tendency to fevers, and so on with the other planets. There are three nebular spots located in the Zodiac, namely: The Pleiades in 29 degrees of Taurus, the Ascelli in 6 degrees of Leo, and An- tares in 8 degrees of Sagittarius. If the Sun or Moon are found in these placed and afflicted by a malefic, be careful of the eyes, or if one of the malefics are in one of these places afflicting the Sun and Moon the same judgment holds good. With these general indications the ordinary student should be able to judge a horoscope with respect to health and disease and should a more thor- ough examination be desired, a study of the matter in the part dealing with Medical Astrology will give the necessary information.  THE SOCIAL AND FINANCIAL FORTUNES The vocation, financial fortune and social standing, like all other mat- ters, should be judged from the whole horoscope, but the Second, the Sixth, the Eighth and the Tenth Houses with their lords are the chief significators. THE SECOND HOUSE indicates what the person earns by his efforts. When Jupiter, Venus, the Sun, the Moon or Mars are well aspected and placed in [PAGE 443]   YOUR LUCK IN LIFE the Second House or lord thereof they attract wealth commensurate with the number and closeness of their aspects and their position as to dignity, ex- altation or elevation. But if Saturn, Mars, Uranus or Neptune are elevated and afflict the Sun and Moon it is a sure sign of financial misfortune. Jupiter in the Second House is moderately generous but Mars makes a free spender and consequently the money he brings goes about as fast as it comes."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Saturn in the Second House, or its ruler, makes the person thrifty and sav- ing but he will find it difficult to make ends meet unless Saturn is in his exaltation sign Libra and well aspected by Jupiter; then fortune comes by legacy or in the latter part of life. Uranus in the Second House and in good aspect to Jupiter or the Sun and Moon is also a good indication of financial fortune. THE EIGHTH HOUSE: The planetary influences which bring financial fortune through the person's own efforts when operating through the Second House bring money through the marriage partnership or legacy when operating through the Eighth House. Thus Jupiter in the Eighth House indicates money by marriage or partnership if well aspected by the Sun, Moon, Venus or the lord of the Seventh House. But if aspected by Saturn or Uranus it shows a legacy. Mars in the Eighth House well aspected shows a husband, wife or partner with good earning capacity but too free a spender. The other indi- cations enumerated as acting through the Second House may be similarly [PAGE 444]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS applied to the Eighth.  VOCATION When the majority of the planets are well aspected and above the Earth or when the Sun is in good aspect to the Moon and Mars it is generally easy for the person to obtain a situation and when the Sun is in good aspect to Jupi- ter it gives promise of a lucrative occupation. But when the majority of the planets are below the Earth, weak and afflicted, or when the Sun is in bad aspect to the Moon, Mars or Jupiter, it is usually difficult for the person to find employment. To find the employment in which the person will be most likely to succeed consider the nature and significance of the Houses and Signs which hold the majority of the planets. When the majority of the planets are in the FIERY Signs, Aries, Leo and Sagittarius, it indicates as profitable the occupations in which the metals and fire play a prominent part, as those of machinist, engineers, chauf- feurs, smiths, cutlers, barbers, surgeons, soldiers, also hazardous and dan- gerous vocations. If the majority of the planets are found in the EARTHY Signs, Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn, it indicates success in agriculture, horticulture, gar- dening, land, mines, timber, building materials and as contractor for build- ings, houses; dealers in foodstuffs, both in the raw and cooked states, such"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"[PAGE 445]   YOUR LUCK IN LIFE as the grocery business, in restaurants or as grain dealers, chemistry, etc., also dress goods and clothing; in short everything that comes out of the Earth to nourish, clothe and shelter the physical body. If the majority of the planets are in the AIRY Signs, Gemini, Libra and Aquarius, it indicates success in clerical, literary, or artistic pursuits; occupations principally involving brains or travel, as those of accountants, bookkeepers, agents, messengers, expressmen, architects, civil engineers, mechanical draughtsmen and designers, lecturers, scientists, electricians, aviators, inventors, and all similar occupations in which mind is a princi- pal factor. If the majority of the planets are in the WATERY Signs, Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces, the person should seek occupations in which fluids are prominent, as those of sailors and fishermen, ship builders and ship owners, marine engineers, and other occupations on shipboard, manufacturers and dealers in liquid refreshment, etc. The ruling planet also has an important bearing on the life-work, and the occupations signified by the different planets may be stated as follows: THE SUN as life ruler indicates a leader--it may be of a state as king or president, or of a province or city as governor or mayor, or has head of a corporation, whether large or small. Thus when the Sun is life ruler, espe- cially if it is in the Tenth House, it indicates a government position or [PAGE 446]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS employment in an executive capacity. VENUS as life ruler indicates employment in an artistic capacity as a mu- sician, singer, actor, theatrical agent, manufacturer or dealer in millinery or fancy goods, laces, embroidery and women's clothing; candy and confec- tions, flowers or ornaments, etc. MERCURY as life ruler indicates success in literature or on a lecture platform; as printers, publishers, or bookkeepers; as school teachers, ex- press agents, mail carriers, commercial travelers, stenographers, secretar- ies, office workers and all other clerical and traveling occupations. THE MOON as life ruler signifies success as traveling salesmen, railroad employees, ticket agents and other positions concerned with the transporta- tion of the public; car builders, hotel keepers, dealers in fluidic com- modities, nurses, obstetricians, fishermen, sailors and others employed on shipboard and in the shipping trades."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":" SATURN as life ruler signifies all employments connected with the earth such as agriculture, gardening, mines, building and building materials; dip- lomats, judges politicians, police, jailers, detectives, secret service agents and all whose work is accomplished by stealth and strategy; night [PAGE 447]   YOUR LUCK IN LIFE workers and those engaged in slow, plodding, laborious work. JUPITER as life ruler signifies success in the professions, as lawyers, judges, clergymen, ambassadors, cabinet officers, senators, congressmen or other positions of public trust; bankers, financial agents, physicians, be- nevolent or social workers. MARS as life ruler signifies employments in which iron and sharp instru- ments are prominent, as used by soldiers, surgeons, smiths, founders, engi- neers, and in all dangerous occupations. URANUS as life ruler signifies employment in which air, electricity, thought power and genius are chief factors, as those of inventors, electri- cians, aviators and those interested in supernormal or superphysical sub- jects such as psychology, phrenology, magnetic, divine or mental healing; also in connection with co-operative colonies, socialism, and advanced ideas of life and living. NEPTUNE as life ruler indicates occupations involving the occult, watery and psychic elements; also those in which fraud and deception are rampant because the genuine psychic article is so rare. These occupations include those of astrologers, mediums and clairvoyants. Neptune also produces some highly inspirational musicians."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"[PAGE 448]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CHAPTER XXI  MARRIAGE AND OFFSPRING There was a time when man-in-the-making was male-female and able to beget children without the assistance of another, but when one pole of the cre- ative force was directed upward to build the brain and the larynx mankind ceased to be bisexual and thenceforth each male or female had to seek its complement to accomplish the begetting of children. Therefore marriage was instituted by the angels as a sacrament and the sacred rite of generation was performed under their supervision in great temples at certain times of the year when the interplanetary lines of force were propitious for propaga- tion. The rest of the time all lived together in the paradisiacal bliss of chase companionship. Therefore parturition was painless and sickness and sorrow were unknown. But when, under the guidance of the fallen angels, the Lucifer spirits, mankind commenced to exercise the creative function for pleasure regardless of the stellar ray, death entered and the woman began to bring forth her children in sorrow and suffering. For though a minister may LEGALLY marry people, he, being ignorant of the stellar script, cannot see if the basic harmony necessary to truly mate two souls is present. Therefore, alas, most [PAGE 449]  MARRIAGE AND OFFSPRING marriages fail to bring the happiness and satisfaction of soul which mark the companionship of true mates. Besides there is the pain of parturition incidental to mismating and the increased suffering of the ego which is building its body under inharmonious prenatal conditions. Surely, a heavy toll to pay for ignorance of the stellar science! Worse still, in the great majority of cases where people do know astrology or where they are informed of its pronouncement in their case, they refuse to heed it warning voice when it is contrary to their desires. They often even hate the astrologer who has the temerity to tell them that sorrow is in store if they wed. Therefore it is at best a thankless task. But this matter is so important at our present stage of evolution, it has such far-reaching consequences both for the individual and for society, that it is really criminal to leave to chance the choice of a mate. Fortunately we are nearing the Aquarian Age and there is no doubt that people will then study the stellar script; perhaps they will institute matrimonial bureaus maintained by the church or state, with a view to guiding the growing gen- eration in the right direction. If children whose nativities are harmonious could visit at each others' homes and become playmates the attachment would undoubtedly ripened into love with the years. Then marriage would not end"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"the romance as it unfortunately does in the majority of unions consummated at the present time, but it would intensify love and happiness year by year. [PAGE 450]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS The bond of affection would grow stronger and aid the soul growth of those under its magic spell as no other relation can. Children would not be accidents then. They would be loved into life and they would scarcely miss the heaven they had left for they would find in their homes a heaven on earth. Therefore we pray that the time may soon come when each community will have its matrimonial bureau conducted upon the astrological basis where parents may send their child's birth data and re- ceive in return the name and address of another child who will be harmonious as a mate. If the parents of both feel satisfied with respect to family connections, etc., the children could be made acquainted,; if not, other names could be submitted by the bureau until one suitable according to both the social and astrological standards was found. The children could then become playmates, and there is no doubt that in time their affection would grow into a love that would satisfy the youthful sentiments of romance. Later an ideal marriage would crown their happiness. Nor should we wait for the church or state to take the initiative. If parents who believe in astrology would form associations, maintaining a cen- tral bureau where horoscopes of their children could be kept on file, grouped and classified with a view to finding true mates for them, it would give such a practical demonstration of the worth of astrology that in twenty [PAGE 451]  MARRIAGE AND OFFSPRING five years enough cases could be pointed out to arrest the attention of con- servative people.  HARMONY AND DISCORD Man is, as Paul says, spirit, soul and body. Therefore the blending of two beings in perfect harmony requires that they be in accord on the spiritual, moral and physical planes, symbolized in the horoscope by the Sun and Moon (Spirit or Ego), Mars and Venus (soul or sex) and the Ascendant governing the physical body. These significators taken together with the sign on the Seventh House and the planet therein show the innate agreement or discord between people so far as the matrimonial relationship is con- cerned. The physical harmony is judged by comparison of the rising sign of the two persons involved. Fiery signs agree, so do earthy, airy or watery"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"signs. But a person with a fiery sign rising cannot successfully mate with one who has a watery or earthy sign on the Ascendant. It is like mixing fire and water, or heaping earth upon fire. Fire will only combine with fire and air. People having a watery sign on the Ascendant may harmonize with a person having an earthy sign rising, or vice versa. But neither the earthy nor watery signs will mix with the fiery triplicity. On the moral plane the relationship is governed by Mars and Venus. If Venus in the horoscope of one person is the same sign and degree as Mars in [PAGE 452]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the horoscope of another person, there will be love at first sight when they meet, but the attraction will be sexual and unless there are other powerful signs of harmony, Mars will dominate Venus, especially if Mars is situated in the Seventh House or highly elevated above Venus in the other person's horoscope. When the Sun in one person's horoscope is on the place of the Moon in the other person's chart harmony is shown on the spiritual plane. The ideal marriage requires the blending of the two charts in all these particulars and the happiness will depend upon the measure of agreement as indicated. There are unions where people are sexually mated but have en- tirely different characteristics in other respects and vice versa. There- fore the two charts must be examined in their entirety to give a reliable judgment. The following will explain the indications for marriage in the individual horoscope of both sexes.  MEN'S MARRIAGES An early marriage is indicated in a man's horoscope: (1) When he is born in the light of the Moon, at the time she is pro- gressing from the new to the full, provided she is placed in the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Tenth, Eleventh, or Twelfth House. [PAGE 453]  MARRIAGE AND OFFSPRING (2) When the Moon and Venus are strong and well aspected with a number of other planets in the fruitful signs, Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces.

A late marriage is shown in a man's horoscope: (1) When he is born in the dark of the Moon; that is to say, when the Moon is going from the full to the new and she is placed in the First, Sec- ond, Third, Seventh, Eighth, or Ninth Houses. (2) When the Moon or Venus are afflicted by Saturn, Mars, Uranus or Neptune, especially if either of these planets is placed in the Fifth or Seventh Houses. (3) When Saturn, Mars, Uranus or Neptune are in the Fifth or Seventh Houses. (4) When the Moon is square or opposition to Venus or Jupiter they bring trouble in courtship and consequent delays of the marriage. [PAGE 454]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Marriage is denied or is accomplished with great difficulty: (1) When Saturn is in Scorpio which rules the genitals, or if the Moon is there parallel, conjunction, square or opposition to Saturn the planet of obstruction, for then there is little or no desire for sexual intercourse, hence such people generally remain bachelors. (2) When the Moon, or Venus, the planet of love, is afflicted in the Saturnine sign Capricorn, especially if the affliction comes from Saturn, the planet of obstruction, many obstacles to marriage present themselves and it is doubtful if they can be overcome, hence it is unlikely that the person will marry. (3) When the Moon is square or opposition to the Sun it is difficult for the person to make up his mind on any subject, and if the Moon is placed in the First, Second, Third, Seventh, Eighth or Ninth Houses, this will make it particularly difficult to come to a decision regarding marriage. If at the same time there is an affliction from Saturn he will never make up his mind, hence marriage will not be consummated.

[PAGE 455]  MARRIAGE AND OFFSPRING  WOMEN'S MARRIAGES An early marriage is indicated in a woman's horoscope: (1) When she is born in the light of the Moon, that is to say, when the orb of night is going from the new to the full, and the Sun is placed in the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Tenth, Eleventh, or Twelfth House. (2) When the Sun and Venus are in one of the fruitful signs, Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces, and well aspected.

(2) When the Sun, or Venus the planet of love, is afflicted in the Sat- urnine sign Capricorn, particularly if the affliction comes from Saturn, the planet of obstruction, there will be many obstacles to marriage and it is very doubtful if under the circumstances a marriage will result. [PAGE 457]  MARRIAGE AND OFFSPRING (3) When the Sun and Moon are afflicting each other by square or op- position it makes the person vacillating on any subject, and if the Sun, which is significator or marriage for a woman, is placed in the First, Sec- ond, Third, Seventh, Eighth, or Ninth Houses, the will make it particularly difficult to come to a decision regarding marriage. Should there be at the same time an affliction between the Sun and Saturn it will eventually pre- vent the person from making up her mind, hence marriage will not be consum- mated. (4) When the Sun by progression makes no aspect to the other planets it indicates a lack of attraction to the opposite sex, which will probably pre- vent her from entering the marriage relation.  HAPPINESS, SORROW AND BEREAVEMENT The masculine Sun is the particular significator of the marriage partner in a woman's horoscope, and the feminine Moon signifies the spouse in a man's chart. Hence when the Sun and Moon are in good aspect to each other, or to Venus, the planet of love, or Jupiter, the planet of benevolence, hap- piness and joy are assured in the married relationship, particularly if these planets are placed in the Seventh House. On the other hand, Saturn, Mars, Uranus or Neptune, afflicting the Sun in a female figure, or the Moon in a man's chart, indicate sorrow and trouble through the marriage relation. If they are placed in the Seventh House the [PAGE 458]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS testimony is all the more potent, and it is also foreshown that the marriage will be dissolved."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" In this respect, Saturn and Mars indicate death of the marriage partner; Uranus may also bring about this ending if afflicted by Saturn or Mars, but otherwise it points rather to a clandestine relationship which will probably bring about the dissolution of marriage by desertion or divorce.  SECOND MARRIAGES If one or more of the malefics, Saturn, Mars, Uranus, and Neptune, are found in the Seventh House, and the Sun or Moon are in a fruitful sign, Can- cer, Scorpio, or Pisces, or in the double-bodies signs, Gemini or Sagit- tarius, it is likely that the person will marry several times, and probably to his sorrow. If the Sun or Moon are aspected to a number of planets placed in double-bodies signs, Gemini, Sagittarius, or Pisces, especially if these signs are on the Seventh House, two or more marriages are likely to occur. When the ruler of the Ascendant is placed in the Seventh House well aspected to other planets and in a double-sided sign, Gemini, Sagittarius, or Pisces, it indicates a plurality of marriages. DESCRIPTION OF THE HUSBAND OR WIFE In a man's horoscope the planets to which the Moon makes an aspect by progression after birth, indicate the women to whom he will be attracted, [PAGE 459]  MARRIAGE AND OFFSPRING together with their character and disposition, which are determined by the signs that the planets are in and the aspects which they make. For illus- tration, let us suppose that the Moon in a certain person's horoscope comes first to a sextile of the Sun in Leo, and that the Sun is aspected by a trine to Jupiter, then we shall find the description of the wife by looking up the disposition, a noble character, a blonde and of florid complexion. If on the other hand, we find that the Moon after birth makes a square to Mars in Scorpio, and Mars in turn square to Venus, then it would show a woman of a very lewd, slothful and slovenly nature who would be domineering, quarrelsome, extremely difficult to get along with. Similarly for the other planets. In a woman's horoscope the husband is described by the planets to which the Sun makes an aspect by progression, these planets to be taken in connec- tion with the sign where they are found and the planets with which they in turn form configurations, and the method is the same as indicated in the case of the Moon in a man's horoscope. It should be remarked, however, that when the significator of the marriage partner, aspected by the Sun or Moon, is retrograde or weak by sign, as Saturn in Aries or Jupiter in Gemini, the attraction is not strong enough to culminate in a marriage but will probably"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"[PAGE 460]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS indicate only a passing attraction. Therefore the student must use his judgment in these respects.  CHILDREN Whether a person will have children or not cannot be judged from his or her individual horoscope with any degree of accuracy for this matter is not dependent on one only, therefore the horoscope of the prospective parents should be compared and the individuals indications blended, then if both horoscopes show a fruitful nature many children will be born, but if both are only moderately fertile, or if one is very fruitful and the other bar- ren, the forecast must be made accordingly. The indications shown i the individual horoscope may be interpreted as follows: The Moon is the planet of fecundation and therefore the most important significator; next comes Venus, the planet of love and attraction; and last, Jupiter, the planet of benevolence. If either of these planets is in the Fifth House, which indicates children, and in one of the fruitful or double-bodies signs, Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces, Gemini, or Sagittarius, it is an indication that the person has a fruitful nature and will have a number of children who will be of good and pleasant disposition. A similar judg- ment may be formed if the Eleventh House is thus invested. For if we turn the horoscope upside down so that the Seventh House becomes the First, then [PAGE 461]  MARRIAGE AND OFFSPRING it will show the marriage partner's figure, and the Eleventh House is then his Fifth House indicating children, therefore both the Fifth and Eleventh Houses should be considered in this matter. But as already said, the true state of conditions cannot be forecasted save by blending the actual figures of both parents. When the violent, turbulent Mars, or Saturn, famed in ancient mythology as a destroyer of children, or the Sun or Uranus, are in the Fifth or Elev- enth Houses, they either prevent the birth of children or destroy them dur- ing childhood. This is particularly true if Aries, Leo or Capricorn are on the cusps of either of these Houses. When the Moon is in Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces, Gemini, or Sagittarius, in good aspect to Jupiter or Venus, a large family is indicated. But when the Moon is in Aries, Leo, or Capricorn, and afflicted by one of"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"the malefics or by the Sun, the marriage is usually barren. Saturn and Ve- nus in the Seventh House is also a sign of marriage without issue. If there is a difference in the testimonies of the Fifth and Eleventh Houses the judgment must be modified accordingly. [PAGE 462]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CHAPTER XXII  PROGRESSION OF THE HOROSCOPE  FATE OR FREE WILL When a chain is subjected to strain, imperfections in any of its links become manifest, and the weakest link will break first. Similarly, in the case of the body, there are certain inherent weak points and these are indi- cated in the horoscope. From the moment of birth we subject the body to a constant strain, and in time the weakness of the various points becomes manifest as disease. The movement of the planets after birth measures the time when any particular link is liable to break. This motion of the plan- ets in the horoscope is called \"Progression.\" Study and practice of medical Astrology require knowledge of how to progress the planets in the horoscope, and we shall therefore take up that subject in connection with the message of the stars relative to disease. When the Sun rises in the East the day is young and the labors allotted to each are still before us. Gradually the Sun progresses across the arched vault of the heavens, and mark the time set for the performance of our various duties, for keeping our appointments, for taking nourishment, rest and recreation, and when it has run it course through the day and has ceased [PAGE 463]  PROGRESSION IN THE HOROSCOPE to illuminate our sphere of action, its absence invites sleep until the dawn of a new day shall present opportunities for continuation of the activities left in abeyance from the previous day. If the Sun remained stationary at any certain point of the sky it would not serve as a time marker but as it is, all events of our lives are fixed by its progression. The horoscope is a chart of the heavens for the time when the mystic Sun of Life rises and awakes us from the long sleep between two lives, then we are born in the physical world, to continue the labors of a previous life, to keep the appointment there made with friend or foe; to reap the joy or bear the sorrow which is the fruitage of our former existence on earth; and as the progression of the sun marks the changing time of day and year, as it ushers in season after season in orderly sequence and changes the appearance"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"of the Great World, the Macrocosm, so progression of the horoscope will cul- minate in events; it measures the periods of prosperity and adversity; it warns of impending temptation and tells from what quarter it will come, thus aiding us to escape if we will but listen to its warning. The natal horo- scope shows unerringly weak points in our character or constitution, but the progressed horoscope indicates when previous indulgence of harmful habits is scheduled to bring sorrow or sickness; it tells truthfully when crises [PAGE 464]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS culminate; thus it warns us to be on the alert at critical moments, and for- tifies us in the darkest hour of calamity, with hope of surcease of sorrow and sickness at a definite time, hence the importance of knowing how to progress the horoscope. But, some may say, if all is thus foreshown, it argues an inexorable des- tiny decreed by divine caprice; what use is there then of striving, or know- ing; let us eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die. If we were born into this life on earth for the first and only time, to live here for a while and then pass away from this sphere never to return, fate and favorit- ism independent of justice would seem to rule. Such cannot be the case; in a world where everything else is governed by law, human existence must also be reducible to a system, and we hold that a reasonable solution of the mys- tery of life is given by the Twin Laws of Being, the Law of Rebirth and the Law of Causation. That which has a beginning must have an end, and conversely, that which is without ending can never have had a beginning. If the human spirit is immortal and cannot die, neither can it be born; if it will live to all eternity, it must have lived from eternity, there is no escape from this truth; pre-existence must be accepted if immortality is a fact in nature. In this world there is no law more plainly observable than the law of al- ternating cycles, which decrees succession of ebb and flow, day and night, summer and winter, waking and sleeping. Under the same law man's life is [PAGE 465]  PROGRESSION IN THE HOROSCOPE lived alternatively in the physical world where he sows seeds of action and gains experiences according to his horoscope. These, the fruits of exist- ence here, are later assimilated as soul powers in the spiritual world,; birth and death are thus nothing more than gateways from one phase of man's life to another, and the life we now live is but one of a series. The dif- ferences of character, nobility or brutality, moral strength or weakness, possession of high ideals or low instincts, etc., are certain signatures of soul power or soul poverty. Finer faculties are the glorious garments of"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"gentle souls wrought through many lives in the crucible of concrete exist- ence by trial and temptation. They shine with a luster which illuminates the way and makes it easier for others to follow. Coarseness of calibre proclaims the young in Life's School, but repeated existences here will in due time smoothe the rough corners, mellow and makes them soulful also. The horoscope shows this difference in the texture of the soul and the aspects indicate how the soul is ripened by the kaleidoscopic configurations of planets in progression, which fan the fires in the furnace of affliction to cleanse and purify the soul of blemish, or brighten the crown of virtue when victory is won, but though the planets show the tendencies most accu- rately there is one indeterminable factor which is not shown, a veritable astrological \"x,\"--THE WILL POWER OF THE MAN, and upon that rock astro- logical predictions are ever liable to founder; that, at times, is the [PAGE 466]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Waterloo of even the most careful and competent astrologer, yet the very failure of well-founded predictions is the blessed assurance that we are not fated to do thus and so because our horoscope shows that at a certain time the stellar rays impel us in a given direction. In the final analysis we are the arbiters of our destiny, and it is significant, that while it is possible to predict for the great majority of mankind with absolute cer- tainty that the prediction will be vindicated, because they drift along the sea of life directed by the current of circumstance, predictions fro the striving idealist fail in proportion to this spiritual attainment of will power which rouses him to self assertion and resistance of wrong. A beautiful little poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox gives the idea in a most pleasing form: \"One ship sails East and another sails West, With the selfsame winds that blow; 'Tis the set of the sail And not the gale That determines the way they go. \"Like the winds of the sea are the ways of fate, As we voyage along through Life; 'Tis the act of the soul That determines the goal' And not the calm or the strife.\" [PAGE 467]  DIFFERENT METHODS OF PROGRESSION"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"  CHAPTER XXIII  DIFFERENT METHODS OF PROGRESSION  AND THE REASON FOR THEM Besides the physical world in which we live, move and have our being at the present time, where sunshine and rain, storm and snow, heat and cold af- fect our physical being in various ways, a world of finer substance perme- ates the denser matter, and the forces indigenous to that realm impinge upon our souls, as feelings, desires and emotions, because the soul is clothed in substance from that world. Mystics therefore call this realm in nature the Desire World. A still more subtle substance, an ocean of Thought, pervades both the Desire World and the Physical World, and as the mind is composed of substance from that region, it senses the waves of thought generated by other spirits endowed with mind. Here in the physical world, Time and Space are prime factors of exist- ence, but in the Desire World distance is practically eliminated because spirits having dropped the mortal coil travel with the speed of lightning, and as spiritual sight pierces the densest substance, light there is never obscured, so there is no night, neither does heat and cold affect the soul, hence there is no seasonal division either, to mark time as definitely as in [PAGE 468]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the physical world. But nevertheless, there is a certain sequence of events. In soulflights from place to place on the globe, we sense the na- ture of intervening country in spite of speed, but in the World of Thought, to think of a place, is to be there instanter, neither is there past or fu- ture; events are not separated by time, or places by space, but all is one eternal HERE and NOW. As the science of Astrology is founded in cosmic fact, there are also three stages in progression from incipient events in the World of Thought, to accomplished facts in the Physical World, and there are two methods of horoscopic progression pertaining to the finer realms besides the actual movement of planets observable in the Heavens. Suppose a pole billions of miles long stuck into the earth at the Equa- tor, and at right angles to the poles, then, as the earth turns upon its axis, the end of the pole would describe a circle in the heavens; this the Astronomers call the \"Celestial Equator,\" and the position of a heavenly body on this line is measured in degrees and minutes of \"Right Ascension,\" from the point where the sun crosses the equator at the vernal equinox. This axial rotation of the earth brings a new degree to the zenith, or Me- ridian about every four minutes, and by the rules of one system of progres-"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"sion we may calculate how many degrees of Right Ascension come to the Merid- ian position from birth to the formation of a certain aspect. The [PAGE 469]  DIFFERENT METHODS OF PROGRESSION intervening degrees are then converted to time at the rate of 1 degree equals 1 year. The other system of progression is founded upon the orbital revolution of the earth, but in this system the positions of the planets are expressed in degrees of Longitude and measured on the ecliptic or Sun's path, from Aries 0 degrees to Pisces 29. The measure of time is the same as in the system first mentioned: 1 degree equals 1 year, but there is this important dif- ference, that while the earth takes only 4 minutes to turn 1 degree upon it axis, it requires 24 hours to move 1 degree in its orbit. Thus, by one system of progression all the aspects that govern events in a life of 60 years would be formed in 60 times 4 minutes, which equals 4 hours or one-sixth part of a day. By the other system, formation of aspects for the same period of life would require 60 days, or 2 months, or one-sixth part of a year. Thus coming events cast their shadows before, but the shadows varies in length according to the exaltation of the sphere of life whence it is cast. From the sublime height of the World of Thought, where all things have their inception in the eternal, the progression of events in a life are sil- houetted upon the screen of Time while the infant is still upon the thresh- old of birth, but the shadow is so short, 1-360 part of a day being equivalent to a year, that an error of 4 minutes in the given time of birth would throw predictions out a whole year. Few people know their birth hour [PAGE 470]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS to the minute, therefore this systems of progression is of little use and little used. Shadows of events projected from the denser Desire World are longer and more definite; it does not require great delicacy or precision to calculate progression at the rate of 1-360 part of a year equal to 1 year. By this method an error of 2 hours in the given time of birth would only cause an error of 1 month in predictions; this system therefore gives universal sat- isfaction, and is most commonly used. In the following pages we shall ex- plain a simplified method of this system of prediction, whereby mathematical calculation of events for a whole life may be performed in a few minutes by any intelligent child who can add and subtract."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":" THE ADJUSTED CALCULATION DATE When a child is born at 7 A.M., in New York, and another at 6 A.M., in Chicago, a third at 1 P.M., in Berlin, a fourth at 2 P.M., in St. Petersburg and a fifth at 12 noon in London, the Observatory clock at Greenwich would point to noon, at the exact moment when all these children were born, hence though the clocks in their several birthplaces pointed to different hours, the Greenwich Mean Time of their births would be identical:--noon. And as the planets' places in the ephemeris are calculated for Greenwich, noon, it would be unnecessary to make corrections; we should simply place each planet [PAGE 471]  DIFFERENT METHODS OF PROGRESSION in the natal horoscopes as tabulated in the ephemeris. This would be most convenient, but he saving of calculation in a natal horoscope where the G. M. T. is noon, fades into insignificance before the facility this gives in progressing the planets for years subsequent to birth, as required to pre- dict events, for in natal horoscopes where the G. M. T. is before or after noon, the places of the planets must be calculated for each year just the same as at birth. We have evolved the following simple method of saving this calculation and of copying the progressed planets direct from the ephemeris into any horoscope.  THEOREM I If the Greenwich Mean Time of birth was BEFORE noon, it is evident that the planets' places in the ephemeris are calculated for a LATER time and also that, as they progress at the rate of a day (of 24 hours) for a year, they will reach the Longitude given in the ephemeris some day within a year after birth.  THEOREM II If the G. M. T. of birth was AFTER noon, it is plainly to be seen that the planets' places in the ephemeris for the year of birth are calculated for an EARLIER time than birth, and that the position there given corre- sponds to a certain day in the twelve-month BEFORE birth. [PAGE 472]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Furthermore, if we can find the date in the twelve-month before birth, or after as the case may be, when the planets were in the degree and minute of longitude registered in the ephemeris, we may use that date as a starting point of calculation instead of the birthday, and as aspects formed during the travel of the planets from the position given on any noon to the noon"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"next following, indicate events in the corresponding year of life, the same starting date may be used for any year. Therefore, once that adjusted cal- culation date has been found, no further calculations is required to progress the planets in that horoscope; they may be simply copied from the ephemeris. It is only necessary to bear in mind that the horoscope thus erected does NOT apply to the year FROM BIRTHDAY TO BIRTHDAY, but from the adjusted calculation date of one year to the same date of the next. There are two methods of finding this date; the first is the more difficult and not so accurate, but it shows the philosphy of the correction better than the second method, and we therefore give examples of both. We will use the figure No. 26 (Medical Astrology Section), which is the horoscope of a man who died of hemorrhages in June, 1918, to illustrate how the adjusted calculation date is found, but defer description of the case and its crises. The man was born April 24, 1884, Longitude 95 W., Latitude 42 N., at 2 P.M., True Local Time. We first find the G. M. T. by adding to the local time of birth 4 minutes for each degree the birthplace is west of Greenwich. [PAGE 473]  DIFFERENT METHODS OF PROGRESSION True local time of birth, April 24......................2:00 P.M. Correction for 95 degrees W.

In compliance with Theorem II, we subtract from the birthdate, April 24, a correction of 8 hours and 20 minutes which the G. M. T. is past noon. The measure of time used in this system is as follows: 24 hours correspond to 12 months. 2 hours correspond to 1 month. 1 hour corresponds to 15 days. 4 minutes correspond to 1 day. According to this scale we subtract from....................................................April 24, 1884 Correction for 8 hours--4 months Correction for 20 minutes--5 days   --4 months, 5 days   ---------------------- Adjusted Calculation Date...............................December 19, 1883 We may, however, find the Adjusted Calculation Date much more accurately and with less labor by the following fourfold rule:"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"  RULE (1) Find the interval from G.

The sum of these is the Sidereal Time of the Adjusted Calculation Date. (3) When the G. M. T. at birth is A. M. of the birthday, or P.

On that day the S.T. is 17 hrs., 51 min., and the A.C.D. is therefore Dec. 19, 1883. Thus, by both methods we have arrived at identical results, but slight discrepancies may appear in using the proportional method because that makes no allowances for long and short months, hence the method last demonstrated is more accurate as well as easier. If this man had been born two hours"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"later, the Adjusted Calculation Date would have been November 19, 1883.

Now, that we have arrived at the point where we are to make use of our A.C.D. to progress the man's horoscope and show how accurately it marks the crises, the first application of the date to the horoscope is a crucial point, and the student is earnestly warned to overlook no word in our de- scription so that he may acquire understanding of the principle.

[PAGE 476]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Opposite April 26 write December 19, 1885, and so on, as shown below. Every day after birth corresponds to a certain year of life which starts on the day written in the margin, and the planets in line with any A.C.D. indicate the events for twelve months from that date.

The swift moving Moon is the long hand; it marks the months when aspects culminate in events. Therefore we divide its motion during the year com- mencing with any adjusted calculation date, by 12, but for rough figuring we may consider the Moon's travel in the progressed horoscope one degree a month. Planetary aspects alone do not operate, however; an aspect of the pro- gressed Moon or a New Moon is required to focus the hidden forces. There- fore crises shown by the planets are sometimes retarded beyond the time when the aspect culminated and we may think we have safely escaped, but the first [PAGE 477]  DIFFERENT METHODS OF PROGRESSION"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"aspect of the Moon which excites it will prove that \"though the mills of the gods grind slowly, they grind exceeding fine.\" The finer forces lose none of their intensity by lying latent in Nature's lock-box of events. Now let us see how the planets worked in the horoscope we have just given. In the year 1915 we find the progressed Sun, the life-giver, had reached the conjunction of the Midheaven, Gemini 5-0. The New Moon on May 2, 1916 fell in Taurus 11-44, square to the radical Mars; on the 31st of May the second New Moon was in Gemini 9-40 in conjunction with the radical Sat- urn in the M.C., which latter had been obstructing the capillaries of the lungs; thus hemorrhages resulted. At this time the young man, who had be- come a very efficient astrologer, began to realize that he was entering a critical period and did all possible to overcome its influence. But a suc- cession of lunations during the year 1916 afflicted his Midheaven and Saturn by square and opposition in the sign ruling the lungs, Gemini, made a con- stant struggle necessary. With the negative sign of Virgo on the Ascendant, with Uranus in the First House square to Venus in Gemini, and with Jupiter afflicted by a square of the Moon, both the venous and arterial circulations were restricted, preventing deep breathing and complete oxygenation of the blood in the lungs. In the Spring of 1918 this young man, after consulting his own horoscope, unfortunately made up his mind that he would pass out on a certain day, and [PAGE 478]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS made all necessary arrangements for his funeral. This state of mind was very dangerous to one in his weakened condition and to one with his negative Ascendant. He precipitated the crisis even before its normal time, as we will show. We will now proceed to find what brought about the crises that terminated the life on June 1, 1918. We first find where the progressed planets were at that time. We take the date May 28, 1884 for the places of the pro- gressed planets on the Adjusted Calculation Date, Dec. 19, 1917. We now progress the Sun and Moon 5 1-2 months beyond this date to June 1, 1918. If we subtract the Moon's longitude on a given day from its place on the fol- lowing day, the difference is its motion during the 24 hours intervening, which corresponds to a year of life in progression. Division of this by 12 gives us the rate of its monthly travel. Moon's place on A.C.D. Dec. 19, 1917, (May 28 in ephemeris for 1884)...Cancer 27.11 Moon's place on A.C.D.

This we add to its place for each month as shown in the following table: [PAGE 479]  DIFFERENT METHODS OF PROGRESSION Dec. 19, 1917 CANCER...27.11 Mar. 19, 1918 LEO...0.41 Jan. 19, 1918 CANCER...28.21 Apr. 19, 1918 LEO...1.51 Feb. 19, 1918 CANCER...29.31 May 19, 1918 LEO...3.01 As we see above, the progressed Moon was in Leo 3.01 on May 19, 1918, and as it moves 1 degree 10 min. per month, in the 13 days to June 1st it would travel 0 degrees 29 min., reaching Leo 3.30, and making a square to the radical Sun. On Dec. 19, 1917, the progressed Sun was in Gemini 7.29. We count for- ward from Dec. 19th to June 1, 1918, 5 1-2 months, and as the Sun moves 58 minutes per year, making 5 minutes per month, in 5 1-2 months the progressed Sun would arrive at Gemini 7.56, conjunction to Saturn. The New Moon on May 10, 1918 fell in Taurus 19.00, conjunction to the radical Neptune. This was the day the young man had chosen as the day of his death, but the crisis was not reached until the transiting Sun reached the conjunction of Saturn in Gemini 8.33, the night of May 30th. At the same time Saturn was transiting conjunction to radical Mars and square to radical Sun, depleting the vitality, and the transiting Moon and Neptune were square to the radical Sun. All this was too much for him to endure in his weakened condition and he began to sink. June 1st when the transiting Moon reached the square to Saturn and the Midheaven, and the opposition to the Ascendant, he passed into the great beyond. [PAGE 480]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Thus we see that we cannot base judgment upon merely one affliction. We must look to the progressed planets, the strong transiting planets, and par- ticularly to the New Moon to excite a natal affliction.  PROGRESSION OF THE ANGLES Besides the progression of planets which we trust has been sufficiently elucidated, we must also note a similar forward movement of the houses, but these must be calculated by the same method as when casting a natal figure,"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"save that we use the Sidereal Time for the day which corresponds to the year for which we wish to progress the horoscope. In relation to the man's horo- scope we have studied, the critical year was 1918, and May 28 in the ephem- eris for 1884 corresponds. We bear in mind that birth occurred at 2:00 P.M., True Local Time, in Lat. 42 N., Long. 95 W., for these factors are used in placing the degrees on the houses just as in the natal chart; the only change is using the S.T. of the progressed birth day.

Some Astrologers use that method, but we advise another, which we think facilitates comparison and judgment of aspects between the natal and progressed position of the planets in a degree unattainable by any other system; it is illustrated in the various figures used in this book. We write the natal chart in ink, as that is unchanged during life; we also draw a large circle outside it, to contain the progressed position of the planets. These and the houses we write in their proper places, but lightly, and with pencil, so that they may be easily erased and the horo- scope erected for another year without the necessity of rewriting the natal chart. But no matter how placed, two full horoscopes with 24 houses, 18 planets, a couple of dragons' heads, each with its respective \"tail,\" and two Parts of Fortune, make quite a maze, and if the full galaxy of aspects, including biquintiles, sesquiquadrates and other highsounding nonsensicals are to be figured out the astrologer will surely so lose himself in the mathematical labyrinth that he will be unable to read a syllable of the message of the stars. During the first year of his astrological study, one of the writers"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"[PAGE 482]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS being originally of a mathematical turn, had the habit of constructing fig- ures, and tables of aspects, so fearfully and wonderfully made that they beat the proverbial \"Chinese puzzle;\" they were veritable \"Gordian Knots,\" and the destiny of a human being was so tangled in each, that neither the writer who had concocted the abomination, nor anyone else could ever hope to disentangle the poor soul involved. May he be forgiven; he has mended his ways, and is now just as zealous to eliminate all non-essentials from the horoscope, but having been enmeshed in the maze of mathematics, his experi- ence should serve as a warning. Our minds, at best, are but feeble instru- ments to fathom fate and surely we shall have the greatest chance of success by applying our science to the most important facts, and these are usually the simplest. If this be granted, the question presents itself: What are the essen- tials and what may be eliminated with advantage to clear the progressed horoscope of useless, befogging elements? First, with regard to the progressed houses, only two vital points pro- duce results when aspected: the Midheaven, which is spiritual in nature, and the Ascendant, which is a significator in material matters. We shall treat that subject later; for the present we confine ourselves to the argu- ment that it will facilitate judgment of the progressed horoscope if we leave the ten unessential cusps out, and draw two dotted lines with pencil to mark the progressed Midheaven and Ascendant. [PAGE 483]  DIFFERENT METHODS OF PROGRESSION In the second place, the student may readily convince himself by looking through the columns of any ephemeris, that the motion of Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter, during the two months which represent progression for a life of 60 years, is so slow that they seldom form an aspect not registered in the natal chart. In rare cases where an important aspect is formed, the fact is easily seen, and the planet should then be entered in the outer ring of the progressed horoscope, but in the great majority of cases it is better to leave these planets out, and enter only the progressed positions of the Sun, Moon, Mars, Venus and Mercury. In conclusion of our treatment of the method of Progression, two impor- tant points must be mentioned: The Midheaven at a given Sidereal Time is the same for all Latitudes, so that two children born at the same S.T. would have the same sign and degree on the M.C., but if one were born in Alaska and the other in Mexico, the Asc. would vary much and change the grouping of planets in the houses very considerably, with the further result that plan- ets which influence the First House affairs in one horoscope affect Twelfth House matters in the other, etc. Thus the lives of these people would be"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"very different. The same argument applies to the progressed horoscope of a person travel- ing North or South from his birthplace. His progressed M.C. remains un- changed, but he receives the forces from a different ascending figure, ac- cording to the Latitude where he resides, and the grouping of planets [PAGE 484]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS relative to the progressed Ascendant varies accordingly. As examples we may state that both writers have left their birthplace; one traveled 2,000 miles West, but is close to the same Latitude as her birthplace, hence both her M.C. and Asc. are the same as if she had remained in her native city. The other writer was born in Latitude 56 N., and now lives in Latitude 32. Had he remained in the far North, his progressed Ascendant would in (1912) be Virgo 6, exactly conjunction to Mars' place at birth, but the As- cendant of his new home is Virgo 0 degrees, and in this latitude he will not feel the effect of the Mars ray for a number of years. The other important point we had in mind is the necessity of being definite in regard to the year for which we progress. Perhaps a person tells us that a certain event occurred when he was 26, and another in his 50th year. Such statements are ambiguous, and give no safe working basis. The Astrologer may go home and do an immense amount of work to no use, be- cause he thought the person meant that one event occurred when he, the per- son, was between 26 and 27 years of age, and a later consultation reveals that he meant the year between his 25th and 26th birthdays. Pin them down to the year, 1850, 1900, or whatever it may be, but never accept a person's age as a starting point. On the same principle, never predict that an event will happen when a person is so and so old; that also is ambiguous and gives them no satisfac- [PAGE 485]  DIFFERENT METHODS OF PROGRESSION tion; give the year and month; never hedge; never predict anything of which you are in doubt; when you are satisfied a prediction is justified, speak fearlessly, BUT TACTFULLY; believe in the stars, and the stars will fully justify your faith.  SOME IMPORTANT POINTS When judging the effects of directions it is of the greatest importance to bear in mine the tenor of the nativity, for even weak aspects which are in harmony with the tendencies foreshown in the natal figure will be much more active than a strong aspect which is contrary to the radical indica-"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"tions. Supposing, for instance, that there are strong testimonies of sick- ness and accident, as Mars in Sagittarius in the Midheaven square the Sun in Pisces in the Twelfth House and square Saturn in Virgo in the Sixth House; then the progression of Mars to square of the radical Ascendant would un- doubtedly precipitate an accident or a fever of a serious nature, but if the Sun were trine Mars and Jupiter the effect of Mars square Ascendant would produce little if any discomfort. Similarly with all the other directions, and if the student neglects to take into consideration this all-important point, he is likely sometime to make a great mistake and wonder why a seem- ingly powerful direction produced no result in one case, while in another a very weak aspect had such a far-reaching effect. Aspects between two [PAGE 486]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS progressed planets are unimportant. Another important point to remember is that aspects of the progressed to the radical planets operate in proportion to the power of the radical planet in the nativity. Let us suppose, for illustration, that in a certain figure the Sun is elevated in Leo and aspected to a number of the other planets--it matters not whether the aspects are good or bad so long as they are close--then even a weak aspect from a progressed planet to the Sun will have a marked result. On the other hand, if the Sun in that horoscope received no aspect, or only one or two weak ones, then even a strong aspect of a pro- gressed planet would have little effect. It should also be noted that a good aspect from a progressed planet to a planet that is much afflicted in the nativity would produce small if any benefit. In short, and to sum up, progressed aspects operate only in the measure that they are in harmony with the trend of the nativity and the planet wherewith they are blending. The third important point to remember when judging the effects of direc- tions is that an aspect from a progressed to a radical planet is never in itself sufficient to produce results; a harmonious aspect from the pro- gressed Moon or a lunation is absolutely essential to bring the tendency to fruition. That is to say, if the progressed Sun comes to square of radical Saturn, a sextile or trine aspect of the progressed Moon or of a lunation [PAGE 487]  DIFFERENT METHODS OF PROGRESSION will pass unnoticed; no effect will be felt until either the progressed Moon or a lunation comes into conjunction, square, or opposition to Sun or Sat- urn, and vice-versa, if the progressed Sun comes to a trine of the radical Jupiter a square or opposition of the Moon will not affect it, it must wait for a sextile or trine. For this reason directions are sometimes delayed in"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"their action beyond the time of their culmination, and at other times they are somewhat hastened because a lunar aspect of the requisite nature occurs slightly in advance of the time when the aspects of the planets are com- plete. It also happens that in cases where the event indicated by an aspect in- volves two people the aspects of the planets by progression may be complete in one person's horoscope and fertilized by a harmonious aspect without pro- ducing a result, because the aspect in the other person's horoscope has not yet matured. In this connection we remember the horoscope of a lady whose Venus was placed in the Eighth House showing a late marriage. In her 45th year the progressed Sun reached conjunction Venus but neither engagement nor marriage resulted; then the Sun and Venus came into conjunction in the horo- scope of a gentleman of her acquaintance bringing an engagement quickly fol- lowed by marriage. Thus one had waited for the other, and unless such a contingency is taken into consideration the astrologer is most liable to meet his Waterloo when forecasting events. [PAGE 488]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CHAPTER XXIV.  PROGRESSED SOLAR DIRECTIONS When the Sun forms a conjunction, sextile, square, trine or opposition to one of the planets by progression the influence begins to manifest when the Sun is 1 1/2 degrees from the exact aspect, and it is felt until the Sun is 1 1/2 degrees past the point of culmination. And as the Sun moves about one degree a day, and the time measure of directions is that one day equals a year, we may say that the influence of the solar aspects is felt for a pe- riod of three years. Their effects are particularly strong at times during this period when aspects of the progressed Moon or lunations vivify them. The parallel is different from the other aspects. In the case of the slow-moving planets it lasts for a considerable number of years so that a parallel of the Sun and Saturn may operate for ten or more years, and a par- allel of the Sun and Jupiter nearly as long. It may also be noted that the conjunction ad parallel act principally upon the health, while the other aspects also affect the business, social standing, etc. Thus under the parallel of the Sun and Saturn there would be [PAGE 489]  PROGRESSED SOLAR DIRECTIONS a very protracted state of ill-health, while the parallel of the Sun and Ju- piter would strengthen the constitution materially."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" THE SUN PROGRESSED PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO RADICAL VE- NUS.

If the horoscope shows artistic ability, this will receive a great impetus during the activity of this direction, and it will bring honor and social preferment.

If Saturn was afflicted in the natal chart these directions mark a period of very evil influence. This is especially true of the parallel, which lasts about ten years; the other aspects are only active during the usual three years. Under these directions the person suffers disappointments and delays in everything he undertakes. No matter how carefully he may plan, something is sure to crop up to thwart him, and this is apt to breed a spirit of worry and pessimism which makes life seem a hopeless battle, with everyone conspiring to checkmate him. Fi- nancial difficulties make matters harder, and he is liable to incur the op- position of employers or the authorities. To crown it all, the health suf- fers, especially under the parallel; his vitality will be very low, and the recuperative power almost NIL. All will depend on whether he can look for the silver lining to the cloud, and strive to learn the intended lessons, or whether he simply sinks down under the load and gives up.

If Jupiter is well aspected at birth these aspects are among the most fortunate in the whole gamut of directions, for they indicate a period of financial prosperity, where every undertaking succeeds, hence speculation, investments, and new ventures in business will bring success and gain, the person will rise in popularity and esteem in the community or his immediate sphere of associations, he may gain much credit in connection with philanthropic or charitable undertakings, and he will en- joy much social success and domestic happiness. There is a tendency to travel or changes which will bring both pleasure and profit, and ambitions that for years seemed impossible of realization are likely to be gratified. Under these directions lasting friendships of benefit to the person are of- ten formed. They also strengthen the constitution and bring radiant health, but the exuberance of animal spirits may later, under evil directions, bring disease. If this is guarded against the increased flow of vital fluid given by these directions will have a lasting beneficial effect on the health. THE SUN PROGRESSED SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO RADICAL JUPITER. If Jupiter is afflicted at birth these directions denote a period of trouble and trials. Someone near and dear will pass out of the person's [PAGE 494]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS person's life, either by estrangement or death; lawsuits, financial losses and social disaster are threatened, with much opposition from other people. If he invests money or speculates each venture will prove a failure because of deception and misrepresentation of those with whom he deals. If he makes a change of business or travels to another city he will meet with worse conditions, the health will suffer and domestic infelicity will result. THE SUN PROGRESSED PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO RADICAL MARS. If Mars is afflicted at birth these aspects mark an extended period of a very evil nature. There is a state of rash and reckless excitement which is apt to lead the person to do the most foolhardy things, hence a li- ability to squander his money, wreck his prospects in life, become crippled by an accident, or indulge in excesses which bring on fevers, boils, or in-"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"flammatory complaints. He should be particularly careful not to handle fire, hot water, explosives or firearms, and be guarded by insurance against loss by fire, sickness or accident. The reputation is also likely to suffer by scandal, therefore he should exert all his energy and will power to act with all the discretion possible to him and so endeavor to rule his stars. [PAGE 495]  PROGRESSED SOLAR DIRECTIONS THE SUN PROGRESSED SEXTILE OR TRINE TO RADICAL MARS. If Mars is well aspected at birth these directions indicate a period of ad- venture when the person will be imbued with a powerful spirit of activity, enterprise and industry; he will become acquainted with people of a pioneer- ing instinct or in some way receive an impulse that will start him upon a new venture in life which will bring him success, friends, and prosperity. He is likely to travel in search of new fields and to be very restless in seeking an outlet for the energy which threatens to burst him, but he is also too prone to squander the money which seems to come so easily. If he were wise he would be a little less generous, for when this aspect passes off, it is likely that the golden days are over. THE SUN PROGRESSED PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO RADICAL URANUS. If Uranus is afflicted at birth these aspects mark a very critical period in the life. The person becomes very irritable and short- tempered. He is liable to tax the patience of friends and relatives to the breaking point so that a separation or estrangement occurs. He will be repellent to others, rash, erratic, liable to do the most strange and unexpected things. He may rush into litigation when he has not the shadow of a case or cause, just for the mere insane love of quarreling. [PAGE 496]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Thus he is likely to disgrace himself permanently in the eyes of all who know him, or, depending upon what other aspects are in force at the time, it may be someone close to him who causes the disgrace which then reflects upon him on account of the friendship or relationship. THE SUN PROGRESSED SEXTILE OR TRINE TO RADICAL URANUS. If Uranus is well aspected at birth and the person is of a sufficiently ad- vanced type to respond to this influence, these aspects mark a period of great spiritual and mental acceleration; the originating, organizing, and"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"inventive faculties become greatly enhanced, so that he is able to formulate ideas, perfect inventions, and organize enterprises in a most surprisingly efficient manner, with little or no effort. There may be sudden and unexpected gains through inventions, investment or speculation, and if he is not already interested in advanced thought or occultism he will most likely be attracted during this period and obtain a good start before the aspect wears off.

If Neptune is afflicted at birth these aspects mark a critical time for those who can respond to the spiritual influence. They are then hypersensi- tive and likely to develop an undesirable phase of involuntary spiritual [PAGE 497]  PROGRESSED SOLAR DIRECTIONS sight or apt to become entranced or obsessed by spirits from the invisible world who seek a medium to gratify their desires, which are usually bad. The person may also most easily become the victim of a hypnotist and get into trouble through fraud, deception and disadvantageous changes, or loss by speculation in large companies where the stock is watered. THE SUN PROGRESSED SEXTILE OR TRINE TO RADICAL NEPTUNE. If Neptune is well aspected at birth these aspects mark a period of spiritual awakening, when the person may receive an initiation which will develop his spiritual powers and open the invisible worlds to him, if he is sufficiently developed. For others it may develop the faculty of inspira- tional music, and yet other people may experience a period of unexampled love and bliss, but the majority cannot respond to this influence.

There is also a great deal of trouble and general so-called \"bad luck.\" [PAGE 499]  PROGRESSED LUNAR DIRECTIONS  CHAPTER XXV  PROGRESSED LUNAR DIRECTIONS The Moon travels through the Zodiac at an average rate of between twelve and thirteen degrees a day, and as the day in the art of progression is 9aken as a time measure equivalent to a year, we may say that the Moon by progression from birth to death travels at the rate of between twelve and thirteen degrees a year, or about one degree per month. Thus in the course of about twenty-eight years she circles the whole horoscope and forms all the aspects that can be formed to all the planets in the radical figure, and she may thus travel two or three times around the horoscope in the life of the average man or woman. It is her passage around the horoscope that makes the life fruitful of events for the aspects of the planets themselves which indicate the year when a certain influence is ready to be reaped as ripe destiny and produce events in the life, do not of themselves cause either good or ill effects unless an aspect of the progressed Moon or a lunation brings the matter to a focus and marks the month when the occurrence will take place.

THE MOON PROGRESSED PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO RADICAL SUN. These aspects mark a rather prosperous period in life, bringing important changes for the better. Not infrequently marriage results which is both successful and happy. An increase of business if the person is an employer, or a raise in salary if he is an employee, may be looked for at this time, for superiors and those in a position to bestow favors are in a generous mood and ready to give the person credit for all that is good in him. THE MOON PROGRESSED SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO RADICAL SUN. These aspects indicate a time of trouble and loss. There is a tendency to difficulty with employers or customers which will bring loss of employment or business; the mind is vacillating so that the person cannot make up his [PAGE 501]  PROGRESSED LUNAR DIRECTIONS mind what to do, and thus he is apt to lose opportunities which might bring gain and instead they bring loss. He will experience trouble with the oppo- site sex, particularly the marriage partner if he is in the state of matri- mony. The health will suffer and there is a change for the worse in all the affairs of life. THE MOON PROGRESSED PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SEXTILE, OR TRINE TO RADICAL VENUS. If Venus is strong and well aspected in the natal chart this period will be one of pleasure and profit both, for the person will make new friends and have opportunities to advance himself both socially and financially. These aspects also frequently indicate the commencement of courtship or the culmi- nation of courtship in marriage, in a man's horoscope.

A courtship may be broken off or a marriage dissolved [PAGE 502]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS by separation. The financial fortunes are likely to suffer and the health is apt to be poor. Snubs and ostracism may be expected in the social rela- tion and the person should be particularly careful with the opposite sex, for while this direction is operative there is considerable liability to trouble from that source. Knowing what is doing and the nature and duration of the influence, he should try to rule his stars by keeping as cheerful a frame of mind as possible, schooling himself to act wisely in the matters which are particularly shown as danger points.

If any important changes have been in contemplation this is the time to make the move, for under these direc- tions success is sure to attend in a much larger measure than under less fa- vorable influences, and if he has any important matters to settle with brothers, sisters or neighbors, he will reach a favorable conclusion with them much more quickly than at any other time. [PAGE 503]  PROGRESSED LUNAR DIRECTIONS THE MOON PROGRESSED SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO RADICAL MERCURY. If Mercury was afflicted at birth the person will need to exercise a great deal of care during the operation of these planetary influences, for there will be a tendency to rash and indiscreet speech; thereby the person may lay himself liable for libel or slander. It is also likely that if any deeds or legal papers are signed during this time it will be to the person's detri- ment and will later regret it. He should also be very careful of his ex- pressions in correspondence and if he is a literary man he should be doubly careful or his writings will be more than likely to cause trouble for him- self or others. The mind will be much disturbed and he should neither travel nor make changes but endeavor to keep himself as quiet as possible during this time. THE MOON PROGRESSED PARALLEL OR CONJUNCTION RADICAL SATURN. If Saturn was afflicted in the natal chart this is a very critical period. In a woman's horoscope it indicates ill-health, worry and trouble. In the horoscope of a man, if he is married, it indicates domestic difficulties or"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"ill-health of the wife. There is trouble, delay and disappointment in all the affairs of life and a tendency to worry over things and become morbid and melancholy. [PAGE 504]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS THE MOON PROGRESSED SQUARE OR OPPOSITION TO RADICAL SATURN. If Saturn is afflicted at birth, these aspects mark a very evil time, par- ticularly with respect to health and the conditions in the home. They pro- duce a disturbed frame of mind with irritability and a tendency to worry, a pessimistic outlook on life; gloom and despondency seem to be the rule, the financial affairs also suffer and care should be taken to make no changes or investments at this time. The only remedy is to try to keep as philo- sophical an attitude as possible, looking for the silver lining of the cloud and endeavoring to learn the lessons that are to be taught during this pe- riod. THE MOON PROGRESSED SEXTILE OR TRINE TO RADICAL SATURN. If Saturn was well aspected in the natal chart these aspects mark a success- ful and prosperous period when one will gain recognition of a lasting nature in his sphere of life. He will be able to take on added responsibilities and acquit himself of the trust with credit. If any investments in houses, lands or mines are contemplated this will be a very favorable period to un- dertake such matters. This time will be epoch-making in the life when a new, solid and stable foundation for success will be laid, upon which the edifice of a successful life may be reared. [PAGE 505]  PROGRESSED LUNAR DIRECTIONS THE MOON PROGRESSED PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SEXTILE OR TRINE TO RADICAL JUPITER. If Jupiter was well aspected at birth, these aspects mark a period of suc- cess and general good fortune. The health is excellent, or if the person has been sick improvement may be looked for at this time. The frame of mind will be happy and he will enjoy all the pleasures of life. It is a par- ticularly good time to travel for he will meet a friendly and cordial recep- tion everywhere. The financial fortunes will be benefited if investments are made under these directions, or if the business is pushed to the best of his ability. This is an epoch when things take a decided turn for the bet- ter, and if the person takes proper advantage of the opportunities then pre- sented to him this time will be long felt in the life.

Keep as cool as possible and [PAGE 506]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS avoid all stimulating food and liquors. Do not under any circumstances un- dertake to speculate while these directions last for loss is certain and there is a liability to be deceived or defrauded by others. There is also a danger of domestic troubles and loss by lawsuits or similar matters. The social prestige is likely to suffer on account of haughty, bombastic and overbearing manners, therefore the person should be careful and moderate in everything and also hold himself well in check. THE MOON PROGRESSED PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SQUARE OR OPPOSITION RADICAL MARS. If the radical Mars was afflicted these aspects mark a very evil period. In a woman's horoscope they indicate, for one thing, bad health, and in a man's, violent quarrels in the home. There is a tendency to be quarrelsome, foolhardy and reckless, with the result that the person may sustain bodily injuries or accidents, also a tendency to the over-indulgence of the lower passional nature which may bring trouble in its train, therefore he should be very careful in his dealings with those of the opposite sex. Unless great care is taken slander and social discredit are sure to result. These directions also make the person very reckless and extravagant in financial matters, liable to form hasty and erroneous judgments, therefore if papers [PAGE 507]  PROGRESSED LUNAR DIRECTIONS are signed at this time disaster is very to follow. These directions are among the most reliable in operation and the person rarely escapes without suffering loss or injury in some manner, therefore the greatest care should be taken during this period. THE MOON PROGRESSED SEXTILE OR TRINE RADICAL MARS. If Mars was well aspected at birth thee aspects mark a period of consider- able activity in the life which will be to the benefit of the person in- volved.

These aspects are par- ticularly active among those who work with or deal in the partial elements of iron and fire, such as soldiers, surgeons and engineers; to them they bring honor and promotion. THE MOON PROGRESSED PARALLEL, CONJUNCTION, SQUARE OR OPPOSITION RADICAL URANUS. If Uranus was afflicted at birth these aspects mark a very critical period, when the person is apt to make a sudden and unexpected change which will [PAGE 508]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS have a disadvantageous effect upon the life, therefore he should guard care- fully against such a contingency. There is also a liability to the forma- tion of a clandestine relationship which will bring sorrow and trouble to the person, hence he should avoid association with the opposite sex and when this is unavoidable he should be very circumspect in his manner and behav- ior, for under these directions people are very likely to judge him severely for the slightest semblance of wrong-doing. There is a tendency to irrita- bility and cruelty of speech which is likely to cause domestic unhappiness and the loss of friends that will later be regretted very much, therefore the person should endeavor to curb himself; in fact it would be better to avoid his friends as much as possible during this time. THE MOON PROGRESSED SEXTILE OR TRINE TO RADICAL URANUS. These are excellent aspects for those who are sufficiently advanced to re- spond. If Uranus was well aspected at birth, the original, intuitive and inventive faculties will find an outlet at this time which may be very ad- vantageous to the person. If he is interested in the study of advanced thought or occultism this is a particularly good time to pursue such sub- jects, for an expansion of consciousness may most easily result under these directions, friendships are formed with advanced people who will be of [PAGE 509]  PROGRESSED LUNAR DIRECTIONS benefit to the person, and advantageous changes or removals may be made, hence it marks an epoch in the life which is likely to leave a permanent mark for good.

If Neptune was afflicted in the natal chart these directions mark a period of weird and uncanny experiences, when the person is likely to come under"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"the spell of hypnotism or mediumship or have visions or begin to hear voices, but all these experiences are of an undesirable character and should therefore be guarded against as much as possible. It would be very unwise under these directions to enter the seance room of a spiritualistic meeting where the conditions favor such manifestations, and if the aspects occur from water signs--Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces--there is a strong tendency to form a drink or drug habit which may operate to the sorrow and trouble of the person for all the rest of his life. As these aspects produce a mental and physical lassitude, when the vital forces are low and the person negative, such undesirable influences are particularly apt to gain a foothold. There is also a danger from plots by secret enemies which tend to [PAGE 510]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS bring the person into discredit and trouble. He may even suffer imprison- ment or be confined in a hospital through ill-health, for Neptune rules prisons, hospitals, insane asylums, and similar places. Great care should be taken in all dealings with others. THE MOON PROGRESSED SEXTILE OR TRINE TO RADICAL NEPTUNE. If Neptune was well aspected at birth these directions may bring a slight extension of consciousness and if the solar aspects to Neptune are also in force at the same time an initiation may be looked for by those who are suf- ficiently advanced to respond to this influence.

In the following paragraphs we have set down these tendencies, and it matters not whether Venus progresses to a good aspect with radical Saturn, or Saturn progresses to a good aspect with radical Venus, the effects are as noted in the first paragraph, and similarly with the other aspects follow- ing. VENUS AND SATURN IN GOOD ASPECT BY PROGRESSION indicate a period of fi- nancial success, gain in social prestige and emotional exaltation. The re- ligious and devotional nature is likely to receive an awakening. VENUS AND SATURN IN EVIL ASPECT BY PROGRESSION indicate a period of sor- row and trouble. Both the health and reputation suffer; delays, disappoint- ment and losses are frequent and annoying. Others will seek to impose upon [PAGE 513]  MUTUAL PLANETARY DIRECTIONS the person; death or separation from loved ones, and other disagreeable ex- periences are met. The mind is gloomy and inclined to worry. MERCURY AND SATURN IN GOOD ASPECT BY PROGRESSION mark a good time to un- dertake new responsibilities, make investments in houses, mines, lands, or similar property, undertake study or research work of a deeper nature, and make important contracts which will prove of lasting benefit to the person. It is a good time to deal with agents and elderly persons, or to undertake journeys for a serious purpose. MERCURY AND SATURN AFFLICTED BY PROGRESSION indicate a time of delays and disappointments with a tendency to look upon the dark side of things. It is a bad time to undertake new responsibilities, deal with elderly people or sign legal papers. The person is liable to slander and loss of reputation. MARS AND SATURN IN GOOD ASPECT BY PROGRESSION mark a period when the per- son will be very enterprising yet tactful and diplomatic, courageous but not foolhardy, strong and dignified, better able to shoulder the responsi- bilities of life than at any other time.

All the vices of the character seem to come to the fore at this time, and loss of temper is the least among them. The greatest care should be taken to keep the animal nature down and hold a firm check upon all the undesirable traits in the character. VENUS AND JUPITER IN GOOD ASPECT BY PROGRESSION bring financial benefits, and a rise in social position and esteem. They make the person more kindly, sympathetic and considerate, hence increase his popularity. It is a good time to travel and enjoy life. Investments made under this influence are generally successful, and the health is excellent, or if the person has been ill this marks the period of convalescence and recuperation, when life takes on a rosier hue. VENUS AND JUPITER AFFLICTING EACH OTHER BY PROGRESSION indicate a period of mild domestic trouble, small financial losses and a tendency to ex- travagance and wastefulness, pecuniary difficulties on that account, and possibly lawsuits. There is also some loss of prestige in the social circle or the person's environment.

He should be very careful not to sign papers or enter into agreements, for there will be trouble and misunderstanding, involving financial loss; also if he lends money to other people they will endeavor to impose upon him and defraud him, and dealings with agents and commission men should be par- ticularly avoided.

MARS AND JUPITER IN EVIL ASPECT BY PROGRESSION mark a danger point in the life when the person is liable to wreck his whole career by acts which are definitely criminal, or by losses due to ostentatious display and ex- travagance, or he may become interested in some wildcat mining scheme or speculate upon the stock exchange in such a reckless manner that he loses all he has and becomes a pauper. The health is also likely to suffer under this direction; impurities of the blood may cause growths, tumors, boils, and kindred afflictions. Altogether it is a very evil time and the person should guard himself very carefully against yielding to any of these influ- ences.

This is a good time for advertising and extending the person's business, entering contracts and agreements, and dealing with agents and middlemen.

The New Moons are particularly potent. These so-called TRANSITS are seen in the ephemeris for the actual year of events."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" THE INCREASING OR DECREASING MOON Among the points in Astrology which bother the beginner, is when the Moon is increasing in light or decreasing. Astrological works frequently use these expressions when tabulating the effects of various configurations. But so far as we know, no explanation has been given elsewhere, and we trust the following may make the subject clear to students. Each month the Moon comes into conjunction with the Sun, and this con- junction of the luminaries is called a LUNATION OR NEW MOON. After the con- junction or New Moon, she may be seen in the western sky close to the hori- zon as a tiny crescent; day by day the lighted surface grows larger; at the time of the opposition to the Sun she has increased her light to the fullest [PAGE 522]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS capacity, and at that time we speak of her as a full Moon; she then rises in the eastern sky at the same time as the Sun sets in the west. From that time for another fortnight it will be observed that she rises later and later in the night; at the same time the illuminated part of her disc de- creases until just before the next conjunction or new Moon, early risers may observe her in the eastern sky just before sunrise as a tiny crescent upon the vault of heaven. Thus the Moon is increasing in light from the time of its conjunction or new Moon to the opposition, or full Moon, and from the full Moon to the net New Moon it is decreasing in light. The times of the New Moon, Full Moon and eclipses are given each month in our SIMPLIFIED SCI- ENTIFIC EPHEMERIS, which see. Transits of Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter are important, and when the student has become familiar with the mysteries of the progressed horo- scope but not before, he may profitably write the ephemeral position of these planets outside the progressed horoscope and watch their effect, also the aspects of the New Moons. But be sure, at first, to keep the progressed horoscope down to first principles, for fancy aspects are \"the stuff dreams are made of,\" the warp and woof of astrological romances which fade away into moonshine and leave the astrologer discomfited. It is comparatively easy to wield the shuttle of imagination with natal, progressed and transit- [PAGE 523]   TRANSITS ing planets, each set with its corresponding houses, and a multitude of as- pects to choose from, but simple judgment based upon the prime essentials of a horoscope is almost invariably justified by events.

ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASE Parents have an exceptional opportunity and may lay up much treasure in heaven by judicious care of growing children based upon knowledge of tenden- cies to disease revealed by the horoscope. The writers rely implicitly upon the horoscope's testimony and though in a few cases doubts have been ex- pressed as to the correctness of our diagnosis, because it varied from that of practitioners in personal touch with the patient, subsequent developments have invariable vindicated our judgment and proved the far-reaching penetra- tion of Astrology which is as much in advance of the X-Ray as that is supe- rior to a candle, for even though the X-Ray were capable of illuminating the entire body to such an extent that we could see each individual cell in ac- tivity, it could only show the conditions of the body at a given moment. But the horoscope shows incipient disease from the cradle to the grave, thus it gives us ample time to apply the ounce of prevention, and maybe escape an illness, or at least, ameliorate its severity when disease has overtaken us. It indicates to the day when crises are due. Thus forewarned, we may take extra precautionary measures to tide over the critical point. It indicates [PAGE 529]  ASTRO-DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASE when the inimical influences will wane and fortifies us to bear present suf- fering with strength born of the knowledge that recovery at a specific time is certain. Thus Astrology offers help and hope in a manner obtainable by no other method; for its scope is wider than all other systems, and it pen- etrates to the very soul of Being.  AN IMPORTANT WARNING If letters of fire that would burn themselves into the consciousness of the reader were obtainable, we would spare no effort to procure them for the purpose of warning students on some particular points in connection with the practice of medical Astrology; these are: Never tell a patient a discouraging fact. Never tell him when impending crises are due. Never predict sickness at a certain time. Never, NEVER predict death. It is a grave mistake, almost a crime, to tell sick persons anything dis- couraging, for it robs them of strength that should be husbanded with the utmost care to facilitate recovery. It is also wrong to suggest sickness to"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"a well person, for it focuses the mind on a specific disease at a certain time, and such a suggestion is liable to cause sickness. it is a well known fact that many students in medical colleges feel the symptoms of every dis- ease they study, and suffer greatly in consequence of auto-suggestion, but [PAGE 530]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the idea of impending disease implanted by one in whom the victim has faith is much more dangerous; therefore it behooves the medical astrologer to be very cautious. If you cannot say anything encouraging, be silent. This warning applies with particular force when treating patients having Taurus or Virgo rising or the Sun or Moon in those signs. These positions predispose the mind to center on disease, often in a most unwarranted man- ner. The Taurean fears sickness to an almost insane degree, and prediction of disease is fatal to this nature. The Virgos court disease, in order to gain sympathy, and though professing to long for recovery, they actually de- light in nursing disease. They beg to know their symptoms, the crises, and delight in probing the matter to the depths; they will plead ability to stand full knowledge and profess that it will help them; but if the practi- tioner allows himself to be enticed by their protestations, and does tell them, they wilt like a flower. They are the most difficult people to help in any case, and extra care should be taken not to aggravate their chances by admissions of the nature indicated. Besides, thought the writers have used medical Astrology for many years and with astonishing success, and though Astrology, as a science, is abso- lutely exact and infallible, it must not be forgotten that there remains nevertheless the chance of mistaken judgment on the part of the practitioner and the chance that the person whose horoscope he is judging may assert his [PAGE 531]   TRANSITS will to such an extent that it overrules the indication in the horoscope. He may change his mode of life without knowing what would have happened if he had gone on as before, and thus he may be in no danger at the time when the tendency to sickness shown by the horoscope arrives; it is cruel to un- settle his mind in any case. Naturally, the young student would be most li- able to make a mistake in judgment, but no one is immune. We remember a case that came to our notice recently. One of the most prominent European astrologers predicted for a client in South Africa that on a certain date he would have a severe haemorrhage of the lungs. The poor man wrote to us for help, but though liability to colds in the lungs was shown, we saw no seri- ous trouble at the time predicted, nor has haemorrhage been experienced in the year elapsed between that time and the present writing."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":" Some students have a morbid desire to know the time of their own death, and probe into this matter in a most unwarranted manner; but not matter how they may seek to deceive themselves there are very few who have the mental and moral stamina to live life in the same manner, if they knew with abso- lute certainty that on a certain date their earthly existence would be ter- minated. That is one of the points most wisely hidden until we are to see on both sides of the veil, and we do wrong, no matter what our ground, to seek to wrest that knowledge from the horoscope. [PAGE 532]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Moreover, it has been well said that \"the doctor who prescribes for him- self has a fool for a patient,\" and this applies to diagnosis of one's own horoscope with tenfold force, for there we are all biased; either we make too light of conditions, or we take them too seriously, particularly if we investigate the time and mode of death. We remember a case where an intel- lectual women, principal of a private school in New York, wrote asking for admission to our correspondence class, \"if we thought it worth while, as she was going to die the first week in March.\" She gave us all the aspects upon which she based her judgment, and as one of the writers had just emerged hale and hearty from similar configurations, she gave the lade in question a good talking to that straightened her out; she told the lady she (the writer) expected to live to a ripe age. Now that lady is thinking of a use- ful life, she has learned to forget death. Astrology is too sacred to be thus misused. Let the student forget about his own horoscope and devote his knowledge to helping others; then it will aid him in accumulating treasure in heaven as no other line of spiritual endeavor will.  PLANETARY POLARITIES When we study magnetism we are dealing with an invisible force; and ordi- narily we can at best state the way it manifests in the physical world, as is the case whenever we deal with any FORCE. The physical world is the world of effects; the causes are hidden from our sight, though they are [PAGE 533]  PLANETARY POLARITIES nearer than hands or feet. Force is all about us, invisible and only seen by the effects it produces. If we take a dish of water, for illustration, and allow it to freeze, we shall see a myriad of ice crystals, beautiful geometrical figures. These show the lines along which the water congealed and these lines are lines of force which were present before the water congealed; but they were invisible until the proper conditions were furnished them and they became manifest. In the same way there are lines of force going between the two poles of a"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"magnet; they are neither seen nor felt until we bring iron or iron filings into the place where they are, when they will manifest by arranging the fil- ings in an orderly pattern. By making the proper conditions we may cause any of the nature forces to show their effects--moving our street cars, car- rying messages with lightning speed over thousands of miles, etc., etc.; but the FORCE itself is ever invisible. We know that magnetism travels always at right angles to the electric current with which it manifests; we know the difference between the manifestations of the electric and the magnetic current, so dependent upon one another, but we have never seen either; though they are about the most valuable servants we have today. Magnetism may be divided into \"mineral\" and \"animal\" magnetism, though in reality they are one, but the former has very little influence upon animal [PAGE 534]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS tissue, while the latter is generally impotent in working with minerals. The mineral magnetism is derived directly from lodestones which are used to magnetize iron, and this process gives to the metal thus treated the property of attracting iron. This kind of magnet is very little used, how- ever, as its magnetism becomes depleted, is too weak in proportion to its bulk, and principally because the magnetic force cannot be controlled in such a so-called \"permanent\" magnet. The \"electro-magnet\" is also a \"mineral\" magnet. It is simply a piece of iron wound around with many turns of electric wire; the strength of the mag- net varies as the number of turns of wire, and the strength of the electric current that is passed through it. Electricity is all about us in a diffused state, of no use for industrial purposes until it is COMPRESSED and forced through the electric wires by the powerful ELECTRO-MAGNETS. We must have MAGNETISM in the FIRST place before we can get any electricity. Before a new electric generator is started the \"fields,\" which are nothing but electro-magnets, must be magnetized. If that is not done they may turn it till the crack of doom, at any rate of speed they please, and it will never light a single lamp nor move a grain of weight; all depends upon the magnetism being there FIRST. After this magne- tism is once started it will leave a little behind when the generator is shut down, and this so-called \"residual magnetism\" will be the nucleus of [PAGE 535]  PLANETARY POLARITIES force to be built up each time the generator is started afresh. All bodies of plants, animals and men are but transformed mineral. They"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"have all come from the mineral kingdom in the first place, and chemical analysis of the plant, animal and human bodies brings out the fact beyond cavil. Moreover, we know that the plants get their sustenance from the min- eral soil, and both animal and man are eating mineral when they consume the plants as food; even when man eats the animals he is nevertheless eating mineral compounds, and therefore he gets with his food both the mineral sub- stances and the magnetic force which they contain. This force we see manifesting in \"Haemoglobin,\" or the red coloring mat- ter in the blood, which attracts the life-giving oxygen when it comes into contact with it in the millions of minute capillaries of the lungs, parting with it as readily when it passes through the capillaries which all over the body connect the arteries with the veins. Why is this? To understand this, we must acquaint ourselves a little closer with the way magnetism manifests as seen in industrial uses. There are always two fields or a multiple of two fields in a generator or motor, every alternate \"field\" or magnet being \"north-pole\" and every other one, \"south-pole.\" If we wish to run two or more generators \"in multiple\" and force their electricity into the same wire, the first requisite is that [PAGE 536]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the magnetic current in the field-magnets should run IN THE SAME DIRECTION. If that were not the case, they would not run together; they would gener- ate currents going in OPPOSITE directions, blowing their fuses. That would be because the poles in one generator, which should have attracted, re- pelled, and vice-versa. The remedy is to change the ends of the wire which magnetizes the fields; then the magnetic current in one generator will be- come like the current of the other, and both will run smoothly together. Similar conditions prevail in magnetic healing; a certain vibratory pitch and magnetic polarity were infused into each of us when the stellar forces surged through our bodies and gave us our planetary baptism at the moment when we drew our first complete breath. These are modified during our pil- grimage of life, but in the main their initial impulse remains undisturbed and therefore the horoscope at birth retains the most vital power in life to determine our sympathies and antipathies as well as all other matters. Nay more, its pronouncements are more reliable than our conscious likes and dis- likes. Sometimes we may meet and learn to like a person, although we have a feeling that he has an inimical influence on us for which we cannot account, and therefore strive to put aside; but a comparison of his horoscope with our own will reveal the reason and if we are wise we heed its warning, or as"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"surely as the circling stars move in their orbits around the Sun we will [PAGE 537]  PLANETARY POLARITIES live to regret our disregard of this handwriting on the wall. But there are also many cases when we do not sense the antipathy between ourselves and a certain person, though the horoscope reveals it, and if we see the signs when comparing the two horoscopes we may feel inclined to trust our feelings rather than the stellar script of the horoscopes. That also will in time lead to trouble, for the planetary polarity is certain to manifest in time unless both parties are sufficiently evolved to rule their stars in a large measure. Such people are few and far between at our present stage of evolution. Therefore we shall do well if we use our knowl- edge of the stellar script to compare our horoscopes with those at least who come intimately into our lives. This may save both them and us much misery and heartache. We would advise this course particularly with regard to a healer and his patients, and with reference to a prospective marriage part- ner. When anyone is ill, resistance is at the lowest ebb, and on that account he is then least able to withstand outside influences. So the vibrations of the healer have practically unrestrained effect, and even though he may be ensouled by the noblest of altruistic motives, desiring to pour out his very life for the benefit of the patient, if their stars were adverse at birth, his vibratory pitch and magnetism are bound to have an inimical effect upon the patient. Therefore it is of prime necessity that any healer should [PAGE 538]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS have a knowledge of Astrology and the law of compatibility, whether he be- longs to those who admittedly heal by magnetism and the laying on of hands or to the regular schools of physicians, for the latter also infuse their vibrations into the patient's aura and help or hinder according to the agreement of their planetary polarity with that of the patient. What has been said with regard to the healer applies with tenfold force to the nurse, for he or she is with the patient practically all the time and the contact is so much more intimate. For healer, nurse and patient, compatibility is determined by the rising sign, Saturn, and the Sixth House. If their rising signs agree in nature so that all have fiery signs rising, or all have earthy, airy, or watery signs rising, they are harmonious, but if the patient has a water sign rising, a nurse or a doctor with fiery signs will have a very detrimental effect."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":" It is also necessary to see that Saturn in the horoscope of the nurse of healer is not placed in any of the degrees of the zodiac within the patient's Sixth House. With respect to marriage the planetary polarity is shown principally by a consideration of the feminine Moon and Venus in a man's horoscope, for they describe his attractions towards the opposite sex, and in a woman's horo- scope the masculine Sun and Mars have a similar significance. If these planets are harmoniously configurated and the signs on the cusps of the [PAGE 539]  PLANETARY POLARITIES Seventh Houses of the prospective partners agree, harmony will prevail, es- pecially if the Sun, Venus or Jupiter of one person is placed in the Seventh House of the other. But if the planets mentioned afflict one another, or the Seventh Houses of the parties are out of harmony, or if Saturn, Mars, Uranus or Neptune of one is in a degree included in the Seventh House of the other, it is the handwriting on the wall which indicates that the planetary polarities are inharmonious and that sorrow is in store for them if they al- low their evanescent emotions to draw them together in a bond of unhappi- ness; for it is easy to change the field wires on two electric generators so that their polarities will agree, but it is extremely difficult to reverse the planetary polarity of one person to make it agree with that received by another at his planetary baptism. [PAGE 540]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  CHAPTER XXIX  THE LAW OF CORRESPONDENCES It is said in the Bible that God made man in His likeness, and from hoary antiquity seers and sages have noted a correspondence between the MACROCOSM, the great world, and the MICROCOSM, the little world, or man. This is again expressed in the hermetic axiom which is the master-key to all mysteries: \"AS ABOVE, SO BELOW.\" Therefore we may note that the various parts of the human body are correlated to different divisions of the vaulted arch of heaven and the marching orbs that move through it. As the creative forces within the womb act upon the ovum and gradually build the foetus, so also the stellar rays from the macrocosmic body of mother nature are active upon man. It is their activity which we note in the process of evolution whereby that which is now man has come up through the lower kingdoms to his present stage of completion, and it is by the same rays that he will gradually evolve to the divine stature where he will indeed be like the Father in Heaven, consequently we may note the correspondences between the signs and planets and the different divisions of the human body as follows:"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"[PAGE 541]  THE LAW OF CORRESPONDENCES PATHOGENIC EFFECTS OF THE TWELVE SIGNS ARIES rules the head, the cerebral hemispheres, the various organs within the head, and the eyes, but the nose is under the rulership of Scorpio. Thus any affliction in Aries will react upon the head, producing head- aches, neuralgia, coma and trance conditions, diseases of the brain and ce- rebral hemorrhages. TAURUS rules the neck, throat, palate, larynx and tonsils, lower jaw, ears, and occipital region. The cerebellum is also under the rule of Taurus, so are the atlas and cervical vertebrae, the carotid arteries, jugular veins, and certain minor blood vessels. The diseases to which these regions are subject are goitre, diphtheria, croup and apoplexy. As each sign always reacts upon the opposite, afflic- tions in Taurus may also produce venereal diseases, constipation, or ir- regular menses. GEMINI rules the arms and hands, shoulders, lungs, and the thymus gland, also the upper ribs, therefore afflictions in Gemini cause pulmonary dis- eases, pneumonia, pleurisy, bronchitis, asthma and inflammation of the pericardium. CANCER rules the oesophagus, stomach, diaphragm, pancreas, the mammae, lacteals, upper lobes of liver, and thoracic duct, hence afflictions in [PAGE 542]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Cancer produce indigestion, gas in the stomach, cough, hiccough, dropsy, gloom, hypochondria, hysteria, gall stones, and jaundice. LEO rules the heart, the dorsal region of the spine, the spinal cord, and the aorta, therefore the afflictions in Leo cause regurgitation, palpita- tion, faintings, aneurism, spinal meningitis, and curvature of the spine, also arterio-sclerosis and angina pectoris, hyperaemia, anaemia and hydraemia. VIRGO rules the abdominal region, the large and small intestines, the lower lobes of the liver, and the spleen, therefore afflictions in Virgo produce peritonitis, tapeworm, malnutrition, interference with the absorption of the chyle, typhoid fever, cholera, and appendicitis. LIBRA rules the kidneys, the suprarenals, the lumbar region of the spine,"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"the vasomotor system and the skin, hence afflictions in Libra produce polyuria, or suppression of the urine, inflammation of the ureters which connect the kidneys with the bladder, Bright's disease, lumbago, eczema and other skin diseases. SCORPIO rules the bladder, urethra, and genital organs in general, also the rectum and the descending colon, the sigmoid flexure, the prostate gland, and the nasal bones; hence afflictions in Scorpio produce nasal catarrh, [PAGE 543]  PATHOGENIC EFFECTS OF THE SIGNS adenoids, and polypi, diseases of the womb and ovaries, various venereal diseases, stricture, and enlargement of the prostate gland, irregularities of the menses, leucorrhoea, rupture, renal stones and gravel. SAGITTARIUS rules the hips and thighs, the femur, ilium, the coccygeal and sacral regions of the spine, the iliac arteries and veins, sciatic nerves, hence afflictions to Sagittarius produce locomotor ataxia, sciatica, rheuma- tism, and hip diseases. Furthermore, as each sign has an influence upon its opposite, afflictions in Sagittarius may also cause pulmonary troubles. It is also noteworthy that broken bones are caused by this sign. CAPRICORN governs the skin and the knees, but it has also a reflex action on the stomach, which is governed by the opposite sign Cancer. Hence afflic- tions in Capricorn produce eczema and other skin diseases, erysipelas, lep- rosy, and digestive disturbances. AQUARIUS rules the ankles, the limbs from the knees to the ankles, and has also a reflex action on its opposite sign Leo, hence afflictions in Aquarius produce varicose veins, sprained ankles, irregularities of the heart action and dropsy. [PAGE 544]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS PISCES rules the feet and toes. It also has a reflex effect on the ab- dominal region governed by the opposite sign, Virgo, hence afflictions in this sign indicate trouble and deformities of the feet, intestinal diseases and dropsy. It also produces a desire for drink and drugs which may bring about delirium tremens. Consumption is sometimes found to be a secondary result of cold in the feet contracted by an afflicted Pisces.  PATHOGENIC EFFECTS OF THE SUN The Sun rules in the very first place the vital fluid which is special- ized through the spleen, transferred to the solar plexus, and thence dis- tributed over the whole body. This vital fluid is invisible to ordinary hu- manity, but to those gifted with the spiritual sight it appears as a"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"rose-colored fluid which is like the electricity in the wires of a telephone or telegraph system. When the wires designed to carry electricity are minus the electric fluid they are dead and the telephone or telegraph instruments do not respond. Similarly, when for some reason the invisible vitial fluid ceases to flow through any part of the human organism in sufficient guan- tity, that part of the body will not perform its proper function, and there- fore disease results, continuing until some obstruction has been removed and the path cleared for the vital fluid. On that account an afflicted Sun al- ways causes disease, particularly in a man's horoscope, and in a woman's [PAGE 545]  PATHOGENIC EFFECTS OF THE SUN nativity the Moon, which is the collector of solar forces, takes the same office or function. The heart and the PONS VAROLII, or vital knot, situated in the brain, are the principal parts of the body ruled by the Sun. When the Sun is well aspected in Leo or Aries radiant health may be looked for. But on the other hand, when he is afflicted he produces the various ailments according to the sign wherein he is placed at the time. These disabilities may be set down as follows: THE SUN AFFLICTED IN ARIES, the sign which rules the head, gives a tendency to aphasia, loss of identity, brain fever, cerebral haemorrhage, and menin- gitis, cerebral anaemia or congestion of the blood, faintings and headaches. THE SUN AFFLICTED IN TAURUS gives a tendency to quinsy, diphtheria, and polypus of the nose. In the Pleiades (Taurus 29), eye trouble.

VENUS AFFLICTED IN GEMINI gives a tendency to corrupt blood, pulmonary inef- ficiency, whitlows, warts, and dropsy. VENUS AFFLICTED IN CANCER gives a tendency to distended stomach, gastric tu- mor, and nausea. VENUS AFFLICTED IN LEO gives a tendency to spinal affections, backache and enlarged heart.

[PAGE 553]  PATHOGENIC EFFECTS OF SATURN  PATHOGENIC EFFECTS OF SATURN Saturn is the planet of obstruction, crystallization and atrophy. By his action the circulation or passage of bodily fluids, such as the blood, lymph, or urine, is impeded, and by this stagnation waste materials are re-"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"tained instead of being eliminated. Thus they form various deposits in the body, building the skeleton, which is CONSTRUCTIVE, hardening the arteries and articulations, which is DESTRUCTIVE. Saturn rules the gall bladder, where he forms the painful gallstones, and by virtue of his exaltation power in Libra he crystallizes the renal stones and gravel which cause such suf- fering to those who have these concretions. By retention of the urea he causes the painful rheumatism and gout which often manifest in deformity of the joints that so often disfigures and disables the sufferers therefrom. He rules the pneumogastric nerve, and by his restrictive action through that medium he may at any moment slow down the heart action, stop digestion, sup- press the urine and stool under the emotions of fear and worry generated by him. Thus he has the power to bring every bodily function to a standstill. Saturn also rules the teeth and the skin. By his action the teeth decay, leading to malnutrition, the synovial membranes are hardened, making the spine and limbs rigid; he makes the skin tough as the years go by. Saturn is at home in Capricorn, and by his reflex action in Cancer he interferes with the peristaltic action which is necessary in the digestion of food; he [PAGE 554]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS then causes antiperistalsis, or vomiting. His general activities in the body are destructive and tend to end the life of the organism. Saturn generally hurts by falls, bruises, and colds. He predisposes to chronic and deep-seated ailments, and his victims are difficult to reach be- cause he imbues them with fear, worry, and pessimism, so that they refuse to believe in the possibility of a cure and cannot be induced to take a cheer- ful look on life.

This, Mars, the opposing ex- altation ruler, recklessly scatters by expenditure of muscular energy, and he is aided and abetted in his destructive activities by Saturn, who pro- duces gall and urea which he deposits during the muscular work as uric acid in the various parts of the body where it manifests as gout and rheumatism. Saturn also makes the liver torpid and causes constipation. Jupiter rules the adrenals and arterial circulation, hence his afflic- tions cause formation of adipose tissue, fatty degeneration of muscles, tu- mors, and morbid growths, enlargement of organs, waste of sugar and albumen as in diabetes and kindred diseases. Blood-poisoning, hyperaemia and apoplexy are due to afflictions of Jupiter. The following effects may be noted when Jupiter is afflicted in the twelve signs. JUPITER AFFLICTED IN ARIES gives a tendency to dizziness, cerebral conges- tion, sleepiness, thrombosis, fainting, ulcerated gums of upper jaw, and, by reflex action in Libra, diabetes and depression due to lack of adrenal se- cretion. JUPITER AFFLICTED IN TAURUS gives a tendency to gourmandize, hence plethora and apoplexy, ringworm and carbuncles follow; also ulcerated gums of man- dible; by reflex action in Scorpio, catarrh of the nose and nosebleed.

PATHOGENIC EFFECTS OF MARS The ancient Egyptian sages called Cancer the sphere of the soul, and when the mystic Sun of life goes through this moist, fruitful lunar sign the seed-atom of the ego's physical body is planted. While the embryonic body grows unconsciously as a plant grows, the mystic Sun of life passes through Leo, Virgo, and Libra. In the fourth month of gestation it passes through the second of the water signs, Scorpio. Then the spirit dies to its heav- enly home and is immured in its earthly prison house by Mars, who chains it with the silver cord and thus brings about the quickening. Then the Sun of [PAGE 560]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS life proceeds through Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and when after the"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"nine months have been completed it has passed through the last of the watery signs, Pisces, the flood-gates of the womb are opened and the ego is launched upon the sea of life under the auspices of the martial sign Aries, where the giver of life, the Sun, is exalted. During the gestatory period Mars has given to the body iron, especially in the form of haemoglobin, and with the first breath oxidation of this sub- stance commences to produce the heat so necessary to life and consciousness. This operation is continued all through life, and thus to the Martian ray falls the important task of supplementing the Sun in the maintenance of the vital spark until the mystic Sun of life has completed its circle and reached the sign where the quickening took place. Then Scorpio gives the body its death-sting, Mars and his friend Saturn cut the silver cord, and the free soul soars as an eagle into the empyrean seeking the celestial spheres which are its true home. Therefore Scorpio is symbolized both by a scorpion and an eagle. On account of his mission as AIDE to the Sun in the maintenance of life, Mars every aims to cleanse the body of filth and waste accumulation so that the fires of life may burn brightly, hence, when the gourmandizing habits of Jupiter and Venus have clogged the system, or the obstructive tendencies of Saturn have poisoned the body by stoppage of elimination, Mars lights the [PAGE 561]  PATHOGENIC EFFECTS OF MARS fire of fever and inflammation to burn out the refuse and give the system a new lease on life and energy. Thus many of the pathogenic effects of Mars aim at a constructive end. But Mars not only aids the vital process of the life-giving Sun, who is exaltation ruler of Aries; he is himself exaltation ruler of Capricorn, where Saturn, the planet of death, holds sway, and between those two thieves the Sun, the Lord of Life, is crucified, suffers and dies, while they part his physical garment. The role of Saturn in this process has been described in the appropriate chapter, and of Mars it may be said that by his reckless- ness he predisposes to accidents by burning, scalding, wounds, or gunshot. He rules the genitals through Scorpio, and depletes the vitality and causes genital disorders by passional excesses, haemorrhage, rupture of blood ves- sels. Excessive menses and haemorrhoids show his activities in the blood; hernia and contagious diseases are also manifestations of the martian ray. As mars is a malefic, his presence in any sign or house constitutes an af- fliction in itself, regardless of his aspects, but naturally his pathogenic effects are worse when he is aspected by square or opposition than when he is fortified by sextile or trine. His effects in the twelve signs may be more specifically stated as fol- lows:"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"MARS IN ARIES gives a tendency to sunstroke, cerebral haemorrhages or con- gestion, inflammation of the brain, brain fever and delirium, shooting pains [PAGE 562]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS in the head, insomnia, and wounds in the head; by reflex action in Libra, inflammation of the kidneys, renal haemorrhage and renal calculi.

PATHOGENIC EFFECTS OF URANUS Uranus rules the ether which is the medium by which the light rays are transmitted, hence he has considerable influence over the eyes and is re- sponsible, when afflicting the Sun or Moon, for various diseases of the eyes, or even blindness. This is especially the case when the Sun or Moon is placed in the Pleiades (Taurus 29), or the Ascelli (Leo 6) or Antares (Sagittarius 8). Modern astrologers have not yet had time to tabulate the full effects of Uranus in all the signs, and as for the pathogenic effects still less is known, but he is said to be exalted in Scorpio and our own experience seems to indicate that Uranus has a very marked evil influence on the sex which is ruled by this sign, producing most deep-seated venereal diseases. By reflex action or affliction to planets in Taurus (ruled by Venus) where the organ of coordinated action is located, he produces erratic movements, as seen in St. Vitus dance, contortions, spasms, tetanus, cramps, hiccough and hyste- ria. As ruler of the ether and gases he is responsible for injury and shock by electricity which travels through the ether. Nitrogen, a gas, is the base [PAGE 565]  PATHOGENIC EFFECTS OF URANUS of a number of compounds whose characteristic Uranian instability makes them highly explosive, and Uranus is thus responsible for such deaths and inju- ries as occur on that account, especially if placed in the Eighth House. URANUS IN TAURUS gives a tendency to diminished pituitary secretion and con- sequent abnormal growth. URANUS IN GEMINI gives a tendency to spasmodic asthma, colds, and a dry, hard cough. URANUS IN CANCER gives a tendency to hiccough, produced by the erratic ac- tion of the diaphragm, also to a hard, dry stomach cough and cramp of the"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"stomach, gas and flatulence. URANUS IN LEO gives a tendency to palpitation, spasmodic heart action, spi- nal meningitis and infantile paralysis; by reflex action from Aquarius similar effects are now observable. URANUS IN VIRGO gives a tendency to flatulence, and abdominal cramps. URANUS IN LIBRA gives a tendency to intermittent action of the kidneys and venereal eruptions of the skin; by reflex action in Aries, sudden and violent headaches, shooting pains in the head, and hallucinations. [PAGE 566]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS URANUS IN SCORPIO gives a tendency to miscarriages, abortions, and venereal diseases, and in the Fifth House he causes painful and difficult parturi- tion, generally involving the use of instruments and often the infant is se- verely or fatally injured or stillborn. URANUS IN CAPRICORN usually works by reflex action in Cancer, but as the children with this position are still young (this is written in 1918) the full effects are as yet unknown.  PATHOGENIC EFFECTS OF NEPTUNE Neptune, the octave of Mercury, works principally upon the nervous system (ruled by Mercury) and at times produces frenzy where the person is beside himself on account of religious or other excitement. At other times he pro- duces lethargy, coma, catalepsy, trance or mediumship, where the bodily en- ergies are in abeyance while the psychic powers are in a state of hyperac- tivity. He rules the spinal canal, which is filled with ether during life. (It is true that surgeons tap it and draw out a fluid, but they may also draw water from a steam boiler because the steam condenses to water.) This luminous gas is called THE SPINAL SPIRIT FIRE by occultists, and by vibrat- ing the pineal gland, also ruled by Neptune, spiritual sight is produced, but it depends upon the rate and pitch of these vibrations what the person sees. By prayer, concentration and meditation, a state of ecstasy may be [PAGE 567]  PATHOGENIC EFFECTS OF NEPTUNE produced where he sees the celestial hosts, or if a lower rate of super-normal vibration is produced by drink or drugs he sees demoniac shapes as related by sufferers of delirium, which is due to Neptune, especially in the watery sign Pisces. The pathogenic influence of Neptune is most evil in the Sixth House (or the sixth sign, Virgo) indicating disease, or in the Twelfth House (or the twelfth sign, Pisces) which governs sorrow, trouble and self-undoing. If these two houses are occupied by Taurus and Scorpio,"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"the signs ruling the throat and genitals, there is an abnormal and perverted passional desire which gives a tendency to self-abuse, and perversion of a still worse nature. The mind, ruled by Mercury, the lower octave of Neptune, is morbid in its brooding upon unsavory subjects, and parents with children having Neptune in the Sixth or Twelfth Houses will do well to watch them carefully, especially if Neptune is in opposition to Uranus; that cov- ers a number of those who are now, in 1918, reaching puberty, for Neptune has been going through the psychic sign Cancer while Uranus was in the op- posite sign Capricorn. We have found that Neptune square Saturn and Jupiter brought mental dis- turbances; Neptune conjunction Mars in Aries, square Uranus and the Moon in Cancer caused temporary instability of a periodic nature; Neptune conjunc- tion Moon square Uranus caused spirit control. We have also seen many other indications, but the full effects of Neptune have not yet been systemat- [PAGE 568]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS ically observed. We are working to that end, however, and hope in future years to be able to present a fairly full tabulation.  THE DUCTLESS GLANDS  THEIR ROLE AND RULERS It is well known to the esoteric astrologer that the human body has an immense period of evolution behind it and that this splendid organism is the result of a slow process of gradual upbuilding which is still continuing and will make each generation better than the previous until in some far distant future it shall have reached a stage of completion of which we cannot even dream. It is also understood by the deeper students that in addition to the physical body man has finer vehicles which are not yet seen by the great ma- jority of human beings, though all have within them latent a sixth sense whereby they will in time cognize these finer sheaths of the soul. The oc- cultist speaks of these finer vehicles as the VITAL BODY, made of ether, and the DESIRE BODY, made of desire stuff, the material whence we draw our feel- ings and emotions, and with the addition of the SHEATH OF MIND and the physical body these complete what may be termed the personality which is the evanescent part distinct from the immortal spirit that uses these vehicles for its expression. These finer vehicles interpenetrate the dense physical body as air permeates water and have particular dominion over certain parts [PAGE 569]   THE DUCTLESS GLANDS thereof, because the physical body itself is a crystallization of these finer vehicles in the same manner and upon the same principle that the soft"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"fluids of a snail's body gradually crystallize into the hard and flinty shell which it carries upon its back. For the purpose of this dissertation we may say broadly that the softer parts of our bodies which we commonly call flesh may be divided into two kinds, glands and muscles. The vital body was started in the Sun Period. Crystallization from that time on in that vehicle has developed what we now call glands and to this day they and the blood are the special manifestations of the vital body within the physical vehicle, and therefore the glands as a whole may be said to be un- der the rule of the life-giving Sun and the great benefic, Jupiter. For it is the function of the vital body to build and restore the tone of the muscles when tense and tired by the work imposed upon them by the restless desire body which was started in the Moon Period. The muscles are therefore ruled by the wandering Moon, which is the present vantage point of the an- gels, the humanity of the Moon Period, and by the impulsive and turbulent Mars, where the so-called \"Fallen Angels,\" the Lucifer spirits, dwell; that is to say as a whole, for the student must carefully note that individual glands and particular groups of muscles are under the rulership of other planets as well. It is as when we say that all who live within the United States of America are citizens of that country, but some are subject to the [PAGE 570]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS laws of California, others to those of Maine. We know the Hermetic axiom, \"AS ABOVE, SO BELOW,\" which is the master key to all mysteries, and as there are upon the earth, the macrocosm, a great many undiscovered places, so also in the microcosm of the body do we find unknown countries that are a closed book to the scientific explorers. Chief among them has been a small group of the so-called \"ductless glands,\" seven in number, namely: The PITUITARY BODY, ruled by Uranus. The PINEAL GLAND, ruled by Neptune. The THYROID GLAND, ruled by Mercury. The THYMUS GLAND, ruled by Venus. The SPLEEN, ruled by the Sun. The two ADRENALS. ruled by Jupiter. They have a great and particular interest for occultists, and they may be termed in a certain sense \"the seven roses\" upon the Cross of the body, for they are intimately connected with the occult development of humanity. Four of them, the Thymus Gland, the Spleen and the two Adrenals, are connected with the personality. The Pituitary Body and the Pineal Gland are par- ticularly correlated with the spiritual side of our nature and the Thyroid Gland forms the link between. The astrological rule over these seven glands is as follows:"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":" The Spleen is the entrance gate of the solar forces specialized by each human being and circulated through the body as the vital fluid, without [PAGE 571]   THE DUCTLESS GLANDS which no being can live. This organ is therefore governed by the Sun. The two Adrenals are under the rulership of Jupiter, the great benefic, and ex- ert a calming, quieting and soothing effect when the emotional activities of the Moon and Mars or Saturn have destroyed the poise. When the obstructive hand of Saturn has awakened the melancholy emotions and laid its restraint upon the heart, the Adrenals' secretions are carried by the blood to the heart and act as a powerful stimulant in its effort to keep up the circula- tion, while the Jovial optimism struggles against the Saturnine worries or against the impulse of Mars, which stirs the desire body into turbulent emo- tions of anger, rendering the muscles tense and trembling, dissipating the energy of the system; then the secretion of the Adrenals comes to the res- cue, releasing the glycogen of the liver in a more abundant measure than usual to cope with the emergency until the equipoise has been again at- tained, and similarly during whatever other stress or strain. It was the knowledge of this occult fact that prompted the ancient astrologers to place the kidneys under the rulership of Libra, the Balance, and in order to avoid confusion of ideas we may say the kidneys themselves play an important part in the nutrition of the body, being under the rulership of Venus, the Lady of Libra, but Jupiter governs the Adrenals, with which we are now par- ticularly engaged. [PAGE 572]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Both Venus and her higher octave, Uranus, govern the functions of nutri- tion and growth, but in different ways and for different purposes. There- fore Venus rules the Thymus Gland, which is the link between the parents and the child until the latter has reached puberty. This gland is located im- mediately behind the sternum or breast bone; it is largest in ante-natal life and through childhood while growth is excessive and rapid. During that time the vital body of the child does its most effective work, for the child is not then subject to the passions and emotions generated by the desire body after that comes to birth at or about the fourteenth year. But during the years of growth the child cannot manufacture the red blood corpuscles as does the adult, for the unborn, unorganized desire body does not then act as an avenue for the martian forces which assimilate the iron from the food and transmute it into haemoglobin. To compensate for this lack there is stored in the Thymus Gland a spiritual essence drawn from the parents, who are sym- bolized by Venus, the ruler, and with this essence provided by the love of the parents the child is able to accomplish the alchemistry of blood tempo- rarily until its desire body becomes dynamically active. Then the Thymus Gland atrophies and the child draws from its own desire body the necessary"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"martian force. From that time, under normal conditions, Uranus, the octave of Venus, and ruler of the Pituitary Body, takes charge of the function of growth and assimilation in the following manner: [PAGE 573]   THE DUCTLESS GLANDS It is well known that all things, our food included, radiate from them- selves continuously small particles which given an index of the thing whence they emanate, its quality included. Thus when we lift the food to our mouth a number of these invisible particles enter the nose and by excitation of the olfactory tract convey to us a knowledge of whether the food we are about to take is suitable for this purpose or not, the sense of smell warn- ing us to discard such foods as have a noxious odor, etc. But besides those particles which attract or repel us from food by their action upon the ol- factory tract through the sense of smell, there are others which penetrate the sphenoid bone, impinge upon the Pituitary Body and start the Uranian alchemistry by which a secretion is formed and injected into the blood. This furthers assimilation through the chemical ether, thus affecting the normal growth and well-being of the body through life. Sometimes this Uranian influence of the Pituitary Body is eccentric and therefore respon- sible for strange and abnormal growths which produce the unfortunate freaks of nature we occasionally meet. But besides being responsible for the spiritual impulses which generate the before-mentioned physical manifestations of growth, Uranus, working through the Pituitary Body, is also responsible for the spiritual phases of growth which aid awakened man in his efforts to penetrate the veil into the Invisible Worlds. In this work it is, however, associated with Neptune, the ruler of the Pineal Gland, and it will therefore be necessary, in order to [PAGE 574]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS properly elucidate, that we study the functions of the Thyroid Gland, ruled by Mercury, and of the Pineal Gland, which is under the domination of his higher octave, Neptune, simultaneously. That the Thyroid Gland is under the rule of Mercury, the planet of rea- son, is readily realized when we understand the effect which the degen- eration of this gland has upon the mind, as shown in the diseases of Cretin- ism and Myxedema. The secretions of this gland are as necessary to the proper functioning of the mind as ether is to the transmission of electric- ity, that is to say, upon the physical plane of existence where the brain transmutes thought into action. Contact with and expression in the invis- ible worlds depends upon the functional ability of the Pineal Gland, which is altogether spiritual in function, and is therefore ruled by the octave of Mercury, Neptune, the planet of spirituality. But Neptune operates in con-"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"junction with the Pituitary Body ruled by Uranus, the planet of wisdom, as has already been stated. Scientists have wasted much time in speculation upon the nature and func- tion of these two little bodies, the Pituitary Body and the Pineal Gland, but without avail, and principally because, as Mephistopheles says so sar- castically to the young man who wants to study science under Faust: [PAGE 575]   THE DUCTLESS GLANDS \"Who e'er would know and treat of aught alive Seeks first the living spirit thence to drive; Then are the lifeless fragments in his hand; He lacks, alas! THE VITAL SPIRIT BAND.\" No one can really and truly observe the physiological functions of any organ under such conditions as exist in the laboratory, on the operating table, or in the dissection or vivisection chamber. To arrive at an ad- equate understanding one must necessarily see these organs exercising their physiological functions IN THE LIVING BODY, and that can only be done by means of the spiritual sight. There are a number of organs which are either atrophying or developing; the former show the path we have already traveled during our past evolution, the latter are finger-posts, indicating our fu- ture development. But there is still another class of organs which are nei- ther degenerating nor evolving; they are simply dormant at the present time. Physiologists believe that the Pituitary Body and the Pineal Gland are atro- phying because they find these organs more developed in some of the lowest classes of life, such as worms, but as a matter of fact they are wrong in their ideas; these organs are only dormant. Some have also suspected that the Pineal Gland is in some way connected with the mind, because it contains certain crystals after death, and the quantity was much less in those who were mentally defective than in people of normal mentality. This conclusion is right, but the Seer knows that the spinal canal of the living is not [PAGE 576]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS fluid with FLUID; that the blood is not LIQUID, and that these organs have no CRYSTALS in them when the body is alive; these assertions are made with full knowledge of the fact that the blood and the spinal essence are liquid when drawn out of the physical body, living or dead, and the contents of the Pituitary Body and the Pineal Gland APPEAR crystalline when the brain is dissected; but the reason is similar to that which causes steam drawn from a steam boiler to condense immediately upon contact with the atmosphere, and molten metal drawn from a smelter's furnace to crystallize immediately upon withdrawal therefrom."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":" All these substances are purely spiritual essences when inside the body; they are then ethereal and the substance in the Pineal Gland, when seen by the spiritual sight, appears as LIGHT. Furthermore, when one Seer looks upon the Pineal Gland of another who is then also exercising his spiritual faculties, this light is of a most intense brilliancy and of an irridescence similar to but transcending in beauty the most wonderful play of the North- ern Lights, the AURORA BOREALIS, ever witnessed by the writer, and he has seen them many times. It may also be said that the function of this organ seems to have changed in the course of human evolution. During the earlier epochs of our present stay upon the earth, when man's body was a large, baggy thing into which the spirit had not yet entered, but was there only as an overshadowing presence, there was an opening in the top and the Pineal [PAGE 577]   THE DUCTLESS GLANDS Gland was within it; it was then an organ of orientation, giving a sense of direction. As the human body condensed, it became less and less able to en- dure the intense heat which prevailed during that time and the Pineal Gland gave warning when the body was brought too near one of the many craters and active volcanoes which were then erupting the thin earth crust, thus en- abling the spirit to guide it away from these dangerous places. It was an organ of direction which operated by feeling, but feeling has since been distributed over the skin of the whole body, and this is an indication to the occultist that some day the senses of hearing and sight will also be similarly distributed so that we shall both see and hear with our whole body and thus become still more sensitive in those respects than we are now. Since then the Pineal Gland and the Pituitary Body have become tempo- rarily dormant to make man oblivious to the invisible world while he learns the lessons afforded by the material world; but the Pituitary Body has manifested the Uranian influence sporadically in abnormal physical growth, producing freaks and monstrosities of various kinds, while Neptune, working also abnormally through the Pineal Gland, has been responsible for the ab- normal spiritual growth of medicine men, witches and mediums of spirit con- trols. When they are awakened to normal activities these two ductless glands will open the door to the inner worlds in a sane and safe manner, but in the meantime the Thyroid Gland, ruled by Mercury, the planet of reason, [PAGE 578]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS holds the secretion necessary to give the brain balance. In the future the ductless glands are destined to play a prominent role; their development will accelerate evolution greatly, for their effects are mainly mental and spiritual.

THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES IN ORDER to further aid the student of the stellar science we present a number of horoscopes of people who have come to us for help in their trouble. We therefore know these cases to be authentic and trust that our delineation of their various ailments by means of astro-diagnosis may prove a true guide. We have made an attempt at classification of these horoscopes, but as there are generally symptoms of several diseases in each horoscope it has been impossible to draw hard and fast lines in the grouping, and the student will therefore have to rely mainly on the headlines for indications of what the figure shows. The first 22 horoscopes are found on pp. 624-634. The last 14 figures are attached to their respective readings.  SEX AS A FACTOR IN DISEASE It is our earnest conviction, that the less we dwell upon sex, the less we read about it and think about it, the purer we shall be mentally, and also less liable to danger of morbid habits, for these are often formed by overstudy of the sex question, and persons having a tendency in that direc- [PAGE 580]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS tion should be discouraged in attempts to discuss the matter at all. In planning this chapter we had at one time thought it possible to escape men- tion of the subject, but more mature thought based upon much study of health and disease from the mystical standpoint has convinced us that we must go back to the allegorical Garden of Eden for the starting-point of pain and sorrow, as fully explained in our literature. The effects of continued transgression are with us today as a matter of actual fact, abuse of sex is in the most literal sense the primal source of sorrow, disease and degen- eracy under which the world is groaning, and in a work of this nature it is obligatory to show the causes so that the remedy may be found and applied. Therefore we shall attempt to show the prenatal influences revealed by the horoscope as a warning to parents that marriage is a sacrament, and not a license to sex abuse, and that \"the sins of the fathers are indeed visited upon the children.\" At the same time, of course, an innocent child is not born with the tendency to a certain disease, its former living has made it liable to a specific weakness, and for that reason it is drawn by the Law of"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Association to parents from whom it may obtain a body subject to that par- ticular ailment.

To drive this point home, the writers undertake to paint the loath- some picture of degeneracy, that the picture of purity may be the more at- tractive by contrast. In this connection we present first figure No. 1, which is that of a boy, in 1912 about 16 years of age. The Fourth and Tenth Houses, the planets in them and their rulers show the parents. the parent who most influences the life is shown by the Tenth House configurations, and the Fourth House indi- cates the one lease concerned in the child's destiny. In this figure Gemini is on the Midheaven, and Mercury, its ruler, is square the Moon from cardinal signs. Neptune is conjunction Mars in the Tenth House and square the Sun in the mercurial sign Virgo. This estab- lishes well the morbid, neurotic nature of the father, and his instrumental- ity in depriving the boy of the faculty of speech and of coordination of muscular movements; the boy cannot walk, but staggers. The mother's part is described by Sagittarius on the Fourth House. Jupi- ter, the ruler is in Leo in conjunction with the Dragon's Tail, (the Moon's Western Node), which has an influence similar to Saturn. It is also square to Saturn and Uranus, these being in conjunction in Scorpio. This describes her as being a lewd woman; degenerate, committed to the dreadful theory of soul-mates, affinities, free love and all kindred abuses. These lewd [PAGE 582]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS tendencies she imparted to the boy. The affliction to Leo affects the heart, and as Saturn is the embodiment of obstruction, restraint and sup- pression, we may know that the heart action is very weak, (had the afflic- tion come from Mars his dynamic energy would have caused palpitation). Scorpio has rule over the sex organ, Uranus and Saturn there give tendency to self-abuse, and on the well known principle that mutilation of that organ affects the voice, we have in this configuration an added reason for the poor boy's inability to speak. The affliction coming from fixed signs shows the deep rooted constitutional nature of the evil, and what may come of con- ception during a drunken debauch.  THE GUARDIAN OF THE THRESHOLD"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":" Horoscope No. 2 shows one of the most remarkable psychic conditions we have ever come across. Its portents in some respects are plain to any as- trologer, but investigation by one of the writers into this person's past life adds sidelights and gives depth to the meaning of configurations not otherwise obtainable; also to the writer, who made the spiritual investiga- tion two years before the horoscope was cast, it was a revelation to note how the mystic facts he remembered so well, were inscribed in this little wheel of life. To enable the student to properly appreciate the remarkable case we relate the story of how we came into connection with the person, what we attempted to do, and what actually happened. [PAGE 583]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES In the fall of 1910, a friend told us the sad case of a young boy con- fined to his bed, lying upon his stomach and elbows, persistently gazing at a certain spot in a corner of the room, as if fascinated, his whole frame continually shaking with sobs and moans. At request of the friend we vis- ited the unfortunate boy, and found that the object which drew his gaze, with a power similar to that whereby the snake charms a bird into its fangs, was an elemental of the most horrible type we have ever seen. Standing by the bedside we directed a stream of force towards the base of the poor victim's brain, and thus drew him towards us in an endeavor to break the spell, but the fiend held the consciousness charmed to such a degree that there was evident danger of rupture of body and soul. We therefore de- sisted, and, with the fearlessness born of inexperience, decided to fight the elemental upon his own plane of being. But the Elder Brother who is our Mentor sought us that evening; he advised caution, and investigation of the genesis of the monster before we took action. Research of the memory of nature developed the fact that in its last life the spirit embodied in the youth had been an initiate of the Order of Jesus, a Jesuit, and a zealot of the most ardent type, cruel and unfeeling in the highest degree, yet perfectly impersonal, with no other aim in life save to further the interests of his Holy Order. The health, wealth, reputation or life of others he sacrificed without qualm of conscience, so that the order [PAGE 584]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS was benefited; he would have offered himself up as freely, for he was sin- cere to the core. Love was as foreign to his nature as hate, but sex was rampant; it tore his strong soul to shreds, yet it never mastered him; he was too proud to show his passion even to one who could have gratified it, and so he developed the secret habit. It must not be supposed that he be- came an abject slave in that respect; he, the immortal spirit, fought his lower nature by prayer, castigations, fastings and every other conceivable"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"means; sometimes he thought he had conquered, but when he least expected it the beast in him rallied, and the war waged as fiercely as ever. Many times he was tempted to mutilate himself, but he scorned such a course as unworthy a man, especially when that man had taken the vows of priesthood. At last he succumbed to the strain; vigorous manhood was succeeded by a middle age of delicate health, constant pain increased his mental anguish and sympathy was born of suffering; he was no longer indifferent to the tortures of vic- tims of the Holy Office. Being by nature a zealot and enthusiast in what- ever direction his energies were exerted, the pendulum soon swung to the other extreme, Paul-like, he fought to protect whom he had previously perse- cuted, he incurred the enmity of the Holy Office, and finally, broken in body, but dauntless of spirit he fell a victim to the torture to which he had subjected so many. By the sincerity of his nature, and his later life he earned the right of admission to a Mystery School and prepared for the privilege of working as [PAGE 585]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES an Invisible Helper in future lives. The Law of Association drew him to birth in an American family who were former friends, and from them he re- ceived a nervous organization tuned to the high pitch required for his expe- rience. Saturn opposes the life-giving Sun, suppresses the nervous energy of Mer- cury, and obstructs the Venus (venous) circulation, by hindering secretion of urine and elimination of poisonous matter through the kidneys which are ruled by Libra, the sign of Saturn's exaltation where he is placed in this natal figure. As the planets which he opposes are placed in Aries, ruler of the head, his disordering influence manifests through the brain and mind, as well as the genito-urinary system. The morbid condition of these parts caused by Saturn's repressive influence on the kidneys is further accentu- ated by Uranus conjunction the Moon in the Sixth House which indicates the health, under the sign ruling the generative organs, Scorpio. As the horo- scope shows tendencies resulting from our actions in past lives, it is evident that the self-abuse of this person must bring him to birth under a stellar ray affecting the health in that particular manner, for when the soul has been overcome by any particular besetting sin in any life, death does not pay all any more than removal to another city pays our debts in our present abode. When we return, temptation will again confront us until we conquer our weakness. It is the task of this poor soul to extract the [PAGE 586]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS essence of virtue and chastity from the burning embers of passion and secret vice. May God help him and strengthen his arm in the terrible combat. Only"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Astrology, the Master Key of Compassion, can adequately reveal to us the struggle and anguish of the soul, and save us from the crime of despising one in conditions of depravity. The before-mentioned aspects were from Cardinal and Fixed signs, which indicate that which is almost unalterable destiny. But Neptune on the As- cendant, in a Common sign, Gemini, points to a condition in the making. He is trine to Saturn, the afflicter of the mind, and supported by the dynamic energy of Mars. Neptune indicates the invisible spiritual hierarchies which work with and upon us, and when placed in the Twelfth House it is evident that sorrow and distress may be expected from them. This position renders the person liable to be preyed upon by spirit controls, but the trine to Saturn and the sextile to the Sun, Venus and Mercury protect him against influence from outside sources. Thus he became a prey to the demoniac embodiment of his former actions, the terrible creature known to mystics as \"Guardian of the Threshold,\" which the neophyte must pass ere he can enter consciously into the Invisible World. This dreadful shape had drawn its being from acts of cruelty committed by the man in his bygone life; it has fed upon the curses of his tortured victims, and gorged itself upon the odor of their blood and perspiration, as is the wont of elementals; it was a monster in every sense [PAGE 587]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES of the word. earth of its progenitor rendered it latent, but in the new birth figure time was marked for retribution upon the clock of destiny. When the Moon by progression reached Mars' natal place in the Twelfth House, his dynamic energy galvinized the monster into new life, and the troubles of the poor lad had commenced. The hate, anger and malice stored in the mon- ster radiated back upon him pang for pang and his negative Gemini nature crumpled under the onslaughts of the demon. When we saw the thing it ap- peared as a shapeless jellylike mass with many large greenish eyes imbedded at different parts of its body. Every few seconds a sharp pointed, sword- like projection shot out from the most unexpected places in its body and pierced the poor lad who lay cringing upon his bed. Then, although the mon- ster had no mouth, wherewith to laugh, it seemed convulsed with fiendish glee at the fear and pain it had given. At other times, one or another of the eyes seemed to dart from the monster, projected upon what resembled an elephant's trunk and it would halt within an inch of the victim's eyes, gaz- ing into them with a compelling power of awesome intensity. There being so many good aspects to help him, it is not likely that he will succumb, and when the Sun reaches conjunction of Jupiter's place in the natal figure and the Moon has passed the square to the Sun's natal place, a distinct turn for the better may be looked for. In the meanwhile the poor"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"[PAGE 588]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS soul must struggle alone with its self-made demon. Had not the secret habit sapped vitality in the former life, birth under a stronger sign would have given greater power of physical endurance and rendered victory more certain.  DISEASE OF THE EYES This malady is due to rays from certain nebulous parts of the Zodiac; the Pleiades in Taurus 29, the Ascelli in Leo 6, and Antares in Sagittarius 8. When the Sun or Moon is in orb of one of these places, and afflicted by Sat- urn, Mars or Uranus, or vice versa, when Saturn, Uranus or Mars is in these nebulous parts afflicting the Sun or Moon, trouble is indicated, but if care is taken in the case of children having this tendency to disease it may be greatly modified or entirely avoided. The light in schoolrooms calls for attention on general principles, but where a child has incipient eye trouble the parent ought to request proper placement of the child in a modified light; reading by lamplight or in the dusk should not be permitted, and win- dow shades in the home ought to be of a soothing color. With civilization and life in cities the eyes have become habituated to short focus and cannot quickly adjust themselves to variation of range as can those of sailors and plainsmen. When a child's horoscope indicates weak eyes, residence in a ru- ral district, if possible, may be of immense value in preserving the vision, for exercise of the eye muscles by frequent adjustment of focus from short [PAGE 589]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES to long range, and vice versa, will materially aid to strengthen the eyes. It is a fact, that much eye strain is due to congestion of the ciliary muscle, which adjusts the lens to range of objects, and of the muscle which contracts the iris. Each time the latter fails to act quickly too much light enters the retina is hurt. Life in the open while the child's muscles are still limber will do wonders towards correcting such defects, and even grown persons may derive vast benefit from outdoor life provided the eyes are properly shaded at first. Careful osteopathic treatment of the eyes has also a most beneficial effect of stimulating circulation and limbering the muscles. SUBTILE INDICATIONS OF SPIRITUAL SIGHT It is a well know scientific fact, that sensation depends on ability to feel and interpret vibration in air and ether, according to the sense in- volved. Ancient seers devised the Staff of Mercury as a symbol of its ef- fects, and among other spiritual secrets embodied in the undulating forms of the twin serpents, is also this, that Mercury is the originator of all vi- bratory movement. Hence he is a prime factor in production of sensation and"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"mental processes arising in the consciousness as a result. An elevated, well aspected Mercury therefore makes our senses acute and the mind keen; and afflicted Mercury either dulls the senses, or makes the person hypersen- sitive; in either case an abnormal state of the brain mind is produced [PAGE 590]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS which causes suffering according to house, sign and affliction; even a good aspect of a so-called evil planet, though it brings out the virtue of that planet, also carries with it a touch of the darker side because even the best of us have something in our inner natures which vibrates to that phase of the planet's nature. But, besides this roundabout way of acquiring knowledge through vibra- tions in the air and ether inaugurated by Mercury and interpreted by slow processes in the brain mind where spirit and matter meet, THERE IS A DIRECT PATH TO KNOWLEDGE symbolized by the staff around which the serpents twine. This is the ray of Neptune, the octave of Mercury, which puts us in touch with the spiritual worlds. But, observe this, the staff and the serpents are not separate, the staff goes THROUGH the winding forms of the serpents, and thus we learn that in our present condition spiritual knowledge is de- pendent on the brain mind for concrete expression, and through the brain mind the latter is colored according to the aspects of Neptune. Experience has proved that the afflicted stellar ray from certain parts of the Zodiac already mentioned, interferes with the etheric vibration sensed by the retina of the eye, and thus impairs the physical sight. If, in the same figure, Neptune is focused through one of these places, the so-called \"blind spot,\" which is BLIND because unresponsive to the etheric mercurial vibrations is sensitized by the spiritual ray of Neptune, and thus [PAGE 591]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES it may be that a person physically near sighted, or even blind, may view the spiritual worlds hidden from people whose sight is focused by mercurial vi- brations. The aspect of Neptune determines the grade and nature of the spiritual sight evolved, as illustrated in various horoscopes herewith. These were picked to demonstrate other points, but it occurred to us that the phase just mentioned is worthy of notice. It may be well, however, to warn students against absurd conclusions; we do not say that everyone af- flicted with eye trouble by Antares, Ascelli or the Pleiades is gifted in return with spiritual sight. The woman in horoscope No. 5 is much afflicted physically, but Neptune is out of orb, and she derives no vision from his ray. Spiritual vision may also be undeveloped in many who have the aspect well defined, but in those cases it is in process of unfoldment, and will yield EASILY to proper exercises. Where this aspect is a square or opposi-"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"tion it is wise, however, to refrain from any attempt to seek illumination, for in those aspects lurk great danger from spirit controls, elementals, etc., which is amply illustrated in horoscope No. 2, where the opposition of Neptune to Antares is responsible for the awful vision of the Guardian of the Threshold. There the physical sight is not impaired, but in horoscope No. 3, defective eyesight is shown by affliction from the Ascelli and like trouble comes from Antares in No. 4. In one the trine from Neptune produces voluntary vision of the super-physical realms, but in the other his focus is [PAGE 592]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS square, hence the spiritual sight obtained is intermittent and not under control. We have spoken of Mercury as originator of all sense vibrations, audi- tory, olfactory, visual, etc., and of Neptune as its octave; to forestall questions we may say that in the spiritual world separateness ceases, sensa- tions merge, so that sound and sight, voice and vision are one. The Neptune ray carries both, but undeveloped seers suffering from the involuntary fac- ulty, \"see\" or \"hear\" as it suits the entities which obtain admission to them through this ray. Horoscope NO. 3 shows the inimical influence of the nebulous spot in Leo 6, the Ascelli, on the sight. This dangerous degree was rising at birth with the Moon in close conjunction, and the Sun also in orb. Saturn in 24 degrees of Libra is just within orb of a square to the Sun in Leo 0 degrees, and as a result of these various afflictions the person is compelled to use bifocal glasses. There is a compensating advantage, however; Neptune in el- evation and trine to the Ascelli (with Sun, Moon and Ascendant in orb), has endowed him with spiritual sight over which he has perfect control, as the student may readily see by examination of Mercury, the best fortified planet in the horoscope. Saturn, by sextile, from the sign of his exaltation, gives steadiness, persistence and concentration; Jupiter by trine from the house he rules expands the mind, makes it religiously inclined and [PAGE 593]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES benevolent; Venus by sextile, adds kindliness and love of beauty. Thus it is evident that in this horoscope the relation of Mercury and its octave, Neptune, to physical and spiritual expression of mind, is well illustrated. Neptune is most highly elevated and Mercury is most strongly aspected. Nei- ther is afflicted, therefore he is not liable to hallucinations, but weighs his experiences in the scale of logic. Compare this horoscope with that of the poor young man afflicted by the Guardian of the Threshold (No. 2), where Neptune is in the Twelfth House in conjunction with Mars, and where Mercury is afflicted by the opposition of Saturn, all from Cardinal signs; contrast"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"of the two figures will bring out some fine points. In horoscope No. 5 we see the Moon in the Sixth House, about three de- grees from Antares, and Saturn is in the Twelfth House within 4 degrees of an opposition to Antares, about 7 degrees from exact opposition to the Moon; thus his natal influence was minimized. Had the opposition been close or exact, blindness from birth would have been inevitable, but fortunately it was a weak aspect and the vision was not seriously affected until the Sun by progression entered the Twelfth House, passed the opposition to the Moon, then opposition to Antares and arrived at conjunction with Saturn. These points of contact in the horoscope marked crises in the disease of the eyes. Saturn being the afflicter, the nerves and muscles crystallized until sight [PAGE 594]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS of one eye was lost and the other eye is almost blind. In November, 1912, the Moon had progressed to the square of the Sun's place at birth. That was the final crisis which vivified the before-mentioned aspects. Neptune makes not aspect to the points of the Zodiac mentioned, hence the spiritual sight is deeply dormant. Horoscope NO. 4 is the most afflicted of all; the Dragon's Tail, the Sun and Antares are in conjunction. That alone is sufficiently severe; the condi- tion is further aggravated, however, by a close square of Neptune and Mars to the Sun, and the affliction to the eyes is increased by a conjunction of Saturn with the Pleiades which occurs in the Twelfth House. Thus this horo- scope shows the person when born to have very weak eyes, and as a matter of fact she can scarcely read even when holding book or paper a few inches from the eyes and using a magnifying glass; but the square of Neptune to Antares has opened her spiritual senses to a certain extent so that she hears spirit voices and at times has visions. These manifestations, being uncontrolled by her, are very unsatisfactory of course, but prove the effect of Neptune aspecting these points in the Zodiac. THE DRAGON'S \"HEAD\" AND \"TAIL\" As it has often been a sore puzzle to students what are the \"Dragon's Head\" and \"Tail\" (called the Moon's nodes in the ephemeris), and why one is supposed to be good and to further all that comes under its benefic ray, [PAGE 595]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES while the other is considered extremely evil, it may be well to show the reasonableness of the philosophy. First, let us say for the information of students not versed in astro-"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"nomical terms, that \"nodes\" are points where a planet, traveling in its or- bit, crosses the Sun's path; as for instance, the earth does at the equi- noxes. This is explained from both the astronomical and mystic sides in our SIMPLIFIED SCIENTIFIC ASTROLOGY, and also the revolution of the Moon's Nodes. Speaking from the convenient geocentric viewpoint, the Sun crosses its eastern node each year at the vernal equinox, 50 seconds of space in advance of the point where it crossed the previous year; as the Sun travels 15 de- grees per hour, 50 seconds of space are traversed in about 3 seconds of time. The Moon rises about 50 minutes later each night; applying the same mea- sure, 50 minutes of time correspond to about 3 minutes of space, and the Moon's nodes recede just that much every day. Thus the Sun travels around the circle of the Zodiac in one year, but re- quires 27 times as many thousands (27,000 years), to complete the preces- sional circle of its nodes, the equinoctial points. the swift moving Moon circles the Zodiac in 27 days and its nodes make a full revolution in 1000 weeks or 19 years. (These figures are only approximate.) In the case of the Sun the place where it crosses the earth's equator in the east is always regarded as the first point of Aries, no matter where in [PAGE 596]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS the constellations it falls because of precession. This procedure is per- fectly justified because the life-giving qualities ascribed to the Sun in Aries are observable as soon as it has crossed the equator; then the seeds sprout, the mating season commences and the whole creation seems stirred by the solar ray to bring forth. Therefore astrologers say that the Sun is ex- alter in Aries, and Aries is understood to be the first 30 degrees from the equinoctial point, the eastern node of the Sun, where he crosses the equator at the vernal equinox. On the same principle the western node of the Sun, the point where he leaves the northern hemisphere for the winter months, is called the first point of Libra, and Saturn, the planet of obstruction and suppression is here exalted; he is the reaper with his scythe, he mows down the fruits of the solar ray, he suppresses life and joy, the gladsome voices of our feath- ered friends are hushed in his presence, and the earth goes down to its win- try grave under his withering influence. As the Moon gathers and reflects the solar light upon earth, this bor- rowed light is similar to the direct ray in certain respects; no matter where its eastern node (called the Dragon's Head), falls in the signs, the"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"effect upon affairs wherewith it is connected by conjunction is like that of the Sun in Aries, which makes nature sing with joy; it furthers and acceler- ates personal matters in a most beneficial manner, it so to speak, oils the wheels of life in the particular department where it is conjoined with a [PAGE 597]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES planet. On the other hand, the Moon's western node, (called the Dragon's Tail), corresponds to Libra where Saturn is exalted and if in conjunction with a planet it exerts an influence of suppression and obstruction similar in effect to the chill blasts of winter ushered in by the saturnine exalta- tion. Horoscope No. 6 shows its part in breaking the femur (thigh bone) of a woman. Its position in the Twelfth House indicates confinement; the square of the Sun from the Midheaven is a further natal affliction. In December, 1908, the full Moon was in exact conjunction, and Jupiter, ruler of the Sixth House (which shows sickness), was in exact square to the Dragon's Tail, also in exact opposition to her Sun. Thus indications of trouble were many. Sagittarius, which has dominion over the hips and thighs, occupies the Sixth House, so the femur was broken when the lady slipped on an icy pavement just outside her house. No. 4 shows the Dragon's Tail in conjunc- tion with the Sun near the fixed star Antares which has an inimical influ- ence on the sight, and the poor woman who is thus afflicted is in great dan- ger of blindness. The Moon's nodes are tabulated in our SIMPLIFIED SCIENTIFIC EPHEMERIS, the position being given for every day; their places at birth are found by simple proportion, and the diagram herewith will explain that these points are called the \"Dragon's Head\" and the \"Dragon's Tail\" because the paths of [PAGE 598]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  DIAGRAM: THE SERPENTINE PATH OF SUN, MOON, AND PLANETS [PAGE 599]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES Sun and planets appear serpentine when drawn upon a plane surface.  DISEASE OF THE EARS The Twelfth House indicates the confining influences in life. Mercury there in conjunction with the Sun limits the spirit, and deafness hampers its search after knowledge. The same happens if Saturn, Mars, Uranus or"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Neptune afflict, also when the mercurial signs, Gemini or Virgo, are on the twelfth cusp and Mercury is afflicted, (no matter where in the figure it is placed). We append horoscopes of people who are suffering from this malady; No. 7 is the horoscope of a woman who is gradually losing here hearing. Mercury, Venus and the Sun are in close conjunction in Pisces, the twelfth sign, which is in the Twelfth House. Blood, lymph and the invisible vital fluid, called \"nerve force\" by science, are the builders of our bodies; each planet, except Uranus and Neptune, has dominion over one of their con- stituent parts. MERCURY rules the nerves, particularly the cerebrospinal system, and the in- visible rose colored vital fluid which flows in the visible nerve sheath. THE MOON also rules the nerves in a general way, but has special dominion over the nerve sheaths of the body, the sympathetic system and the lymph. JUPITER governs the arterial circulation. [PAGE 600]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS VENUS rules the venous blood. MARS rules the iron in the blood. THE SUN rules the oxygen. SATURN has dominion over the mineral deposits carried by the blood, which causes the arteries and other parts of the body to harden. When a planet is in very close conjunction to the Sun, three degrees or less, it is said to be combust; its ray is, so to speak, burned up in the terrific heat of the Sun, and thus the afflicted planet is unable to prop- erly exercise its function in the life of persons born under that configura- tion. It is also evident that as the weakest link of a chain is the first to give, so the disability would show itself in a part of the body otherwise afflicted. Horoscope No. 7 has both Venus and Mercury combust in the Twelfth House; we may therefore conclude that there is a lack of nerve force or vital fluid, and that the venous circulation of the ear is obstructed. Thus con- gestion is inevitable, and the hearing becomes less and less acute. Oste- opathy is excellently equipped to deal successfully with a case like this; were the configuration in a fixed sign we might not feel optimistic, but flexibility is the salient characteristic of the common signs, so we see no reason why with patience and perseverance a cure may not be consummated. [PAGE 601]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":" As said, Saturn rules the earthly mineral matter carried by our blood; from this the bony structure is formed, also concretions in the softer tis- sues. Therefore the skeleton is also under the dominion of Saturn. In horoscope No. 8, the auditory disability comes through the fixed signs Leo and Scorpio; this makes it more difficult to remedy, particularly as Saturn is the afflicter and throws his malefic ray upon Mercury from an angle. Science thought at one time that the tympanum was the only, or at least the main factor in hearing, but realizes now that as much or more de- pends upon the bony structure. It is the nature of Saturn to obstruct and as Scorpio rules the organs of Saturn to obstruct and as Scorpio rules the organs of excretion, we may easily see that this important function is im- paired, and that waste products have difficulty in passing kidneys and co- lon. The whole system becomes clogged in consequence, and as Mercury in the Twelfth House marks the ears as weak, it is only natural that the auditory nerve becomes clogged and the bony parts of the ear grow denser in the course of time. Sour milk or buttermilk has a particularly wholesome influence in clear- ing up a clogged system. Many people rebel against the use of milk in quan- tity because of an idea that it aggravates constipation: that is true in the beginning, but after a short time the system will accommodate itself to the diet, which will be then found superlatively cleansing, wholesome and nutritious. Greens and fruits will also aid a person afflicted as in horo- scope No. 8 to eliminate the waste and effect a cure in time. [PAGE 602]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  DISEASE OF THE VOCAL ORGANS Among the subjects germane to thorough knowledge of Astrology are the similar effects of intrinsically opposite factors; Saturn is called evil, and Jupiter good, but when Saturn is well fortified in a horoscope it has an exceedingly desirable effect, and an afflicted Jupiter is the very reverse of beneficial. Thus there is a good side to each so-called \"evil\" plant, and every \"good\" planet has also an undesirable phase. The signs of the Zo- diac are said to rule certain parts of the body, but each sign has also sub- sidiary dominion over the part ruled by its opposite sign; affliction of Gemini may cause bronchitis, or weaken the arms and shoulders, but sciatica, a Sagittarius disease, may also result. Taurus rules the throat; it has great sympathy with Scorpio, the sign that rules the generative organs, hence we note the change of voice in boys at the time of puberty; also woman, when she forsakes the path of chastity and lives a life of debauch acquires a coarser voice. Taurus rules the larynx, but Mercury governs the air which stirs the vocal chords to vibration; thus organic affliction is indicated by affliction of Taurus and Scorpio, but functional disability by"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"the position and aspect of Mercury. There is a similar relation between Taurus (ruling the vocal organs) and Mercury (ruling the air which passes through the larynx) as between instrument and player. [PAGE 603]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES If Taurus (and Scorpio) are unafflicted the vocal organ is in good condi- tion, but an afflicted Mercury may nevertheless cause a functional disorder of the speech. The reverse may also happen, namely, that a well fortified Mercury partially overrides the effect of a Taurus affliction. This is well exemplified in horoscope No. 9; Saturn, Neptune and the Sun conjoined in Taurus cause a throat affection, but Mercury is in a sign of voice, Gemini, (Libra and Aquarius are the other signs of voice) and in conjunction with Jupiter. The woman suffers constantly from throat trouble, but as a good musician draws melody from a dilapidated instrument, so, by the aid of her well placed Mercury, this woman is able to express herself better than many whose vocal organs are sound; in fact, she teaches elocution. Horoscope No. 3 has a singularly well fortified Mercury; there is no af- fliction to Taurus or Scorpio, and the gentleman has a powerful voice ca- pable of filling the largest halls without effort, yet not too loud for the smallest; but Mercury in Leo, a bestial sign, and Saturn in Libra, a sign of voice, are obstructive of perfect vocalization, therefore the gentleman has at times a certain halt or hesitancy of speech. It follows as a matter of course that disabilities of speech are more easily remedied that those that are organic; patience, practice of vocal and breathing exercises such as teachers of voice culture give, (these are en- tirely different from the dangerous Hindu breathing exercises) are almost [PAGE 604]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS sure to restore normal conditions. Horoscopes Nos. 9, 10, and 11 have Saturn and Neptune conjoined in Tau- rus; as a consequence all have throat trouble, and also a disorder of the genital organs. Nos. 10 and 11 have both undergone operations for removal of certain parts, and Mercury in Scorpio centers the thoughts of No. 10 upon sex, causing intense torture, as it is impossible to gratify the craving. Saturn in a fixed sign is certainly a sore afflicter, the reaper of fruits from a past life, and if there is to be any solace it must come through knowledge of the cause, prayer, and the patience engendered thereby.  DISORDERS OF THE MIND Before closing discussion of maladies peculiar to the head, mention must"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"be made of insanity, though the underlying causes can only be hinted at in a work of this kind; but the student is referred to THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION for a thorough explanation, and a key to the astrological correspondences. Here we only give the essential facts. The brain and larynx were first built by the angelic host from the Moon (Luna), who used part of the sex force for that purpose, hence the intimate connection between these organs. \"Lunacy\" is often induced by misuse of the sex force, and \"lunatics\" frequently have a flaw in the speech. When boys [PAGE 605]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES reach puberty the voice changes; the speech of a fast woman becomes coarse, and degenerate men acquire effeminate voices. In Italy singers anxious to cultivate high tenor voices have become eunuchs to achieve their purpose. Into the system thus built by the lunar host under Jehovah, rebel Angels led by Lucifer, the Spirit of Mars, insinuated themselves, and inculcated passion, sex abuse and rebellion against the rulership of the Angels of Je- hovah. To offset their influence our Elder Brothers from Mercury were com- missioned to foster reason that many may in time learn to guide himself. All the great Hierarchies work in our bodies constantly, but the three men- tioned have particular dominion over sex and sense; each invests one of the three segments of the spinal cord. The sublimely spiritual hierarchy of Neptune works in the spinal canal and cerebral ventricles to awaken spiritual senses, which when evolved, enable the imprisoned spirit to pierce the veil of flesh and contact super-physical realms. The Lucifer Spirits dominate the left cerebral hemisphere, which will come into activity in the future and elevate mankind to a higher, nobler plane of life, give us the power over the lower nature and make us Christlike. The lunar Angels hold sway in the cerebellum which is the instrument of coordination. In this veritable \"Tree of Knowledge\" the fight is fought between forces which make for emancipation of man and agencies which aim to keep him dependent, as [PAGE 606]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS explained in Rosicrucian Christianity Series, Lecture No. 14, \"Lucifer, Tempter or Benefactor?\" Such are the teachings which explain the deep reason back of astrological dicta, and any qualified seer may easily perceibe the various agencies at work in the human body; such are few, however, and the student of Astrology has reason to thank God day by day for the blessed science which is of greater benefit than any measure of spiritual sight. Though the writers are firm believers in the law of compensation which gives to each exactly what he has earned, neither more nor less, we cannot free ourselves from the"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"feeling that our measure of spiritual faculties has been heaped and shaken down. We feel very, very grateful for the privilege and added usefulness in service which this gives us. Nevertheless, were the alternatives placed be- fore us involving choice between loss of spiritual faculties and loss of our knowledge of Astrology, we should not hesitate one moment, but decide at once in favor of our beloved science, neither ought this surprise anyone who will give the matter a moment's thought. It is true that spiritual sight, even in its rudimentary form enables us to see the condition of the human body to the minutest detail, and thus affords a much easier means of diagno- sis than Astrology, but though it penetrates to the innermost core of the bone, mere clairvoyance is superficial compared to Astrology for it shows only present conditions of the body. To find the causes which led up to [PAGE 607]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES that state and judge of future tendencies, it is necessary to consult the memory of nature. We should have to do that personally, and this, time would not permit, as were are handling hundreds of cases, but a simple as- trological figure, which we may commission one of our students to case, re- veals as much at a glance. There are delineated the causes of mental, moral and physical disorders; it shows accurately the stages that have been passed and the crises yet to come. It also indicates the direction from which a remedy may be looked for and the most favorable time for administering the same. It helps people Here and Now, and the astrologer who lives up to his privilege has a mission so high and so holy that the office of priest (in the esoteric sense) pales into insignificance by comparison. Let the aspir- ant to this great knowledge remember that he stands upon holier ground that Moses before the burning bush, when he looks at a horoscope. Through that circle symbol of infinity an immortal soul is laid bare, and woe to him who dares to look with profane gaze, for no matter how that soul may have been smirched in its pilgrimage through matter, it is essentially divine and dear the Father, yea, perhaps even more precious, than the righteous who do not need mercy and compassion. This has been somewhat of a digression, but we have no apologies to offer, for we preach Astrology as a religion and feel the necessity of emphasizing this phase in season and out, if by any means [PAGE 608]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS we may inculcate in others the reverence which we ourselves feel for this divine science. Returning to the astrological consideration of insanity, and in view of what has been said we may note that the horoscope shows how, in the spinal canal, rays of the various hierarchies blend, and Astrology tabulates the resultant mental conditions as follows:"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":" People are not congenitally affected, who have cardinal signs rising, particularly if cardinal or fixed signs also invest the Midheaven and Nadir, rarely become insane. The active nature forbids morbid tendencies and blues, disappointment is quickly thrown off and hope springs eternal in the cardinal breast urging to renewed struggle with conditions. It is said that the exception proves the rule, and when Capricorn rises the saturnine rulership gives a tendency to melancholy which under certain aggravating circumstances may provoke suicide, particularly when the ruler is cooped up in the Eighth House, as we see in horoscope No. 12. Virgo, a common sign, devoid of stamina, holds the Sun, Saturn, Venus, and the Moon in this, the house of death; this robs the person of joy in life and impels him to end it under stress of sorrow. Knowledge on the part of an astrologer friend has so far forestalled the calamity, and it is hoped, may save the poor man from committing so grave a crime. When a Fixed sign rises at birth of a normal child, chances of insanity in later life are so exceedingly remote as to be almost negligible, espe- cially if a Fixed and Cardinal sign is also on the Midheaven. [PAGE 609]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES In our extended practice, we know of no exception; the rigid, set and in- flexible nature of the Fixed signs seems to protect the mind under all exigencies of stress. It therefore follows that the mentally unbalanced come principally from those born with Common signs on the angles. The intrinsic nature of these signs if FLEXIBILITY; as a reed in the wind people under these signs are swayed hither and thither by circumstances; they have no stamina or stabil- ity, and take reverses much to heart, while they last. Sorrow seems to overwhelm them and balance is easily lost. It is a distinctive feature of the Rosicrucian teachings that pupils in the Western world must be given every dictum, so as to forestall criticism as much as possible, for it retards development every time it is indulged. The Rosicrucian teachings therefore aim to forestall questions at every point by giving reasons for every dictum, so that the critical mind may be weaned away from this attitude. We are ardently looking for the day and reign of Christ, the Friend of man; we do not know when He comes we shall be like Him. Adverse criticism and skepticism were not traits of His character and any things that will aid to eradicate these undesirable characteristics hastens the glad day of UNIVERSAL FRIENDSHIP. The reason has been given in SIMPLIFIED SCIENCE ASTROLOGY why the Ascen- dant rules the body as a whole; it (or its opposite) is the place of the"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"[PAGE 610]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Moon at conception. In the Bible angels are mentioned as heralds of birth and their lunar home is the focus whence the spirits enter our terrestrial sphere on their return to physical life. They fashion the etheric mould for our present instrument, and direct the growth of the fetus. Therefore the Ascendant and the Moon show the organic disabilities which lead to mental disorder. The congenital idiocy resulting from lack of proper adjustment between the vital body and the physical vehicle has been thoroughly de- scribed in the ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION, together with causes producing the same during prenatal life. Astrologically this condition is produced by an affliction of the Ascendant, that is to say, the Moon's place at concep- tion, which throws the angle of the stellar ray out of parallax to the mother's body and the physical vehicle is built in such a manner that the head of the vital body is several inches above the skull. Thus the nerve centers are askew, preventing the ego from properly controlling its instru- ment. This is one of the configuration which produce idiocy and St. Vitus' dance. Uranus and Neptune are especially concerned in producing this latter phenomenon. Saturn is the cause of melancholy and depression. Mars and Uranus pro- duce the muscular and violent forms of insanity. Horoscopes 13 and 14 il- lustrate these peculiarities. No. 13 also shows the connection between pu- berty and the mental state. Gemini is rising, with Taurus and Mars intercepted in the Six and Twelfth Houses, from whence come disease and [PAGE 611]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES confinement. The Moon is in Taurus, which rules the larynx; she is in con- junction with Neptune, square to Mercury, and Mars is in Scorpio, which rules the generative organs. There we have at once the tendencies to a dis- ease, which further accentuated by the fact that Neptune in Taurus squares the Sun in Leo, and Leo has rule over the heart, and is the prime factor in circulation upon which the life of the body depends; thus the threatened illness may be set down to trouble with the blood, produced by a nervous af- fection. Puberty occurs at the time when the Moon is in the opposite quar- ter from its place at birth. She entered Scorpio, the opposite of Taurus which held her at birth, at the time when the child was nearly twelve years of age. Up to that time the little girl had been bright, but the conjunc- tion with Mars in Scorpio precipitated the period and robbed the growing child of vitality sorely needed at that time. The initial periods were few, but left her depleted of strength to withstand the square to Mercury and the opposition of the Moon to its radical place. (The radical place of a planet is its position at birth.) This affliction of Mercury, the ruler, by Moon at birth, was thus excited and insanity showed itself in consequence. As the affliction comes from fixed signs, we may judge it will be impossible to"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"overcome, and the best that can be done for the poor soul is to pray for the day of its release, that it may have a better chance in a future embodiment. [PAGE 612]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS No. 14 is the horoscope of a young man. The common sign, Gemini, is rising, the ruler, Mercury, is in the Eighth House, the house of death, and Uranus and the Moon are in opposition to Mercury. This configuration, is similar to that of No. 12, and has the same significance, namely, suicidal tendencies under nervous strain, and this augur is all the more dangerous as it comes from fixed signs. Mars and Neptune in Taurus give a desire for drink and the Sun in a watery sign accentuates this tendency. Under such circumstances the man has several times tried to end his life in a most ex- traordinary manner. Jupiter and Sagittarius, square to Saturn in Pisces, increases the looseness of his morals and makes him dishonest. He will forge and steal in order to satisfy his passion and craving for drink and questionable society. Leo on the Second House with Uranus and the Moon in close conjunction, shows that he spends what he gets in dissolute living. There is one redeeming feature in the horoscope: Venus in the Midheaven sextile to his ruler, and trine to the Moon. He has energy and artistic ability which, it is hoped, may in time rouse the better qualities and make him a man. But again we reiterate that with the affliction from fixed signs the obstacle is almost insurmountable. In conclusion the student's attention is directed to the Third and Ninth Houses, which will also have an influence on the mind. Planets therein act [PAGE 613]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES according to the intrinsic nature expressed in the key word of each.  PULMONARY DISEASES Horoscope No. 15 is the chart of a woman who, among other things, was afflicted with pulmonary trouble. Virgo is rising and Mercury, the ruler, is trine at birth, but unfortu- nately he is combust, a term which has been previously explained as the meaning that the heat of the Sun burns up the ray of any planet placed too close thereto. The disease was not congenital however, although the Moon was square to the Ascendant. But Virgo people, we have seen, are extremely fond of being sick. When once they have had a little pain, they magnify and nurse it and are loath to let it go. The square of Neptune in Aries to Uranus caused St. Vitus' dance at about the age of four years when the Moon reached the conjunction of Saturn (which is 21:15 Capricorn) and the opposi-"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"tion to Uranus. This was the beginning of her illness. She afterwards re- garded herself as an invalid and nursed sickness. Saturn in opposition to Jupiter added to the trouble by restricting the arterial circulation. At the time of puberty the Moon was in Gemini in opposition to its place at birth. This excited the above mentioned square between the radical Moon and the Ascendant; it also caused the periods to be irregular and troublesome. The blood must have an outlet and the square of Neptune to Jupiter in Can- cer, which rules the stomach, causes hemorrhages when the Moon came into [PAGE 614]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS conjunction with the Dragon's Tail in Sagittarius (the opposite sign to Gemini), and the radical square of the Ascendant and the Moon were again ex- cited. Then also the lungs became affected. In April, 1909, the progressed Moon squared the natal positions of Saturn, Jupiter, and Uranus. This in- imical force from the house of death, the Eighth, ended the life. As we feel that this cannot be reiterated too often, we repeat our in- junction to students never to let a patient know that there is any danger or that there is a crisis ahead. Particularly, please remember, PARTICULARLY, if it is a Virgo, for he has no chance at all if he knows what is coming. Horoscope No. 16 shows the natal configuration of an actress. Sagit- tarius is rising; Jupiter and the Moon are in close conjunction in Gemini, a mercurial sign, and are supported by a trine of the Sun; thus she had a most healthy constitution at birth, so far as the lung power is concerned. Mars and Mercury are also in an airy sign, giving energy to respiration and it thus seems as though this person were singularly well fortified against pul- monary trouble. But Saturn, Neptune and the Dragon's Tail in Taurus in the Sixth House, give a tendency to colds and contraction of the throat. Uranus in Virgo produces convulsive movements of the diaphragm and abdominal re- gion; he is square to Jupiter and the Moon, and thus we see how graphically the stellar script pictures the tendency to convulsive coughing and [PAGE 615]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES hemorrhages which nearly brought the young woman to an early grave when Mars, by progression, came into conjunction with the radical Sun and vivified the square to Saturn. We rejoice to say that the good aspects first mentioned enabled the young woman to weather the storm; but close at- tention to diet, regular living and above all absolute continence are re- quired to regain full physical strength, for there is much evidence to show that license played an important part in reducing the life forces and robbing her of the needed strength at the critical period.  DISEASES OF THE STOMACH"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":" Horoscope No. 17 presents a number of diseases, but all have their root in an insatiable appetite fostered by the fact that the person is a profes- sional chef. Venus in Taurus gives discrimination in food, and the sextile to Mercury in Cancer causes the mind to run in the direction of preparations wherewith to tickle the palate. But the Moon being ruler of Cancer, the rising sign, which has dominion over the stomach, shows that over-indulgences of the appetite will result disastrously. The distended stomach presses upon the heart, of which the Sun, our life-giver, is ruler. This planet is in Gemini, the sign which has dominion over the lungs, square to Mars in Pisces. Mars rules the iron in the blood and the Sun gives us oxygen, thus this square shows that the blood will lack in the life-giving element. The conjunction of the Sun with Uranus in Gemini produces spas- [PAGE 616]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS modic motion of the lungs and labored inspiration to obtain sufficient oxy- gen wherewith to supply the system; thus we have the condition called asth- ma. Saturn and Jupiter are in Virgo which rules the abdomen, square to the Sun and Uranus in Gemini, showing a lack of circulation and a tendency to ulcerous growths, and there is a general lack of nutrition in the whole sys- tem because of the great energy required to eliminate waste from the enor- mous quantities of food which this person consumes. Sad to say, however, persons in that occupation protest that they cannot help tasting, and that in spite of all ills they must eat to excess. It were wiser of course, to see another profession and train the system to moderation. In horoscope No. 18 we have the natal configurations of another chef; they are similar to those delineated in No. 17. Cancer, the sign of the stomach, is rising, with Mars and the Sun close to the Ascendant; thus the forces of this individual will be directed principally toward the stomach, and the opposition of the Moon shows disastrous results which eventually re- sulted from gratifying his ravenous appetite. The Sun is life and motion, Mars is dynamic energy, and the excessive activity centered in the stomach to take care of digestion causes this organ to be inflamed. Nature is not a jerry-builder; she builds substantially and well, or our bodies could never stand the abuse we give them as well as they do, but even the healthiest [PAGE 617]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES organism must give way in time under such dreadful strain. As indicated by the Sun and Mars, an ulcer developed from the internal heat, ate through the stomach and relieved the poor soul of its misused body. Neptune in Taurus, the sign of the palate, was of course also a contributing factor. It is not to be supposed however, that anyone who has Cancer rising or many planets in Cancer, is necessarily going to die of the disease to which that name has"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"been given, but it would be the part of wisdom to train children with such conditions to abstain from overeating, for it is a truism that more people die from overeating than from starvation.  DISEASES OF THE HEART As the heart is the seat of physical life, it natural ruler is the Sun. The solar sign is Leo. But it is a mistake to think that palpitation of the heart is necessarily shown by an affliction to the sign Leo. Indeed, there are many cases where overindulgence of the appetite indicated by the sign Cancer distends the stomach, which presses upon the heart producing what the person then believes to be heart trouble. This was the case in horoscopes Nos. 17 and 18; both believed their heart trouble to be the primal cause of the illness under which they were suffering, while in reality it was only one of the effects. But No. 3 shows a case of organic weakness of the heart. The Sun is at home in the fixed sign Leo and receives a square from Saturn the reaper; [PAGE 618]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS thus it is evident that the heart was a weak link in the constitution and would cause trouble in time, unless care was taken. Unfortunately of course, parents knew less about Astrology a generation ago than today, when the science is coming to the fore. The energy of which this horoscope is full, was allowed to spend itself unrestrained with no thought given to com- ing disaster. Venus and Jupiter, the planets ruling the venous and arterial circula- tion, are in opposition. Venus is in Gemini the sign of the lungs, and when the Sun progressed to the square of Venus' radical place, and Uranus tran- sited the Sixth House, illness began; breathing became labored as indicated by the square of the life-giver to the lungs. Uranus in opposition to his natal place in Cancer produced the convulsive movement known as the stomach cough, and thus for years this illness robbed the man of vital energy; but these afflictions passed and because of attention to right living the system has been left none the worse for the experience. Moreover, the suffering of the soul has resulted in growth that he might not otherwise have obtained. Horoscope No. 19 shows another case of heart disease. The Sun and Neptune are conjunct in the Eighth House, in opposition to Mars. As this conjunction is in the sign Gemini and in the house of death, it is easy to see the portent. The dynamic energy of Mars tears everything to pieces, ac- celerates motion, causes palpitation etc. The Sun and Neptune in Gemini [PAGE 619]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"shows a likelihood of a hemorrhage of the lungs, resulting from over activ- ity of the heart. The Moon and Saturn in Leo show the obstructed passage of the blood, for the keynote of Saturn is obstruction and retardation: thus the valves of the heart become leaky and the backward flow of the blood called regurgitation takes place. Leo also rules the spinal cord and malefic configurations there may pro- duce hunchback and kindred disabilities. Horoscope No. 20 is the figure of a beautiful boy, well formed and healthy, who became afflicted with curvature of the spine. Here we find the Moon in conjunction with the Dragon's Tail in the Twelfth House, square to Saturn and Uranus in Scorpio. At five and one half years of age the Moon had progressed to the square of its own place; this and the conjunction with Saturn and Uranus in Scorpio, brought on his affliction. After enduring eight years of torture he died, having been taken from one free dispensary to another and used by the doctors to practice on. Each doctor tried anew cure. He was plaster casts for years but to no purpose. The mothers is represented by Neptune in conjunction with Mars, careless and of dissolute habits; she was glad of the opportunity to place the boy anywhere in order to shirk the responsibility of caring for him. The boy died when the Moon had progressed to an opposition of its own place; it was also then in square to Uranus and Saturn. [PAGE 620]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS  DISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS The kidneys are ruled by Libra and Scorpio both. That is to say, the functional activity of secretion of urine comes from Libra, but the bladder and urethra through which elimination takes place are ruled by Scorpio. Re- nal stones and gravel would result from an affliction to Libra, for they are formed int he peduncle of the kidneys. These would also result from an af- fliction to Scorpio, causing faulty elimination and consequent retention of calcareous matter in the system. Diseases of the ureters are under Libra. Horoscopes Nos. 3 and 21 are examples of how the stars indicate diseases of the kidneys. In both cases Saturn is in or near an angle and square to the Sun, and in his sign of exaltation. Libra, which rules the kidneys, is also elevated. This latter point may not be apparent to beginners who look at No. 3 and find Saturn, as they would say, DOWN in the Fourth House, but the nadir of the birth place in Midheaven or Zenith of an opposite point on earth, and planets at either of these points are found to have an added power. In the two examples mentioned, Saturn, the planet of obstruction, pre-"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"vents secretion of urine but does not interfere with elimination of that which has been secreted. But in horoscope No. 8 where he is posited in the sign Scorpio square to Mercury, we have a case where the formation of gravel and renal stones is shown to result from incomplete elimination. A person [PAGE 621]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES with such a configuration ought to be extremely careful not to drink hard water, for this may cause a painful ailment. Only filtered water should be used for purposes of cooking and drinking. Sour milk, buttermilk and grape juice are great solvents. We may further to say that to boil water will not soften it, and the fur which gathers in the tea kettle where hard water has been boiled is no evidence to the contrary, for that scaly formation was ob- tained from the water which evaporated; what remains in the kettle for use is as hard as ever. In horoscope No. 7 we find Saturn in Scorpio square to Mars. Saturn pro- duces the obstruction of the blood known as hemorrhoids, and the dynamic en- ergy of Mars causes rupture of the congested places, thus we have the pain- ful bleeding well known to so many sufferers. As a secondary result constipation adds to the malady, because persons afflicted with the first named disease shrink from the added pain of the stool, and do not respond to nature's call. A prolonged rest seems to be the only physical means which is really effective. Nature however, will be very much aided by proper os- teopathic manipulations, and a diet consisting principally of milk.  ACCIDENTS TO HIPS AND ARMS Sagittarius rising, or in the Sixth or Twelfth House is responsible for broken bones and accidents. Under the chapter on the Dragon's Tail we saw how the person described in horoscope No. 6 fell upon the ice and broke her [PAGE 622]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS hip. No. 21 has even stronger indications of accidents and probably the life will end in an untoward manner. Sagittarius is rising, Saturn is ex- alted in the Midheaven exactly square to the Sun, and Neptune is elevated at the nadir also squaring the Moon; thus both luminaries are afflicted. As the Sun is lord of the house of death these auguries presage an untimely end. The only hope lies in the sextile of Jupiter to the Sun which gives hair-breadth escapes. This man's life has been jeopardized many times in railroad wrecks, automobile accidents, etc., but although he has thus been near the gate of death many times, the benefic ray of Jupiter has so far preserved his life and no bones have yet been broken. The woman described in horoscope No. 22 has not been so fortunate; her arms and legs have been accidentally broken several times, for Mars and the Moon are in Sagittarius"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"in the Twelfth House, also in opposition to Jupiter. The Sun and Mercury are in the Eighth House in opposition to Neptune and these planets are square the first mentioned positions. Saturn, her ruler, is square to Venus so that she attracts accidents and never escapes being hurt.  DISEASES OF THE LIMBS In horoscope No. 7 we find Mars in Aquarius square to Saturn, and from this affliction it is evident that there is an obstruction of the blood in the lower limbs, which produces varicose veins. Horoscope No. 17 shows Mars [PAGE 623]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES in the sign Pisces in opposition to Saturn and Jupiter. It is the nature of Saturn to obstruct, and his conjunction with Jupiter shows that the circula- tion is poor. Mars in Pisces produces heat, inflammation and swelling of the feet, because of the stagnated blood. We have already seen that the person there described is gluttonously inclined, and therefore it is no won- der that stagnation of the blood produces such painful afflictions as indi- cated by these configurations. The remedy of course if self-evident; it is moderation.

Here we find that Mercury is combust and that it is with the Sun in the Common sign, Pisces. That in itself is not a very good augur; we further find that the Moon is in conjunction with Neptune in Aries, that [PAGE 636]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS it is square to both Saturn and Jupiter, and that therefore the mind must be of a weak and unstable nature. Mars, the Moon and Neptune in Aries would be in themselves make a person erratic, but when we find, as here, that Luna is square to Jupiter, the planet of religion, also to Saturn, the planet of ob- struction and negation, it naturally causes a very evil condition. The op- position of Jupiter to Saturn shows that whatever desire for religion Jupi- ter might engender, would always be opposed by the influence of Saturn, who would counsel \"Don't, don't,\" causing the person to deride what he or she really wants to believe. It is a common experience that that which we can- not understand, appears chaotic and erratic to our minds. Neptune is the planet of fear and chaos to us, for the human race has not learned to live up to its high vibrations, and this, with the Moon, square to Uranus makes that chaotic mental state which we find in this circle. To offset this in- fluence there is the trine of Jupiter, the planet of religion, to both the Sun and Mercury; but even this influence there is the trine of Jupiter, the planet of religion, to both the Sun and Mercury; but even this influence will not be able to break the condition entirely, though there is no doubt this great redeeming power has had an effect is staving off the evil day when the mind will break down entirely. As usual, the marching orbs in their circling dance come to a point where the string of each aspect is touched which them produces the tome of either harmony or discord that im- pels us to actions which we call good or evil; so also in this case. The time marked on the clock of destiny by the hand of God was April, 1913; [PAGE 637]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES then the lunation fell in conjunction with the radical Moon in Aries. This naturally excited the radical square to Saturn and Jupiter, also their op- position, and thus the climax was precipitated; the person became violently insane. We may look for the immediate cause the precipitated that calamity to the radical position of Neptune and Uranus. These, the octaves of Mercury and Venus, in a square position will always bring the person in contact with spirits who have left the body, or who have never inhabited a body such as we have at the present time. During aspects like the above, they would have an excellent chance to use this poor person as a tool for their nefarious practices, for naturally those spirits which come under a square are not what we would call good in"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"any respect; they have no benevolent designs for helping their victim, no matter what they may profess in that direction. The question them comes: What can we do for a person in that condition? We have a good aspect to the Moon and Neptune, which is the sextile of Ve- nus.

He is sextile to Saturn, but even good aspects to Saturn are physically inimical. The sun, which is ruler of the heart, is in conjunction with the saturnine Dragon's Tail. The nerves also are affected by the square of Mars to Mercury, hence the heart is far from normally bal- anced, and the outbursts of temper which this person is apt to indulge in on the slightest provocation may cause heart failure at some time, by putting an undue strain on this organ and interfering with the already sluggish cir- culation, which is shown by the square of Jupiter to the Sun and the Dragon's Tail, also by the conjunction of Venus with Saturn, and their op- position to the Moon; Jupiter and Venus being governors respectively of the [PAGE 640]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS arterial and venous circulations. The head is particularly congested because the Sun conjunction the satur- nine Dragon's Tail occurs in Aries, the sign of the head, and Saturn, the planet of obstruction, is in Gemini, the sign of the lungs, in conjunction with Venus. This shows interference with the circulation of the venous blood in the lungs. The Moon, which governs the tidal air, is in opposi- tion, showing that an insufficient amount of air is inspired into the lungs to cleanse the blood of its poisonous carbon dioxide, and the presence of Saturn shows a hardening of the tissues, which is apt to develop into tuber- culosis. You will also notice that Jupiter, the ruler of the Ascendant, is in the Eight House square to the Sun and the saturnine Dragon's Tail in the Fourth House, and all are in Cardinal signs. This is a strong testimony of an accidental death, and Mars in the Eighth House, in the sign Leo, which rules the heart, shows that hemorrhages may be the cause which will end the physical life. If this person had been taken hold of in time and taught self-control, this serious condition could probably have been avoided; even now a frank statement concerning the great danger that undue excitement may cause, should help her govern her temper, and thus lengthen life. The Moon conjunction Antares, and opposition to Saturn shows that the eyes are in danger also, and Saturn in Gemini, which is a mercurial sign, [PAGE 641]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES shows nervous affection.

Four Common signs are on the angles, and this at once describes the nature as weak and vacillat- ing. Mercury square the Moon further accentuates this wavering and [PAGE 642]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS flightiness of her mind, and Saturn conjunction Venus and Jupiter in the Twelfth House robs life of its joy, making this woman subject to melancholy and morbid fear. This characteristic is somewhat ameliorated by the sextile of the Sun to Uranus, which fosters altruism, and the trine of Mercury to Neptune, which gives spiritual perception, thus aiding to dispel gloom by directing the mind from sorrows which are but fleeting, to the eternal verities. To sum up, she is prone to be either \"down in the dumps,\" or \"up in the air,\" and it is necessary to strive to cure her of both depression and elation, which are alike harmful. Equipoise must be cultivated to aid in attaining and maintaining health. Were Fixed signs on the angles this would be next to impossible, but with Common signs there she is more adapt- able and reachable. Regarding the ailments to which this woman is subject, we note first Uranus in high elevation, conjunction the Dragon's Tail, whose influence is saturnine, that is to say, obstructive, crystallizing, and hardening. Both are in the airy sign Gemini, which governs the lungs, and square to Saturn in the Twelfth House, which denotes confinement-in prison, hospitals or upon a sickbed.

[PAGE 645]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES This is the horoscope of our friend, James Casey, who wrote such helpful articles in the \"RAYS.\" He passed into the invisible worlds in June, 1918, and as he has no relatives connected with our society who might read this diagnosis and feel badly on that account, he gave us permission to use if for the benefit of his fellows. He was born on April 24, 1884, 2:00 P.M., in Harlem, Iowa, and became afflicted with tuberculosis while living in Den- ver, Colo., the Mecca for all who are afflicted with this disease. You will notice that Saturn, the planet of crystallization and obstruc- tion, is placed in Gemini, the sign which rules the lungs, and although Sat- urn is the highest elevated planet in the horoscope, besides being unafflicted there is always a weak spot in the anatomy where he is found. The hot, inflammatory and disruptive Mars is in Leo, the sign which governs the heart, square to the Sun, which is ruler of Leo, in the sign Taurus, which governs the throat and all the passages there. This is a configura- tion which usually produces fevers, inflammation, wounds and hemorrhages. Thus there was a tendency in the system toward tuberculosis, and you will furthermore notice that there are four Common, flexible signs on the angles, the Sixth House sign, Virgo, being on the Ascendant with the spasmodic Uranus afflicting Venus, the ruler of the venous circulation, which is placed in Gemini, the sign ruling the lungs. Uranus gives a tendency to coughs and spasms, so you see that the condition is very well outlined in the horoscope. The four common signs show that when he became subject to [PAGE 646]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS illness the Virgo nature was too weak to throw it off and he simply made up his mind that he was going to die from it, hence there was no help.

We note first that there are Cardinal signs on the angles, showing her to be active in nature. But she acts more from impulse than from reason. This characteristic is shown by the fact that the Moon is [PAGE 648]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS square to Mercury and the Sun. Naturally as both the Moon and Mercury are significators of mind, any inharmonious aspects between them are detrimen- tal. Add to this the further fact that Mercury is combust or burned up by its close proximity to the Sun, and it is very evident that we may expect to do very little with the person by reason. This does not mean that she is of evil mental disposition; she is quite the reverse, as shown by the conjunc- tion of the Moon with the planet of benevolence, Jupiter, and the trine be- tween this last named planet and Venus, the planet of love and pleasure. The trouble for which this young woman has consulted us is adenoids, which cause extreme difficulty in breathing. The condition is very clearly shown in the horoscope. When we remember that afflictions in one sign al- ways give a reflex action in the opposite, we shall readily understand that Saturn, the planet of obstruction, in conjunction with Uranus, the planet of"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"spasmodic action in the sign Scorpio, is certain to interfere with the rhythmic breath through the Taurus region comprising the throat and lower part of the head. Furthermore, Scorpio also governs the nose, as you will realize when you remember that the most prominent feature of the true Scor- pio person is a aquiline of generous dimensions. Thus an afflicted Saturn located in Scorpio, which causes an obstructed rectal region and constipa- tion, also at the same time gives a tendency to throat trouble and obstruc- tion of the nasal passages. [PAGE 649]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES In the case of this patient we find the condition aggravated by the square of the Sun and Mercury to the Moon and Jupiter. The Sun and Mercury being placed in Sagittarius are therefore active in the opposite sign Gemini, which governs the lungs, and as the Moon governs the tidal air in the lungs the square of these planets will naturally affect the breathing. Now for the remedy; it seems far-fetched to attempt to rectify an ob- struction in the throat by working on the anus. Nevertheless, Saturn, the planet of obstruction, conjoined with Uranus, the planet of spasmodic action in Scorpio, shows that at certain times the sphincter muscles of the anus are so tightly closed that it is impossible for the diaphragm to move. Un- der ordinary conditions there is an in-breathing through the anys which regulates the air pressure in the bowels, a fact that is not generally known, but when the sphincter muscles are congested by a configuration of so severe a nature as this one, this automatic regulation stops and the diaphragm is then unable to work with the necessary freedom; therefore the lungs are deprived of the necessary tidal flow of air. So, to relieve this condition an adjustable mechanical dilator should be used. It should be noted that THERE ARE TWO SPHINCTER MUSCLES to operate upon, the inside one being located just a little way inside the anus. After a few treatments of this kind the bowels should be kept open by the use of the proper laxative foods such a prunes, figs AND NOT FORGETTING  --- END OF FILE ---"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"[PAGE 650]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS COARSE WHOLE WHEAT BREAD.

ACCIDENTS TO HEAD, POOR OXYGENATION GOOD ASPECTS: Saturn sextile Jupiter, trine Mars and Uranus. BAD ASPECTS: Jupiter opposition Mars and Uranus; Moon opposition Venus; Sun and Mercury square Uranus, Mars and Jupiter. This is the horoscope of a man born on March 16, 1865, at 3 P.M., in En- gland, and it affords a good example of how accidents are also crises are shown in the horoscope. The main affliction comes from the fact that the Sun and Mercury are in close conjunction in the Eighth House, occupied by Pisces. This itself is unfortunate for the reasoning faculty. They are both square to Jupiter in Sagittarius, which also has a strong influence upon the mind. But worst of all, they are square to Mars, the planet of dy- namic energy, impulse, etc., and Uranus, the planet of lightning-like [PAGE 651]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES action, which precludes forethought.

So we see at the very first glance that we have here before us a person who [PAGE 652]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS on account of weak mentality is apt to get into trouble and accidents. But the injuries which he has received in consequence of his lack of forethought were all to the head and as the horoscope does not show any serious afflic- tion to Aries, which rules the head, except that Mars and Mercury, which rule the two hemispheres of the cerebrum, are square, what then caused these accidents, we may ask. The answer is found in the progression of the Sun, which corresponds with the time when this person was injured, the Moon also bearing its part in bringing about these accidents. In 1876, when he was eleven years of age, the Sun and Moon were both in conjunction with Neptune in the sign Aries and at that time he met with an accident which caused the first injury to his head. In 1896 the progressed Sun was in opposition to Saturn from Aries; you will notice that Saturn is retrograde so that al- though he is in the last degrees of Libra his influence is thrown backward into that sign and works as an opposition between Libra and Aries, affecting the head. The Sun was also parallel to Saturn and this is one of the most inimical influences in the whole gamut, for it destroys all vitality of the person who is under its sway for a number of years. (One of the writers can testify to this from personal experience, having felt it for ten or twelve years.) At the same time the progressed Moon was in opposition to Mars and Uranus and square to the Sun and Mercury at birth; thus there were very [PAGE 653]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES severe afflictions at that time and the poor man suffered a considerable in- jury. The third accident came in 1908, at the age of forty-three. At that time the Sun was in opposition to the Moon's radical place and the progressed Moon was in conjunction with Uranus and Mars, square to the Sun and Mercury, radix. The opposition of the Sun to the Moon occurred from Taurus, which governs the lower part of the head, where he was hurt. In consequence of these various accidents the man is now suffering from chronic headaches and he is on the verge of insanity. Various doctors have been called on for advice but no one is able to put his finger on the seat of the trouble. Consulting our ephemeris we find that during the man's lifetime Saturn will continue to retrograde further back into Libra, and that his influence in Aries is becoming stronger with every year. Saturn always causes bruises and depression; we are therefore satisfied that there must be a depression of the skull and an examination should be made to find this and have it removed.

This in itself is not a sign of good mentality. We further find that Jupiter in the mercurial sign Gemini is square to Uranus in Virgo [PAGE 655]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES 16-20 and Mars is also in the sign Virgo,; thus all the significators point to a weak and even an erratic mentality. In the last few years Mercury has, moreover, progressed past the natal places of Uranus and Mars, thus accentu- ating the trouble. A person may, however, have a weak mind and yet it may not become en- tirely unbalanced, provided there are no other malefic aspects between the natal planets or the progressed positions. The person may be constitution- ally below the stature of the normal mind, and still retain unto the last sufficient hold upon himself or herself so that it does not become an actual disease. When we look for the signs of disability in a horoscope like the present, we turn to the aspects for our information. Saturn, it appears, as in con- junction with the Dragon's Tail ( 26-10 ), and this adds to his malefic in-"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"fluence; he is further in conjunction with Neptune in 18 degrees of Taurus, and also with the fixed star Alcyone in 29 degrees of Taurus. As Saturn is the planet of obstruction and Taurus rules the throat we naturally look for some obstruction in that region, and we find that a concretion has taken place, a growth, a crystallization known as Goitre, a disease which also further bears out the indications in the former aspects which we have dis- cussed. Were it not for good aspects which we have not hitherto mentioned, namely, the sextile of Saturn to Mercury and its trine to the Moon, this person would certainly have become an inmate of an insane asylum, but this [PAGE 656]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS is one of the few cases where Saturn really helps in a material sense, for even his good aspects will obstruct when coming to the other planets; but when this obstruction is applied to the Moon, the flightiest planet of all, and to Mercury, the one next to her in swiftness and instability, both of then significators of the mind, Saturn does really help to hold the flighty mind in check, and such a weak mental condition as the one found here will be vastly benefited by these aspects, whereas if there are no evil aspects the sextile of Mercury and Saturn will strengthen the mind in a wonderful degree. As Saturn in Taurus always affects the functions of the opposite sign, Scorpio, namely elimination, it is of great importance to see that both kid- neys and bowels act freely with a person like this. Nothing but distilled water should be taken into the system on any account. As the muscles of the beck are always strained in hill and star climbing, a person with this dis- ease should be housed on a level and on the lower floor of the house. A vegetarian diet consisting of uncooked food is preferable to any other, and it is particularly necessary to get the vegetable salts which may tone the body and bring the standard of general health as high as possible; lettuce is the best single vegetable for this purpose.

Astrologically we find [PAGE 658]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS that this is due to several causes. In the first place, there are four Common signs on the angles, the Sixth House sign, Virgo, being on the Ascendant which governs the condition of the body. It is a vital point in that respect. This in itself shows his somewhat indolent nature and a tendency to give up very easily. We also find Mercury, the ruler of the Ascendant, in the Twelfth House, denoting hospitals and chronic illness; he is square to Jupiter and Uranus, which are placed in Sagittarius, the sign which governs the hips and the great sciatic nerve. The Sun, the giver of life, is also square to Uranus, the planet of irregularity, which is conjoined with Jupiter in Sagittarius. And finally, Saturn, the ruler of the bony structure and its articulations, is placed in Sagittarius in opposition to Neptune, in Gemini. All these configurations naturally tend to bring about the conditions complained of if nothing is done to prevent; but in this case, with four Common, flexible signs on the angles, with the life-giving Sun sextile to Mars, the planet of dynamic en- ergy, and with the Moon sextile to Jupiter, the planet governing the arte- rial blood, it is quite possible to obtain relief by means obtain relief by means of exercises which will remove the sluggish conditions. But we also find other weaknesses of a serious nature latent in this horoscope. Uranus is in conjunction with nebulous star Antares in Sagit- tarius 8 degrees, square to the Sun and Mercury. This implies a grave dan- ger to the sight and also to the hearing because of Mercury being in the [PAGE 659]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES Twelfth House. These conditions can certainly be overcome if the ounce of prevention is applied.

The Moon, which is the other significator of mind, square Venus, shows us that consid- erable sorrow may be expected in this life; but the conjunction of Mercury with the mystical Neptune in the Twelfth House gives her a certain degree of spiritual development, which brings much comfort through her communion with the higher worlds, compensating her for her isolation. Jupiter is the Midheaven trine to the Ascendant causes her to look upon life from a more [PAGE 660]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS hopeful angle than even people who are not at all afflicted (in comparison with her), and the strength of her hope is bound to help her in a degree be- yond human measure; for even as the person who gives way to worry  CHART #31: ASC: 2:43 GEMINI SUN: 29:20 TAURUS SATURN: 0:28 ARIES MC: 11 AQUARIUS MOON: 19:28 CAPRICORN URANUS: 25:28 LEO 11H: 9 PISCES MERCURY: 10:56 TAURUS NEPTUNE: 8:05 TAURUS 12H: 18 ARIES VENUS: 14:14 ARIES 2H: 27 GEMINI MARS: 9:00 CANCER 3H: 18 CANCER JUPITER: 7:07 AQUARIUS and melancholy is thereby made more unhappy or unhealthy, so also the person who constantly keeps an optimistic spirit is bound to gain thereby corre- spondingly in health and happiness. The Sun on the Ascendant, even though it is afflicted by a square of Uranus, is nevertheless a valuable asset in recuperation. The Sun sextile Saturn will give her a persistence, a tena- [PAGE 661]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"of life, that will not let go despite all discouragements. This woman has been deaf since she was five years of age and this dis- ability is indicated by the position of Mercury in the Twelfth House, by his conjunction with Neptune, and his square to Jupiter. This latter aspect in- dicates that it is sluggish circulation of the blood which is responsible for the disability. These aspects of Mercury also make her dumb, par- ticularly because Mercury is in Taurus, which governs the vocal organs. She has nevertheless learned to talk, showing that there is no organic disabil- ity but only a functional weakness. But these are not all of the poor woman's afflictions. You will notice that the Sun is in Taurus 29. In other words, it is in conjunction with the Pleiades, a nebular spot in the Zodiac. It is also square to Uranus and parallel to Mars. Therefore the eyes are sorely afflicted; one is almost blind, the other not much better, so that there is danger that she may lose her sight entirely. On account of her afflictions and the position in which she has been placed, this woman has been unable to get an education. Nevertheless, by persistence indicated by Saturn sextile the Sun, she has accomplished much. She writes a really beautiful letter which tells how she was in comfortable circumstances up to 1906, when the earthquake in San Francisco deprived her of her all, and still she has not given up hope. Her mental attitude, in- spired by her Sun conjunction Ascendant and sextile Saturn, is justified in [PAGE 662]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS quite a large measure. The trouble comes from Saturn, the planet of ob- struction, in Aries, the sign which governs the head, and the square of Ju- piter, the planet which governs arterial circulation, to Mercury in Taurus, the sign which governs the throat. There were also signs of malnutrition, indicated by the presence of Mars in Cancer, the sign which governs the stomach, square Venus, which governs the venous circulation. If the system could be given the proper amount and kind of food and the head and neck mas- saged with special attention to manipulations of the ears and eyes, condi- tions might be considerably relieved and further progress of deterioration stopped.

With regard to the ailments to which this person is subject, we find in the first place that Jupiter square to Mercury and Saturn, the latter being in Scorpio, which rules the rectum, gives a tendency to constipation and hemorrhoids. This configuration also interferes with the circulation of the arterial blood. His disability is further enhanced by the square of Jupiter to the Sun, the latter planet being ruler of the organ which circulates the vital fluid. But there is a great misfortune in this life, compared with which the troubles previously mentioned pale into insignificance. The Sun and Mars are in conjunction with the fixed star Antares in eight degrees of Sagit- tarius, and this configuration always brings trouble to the eyes, though it may not result in blindness from birth. In the present case the crisis came when the Sun had progressed to the opposition of Uranus, at the same time"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"striking the square to Neptune. In that year the Moon also was in conjunc- tion with Neptune in the sign Aries, which rules the head. This kindled the double fire of Mars and the Sun at birth, with the result that inflammation of the eyes made the man blind beyond hope of recovery. It may seen strange that the writers selected this horoscope for analysis, as the patient is beyond help, but if offers certain points which it will be well for the student to impress upon his mind. You will notice [PAGE 665]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES that Mars is trine to Neptune, and that the Sun is only about seven degrees from a trine to Neptune. The culmination of the latter aspect will occur before even the vital body is brought to birth. This is a very good indica- tion that THE SPIRITUAL SIGHT MAY BE AWAKENED in this person and that it will compensate, or more than compensate, for the loss of the physical fac- ulty. There is, however, as you will also note, the square of Neptune and Uranus which makes for mediumship; on that account it would be advisable for this person to be very closely on his guard during the time when the spiritual faculty is being developed, and until he is perfectly safe and balanced in the other world; and it would be a great privilege for a healer receiving such a case to aid a person stricken by the misfortune of blind- ness to cultivate the latent faculty shown by the horoscope.

Conversely, when the doctor gives up hope and makes a long face, the patient dies unless he \"GETS MAD,\" or \"SPUNKEY,\" as once happened to the writer when he was broken down from overwork. He went to a hospital to get nursing and quiet, and had to engage a regular doctor to comply with the rules. He knew that his condition would [PAGE 667]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES not change till the Moon did, and lay patiently waiting, though the case was approaching a crises, for his mind was too lethargic to set to work; HE EX- PECTED THE MOON TO DO IT ALL at the proper time. But on the day of the New Moon his doctor came in with another, and both had faces a yard long. They did not think he had another hour to live; and he laughed, but it made him \"mad,\" and he commenced to work on himself with the result that the dropsi- cal swelling which had almost reached his heart, was gone in a few hours and he was out in the sunshine getting a dose of new life. Before a month had elapsed he had not only left the hospital behind, but had written THE ROSICRUCIAN PHILOSOPHY. There is no doubt that the fluid could not have been eliminated before the change of the Moon, but the co-operation of his mental attitude was necessary to help the lunar forces, and combined with proper action it brought results. Similarly in every case, the right at- titude of the mind must be cultivated or cure is impossible. This figure shows an unfortunate person, for the mind is in a bad state. Saturn is square to the Sun, Moon and Venus. The Moon, which signifies the instinctual mind, is in opposition to the Sun and Venus, robbing life of all joy, making her pessimistic and prone to look only on the dark side. Mer- cury, the planet of reason, is square to Neptune, the planet of spiritual perception, all these testimonies tell us that nothing we may say is likely to make her cheer up. [PAGE 668]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Such a poor person is a burden to herself and her associates all through life, so they shun her while she is able to take care of herself, that is to say, while the body is in comparative health; but the afflictions which make her mentally miserable also have their effect on the body, for as we mould the lines of our face to an exact expression of our habitual mode of thought, so are also our other organs shaped and built by this force, and the evil effects show themselves as disease. The Sun, Venus and mercury in the Eighth House indicate that when sickness comes she is going to let it take its course, and will make no effort to fight for life."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":" The nature of her sickness is seen to be heart trouble, from the fact that the Sun is on the cusp of Leo, which governs the heart, in conjunction with Venus, which governs the venous circulation, and opposed by the Moon, which rules the liquids of the body. The Sun, Venus and the Moon are squared by Saturn, the planet of obstruction, and thus we see that there was a natal tendency to poor heart action and faulty elimination of liquids. In 1913 the Sun progressed to the conjunction of Uranus and Mars. The aspects of the Sun are always effective for three years, one and one-half years before the aspect is exact, and a like period after. Therefore it was still active in 1914, when the Moon progressed to the conjunction of Saturn and thus enlivened this square to the Sun, Moon and Venus. Neptune, the wa- tery planet, also reached the natal Sun by transit, and the poor soul was [PAGE 669]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES released by the total obstruction of the liquids; in other words, the drop- sical condition stopped the heart. The main effort in such cases should be to get the person to fight. If she could have been made to see that it was her gloomy outlook on life that was responsible for her sickness and that if she did not fight here and now, she would have a harder fate to face next time, it might have helped. No person who is naturally pessimistic can change over night, but he can do a whole lot to cultivate optimism if given years, and we should strive to in- culcate this attitude of mind in all, BESIDES TRYING TO BE CHEERFUL OUR- SELVES, for that is a healer's greatest asset. NO. 34.--SEX, EYE AND THROAT TROUBLE The type of mind is denoted particularly here by the square of Saturn to the Sun. This occurs from Cardinal signs, Saturn being essentially digni- fied and therefore very powerful, while the Sun is in Libra, the sign of its debility and greatest weakness. Life and joy come from the Sun, while Sat- urn gives gloom and death. Therefore we readily see that this person must be subject to gloom and melancholy. The sextile of Uranus to Mercury, the significator of mind, tells that the person is endowed with an almost un- canny lightining-like intuition, and the square of Uranus to the Moon and Venus shows that she is indiscreet and too weak for her own good. [PAGE 670]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS You will notice that this square occurs from the Fixed signs, Leo and Scor- pio, and it is therefore a condition which would be very difficult to over- come.

[PAGE 671]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES The act itself should, of course, never be condoned, but the tenderest kind- ness and the greatest effort to succor should be given to the one who is thus Aquarius. The horoscope is, as you know, the clock of destiny, and the position taken by the planets at birth give certain tendencies for life. From that natal position the planets move on to different positions with every year that passes, as the hands of a clock move around its face; thus they bring to pass events foreshown at birth. Now you will notice that the Sun is in eleven degrees of Libra in this horoscope, so at nineteen years of age the Sun entered the sign Scorpio. At twenty-two it reached the conjunction with the Moon and Venus and a couple of years later the square with Uranus was reached. During this period the unfortunate tendency spoken of developed and the seeds of disease were sown which resulted in a number of operations, both in the lower regions and in the throat, for you must remember that the opposite is always afflicted. The generative organ can never be hurt with- out in some measures it counterpart, the larynx and throat, also being af- fected. During the years which intervened between that time and 1914 the Sun had pursued its path through Scorpio, and reached the affliction of Ju- piter, which occurs from the sign Leo in 23 degrees. This square was also augmented by the fact that the Moon in its circle around the horoscope had been going through Taurus, so that was an opposition of the progressed Sun and Moon, both of them squaring the planet Jupiter at the same time. The [PAGE 672]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"Sun's square to Jupiter will for a few years be an affliction to this poor person. Uranus at birth was also on the Ascelli in Leo, the nebulous spot that is so dangerous to the eyes, and from there it squares the Moon. This, also, is another danger which faces this person, for , as you know, eye trouble is very often the accompaniment of indiscretion. Now comes the question as to what can be done for this poor person. As we have often stated, the first effort should be toward instilling hope into the mind. Persons suffering with melancholy are always centering their thoughts upon self, always seeing their own desperate position which appears to them more hopeless than that of any other. If their interest can be di- verted from self then the battle is more than half won; that should be the first consideration of the healer. A simple diet should be prescribed and no highly seasoned dishes permit- ted a person of this nature. The sextile of Uranus to the Sun and Mercury and the trine of Neptune to Jupiter shows that an appeal along the higher lines, an appeal to the better and noble nature will not meet with a rebuff and it is possible on account of these positions to elevate this person's ideas and ideals so that she may become a servant of humanity instead of driftwood upon the ocean of life. You will note that all the good aspects are from Cardinal and Fixed signs, that the Common signs are void of plan- ets, hence there is a great deal of hope. There is energy in this person, [PAGE 673]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES and when this energy has been turned in the right direction, when she has become thoroughly aroused, then the great sinner may become the great saint, and a blessing to humanity.

[PAGE 674]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS This is the horoscope of a woman born May 21, 1883, at 5 A.M., Longitude 88 West, Latitude 44, North. The student will at once note that five of the nine planets are placed in the Twelfth House, which governs sorrow, trouble, and self-undoing. This has been a characteristic feature in the life. She is a competent worker in her vocation, stenography and bookkeeping, but has, nevertheless, found herself unable to obtain employment at various times and has been at those times on the verge of starvation. This is due to the op- position of Saturn and Neptune from the Twelfth House to the Moon in the Sixth, the house of employment. Jupiter, though exalted in the Second House and sextile Venus, is unable to offset this. With respect to the mental qualities we find that Mercury is square to Uranus, and the Moon in opposition to Neptune. This makes her skeptical, critical, very peculiar and spasmodic in her mental processes, with an ex- tremely morbid imagination. Uranus is placed in the Fifth House, governing courtship and the relations among the sexes prior to marriage, and there- fore, squared to Mercury, it indicates an unconventional turn of the mind, with a tendency to promiscuous relations, involving public criticism and slander. That in itself is an extremely unfortunate configuration and con- dition in a life, but it is only one of a number of afflictions which point in the same direction, for in the Twelfth House, the house of sorrow, trouble, and self-undoing, we find Mars, the planet of dynamic energy, [PAGE 675]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES conjoined with Venus, the planet of love, in the fiery sign Aries, another inflammatory sex condition; and last, but not least, we note Neptune in Tau- rus, opposition to the Moon in Scorpio, which governs the generative organs. This latter is the worst of all for it makes the mind almost insane upon this subject, conjuring up before the imagination morbid pictures, and where the configuration occurs from the Sixth and Twelfth Houses it is a certain indication of inveterate self-abuse. Naturally such practices in time un- dermine the health and disease shows itself in the weakest parts of the body according to the indications of the horoscope. In the present case we find Saturn on the cusp of Gemini in conjunction with the Sun. Gemini is the sign which rules the lungs, and the conjunction as we see is almost exact, wanting only 26 minutes. Thus the cold, crystallizing saturnine forces are hardening the lungs and producing the disease we know as tuberculosis, which is slowly sapping her vitality and carrying her toward an early grave. It may be noted in passing that her mother succumbed to tuberculosis at the very moment when she gave birth to this child. Mars by progression has now arrived close to the place of Neptune at birth. This will unfortunately in"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"all probability accentuate the morbid craving indicated by Neptune opposi- tion to the Moon, so that if left to herself the end will not be very far off. Tuberculosis though serious is not, however, necessarily fatal if she can [PAGE 676]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS be put under restraint so that it becomes impossible for her to gratify the passion for solitary vice that saps her vitality. Thus the spells of gloom which are also resultant from the conjunction of Saturn and the Sun in the Twelfth House can be overcome if she can be given a brighter outlook upon life. Then the usual measures employed against tuberculosis may probably save her. The occult has an intense attraction for her, indicated by the exact trine of Neptune and Uranus, also by Uranus sextile to the Moon. By playing upon those strings and giving her a new interest in life it may be possible to win her away from her present morbid channels of thought. At any rate salvation from the evil configurations should always be sought through the good aspects and substituting the higher for the lower may help this poor soul out of her condition. Very little can be done physically un- til the mental condition is changed. A healer with either Libra or Aquarius rising and whose Saturn is not in Libra or Scorpio would be beneficial, but much firmness is needed here and therefore probably the Fixed sign would be preferable.

At the same time there appeared, instead of the nails, a strange horny growth on fingers and toes; this grows to a certain length or stage of development and then it begins to suppurate. This facilities the removal of [PAGE 678]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS growth and when that has been completed the suppuration ceases, but immedi- ately a new growth begins to form. Lately the jaws have also commenced to grow stiff, so that now the young man can no longer eat with comfort. The very first glance at the horoscope shows us Uranus, the planet of spasmodic action, in conjunction with the Sun, and in the sign Libra, which rules the kidneys. WE also note that Uranus is parallel with Mars, the planet of dynamic energy; this shows at once that the action of the kidneys is spasmodic and irregular so that instead of the poisons being eliminated from the body by these organs they are retained and naturally contaminate the whole system. But we also find that this patient is poisoned to a greater extend than ordinarily by a venereal disease contracted about seven to eight years ago; this is shown as a tendency in the natal horoscope by the conjunction of Venus, the planet of love, with Mars, the planet of dy- namic energy, in the Fifth House, which governs courtship and the relations of the sexes before marriage. Saturn is also there with his obstructive hand and square to Neptune, the planet which governs strange and unusual conditions. Neptune is in the sign Gemini, which rules the hands and fin- gers. About seven years ago, when the Moon was in Pisces by progression, the sign which governs the toes, it was in opposition to Venus, Mars and Saturn and square to Neptune. We base our judgment that the disease was contracted at that time on the fact that the afflicting planets are in [PAGE 679]  THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES Common or flexible signs; hence it could have been avoided much effort. As it is, the most drastic measures for purification of the blood must be adopted; the patient should be brought to California, treated with daily sun-baths to facilitate copious perspiration, and given nothing but water and fruit juices until the system has been cleansed.  PLANETARY HOURS Measures for the alleviation of pain and disease cannot always be de- ferred to a propitious time, but where that is possible the student will find that remedial treatments given under the propitious planetary rays are much more efficient and successful than when applied haphazard. Therefore"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"the following hints may be found valuable. Surgeons who have watched and tabulated these matters inform us that the operations performed while the Moon is increasing in light (see Page 521) are generally more successful, less liable to cause complications and more quickly healed than operations performed with the Moon is decreasing in light. When a surgical operations seems unavoidable consult the ephemeris and if the Moon is going through the sign which rules that part of the body where the operation is to be performed defer it for a day to two till the Moon gets well into the next sign. This will minimize the danger of complica- tions, and not infrequently the symptoms change so that operation is avoided. [PAGE 680]  THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS Always look to the benefics and the good aspects in a horoscope for di- rections concerning how and when to treat. Suppose the Sun, the giver of life, is square to Saturn, the planet of stagnation and death. The tendency is to rob the person of vitality and if he is taken ill recuperation will be very slow. Then, to give the most effective and energizing treatment apply the principle of the day and hour rulers as given in our SIMPLIFIED SCIEN- TIFIC ASTROLOGY; choose the Sun's day (Sunday) and the hours ruled by the Sun on any day. Treatments on Mars' day (Tuesday) and the hours ruled by Mars on any day, will also build up wonderfully. Similarly with the other planets, their virtues and power is greatest during the days ruled by them. But the so-called malefics also have their virtues. Poultices intended to draw suppuration from a wound, or bring a boil to a head are most effica- cious on the hot and inflammatory Mars' day (Tuesday), or in the hours of Mars on any day, but applications made to disperse a swelling are most suc- cessful when applied on the day of Saturn, the planet of suppression, or in his hours on any day. Treatments received on the day and in the hours of the planets which are well aspected in the patient's horoscope are always more powerful and ben- eficial than they would be if given in the hours and on the days ruled by planets afflicted when he was born.
