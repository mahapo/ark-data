Secondly, having considered the Lord of the Ascendant, see how many degrees the Moon is also distant from any Infortune, or from the Lords of the 6th or 8th, and in what Signe or Signes, their Nature, Quality and House wherein they are posited.. Thirdly, consider if there be an Infortune in the Ascendant, how many degr ees the Cusp of the house wants of that degree the unfortunate Planet is in, or if the unfor tunating Planet be in the 7th, how many degrees the Ascendant wants of his true Opposition, and compute the time of Death, Sicknesses or Misfortune according to the dimension of degrees in Signes moveable, common, or fixed.. If you find the Lord of the Ascendant afflicted most of all by the L ord of the 6th, and in the 6th, or if the Lord of the Ascendant comes to Combustion in the 6th, you may judg e the Querent will have very many and tedious sicknesses, which will scarce leave him till his death; and the more certain your judgment will be, if the Lord of the Ascendant, and the Lor d of the 8th and the Moon be all placed in the 6th.

The Lord of the Ascendant is Sun, who being neer the Cuspe of the 9th house,(signifying long journeys) and the signe thereof Moveable; I intimated he was resolving sodainly upon a Journe y South-East, or to those parts of the World which lye from London South-East: South, because the quarter of Heaven wherein the Lord of the Ascendant is in, is South: East, because the Si gne where Sun is in is East (this be confessed:) And as the Sun was but 2 degrees 10 min. distant from the cusp of the 9th, he went away within two months; for Sun was 4:18 Aries.

Because Sun had already been in Square of Saturn, who is Significator of the Querent’s Wi fe, I told him I feared his Wife and he had lately been at great variance; and because Satur n her Significator did dispose of his Part of Fortune, I judged she had no mind he should have any of her estate, or manage it, but kept it to her own use; for Saturn is Retrograde, a superior P lanet, and in a fiery signe, and that signe of the 7th is Fixed; these show her a Virago, or galla nt spirited woman, and not willing to be curbed, or else to submit: (This was confessed.) [IT WAS THE LORD COVENTRY.] Lastly, because Sun was lately in Sextile with Jupiter and Jupiter was in the 10th; I told him, either some great Lawyer or Courtier had endeavoured to reconcile the differences betwixt them; and forasmuch as both the Sun who was his Significator, and Saturn who was hers, did now both apply to a Trine aspect, there seemed to be at present a willingnesse in both parties to be reconciled; nor did I see any great obstruction in the matter, except Mercury who is i n Square aspect with Saturn, did impedite it; I judged Mercury in the general, to signifie ei ther some attorney, or lawyer, or writings; but as he is Lord of the Querent’s 2nd, it might be becaus e the Querent would not consent to give or allow such a summe of money as might be demanded, or that the Querents purse was to weak, he had not wherewithall to solicite his cause lust ily; or as Mercury is Lord of the 11th house, some pretended friend would impedite her, or advise the contrary, or some of her Lawyers; or as the 11th is in the 5th from the 7th, a child of the Querent’s wife might be occasion of continuing the breach.

Thirdly, subtract the place of the Sun from the Moon, by adding 12 Signes t o the Moon if you cannot do it otherwise; what remains, reserve and add to the Signe and degrees of the Ascendant; if both added together make more than 12 Signes, cast away 12, and what Signes, degrees and minutes remain, let your Part of Fortune be there: For example in our prese nt Figure: The Moon is in 21:18 of Virgo, or after 5 Signes, in 21 degrees 18 minutes Virgo.

A Woman being at my House in the country, demanded if her Sonne were with his Master, or at her owne House. In this Figure Venus is Lady of the Ascendant, and shall signifie her that asked the Ques tion; the matter quesited after must be required from that house which signifies Children, and t hat is the 5th: I considered Jupiter who is Lord of the Signe Pisces, for Pisces is the house of Jupite r, and I found Jupiter, the Youths Significator, in the Angle of the East, or Ascendant; one argument, t hat the Party sought after was at home at his Mother’s house at time of the Question: I obs erved further, that the Moon did apply to a Sextile Dexter of Saturn, Lord of the 4th, which signifie s the house or dwelling place of the Querent; from which two testimonies, I judged the Youth wa s at his Mothers, and that she should find him there at her comming home, as indeed she did: now had I found Jupiter, Lord of the 5th, in the 10th, because that is the house which signifies the Master, or had the Moon separated from Jupiter, Significator of the youth, and presently applied to a good or indifferent aspect of the Sun, and she, viz. Moon been in an Angle, I would have adjudged him at his Master’s house, &c.

Had this Woman enquired, if she should have found a Neighbor or Brother or Sister at home, or not; You must have taken signification from Jupiter, who is Lord of the 3rd house; for you may see in the signification of the houses, pag.52, that the 3rd house signifies Brethern, Sisters, Ki ndred and Neighbors; you might safely have adjudged, she should have found any one of these at home, because Jupiter their Significator is in an Angle, But if she had enquired, whether she should have found a Party at home, yea or not, to whom she had no relation, but as to a stranger; then Mars the Lord of the 7th; had been his Significator, whom I find to be in the Signe of Sagittarius, and in the 2nd house of Heaven, for wanting more than 5 degrees of the Cusp of the 3rd, he is not admitted to have signification in that house. In the first place therefore, I find Mars in the 2nd house, and in a Northerne quarter of Heaven, (for t he Cusp of the 4th house to the Cusp of the 5th, or Ascendant, is so, as you may see pag. 48) next I find Mars, who is Significator of the Party with whom she would speak with, is in Sagitt arius, which is an Easterly Signe, (as you may see pag. 97.)

CHAPTER XXVI. Of a Ship, and Whatever are in Her, Her Safety or Destruction. The Ancients do put this question to those concerning the 9th house, and I conceive for no other reason, than because it must be granted, that all Ships are made for travel and journeys: however, in regard the most part of the judgment concerning its safety or ruin is derived f rom the Ascendant and his Lord, and the Moon, I thought fit to place this judgment as belonging to the 1st house. Generally, the Signe ascending and the Moon are Significators of the Ship, and what goods ar e in her: if in the question demanded you find all these unfortunate, that is, if a malevolent Plane t by position be placed in the Ascendant, he having dignities in the 8th; or if you find the Lord of the Ascendant in the 8th, in any configuration with the Lord of the 8th, 12th, 4th or 6th, or the Moon combust, or under the earth, you may judge the Ship is lost, and the men drowned, (unless you find reception betwixt themselves) for then the Ship was casually Shipwrecked, and som e of the sea men did escape: but if you find the preceding Significators all of them free from misfortune, both men and goods are all safe; the more safe if any reception be. But if the Ascendant and t he Moon be infortunate, and the Lord of the Ascendant fortunate, the Ships like to be drowned, but the men will be saved: Some for better knowledge and discovery of what part of the Ship was like to be freest from danger, have divided the several parts of the Ship, and have assigned to every of the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Compliments of http://mithras93.tripod.com 158 The Resolution of twelve Signes, a part or place of the Ship, by which if any damage was to come to the Ship, they could or might better prevent it.

If the unfortunate Signes (viz. those which are afflicted by the pre sence of Saturn or South Node) be those which signifie the bottome or that part of the Ship which is under Water, it’s an argument of the breaking and drowning thereof, or receiving some dangerous Leak: if the Signes so unfortunate be in the Midheaven, and Mars unfortunating them, it’s like t he Ship will be burned by fire, thunder or lightning, or matter falling out of the Aire into the Ship; this shall then take place when the Signes are Fiery, and near violent fixed Stars.

In December 1644, a Merchant in London having sent out a Ship to the coast of Spaine for Trade, had severall times newes that his Ship was lost or cast away, there having been a little before very Tempestuous weather, in so much that many Shipps were sunk a nd Shipwrackt; he would have given 60 in the hundred for the assurance of her; but so generall w as the report of her losse, that none of the Ensurance company would meddle, no not upon any termes. A Friend of the Merchants propounds the Question unto me, What I thought of the Ship, if sunk or living? whereupon I erected the Figure preceding, and having well considered what was requisite in this manner of Judgment, I gave my Opinion. That the Ship was not lost, but did l ive, and though of late in some danger, yet was now recovered.. My Judgment was grounded upon the Considerations in Art following.. In the first place, the Ascendant being the 11 degree and 33 minute of C ancer, showed the Bulk or Body of the Ship; there doth also ascend with these degrees of Canc er 3 Fixed Starres in our Horizon, wholly almost of the nature of Saturn: I find Saturn castest his Square Sinister out of the 11th house, but from a Cardinall Signe to, or very neer the Cusp of the ascending degrees, thereby afflicting it: after his Square aspect, I found the Moon in her Exaltation, casting a Sextile Sinister to the degree ascending, interposing her Sextile betwixt the Ascendant and the Opposition of Mercury and Sun in the 7th, which otherwise had been dangerous, for all opposite aspects to the Ascendant in this Judgment are dangerous."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Compliments of http://mithras93.tripod.com 163 all manner of QUESTIONS.. From the Ascendants affliction both by the Square of Saturn, and presence of fixed Stars of his like nature, I judged the Ship was much of the nature of Saturn, viz. a slug gish, heavy one, and of no good speed, or very sound; and Cancer being a weakly Signe, made me judge the condition, building and quality of the Ship was such; (and it was so confessed.) From hence, and for that South Node is in the 9th house, I judged the Ship had be en in some affliction or distresse in her journey, occasioned from such casualti es as are signified by Saturn, viz. had received some such casualties as are signified by Saturn, viz. had received some bruise, leak, dammage in or neer her Brest; because Aries, the Signe whe rein Saturn is, represents that part, thereby afflicting it. But in regard the Moon, who is Lady of the Ascendant, is posited in the 11t h house, and in her Exaltation, is no manner of way impedited, but by a benevolent aspect appl ying to a Trine of Mercury and Sun, and is by bodily presence so neer unto Jupiter, and all the Significators above the Earth, (a thing very considerable in this Judgment.) Besides, I observed no Infortunes in Angles, which was one other good argume nt; for these considerations, I judged the Ship was not cast away, but living, and that the Saylors and Officers of the Ship were lively and in good condition. The next quere was, Where the Ship was, upon what Coast, and when any newe s would come of her? Herein I considered the Moon was fixed, and locally in the 11th house; Taurus is a Southerne Signe, but in an East quarter of Heaven, verging towards the South: her application to a Trine of Mercury, and he in Capricorn, a South Signe and West Angle, made me judge the Ship was South-west from London, and upon our own Coast, or neer those which lye betwixt Ireland and Wales; I judged her at that time to be in some Harbor, because Taurus wherein the Moon is, i s fixed, and in the 11th house, which is the house of Comfort and Relief; and that she was put into some Harbor to mend her Defects or Rents:(It proved true that she was in the West, and in a n Harbor.)

It’s first necessary for more exact judgments in this question, that you examine the Diurnall motion of the Planets, which I finde here to be as followeth: Viz. Saturn moveth in 24 houres, 2 minutes: and is therfore slow in motion. Jupiter 13 min. Ergo, he moveth more in 24 houres, than his middle or meane motion: which is 4 min. 59 sec. is reputed swift, as you may see fol. 61.

Herein first I considered the generall disposition of the Planets, and found that the Major number of them (especially the 2 Fortunes) were swift in their motion, w ell posited in houses, no manner of wayes in a violent way, or by a forcible aspect afflicting e ach other.. I also well considered that Venus Lady of the Ascendant. was neer to Cor Leonis, a Star of great vertue and influence, the Moon increasing in light, Jupiter almost culminating: From hence I collected thus much in generall, that he should subsist in the Common-wealth, and live in good ranke and quality among his Neighbours, etc..

In resolving this Question, I cons idered, that the Lord of the 2nd is posited in the Angle of the East, and that the Lord of the 2nd, viz.. Mars is Lord of the Part of Fortune or Dispositor thereof, and is neere Spica Virgo in 18 degrees of Libra..

Lastly, I considere d that Part of Fortune was in a fixed sign and in Mars his own termes: from all which testimonies aforesaid, I judged that the Demandant would aquire an Estate, and have a competent fut ure in this world, but attaine it with labour and care, because it is signified by an Infortune; so to the day hereof he hath; but because Mars Lord of the 7th (which is the house of Women and Wi ves) hath the most materiall signification of the thing demanded, viz.. Wealth and Riches . I advized to marry, and acquainted him, that without Marriage he should nothing so well subsist. By what Meanes, or how attaine Riches. Herein you must consider the Planet or Planets promising Wealth; M ars in our Scheame being Lord of the 2nd house and of Part Of Fortune is the Planet we must princ ipally consider; for in the 2nd house you finde no Planet, as he is Lord of the 2nd and placed in the As cendant, he intimates an estate to be got by the Querents owne industry, and beca use the Significator of the thing demanded is posited in the Ascendant, it argues that an estate or increase thereof would come somewhat easily or with lesse labor then expected, but Mars being an Infortune something lessens that point in our positure at this time; and as Mars is L ord of the 7th house, and thereby signifieth (Women, etc.) I acquainted him he would marry a Woman who w ould produce him a good fortune, and it fixed, and more then he could very well looke for; which I judged first by the Lord of the 7th his being in the Ascendant.. and neer so eminent a fix ed Starre; as also because Venus who is Lady of the wives house of substance , viz. the 8th, is so well"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Compliments of http://mithras93.tripod.com 183 all manner of QUESTIONS.. fortified.. I afterwards considered the Moon was Lady of the 10th house ( which signified his Trade) that she was transferring the light and nature of Mercury and Mars to the Querent; wherefore I advised him to diligence in his profession, and that he should thereby attaine a very good or competent Estate.. He hath, as he informs me, had a good fortune wi th he Wife, both Money and Land; and for his Trading it has been very good; for Jupiter in the 10th is a certaine and infallible argument (according to naturall causes) that the Que rent shall have plenty of trading, or exercise a gainfull Profession.. The Time When. All the Significators either in the Ascendant, or Orientall quart er of Heaven, and 5 of the Planets swift in their motion, promise Substance in a small compasse of ti me, after the proposall of the Question.. Mars Lord of the 2nd house, and of Part Of Fortune, the principall thing inquired of, being swift in motion argues the same.. The distance of the Ascendant. from Mars being about 2 degrees, did in t his way of judgment signifie 2 yeers or there-abouts, as what time he had a Portion wi th his Wife: Some may wonder why Mars being peregrine shall signifie any good to the Querent. I say to that, he being Lord of the 2nd house and of the 7th, and the promising Planet of the thing demanded, shal l as well shew the time When, as also the performance of what he signifies, (but not without some manner of obstruction;) and herein no question ought to be made, as in civill societies of me n, the wicked or ungracious doe as well many good offices of love for their Friends, as others better qualified..

Retrograde, Combust, Cadent, then observe if Reception intervene; which if therebe, it signifies the perfection of the matter, though with weariness e and much solicitation: If no reception be, the matter will come to nothing, though there have been much probability of its performance.

Consider in what condition the Lord of the 3rd is in, and in what house, and how t he Planets do aspect him, and whether he be in the aspect of the good or evill Planet s, and what that aspect is they have to each other, or whether they are in Corporall Conjunction; for if the Lord of the 3rd be in the 3rd and the unfortunate Planets have no Square or Opposition aspect unto him, you may judge the Brother is in health; but if the malignant Planets behold hi m with a Square or Opposition, without reception, you may say, the Brother lives, is in healt h, but he is in great perplexity, discontent and sorrow; but if they behold him with the afores aid aspects, and be in reception, you may say, the Brother is in great distresse, but wil l with ease evade it, and free himselfe from his present sad condition: but if the Fortunate Planets behold him with a Sextile or Trine aspect, without reception, or with a Square or Opposition with rec eption, you may Judge the Brother is in good health and is well content to stay in the plac e where he then is: if the fortunate Planets behold him with Sextile or Trine and with recepti on, you may tell the Querent his Brother is in health, and wants nothing in this world to make him happy : but if the Lord of the 3rd be in the 4th, which is his own 2nd house, without the aspect of the ma lignant Planets, he endeavours to get an Estate or fortune in that country wherein he is a t the time of the erecting the Scheame; but if the Lord of the 3rd be in the 5th house, and is joyned with the Lord of the 5th house, with reception of a Fortune or not, as long as the Lord of the 5th house is not impedited in any grievous manner, it’s an argument the absent brother is in health, is jocund and merry, and well liketh the conversation of the men of that Country wherein he is: if he be a Fortune with whom the Significator of the Brother is in Conjunction with, or in Sext ile or Trine with reception, you may then more safely pronounce the Brother to be in a good condition;"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Compliments of http://mithras93.tripod.com 190 The Resolution of yet if the Lord of the 3rd be in the 5th voyd of course, or in perfect Conj unction with any of the infortunate Planets, without reception, and those unfortunate Planets be the mselves impedited, it’s an argument the absent Brother is indisposed in health, crazy a nd not contented in the place where he is: if you find the Brother’s Significator in other houses which are not naturally ill (as the 6th, 8th and 12th houses are) then he is not well placed, but yet no hurt will come of it. If the Brother’s Significator be found in the 8th house, and is either c orporally or by Sextile or Trine aspect joyned to a Fortune, you may judge the Brother is not very well, yet not so ill, that he need any thing doubt of his well being; however, he is indisposed. If he be joyned to evill Planets by bad aspects, and out of the 6th house, t he absent Brother is infirme; the same you may judge if the Lord of the 6th be in the 3rd, unless he have dignities in the Signe, and be in those dignities.. If you find the Brother of the Querent to be ill, see if the Lord of the 3rd be in Conjunction with the Lord of the 8th, or is entering Combustion, it’s likely then he will dye of that infirmity; but if you find his Significator in the 7th, say, he is in the same Country i n which he went, and not yet gone out of it, he continues there as a Stranger or Sojourner, is neither well or ill, but so-s o. If the Significator be in the 8th, he doubts himself that he shall dye ; and the more dubious he is, if his Significator be either combust, or in conjunction with the Lord of the 8th in the 8th, or in aspect by Square or Opposition of the Infortunes out of the 8th. If the Significator be in the 9th, then is he gone from the place to which he first went into a further Country, or if capable, he is entered into some religious Orde r, or is imployed by those that are in Order, viz.. Religious Men, or possibly according to his qual ity, is imployed in some journey far distant from his former aboad. If his Significator be in the 10th, and joyned by the Conjunction or in aspec t with the fortunes by Trine or Sextile aspect, especially with reception, he hath then got some imployme nt,"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Compliments of http://mithras93.tripod.com 191 all manner of QUESTIONS.

If he be in the 11th House, joyned to the Fortunes by any good aspect; or if he be in Conjunction with the Lord of the 11th; he is then safe at the house of a friend, and is pleasant and merry: but if evill Planets afflict him in that House, or cast their m alevolent beames unto him; then is he malecontented, and not well pleased with his present condition. If he be in the 12th House, joyned to the Fortunes with reception, and that or those Fortunes not impedited; he then trucks for Horses, or great Cattle, is turned Gr asier, or is Master of a Horse, an Hostler, a Drover of Cattle, or one that drives Cattle to Marke t, according to the quality of the person inquired about. If he be unfortunate in the 12th, or in bad aspect with the infortunes, or in aspect with the Lord of the 8th, or Combust; the man is discontent, and doubts he shall never see his Country againe; and well he may, for its probable he will dye there. If he be in the 1st, the absent Brother is frolicke and merry, and ex treame well pleased where he is; and they much love and respect him where he is. If he be in the 2nd, it’s probable the man can by no means come away; e ither he is detained as prisoner, or hath done some such act as that he is not capable of coming away; yet if the Significator be Retrograde, he will make hard shift to escape when ever opportunity is offered. I have been somewhat more tedious in this judgment, because it is as a Key to all the rest: For if any ask of their Father being absent, let the 4th house be the Ascendant of him, and so run around the 12 houses in your judgment for the Father as you have done for the B rother, ever having this Consideration, that the 2nd House from the Ascendant of your Ques tion, is the substance of the Quesited; the 3rd from that shall signifie his Brethern; "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Compliments of http://mithras93.tripod.com 192 The Resolution of the 4th his Father: If inquiry be made for a Childe, or Sonne, or Daughte r absent, the 5th house is their Ascendant; the 6th their 2nd House, then the 7th their 3rd, &c.

After all this, have respect to the Planet who is recei ver of the Disposition of the Significators; who if he be clear from misfortune or affliction, viz. from Retrogradation, Combustion, or Cadency in House, it gives great hopes of issue.. See als o if that Planet from whom the Moon is separated the Lord of the 5th Signe from the Signe whe rein the Planet is to whom the Moon applies, and both these Planets have any aspects to each oth er; that also doth testify the party shall have Children or a Childe. If no aspect happe n betwixt them, it’s not then likely he will have any; and yet some say, that is the above named Planets or Significators be not in any Aspect, yet if the Planet to whom the Moon Applies be in an Ang le, the Querent may have Issue. If a Woman aske, whether she may conceive? Many times a Woman married, having been long without Children, may inquir e, whether she is like to Conceive, yea or no? In this Question you are to consider: If the Lord of the Ascendant be in the 7th, or the Lord of the 5th in the 1s t, or the Lord of the 1st in the 5th, or if the Lord of the 5th be in the 7th, or the Lord of the 7th in the 5th, or the Moon with him, or good Planets in the Ascendant, or with the Lord of the 5th, or in any of the Angles; she may then conceive: but if none of these testimonies concurre, and you find barren Signes and i ll Planets to be in the former places, she neither is at present conceived, or will therea fter conceive. If good and bad Planets be mixed together, she may perhaps conceive or have Children, but they will not live: If Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces be in the Ascendant or 5th, she may have Chil dren; but if Leo or Virgo be there, she neither is at present, or hardly after will be wit h Child. When women have been long without Children, and propound such a Question, see if their Nativity did not originally deny Children.. At what time, or how long it may be before she have a Childe?

And herein you must be carefull in considering what Signe the Lord of the 5th house is in; for the Swiftnesse of a Planet in a moveable Signe doth somewhat hasten the time; a double bodie d Signe doth not manifest so soon; fixed Signes prolong the matter; however, this is worthy of your consideration, that let the Significator be in what Signe he will be, yet if he be swift in motion and direct, he doth make the more haste in performance of the businesse he is a Sig nificator in, and causeth the matter sooner to be accomplished.. Whether the Querent shall have Children, be he Man or Woman that asketh? Behold the Ascendant, and if fortunate Planets behold the same, and the Lor d thereof be in the Ascendant, or in the 10th, 11th or 5th house, and you finde Jupiter also well plac ed together with that Planet who is Lord of the Triplicity ascending, and he be not Combus t or Retrograde; judge then, if the Man aske the Question, he may have Children, or is capable of getting them.

MOON IN SAGITTARIUS (CONJUNCT – SQUARE – OPPOSITION) SATURN Saturn afflicting the Moon, the diseased party is sensibly oppressed with Deflux of subtill, thin sharp Humours, griefes in the Arteries or Joynts, feare of a Fea ver, extremeties of heat and cold, many times a double accesse of a Feaver. What mitigates heat gently, and moystens, is good for such people as fall sick under this aspect. I find by experience, that the Moon in Sagittarius, afflicted by a Conjunction of Saturn, doth cause the Disease to proceed from Blood infected with choller and me lancholly, and many times by too great paines-taking, or violent exercise, and cold thereupon taken. U pon the Opposition of the Moon and Saturn, for the most part the sick has a spice of the Gout, or some Tumour or Swelling in the Hands, or Thighes, or Feet &c. If Mars have any il l aspect to the Moon as well as Saturn at time of first falling sick, it proves a violent burning Feaver. MOON IN CAPRICORN (CONJUNCT – SQUARE – OPPOSITION) SATURN The Disease proceeds from Cold and Melancholly, with subtill, thin Dis tillations, heavinesse of the Brest and Stomack, difficulty of breathing, dry Coughs, the Lungs oppre ssed, intended Feavers, more pained in the night then in the day-time.

An hot thirsty mouth, extreme thirst, drynesse of the tongue, hot Liver or inflamation thereof, much heat in the Brest, high and sublated Pulses, keeping no order, a Phrensie may be feared, or deprivation of Senses: letting of Blood and such things as do coole and nourish are very helpfull."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Compliments of http://mithras93.tripod.com 278 The Resolution of If the Moon next after her separation from the Malevolent beames or aspect of Mars doe apply to Conjunct or Opposition of Saturn, and she decreasing in light and slow in mot ion, there’s small hopes of life; let the sicke prepare for God.

The Lord of the Ascendant in his Fall, unfortunate or Combust, or else the Lord of the Figure, it’s doubtfull the sick party will dye of that Infirmity. 16. When the Significator of the sick is feeble, and the Lord of the 8th strong and afflicting him, it’s much feared the sick party will dye of his then infirmnesse, nature being we ak, and the Disease prevalent. 17. If the Lord of the Ascendant be placed in the 8th, and received of the Lord of the 8th by some essentiall Dignity, though the Lord of the Ascendant receive not him againe, the sick party recovers beyond expectation. 18.. The Physitian may justly feare his Patient, when the Lord of the Ascendant and the Moon do both apply by ill aspect to a Planet under the Earth; the contrary is to be expected, if they apply to a Planet above the Earth. The 12th, 11th, 9th, 8th, 7th houses are above the Earth, the rest under. 19.

Or C R Y S I S is no more then this, viz. A sudden alteration of man’s body when he is sick, tending either to health or further sicknesse; for when this Crysis is, t here’s a sharp fight, as it were, betwixt nature and the Disease, whether of them shall overcome. Dayes Criticall, Decretory and Chrysmall are all one, and inte nd no more then a certaine and more sure judgment of the infirmity afflicting, either more power fully, or in a lesse measure at those times when the true Crysis is. The true Crysis is best of all taken from the moment of time w hen first the sicknesse invaded the Infirme; which if it cannot be had, then it may be taken (but not so ce rtainly) from the very hour when first the Water is brought to the Doctor to advise for recovery : but if no Urine come, then when the Doctor first speaks with the sick party, and is demanded by t he Infirmed what he thinks of his sicknesse, and what course he would advise for cure thereof. Every sudden and vehement motion of the Disease may be called a Crys is as Galen saith; or it is, not a locall motion altogether, but an alteration of the Disease. Or Crysis imports judgment in the Disease afflicting, and which way it will terminate, viz. for good or evil.. Hypocrates will have Crysis to be an acute or swift reportation in Diseases, either to recovery or death: But, say some, in regard there are more Diseases to ter minate in health then in death (except pestilentiall Diseases) where the matter and cause is so malignant and poysonous, that nature many times doth not attend a fight or combat with the Diseas e, whereby it cannot properly be called a Crysis; the definition of the Hypocrates will not we ll hold, unlesse it be in such Diseases as doe determine in a recovery of the sick party: So some say.

I judged from hence that the Servant went westward at his first departing, and that at the time of the Question, he was West from the Querent’s house; and this I judged because Mars was angular, and every way as strong as the Moon, otherwayes I should have j udged by the Moon: Forasmuch as Mars the Significator of the Servant, and Mercury Lor d of the ascendant, were suddenly hastening to a Trine out of angles, I judged, that within a day or two he should have his Servant againe: I found the Moon in the 2nd, in her owne house; the Servant bei ng a part of his Master’s Estate, I judged from hence also, that the Master should not lose, but recover forthwith his lost Goods; and the rather, for that the Moon was in the 2nd, and in perf ect Trine of the Sun in the 11th, both of them in the Mediety ascending: the"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Compliments of http://mithras93.tripod.com 392 The Resolution of neernesse of Mars to the degree ascending, made me judge the Serva nt was not above three or four houses Westward from his Masters house.

The Signe of Gemini is West and by South, the quarter of heaven is We st; Mercury the Significator of the Dog, is in Libra a Westerne Signe but Southerne quarter of heaven, tending to the West; the Moon is in Virgo, a South-west Signe, and verging to the Westerne angle: the strength of the testimonies examined, I found the plurality to signif ie the West, and therefore I judged, that the Dog ought to be Westward from the place where the Ow ner lived, which was at Temple-barre, wherefore I judged that the Dog was about Long-acre, or upper part of Drury- lane: In regard that Mercury Significator of the Beast, was i n a Signe of the same Triplicity that Gemini his ascendant is, which signifies London, and did apply to a Trine of the Cusp of the 6th house, I judged the Dog was not out of the lines of Communication, but in the same quarter; of which I was more confirmed by Sun and Saturn their Trine, The Signe w herein Mercury is in, is Libra, an ayery Signe, I judged the Dog was in some chamber or upper room, kept privately, or in great secrecy: because Moon was under the Beames of the Sun, and Mercury, Moon and Sun were in the 8th house, but because the Sun on Monday following did apply by Tri ne Dexter to Saturn Lord of the ascendant, and Moon to Sextile of Mars, having exalta tion in the ascendant; I intimated, that in my opinion he should have his Dog againe, or newes of his Dog or small Beast upon Monday following, or neer that time; which was true; for a Gentle man of the Querent’s acquaintance, sent home the Dog the very same day about ten in the morni ng, who by accident comming to see a Friend in Long-acre, found the Dog chained up under a tabl e, and knowing the Dog to be the"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Compliments of http://mithras93.tripod.com 394 The Resolution of Querent’s, sent him home, as abovesaid, to my very great credit.

Having thoroughly considered all partic ulars, and well weighed that Saturn Lord of the 4th, signifying the Governour, was in his Fall with South Node, and that Mercury and Jupiter were not farre from South Node, and that M ars did with his Square aspect behold Saturn, I said and sent somebody word, the most assured way, & which would certainly occasion the surrender of the Towne, was, to set division am ongst the principall Officers, and to incense them against their Officer in Chiefe, & that about 8 dayes from the time of the Question, I beleeved his Excellency would be Master of the Tow ne, yet rather by composition than blood, because Sun and Mars were separated from the Square dexter of Saturn from Cardinal Signes; as also, because the application of the Moon wa s so directly to the Sextile of the Lord of the Ascendant, without any frustration or prohibition.

In this case I should have judged the Defendant a man of good estate, or able to spend well, because Venus Lady of the 8th, viz his 2nd, is in Exaltation; and yet the Sun and Mars in Sextile, might give strong testimonies that the Judge would labour to compound the m atter betwixt both parties; the Dispositor of the Part of Fortune in his Fall, viz.

It’s a received, generall Rule amongst those Artists that know t he Cabalisticall Key of Astrologie, that if one Planet be Lord of the ascendant and 12th house, that then the Sicknesse is more then naturall: when Saturn is Lord of the ascendant and 12th, and in the 12th R etrograde, or in the 7th or 8th house in the same condition, and the Moon being Lady of the 6th, apply to Saturn, we constantly judge the party enquiring is Bewitched or Fore spoken, or that an evill Spirit hath power over him, and that the Infirm will be sore oppressed and disturbed in his Fancy, if not distracted.

If the Lord of the ascendant be infortunate, as aforesaid, by the Lord of the 5th, it’s some Ale- wife, Nurse, or some drunken companion that occasions it, or hath procured this Witchery. If the Lord of the 10th afflict the Lord of the ascendant in the 12th, it ’s doubtlesse the hand of God, or by some supernaturall power or cause. If the Lord of the ascendant be an unfortunate Planet, as Mars or Sat urn, and be in the 12th house, Combust and infortunated by the Lord of the 12th, it imports the man is bewitched by a common Witch.. If the Lord of the 12th be in the ascendant it argues Witchcraft, or that some evill Spirit doth molest the party, or that some that are neer him or about him have e vill tongues, or in plaine tearmes, have bewitched him. In places where people are troubled with Witches, as in many places of this Kingdome they are, these Rules will hold: as also, if the Moon be in the 12th, in Opposition t o the Lord of the ascendant or 12th.

It is very true, some of the Ancients have Winter and Summer, made the day and night to consist of equall hours, I mean every hour to consist of sixty minutes equally; but Astrologians doe not so, but follow this method, viz. according to the motion of the Sun both Summer and Winter, so doe they vary their hours in length or shortnesse; for all that space of time which is contained from Sun rise to Sun-set, they divide into twelve equall parts, whereof the one halfe containes the hours before Noon, the rest the hours after Noon; so also, what space of t ime is from Sun-set untill Sun-rise againe the next day after, is equally divided into 12 parts; whereof every 12 th part containes the space or time of one hour Astrologicall; and we doe ever begin to number from Sun-rise, and continue untill the next Sunrise, with that Planet who is assigned to the day, a nd so"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"Compliments of http://mithras93.tripod.com 483 all manner of QUESTIONS. numbering successively in order untill the next day; so that your Ast rologicall hours are called unequall hours, as all the yeer long consisting of more or lesse then 60 minutes for the space of one hour, unlesse it be the day of the Sun his entrance into Aries or Li bra, at what time an Astrologicall hour is just 60 minutes and no more. Use of the Table. Be the Sun in Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, and you would know t he Planetary hour of the day, first and second Pages serve your turne. If you would know the Planetary hour of any day, the Sun being in Libra, Scor pio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, the third and fourth Pages will serve you. If you would know the Planetary hour of the night or after Sun-set, while st the Sun is in Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Leo, Virgo, then you must be directed by the fift and sixt Pages of this Ta ble. If you would know the Planetary hour od the night, the Sun being in Libra, Scor pio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, the seventh and eight Pages will satisfie you. An Example. If you would know when the Sun riseth, being in the third, fourth or fift of A ries, see to the first Column of the first Page, and there you find, Place of the Sun, under it, S.D. viz, Signes, Degrees, under these two letters, Aries 0, then under 0 3. on the right hand, 5 54. over it H.M. viz. Houres and Minutes; so that it tels you, the Sun being in three deg . of Aries, riseth at 54 minutes after 5. proceed in the same line, and you see the Planetary houre; as, admit I would know at halfe an houre after nine in the morning, upon Monday the 15. of March 1646, the Sun at noon that day being in 4.. degr. 47.min. of Aries, which wanting so few mi n. of 5.degr. I enter with five whole degr. under the Signe Aries, and in the fourth line of t he first Column I find 6. for the whole Table of Signes goes by the continuall addition of three, and if I had entred with four or five degrees of Sun in Aries, I might have taken either three or six, and it"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Compliments of http://mithras93.tripod.com 484 The Resolution of had bred little difference. But to the purpose, over against 6. on the rig ht hand, I find, as aforesaid, 5 47. for the time of Sun-rising, then 6 47. then in order 7 5. then 8 54. then 9 56, my hour was 9 30. so then I begin and say, the Moon being the Planet of the day, beginneth to rule at 47.min. after 5. and governeth until 47.min. after 6. then Saturn ruleth the 2nd hour of the day, untill 51.min. after 7. then Jupiter ruleth the 3rd hour, viz. till 54.min. afte r 8. then Mars the fourth hour, until 56.min. after 9. which is the hour sought for, I say Mars r uleth at that hour; and so you must doe either day or night: And you must remember, that as you see onely in the first Column Aries, Taurus, Gemini, so in the ninth Column of the said page, Vir go, Leo, and Cancer, so when you enter with the place of the Sun in Virgo, Leo or Cancer, you must enter upward contrary to the former side; for the Sun being in 15. of Taurus, riseth at the same moment of time as he doth being in the 15. of Leo: or when in the 15. of Virgo, as when in the 15. of Aries. The length of the Planetary hour is thus known, let the Sun be in the 6th degre e of Aries, he riseth then, as you may see, at 47.min. after 5. In the third Column you find 6 47. which if you subtract from the next number on the right hand in the same line, viz. 7 51. 7 51 rests one hour and four minutes for 6 47 the length of the houre that day, and so as your day-hour is more then 60 minutes, so much the nocturnall hour mus t want of 60 min. and this is a generall rule. The above named 15. of March 1646, the Sun being in 4 47. of Aries, I would know what Planet reignes at 20 min. past 5. in the afternoon; I enter the first Column of the second Page, under the title of the Sun, in the fourth line under Aries I find 6. and accept of that without errour, because the place of Sun is 4 47. of Aries, and so is neerer 6. then 4. over agains t 6. on the right hand, I find 1 2. then 2 4.. then 3 6. then 4 9. then 5 11. then 6 13. these tels me, the first Planetary hour after noon ends at 1 2. that is, two min. after one, the second at two min. after two, the thir d at six min. after three, the fourth at nine min. after four, the fift at e leven min. after five, the sixt at thirteen min. after 6.. now my hour enquired after was 20 mm. past 5. whic h fals to be the last hour of the"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Compliments of http://mithras93.tripod.com 485 all manner of QUESTIONS. day; and if you look over the head of 6 13. you may see the number 12 viz, it’s the twelft hour of the day; now if you begin in the morning at Sun-rise, accounting Moon the first, and so proceed, MOON SATURN JUPITER MARS SUN VENUS MERCURY 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 MOON SATURN JUPITER MARS SUN  8 9 10 11 12 You shall find, that Sun begins his rule at eleven min. past five, and ends at thirteen min. past six. I need not be more copious in a thing so plaine and obvious to the eye; I shall onely propound one example more, viz..: the said 15 of March 11 deg. 10 min. after noon, I would know what Planet rules ; the Sun being in 4 47 of Aries, I now enter the fifth Page of the Table, I look to t he 6. of Aries, against it on the right hand I find 6 13. then 7 11. then 8 9. then 9 7. then 10 4. then 11 2. then 12 0. My hour is ten min. after 11, in the seventh Column you have 11 2.. my hour is i ncluded in the next; so then I conclude my hour is the last hour before mid-night, and cons equently the 6th hour after Sun-set, but the 18th hour of the day, and being accounted as we forme rly instructed, you shall find it the hour of Mars. Either in giving Physick, or performing many naturall conclusions, without exact knowledge of the Astrologicall planetary hour, no worthy w ork can be done, with it wonders, either in collecting Hearbs, framing Sigils, Images, Lamens, &c. So now by the blessing of Almighty God, without whose providence we can per forme no worthy act, I have produced to an end the second part of my intended Work, and could have willingly acquainted untill a further opportunity had been offered: but such is the des ire and importunity of severall wel-affected to this study, that beyond my first intenti ons I againe adventure upon the succeding Traciate of NATIVITIES, wherein the pitifull and merc ifull God of all the faithfull, whole brightnesse shines in our fraile understandings, assist me, that I may performe this Work with judgment and understanding, for the good of all honesthearted English, my most beloved Country-men.
