Sir, I MADE BOLD to Dedicate this sm all piece to you, though somewhat a stranger to you at present, yet being de sired by a faithful friend of yours: who informed me of the great respect you owe to Art, I could do no less. Therefore good Sir, let me Crave your pardon in this my presumption, and let me desire you to pass by my imbecilities, which I do not fear but that you will, when you have seriously considered my Minority, and how hard a matter it is to comprehend the profundity of this sublime Science. And now to let you understand what moved me here to make my self public, is the true love that I owe to my Country , and I hope most w ill receive benefit by those my weak endeavours, and upon this accountonly, I have presumed to make know to the world this little tract of Astrology touching Theft, knowing it must pass the Censure of various capac ities, and from the unskilled I expect blots, but from the Judicious a friendly Correction, and if at last it may be crowned with your Protection, my expect ation is fully answered: who faithfully desires to subscribe himself. Sir, your devoted servant for ever to command, Anthony Griffin "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" To the Judicious Reader Reader, When I did seriously consider what mischief is done by Thieves and Cheaters, I could do no less but make public this little Treatise touching Theft, &c. Wherein Astrologically is plainly laid down some very excellent Rules of Art Experimentally amplified, ea sy to be understood by the meanest capacity, and certainly will be of mu ch advantage, not only to those who are well versed in this most sublime Science; but to most others that are desirous to be instructed therein: and for the better understanding I have here showed you whether the Figure at the time of the question is Radical or not: that you may not de ceive your selves nor the querent: but certainly direct him how to find the Thief or goods stolen, &c. and not out of the querent’s house, but he judgeth it stolen because theft is so much practiced by servants, &c. Therefore I have demonstrated to thy view, whether it be stolen or remain in the house (if so) in what part thereof it may probably be found. But if the goods are stolen, I have showed thee the best Rules how to describe the Thief or thieves, which wa y they live, strangers or familiars, &c. Likewise concerning Beasts, if they are stolen or stra yed, and Fugitives with many other maters very usef ul and beneficial, to all that are students in this Art, viz. Judicial Astrology: so Courteous Reader, let me desire thee to pardon my imbecilities, and if God permit me with Life and health, I shall furnish thee with another Piece Treating of the judgement of all horary questions, more particular than any yet extant: and to all carping Criticks and fantas ticall sencerers I thus make them an answer, Ut Ignam Caves Omnibus ignotis, Allatrant its barbari; Quicduid non intelligent Carpunt at damnant. Thine Anthony Griffin "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"An Astrological Judgment Touching Theft &c. First to know whether the Figure be radical or not. If the Lord of the Ascendant and the Lord of the hour be both of one Triplicity the Figure is radical and Judgment may safely be given. Example: If Aries ascends and Mars be Lord of the hour the Figure is radical, the same if Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces ascends, Mars governing that Triplicity: if that Sagittarius or Pisces ascends and Jupiter be Lord of the hour, the Figure is Radical, and thus observe of all the rest: which by your own discretion you may easily find out. When the latter degrees of a sign ascends it is not safe to give Judgment unless the Age, Corprature, and Complexion of the Querent doth agree with the degrees ascending. Also when the Second, Third, Fourt h or Fifth degrees of a sign ascends, chiefly in signs of short ascension, it is not safe to give judgment unless the Querent be young and short in stat ure. Likewise if the Moon be in the first degrees of a sign or else in the Latter, give no Judgment, for the Querent comes to try thee and likewise for deceit. Likewise if the Moon be unfortunate or be void of course, or if Scorpio do ascend, or if the Dragon's-tail be in the first or seventh house, or if that the fortunes and the infortunes be of equal strength, all these do signify errors in Judgment, and an unlucky end of the question. Narrowly observe whether the seventh House or hi s Lord be afflicted, for then it is an Argument that the Artist shall not gain Credit by the question, for the seventh House si gnifies the Artist himself. Now I shall begin concerning T heft or any other thing lost. When a Question is propounded concerning Theft, it is very convenient to examine the figure and see whether the thing enquired after be stolen or not or whether it be in the Q uerent's house or not which may be discerned several ways as thus. Choice tokens that t he Goods are not Stolen. If neither the Lord of the House of th e Moon, or the Lord of the house of the second separate not themselv es one from another, nor any Planet from, then the thing enquired a fter is in its own place."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"If that the disposer of the Moon, an d the Lord of the Ascendant be in Conjunction, then is the thing mi ssing in the house of the Querent. If, that the Lord of the Ascendant did separate from Jupiter, or from the Lord of the second, then did the Q uerent lay it down or forget it. If that the Lord of the Hour be in the Ascendant, the thing wanting is not stolen but in the Querent's house. If that Cancer Ascends and the Moon be in the fourth, and the Lord of the second be in the seventh, or in th e sign of the eighth, or at a Sextile or Trine to the Moon, then the thing enquired after is not stolen, but taken away in Jest. If that the Moon be in the seventh, in the sign of the Lord of the Hour, the Lord of the Hour being Lord of th e seventh, the Goods are not taken away, but over-look ed and mistaken. If that the Lord of the Ascendant and the Lord of the Hour be in Conjunction, the thing enquired after is not stolen. If the Lord of the Hour, the Lord of the fourth, and Planet in the fourth, the Moon or her dispositor, any of th ese significators being joined near together, doth argue that the goods are not stolen but near the Querent. Having found whether the Goods be in the house or not, now I shall show you in what part of the house you may discover them in. First I shall show what places every Sign doth represent. Aries A place where small beast are kept, as Sheep and such like. In houses the Roof Plastering, or cov ering of the house, Kitchens, Slaughterhouses, backhouses, houses of office, Chimneys, fireplaces, distilling house, brew house, or a place where iron is wrought on.

Note if the Moon be significator and in Pisces then the thing is hidden in a Well. To know in what part of the house the thing missing is in. First consider the sign Ascending, and the sign the Lord of the Ascendant is in and in what quarter. Secondly the sign the Lord of the second is in. Thirdly the sign of the fourth, and th e sign the Lord of the fourth is in, and the Planet in the fourth. Fourthly the sign the Moon is in. Fifthly the sign where the Part of Fortune is. Sixthly the sign the Lord of the hour is in, and Collect all these testimonies together, and according to the Major testimony so Judge. Example: If that the Major part of these Testimonies be Aiery signs, it is in some Chamber, Garret, or Eaves of the house, or in some Hayloft, and so Judge of all the rest. If that the principal significator of the Major part of these be dropping betwixt two signs, the thing missing is fallen down betwixt two Rooms, or between the Wainscoat and walls, or dropt between some slit or hole or the like. Note that earthy Signs signify near the earth, low places in houses, Cellars, low rooms, store-houses for Com and Hay, places where old tools for husbandry are laid up, dark places or the ground near the threshold or the like. In fiery Signs where fire is kept. In watery Signs where water is kept , a sink or some moist place or a place near some Cistern, or where water doth constantly stand.
