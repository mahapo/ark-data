"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" THE DOCTRINE OF HO RARIE QUESTIONS. Having treated largely of the Doctrine of Nativities, (that nothing may be wanting unto the Reader of th is book) I shall in the ne xt place speak somewhat of the judgment of Horary Questions. It is an Axiom most true, that all people endured with reason, and solicitous and desirous to kn ow that for some persons to obtain their Nativities, is as impossible, as for a man to stop the Course of the Planets. Astrologer, therefore, have made use of the Doctrine of Horary Questions, to supply the defect. From a Question seriously pr opounded, the Artist may give such satisfaction unto the Querent, as if hi s Nativity were known. For as the nativity is the time of the birth of the body, the Horary Question is the time of the birth of the Mind; And as there are hardly any persons living upon the face of the earth, but are in one kind or other subject to Horary Doubts; so no Question may they have Horary resolves thereunto, from a Horary Question, soberly, and with a clear intention propounded. But I will predetermine all fu rther proof of the truth hereof in this place, having sufficiently done that in anot her Work formerly emitted into the World: and so co me to the subject matter in hand. Those that make tryal of these Rules in this manner of Judgment, will finde a great deale of pleasure therein: But I wo uld not have an Artist prostitute his Art to every Vulgar or Mechanical desire ; for by such means, he will beslave himself, and render hi s Art contemptible. The Art it self is too sacred to be made common: and I did not hope to pleasure so me worthy and deserving Persons with these my labours; it would repent me that I have taken the pains to publish so much of Art to the other sort of people in the World. For an Artist to respond to every trifle, or endeavour to satisf ie the curiosity of every Beef-Brain’d Questionist, is ev ery whit as dishonourable, as for an intelligent Lawyer to Moot with a Bear, or for a Di vine to Preach to a Herd of Hoggs. Let it therefore be the Artist’s Prudence, to judge only of Questions considerable, and such as are serious and fit to be propounded. For, although the Question of this last Sec tion (suddenly considered) fa voureth of Levity; yet, excellent use may be made thereof, as I have often proved: therefore, I would not have any, to an idle e nd, wrest the Rules of Art. Of The Several Considerations To Be Ob served, Before Judgment Be Given On A Horary Question. The wisdome of the Ancients hath been such, that (the better to bring Art to maturity) they have consid ered of several things [C onsiderable] in an Horary Question, fit for the Artist to be acquain ted with, &c. The Principal of which are these, viz: "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 1. Of the several Significators belongi ng to the Querent, and the person or thing enquired after. 2. Of the Radicalness of the Figure, a nd fitness of the Matter to be judged. 3. Of the possibility or impossi bility of the Matter propounded. 4. Of the Person or Matter impe ding or furthering the business. 5. Of the Time in wh ich it may be performed. The Querent is that Person (be it man or woman) that propounds the Doubt or Question to the Artist; and th e Ascendant and the Lord thereof, are properly the Significators of the Querent. The Quesited, is the Person (or thing) enquired after, and the 7th house (genera lly) and his Lord are the Significators thereof. And then the Moon, she is a general Significa tor in all Questions, as well to the Person Quesited, as to the Person enquiring, because she conveys the Influences of all the Planets, to all Persons promiscuriusly upon this Earthy Globe. And as in the Doctrine of Nativities, the Ascendant, and Planet or Planets posited therein, so signifie the Corpor ature and stature of the body; And the Lord of the Ascendant, the Moon) and the planet or planets they are in Configuration with, the Quality and condi tion of the Minde, &c. so they do also in a Horary Question. Now, for to judge of a Questi on truly, it is requisite that the Artist be well versed in Nativities; for it is impossible for any man to judge a Question well, that doth not first skill the Doctrine of Genitures; for that is the Root and Father of Questions. And in particular , let him sufficiently acqua int himself with the 6th Chapter of the 1 st part of this book, for that inst ructs him in the significations of every of the 12 Houses. Being well versed therein, observe the Nature of your Question propounded, and give the Moon, the Ascendant, and his Lo rd, &c. to the Querent; then consider, unto what House the person or thing enqui red after belongs, and give the Moon the Cusp of that House, and his Lord, unt o the Person or thing enquired after. As an Example: suppose a Person should en quire concerning Riches; the 1st house signifies his person; and fr om the 2nd house, and the posi tion of the lord thereof, you shall know the condition of this Estate: Or if on e shall enquire concerning Brethren, &c. then we must take the 3r d House and his Lord, because they have signification thereof. But if a Question be made of or conc erning a Father, or Land, or Houses, &c. the 4th House hath si gnification thereof if of Children, &c. the 5th; if of servants, or small Cattle, &c. the 6th; if of a Husband, a Wife or Sweetheart, or of Partnership, Theft, Law, or Controversies, the 7th; if of the Portion of a Wife, or Estate of a Husb and, or Death, &c. the 8th; if of the Husbands or Wives kindred, or of a Church-man, or L awyer, or Dreams, &c. the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 9th; if of a King, Prince, Protector, Earl , Lord or Magistrate, or of the Mother, the 10th; if of the Friends, or of anything one shall hope for &c. the 11th; if of private enemies, or sorrow and imprisonment, or of Pris oners, or of great Cattle, the 12th house: Thus according to the true propounding of any Question, may the ingenious Artist give a sober and a certain resolve. And this shall serve for the discovery of the Signifi cators, both of the Querent, and the person or thing Quesited. When a Figure is Radical, and fit to be judged The Astrologer before he adventureth to judge a Question , ought first to consider, whether it be proper and fit to be judge d: For many times, Persons propounds impertinent Questio ns, with an intention to disgrace Art; in doing which, they do nothing but create shame to themselves. Then, the Artist shall sometimes meet with Pe rsons that know not how to propound their desires aright, it’s an Argument when such Qu eries are made, that (although they may be asked with a good intent, yet) they are not ripe for a resolve; and the Astrologer in such Cases ought to defer judgment until another time. Now, for the discovery of the knavery of the one, and the unfitness or unprepared ness of the other, you may observe these following Rules and Aphorisms: 1. When the Sign Ascending, and Planet in the Ascendant, &c . shall describe the person of the Querent exactly, you ma y conclude that figure Radical, and the Question propounded fit to be judged. 2. When either the very beginning of a Sign ascends, or the very later end thereof, it is not safe to give judgmen t; for the Querent hath been tampering with others about the bus iness propounded, or else the Question is forged, and therefore not fit to be answered. 3. When the Moon is voyd of Course, or in Via Combusta, the Combust way; All Matters or businesses propounde d, go unluckily on: therefore the Astrologer ought to understand the Matter propounded perfectly, or else he will give but poor content to the Querent therein. 4. If the Moon go to a square or opposition of the Lord of the 7th; or the Lord of the Ascendant afflict him so; the Ar tist may conclude his Querent a knave, for he then cometh to abuse him. 5. If the 7th House be hindered, or his Lo rd be Retrograde, Combust, or other ways afflicted, let not the Astrologer ju dge any thing: for by how much the more he shall adventure to judge at such a time, by so much the more shall be disgrace himself, and disp arage the Art he professeth. And that is the meaning of Ptolemy’s words Quantis in erroribus versatur Astrologin cum locus septimus ac ejus Dominus afflicti erunt. Centilog. Aphor. 14. 6. When Saturn is the Ascendant of a Question, and unfortunate, the Matter"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" propounded is either false a nd without ground, or else 'tis past all hope: And if at the same, the Lord of the Asce ndant be Combust or Retrograde, the Querent is either a knave or a fool. 7. When the testimonies in your Figur e are equal, the Matter propounded ought not to be judged; for the Artist knows not which way the ba lance may yield, wherefore he ought to defer judgme nt, until a more convenient time. 8. Some Astrologers hold the Question to be Radical, when the Lord of the Ascendant, and Lord of the hour, are of one nature and Triplicity; which is easily known: suppose E ascends the Horoscope at the Querent’s Interrogation, and Q happen to be Lord of the hour; here the Question will be found Radical, because the N who is Lord of the Horoscope, and Q , are of one nature, viz. Hot and Dr y; Or if at the same time, M fortune to be Lord of the hour, the Question will then be admitted Radical, because is of the same Triplicity with the N Understand the same of th e rest. It is requisite here, to show you how to take the plan etary hour at any tim e, either day or night.

But the possibility or impossibility of bringing to pass the Matter propounded, ma y be known by these following Aphorisms By what ways things are brought to pass. 1. Businesses are brought to pass dive rse ways, according to the opinion of the Ancient Astrologers, viz. When the Planets signifying the Person propounding, and the Person or thi ng propounded, are going to Conjunction in good places of the Figur e: Or, when they are appl ying by ' or trine unto each other. Sometimes, things are brought to pa ss by translation or Collection of light, or by the dwe lling in Houses or Dignities, &c. 2. When the Significators of the Matter enquired, are going to conjunction in a good House of Heaven, chiefly in an A ngle, the business ma y be brought to pass. If the significator of the thing pr omised be essentially dignified, and doth apply to the Lord of the Ascen dant; the matter will be brought to perfection before ‘tis expected. 3. If the Lords of the Matter propounded, &c. apply to each other by a trine or sextile from Sign s and Houses they delight in, the thing sought after will be brought to pass. 4. When the Significators are not beholding, yet, if a good Planet do Translate, or Collect, and gather thei r light, it denotes good in the Matter enquired after, and sh ews its possibility. 5. When Planets dwell in Houses prop er and convenient, the Matter by that means may be brought to pass; chiefly, if the Mo on have a good Defluxion and Application. Now, as I have shewed the possibility of br inging things to pass, it is requisite I show the im possibility; which is known from these following Aphorisms. When things are impossible to be brought to pass. 1. If the Significator of the Querent, and Quesited, &c. are non-beholding, it is an ill sign of ever bringing the thing enquired after to perfection. 2. When the Significators shall behold each other by d , or b , from hateful places of the Figur e; or shall be in d , or b , of the infortunes. It is seldom known that upon such positions a ny thing is brought to pass. 3. When the Significators are voyd of r eception, or are Combust, Cadent &c. it is a Miracle, if th ey perform any thing. 4. When the Infortunes or Cauda Dracon is shall be in the House signifying the thing enquired after, or affl icting the Significators, the business propounded will come to a poor end. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Of the Person, or Matter, furthe ring or impeding the business. 1. When you have set your Figure, an d finde an obstruction in, or a furtherance of your business, observe th e Planet impediting, or Adjuvant, and the Houses he or sh e Governs, and say, the Le t or Furtherance shall come from such a Person or Thing sign ified by the House or Houses he or she doth Govern. 2. If Venus be the assisting or impe ding Planet, and be Lady of the 3rd, say a Sister, Kinswoman, or Neighbour, will be the occasion of the good or evil portended by the business. If she shoul d be Lady of the Second, tell the Querent, that Money must be his onl y Advocate in the thing he enquires after; or for want of Mone y, the Matter or business wi ll be starved; he that understands this rule (and it is easily understood) cannot be to seek in the resolution of any Question whatsoever: he that understands it not, is unfit (in my opinion) to enter into judgment with any Thing or Matter of this Nature. And thus much for this Section. Of the time wherein a bu siness may be performed . 1. Being desirous to know, when or in what time a Thing may come to pass, after you see a possibility thereof, you mu st take the true distance of the Significators, let it be either by body or Aspect, and turn the distance found into time. 2. If the Significators are in moveable Signs, look how many Degrees of distance you have, for so many Weeks or Days it will be, before the business be perfected. If in common Signs, it will be so many months or Weeks. If in fixed Signs, then so many Ye ars or Months, as you ha ve Degrees of distance. 3. Angles are equivalent to moveable Signs; Succeedents to common or bi- corporeal; Cadent, to fixed. Wherefore, when you finde the distance of the Significators in moveable Signs, a nd in Angles, you may be the more positive, and say, that the Thing shall be performed with speed. 4. When you see a very great probabili ty of the performance of a business; and no let or hindrance thereto, and the Significators immediately applying unto the a or good Aspect of each othe r; then for the time of performance, observe the time of the a or Aspect; and this I have of ten proved true. Of Moles, Marks, and Skars, of the Querent and Quesited. The Knowledge of the Marks, Moles, &c. of each Querent by Art, is a good way for to verifie your Figure, and prove it Ra dical, as I before shewed: For if the Moles &c. of the Person enquiring, corr espond exactly with the Scheam erected, the Artist may safely proceed to judgment . Now the Rules observable herein, are those following. [what part Querent marked]. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Having erected your Figure, 1. consider the sign ascending, and what part or Member in Mans body it Rules; for the Querent hath a Mole, Mark , or Skar in that part of his body. Example: if the Sign ascending be F it is on the belly; if G the reins; if H the Secrets, &c. 2. Then consider in the next place, in what Sign of the Twelve the Lord of the Ascendant is posited, and say the Querent hath a Mole, &c. in that Member or part of his body represented thereby. 3. observe the place of the M and tell the Querent that he hath another Mole, or Scar, &c. in that part of his body the is represented by that sign she possesses. 4. Consider the Sign of the 6th, and th e Sign wherein the Lord of the 6th is Located; for usually in those Members represented by these Signs, the Querent is also marked. 5. When S shall signifie the Mark, &c. it is generally an Excrescence of a darkish obscure or black colour. If R it is usually a purple or blewish Mole, &c. If Q , ‘tis commonly some scar, slash, or cut, chiefl y in a fierie Sign; and sometimes a reddish Mole , or spots of Gunpowder. If the N , generally of an olive or chestnut colour. If P , of a honey color. If O it is sometimes whitish, and other times of a pale lead colour. If the M ‘tis often white, yet many times pa rticipates of the colour of that planet she is as aspect with. 6. If the Planet and Sign re presenting the Mark, Mole, or Scar be Masculine, the Mars &c. is then on th e right side of the body; if feminine, judge the contrary. 7. If the Significator of the Mole &c. be above the Earth, the Mark, Mole, &c. is then visible to the eye, and on th e forepart of the b ody; but, if he be under the Earth, it is then not to be seen, but is on the back part of the body. 8. If few Degrees of a Sign ascend on th e Horoscope, or descend on the 6th house; or if the Lord of the Asce ndant, Lord of the 6th, and the M be in the beginning of Signs, then say the Mole , Scar, &c. is in the upper part of the Member thereby represented. If they , or any of them shall be in the middle of Signs, then judge the Moles, &c. to be about the middle of the Member. But if they be in later degrees of the Signs, &c. you may be confident that the Mark, &c. is on the lower part of the Member."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 9. Observe, if an infortune be in the Ascendant of any Question, the face of the Querent is usually blemished; for the face is signifyed by the Horoscope, let what sign soever ascend. 10 . These rules will hold true also upon the body of the Quesited, mutatis mutandis ; As, suppose one shall enquire of a sweet-heart, or wife, &c. the 7th house will be her 1st, and the 12th her 6th, &c. and in the Members, those signs signifie she shal l have Marks or Moles. And thus much for this Chapter. HERE FOLLOWS THE JUDGMENTS BELONGING TO THE TWELVE HOUSES OF HEAVEN, WITH THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE MOST MATERIAL QUESTIONS THEREUPON. JUDGMENTS, AND INTERROGATORIES PROPER TO THE FIRST HOUSE. The 1st House signifies the life of each person, his temperature and Corporature; and in Horari e Questions hath these Ques tions proper unto it, viz. 1. Of the length of the Querent’s life. 2. Of the good or evil attending life. 3. When, or in what time sh all the Native undergo a change? 4. What part of the Querent’ s life is like to be best? 5. Toward what part of the World may he di rect his affairs to prosper in them? 6. A person having a minde to speak with another, shall be finde him at home? 7. Of an absent party, if dead or alive. 8. Of a Ship at Sea, her safety or prejudice. These particulars being explained, will gi ve light sufficient unto the Astrologian, whereby he may judge of any othe r demand proper unto this house. Of The Length Of The Querent’s Life. 1. In the resolution of this Question, you must observe the Sign ascending, the Lord thereof, and the And if you finde them free from the malignant Beams of the infortunes, or the Lords of the 4th, 6th, 8th and 12th Houses, and from Combustion, you may safely judge the Querent’s life will not be short. 2. When the aforesaid Significators are not afflicted by the presence of violent fixed stars, the Native may live long. 3. If the Lord of the Ascendant be Com bust and Retrograde, &c . and this in an evil House of Heaven, you may safely judge that the Querent is not long-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" liv’d. 4. When the Significators, &c. shall be evilly aspected from good places of the Figure; or the Benevolent Planets inte rpose their Rayes, the Malevolency threatened will be abated; but if it be from evil Houses in the Scheam, and the Benevolents afford no help, much dange r of a short life is to be feared. I shall speak of the time thereof, when I come to the 8th House. Of The Good Or Ev il Attending Life. 1. The Good and Evil that attends each Person, is known from the fortunate and unfortunate Radiati ons in the Figure. 2. When Benevolent Planets possess the Ascendant, or the principal places of the Figure, they prognosticate much go od unto the Querent in the whole course of his Life. 3. If the Lord of the Ascendant and the M be befriended by the Beams of the Fortunes, although from bad places of the Scheam, yet it presage good unto the Native in the Course of his Life; in as much as an accidental evil cannot rebate or withstand an Essential good. 4. But when the Infortunes shall posse ss the places aforesaid, or by Aspect afflict the Significators aforesaid, the Person interrogating will be subject to a troublesome Life. 5. If S possesseth the ascendant, the Queren t will be melanchol y and pensive, and subject to perplexities from aged men, &c. If Q , he will be Cholerick, and lie liable to opposition by Knaves and Thieves; and sometimes by the villainy and Treachery of kindred he ma y suffer: of retrograde he is never free from scandals and disgrace, &c. 6. When the afflicting Planets are Lord s of evil Houses, the evil will be the longer durable: But when the afflicting Planets are Lords of good Houses, the good will be more Permanent. Have great regard also to the Houses those Planets govern; for from thence is k nown by what means the Querent shall be fortunate, or unhappy. 7. You must observe, that as the malignant Beams of the Evil Planets prevent or Eclipse the good that is signified; so, the Benevolent Rayes of the fortunes Stars, reverberate much of the mischief portended: by considering of which, according to the strength of the Planets assisting or afflicting, the Artist may find the Magnitude, Smallness, or Medi ocrity of the Good or Evil that attends each Querent’s Life. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" In What Time The Native May Expect A Change. 1. Contrary to the opinion of some Astrologers now living, upon the propounding of a serious Question, when the Nativity of the Proponent is not attainable (for if the Nativ ity to be had, I adjudge Ho rary Questions useless) I erect my Figure, and (as a Nativity) draw it into a Speculum, and direct the several Significators to their Promittors. 2. Having the true distance of each Significator from th e Promittor, I turn it into time, as in a Nativity, and according to the effects of Directions, I judge thereof. But this pains is to be taken only when Questions of weighty concernment are propounded, and not upon any trivial or ordinary business. 3. In matters of indifferency or light concernment, you may observe the Degrees of distance between the Signi ficators, either of their bodies or Aspects, and judge th ereof certain enough. 4. When fixed stars of a violent natu re, occupie the principal parts of the Figure, chiefly the Ascendant, Mid-Heaven, and the place of M , they presage sudden and unexpected mischiefs. When fi xed stars of a noble nature possess the before-mentioned places, they demonstrate sudden good unto the Querent. And this sha ll serve for the time &c. What Part of the Querent’s Life i s Like To Be Best. 1. For the resolution of this Question, you are to observe in what part of the Figure the fortunate Stars are, and acco rding to their position judge thereof. 2. If the propitious Planets be in the Ascendant, the 12th or 11th Houses, the Native will be most happy in his infancy. If in the 10t h, 9th, 8th, in the 2nd part of his Age. If in the 7th,6th or 5th, after his middle age. If in the 4th, 3rd, 2nd, his later years w ill be most happy. 3. Some Astrologers hold that in this manner of judgments, we ought to allow to every House the fortunate Planets ar e distant from the Ascendant 5 years; and thence predict the time of the Querent’s happy and fortunate estate. 4. When the Significators of life are str ong, and signifie long life, you may add 1 (one) year to every House (that is, whereas we give but 5 generally, we allow 6 for it’s then possible the Quer ent may live more than 60 years, &c.

We know it to be an ev il epidermical, for Persons to undertake voyages, and other weighty matters, &c. much to th eir prejudice and disadvantage; and"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" although all places are alike to him that ma de the Earth, yet they are not so to men that possess it; therefore it will be requisite for those who judge Questions of this kinde, to observe these following ru les, or at least as many of them as he shall have use for. 1. The whole Heaven is divided into 4 Quarters, East, West, North, and South: And these 4 Quarters are agai n subdivided, viz, the 1st House is full East, and the 12th House being in Ascension next unto it, is East and by South; the 11th next unto that, is South East; and the mid-Heaven is South, &c. 2. According to the Quarters of Heaven, thus divided and subdivided, you are to look in which those places you finde the promising Planets, &c . viz. R , P , M , Z , or most of them, and direct the Querent in his affairs thither. 3. When the aforesaid Planets shall be in the Mid-Heaven, that being South, direct the Querent Southward; if they be in the 9th; tell him ‘tis his best way to go South-west. If in the West , it is for his good to go full West: understand the same of the rest. 4. Consider seriously the Na ture of the Querent’s de sire, whether it be for Health, Riches, Honor, Friends, &c. that he hopeth to enjoy, by his undertaking; for by rightly understandi ng the Question, you shall answer the Querent’s desire more readily. 5. If it be for Health he would remove hi s habitation, observe where, or in what Quarter the Lord of the Ascendant and M are posited, and direct him that way. If for Riches, take not ice of the Lord of the 2nd and v : If for Honor, consider N , and the Lord of the 10th: if for Friends, observe the Lord of the 11th; and so may you answer the Question safely. A Person Having A Minde To Speak With Another, If He Shall Finde Him At Home? The verity that I found in this very th ing, did principally engage my thoughts to this study at the first; for with prej udice have I often ma de proof hereof, and (if I were true to my Rule ) it never failed me; which caused me to conclude, that if there were so great cert ainty to be found in so me an a Question, there might be found much more in things of grea ter worth. Without further Anticipation, the Rules are th ese following. 1. When you would speak with a person that you have famili ar and constant dealings with, and he no ways related unto you; ta ke the 7th house and his Lord to signifie him, (i.e.) the 7t h from the Ascendant; for the Ascendant"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" always signifies the Querent. 2. If the Lord of the 7th be in any of th e 4 Angles, viz. Theist, 4th, 7th, or 10th Houses, the Person you would speak withall is at home. 3. If the Lord of the 7th be in any of the Succedent Houses, viz. The 2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th, he is not then at home, but he is neer home, and may with a little diligence be spoken withall. 4. When the Lord of the 7th is in any one of the Cadent H ouses, viz. The 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, the party is then far from home, and consequently cannot be spoken withall. 5. If the Lord of the Ascendant apply to the Lord of the 7th by a friendly Aspect at the time of the enquiry, you may te ll the Querent he may meet the Querent as he is going, or accidentally h ear of him by the way. Or, if the M , or any other Planet transfer the light of the Lord of the 7th to the Lord of the Ascendant, it signifies the same. 6. The Nature and sex of the Planet transferring the light thus as aforesaid, informs you what manner of Person sha ll give notice to the Querent of the Person he enquires after, with regard had to the Sign and Quarter he is posited in. 7. Note, that if the Person you would sp eak with be a relation, then you are not to take the Lord of the 7th, but the Lord of that House which Signifies such relation: as, if he be a Brother, then the Lord of the 3rd you must look unto; if a Father, you must have re gard to the Lord of the 4th; if a Son or Daughter, observe the Lord of the 5th, &c. And according to their Positions judge, as before you were taught. If An Absent Party Be Dead Or Alive? 1. Herein you are to consider what rela tion the Querent hath to the Party Quesited, and take your Significator acco rdingly, as is formerly shewed. But if there be no relation between them, take the Ascendant, his Lord and the M to signifie the Party that is absent; and you may thus judge. 2. If the Lord of the Ascendant, or M , be in a with the Lord of the 8th, or a Planet in the 8th, and no benevolent t estimonies concurring, the absent Party is dead. 3. When the M , and the Lord of the Ascendant, shall be in b to the Lord of the 8th, from the 2nd and 8th, or from the 6th and 12th, th e absent party is dead. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 4. If the Lord of the Ascenda nt be in the 4th, and the M in the 7th, in Quartile to him there, it shews great danger to the Quesited, if not death. 5. When an evil Planet shall translate th e light of the Lord of the 8th unto the Lord of the Ascendant, or of the Lord of the Ascendant to the Lord of the 8th, ‘tis forty to one, but the absent Party is dead. 6. Behold the Lord of the Ascendant and M , and if you finde them in the 4th from the Ascendant, or in the House of Deat h, and either Combust, or in their falls, or joyn’d with the Lord of th e 8th, say the Part y Quesited is Dead. 7. If none of these happen, but on the contrary, you finde the M and Ascendant, and his Lord fortified, you may conclude that the absent Party is alive, and very well. 8. If the Lord of the Ascendant or M , separate from the Lord of the 6th, the absent party hath been sick lately; if from the Lord of the 8th, he hath been in danger of Death; if from the Lord of the 12th, he hath been in Prison, and hath had much trouble of minde. And by varying your Ru le, his condition according to the Significators appli cation and separation will be found. Of A Ship At Sea, Her Safety or Prejudice. 1. This Question, although by the Ancien t Arabian and Latine astrologers it is attributed to the 9th House, beca use it relates unto Vo yages; yea (as the Learned Mr. Lilly saith) the judgments hereof being chiefly relating to the Ascendant, I shall (with him) refer it thereunto. The parts of the Ship a re thus divided according to the Signs of the Zodiack. A The Brest G The part above th e brest in the water B Under the brest toward the water H Where the Mariners abide. C The Rudder or Stern I The Mariners D The Bottom or Floor J The ends of the Ship E The Top above the Water K The Governor or Captain F The Belly of the Ship L The Oars 2. After observation made of this Divi sion you are to consider what Signs are fortunate and what unfortunate, at the time of your question propounded; for the persons or parts of th e Ship thereby Signified, are either well, or in danger, according to their fortunacy or unhappiness."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 3. The Ascendant and the M are (generally) Significat ors of the Ship, and the burthen she bears; But th e Lord of the Ascendant, of the Persons that sail therein. And if in a Question propounded, M you finde all these fortunate, you may judge prosperity to the Ship: But if on the contrary, you finde them all afflicted, you may conclude the Vessel and all in her to be in eminent danger, if not lost. 4. When a Malevolent having Dignities in the 8th House, shall be placed in the Ascendant, or the Lord of the Ascendant in the 8th, in evil Aspect with the Lord of the 8th, 12th, 6th, or 4th; or, if the M be Combust under the Earth, all these are accounted danger s, and presage the Ship eith er to be lost, or in a very desperate condition. 5. But if all the Significators are fre e, and no ways impedited, you may then judge the Ship to be in a very good c ondition, and all the Persons and things in her also. 6. If you finde the Ascendant and the M unfortunate, and the Lord of the Ascendant strong, and in a good conditi on, you may judge the Ship to be in an ill condition; but the men &c. that are in her are likely to do well, and come off without prejudice. 7. But if the Ascendant and M shall be fortunate, and the Lord of the Ascendant unfortunate, you may then judge that the V essel shall do well, or that it is in safety; but the men in her are in great danger of being destroyed. 8. If any shall enquire of the success a Ship shall have in her Voyage upon her setting forth, you must then behold the Angles of the Figure; and if you finde the Fortunate Planets and the M (for she is a Lady of the Seas) therein, and the unfortunate Planets Cadent, or in an abject condition, you may conclude the Ship and her lading will go very safely unto the intended Haven. 9. But if the infortunes be in Angles, or succedent H ouses, she will meet with some prejudice in her Voyage; and the misfortune will fall upon that part of the Ship, or Person or Thing in the same, signified by the sign where the infortune is posited. 10. And if the infortunate threatening danger shall be S , the Vessel will either be split or sunk, and the men therein either drowned, or subject to much prejudice. But if the infortune be Q , and he in any of hi s essential Dignities, or aspecting a place where he hath strength, or posited in an Earthy Sign, he portends the same mischief that S did, and very great impediments, and troubles. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 11. But if the Fortunes cast their Beams unt o either of the aforesaid Places, and the Lords of the Angles, chiefly the Ascendant, and the Dispositor of the M be free, it denotes, althou gh the Ship shall undergo mu ch prejudice, yet the major part of the men and goods shall be preserved. 12. But if N do afflict the Lords of the A ngles, and the Dispositor of the M , the Saylors or men in the Ship will mightily fear their Enemies; and this is so great a manner, that they shall tremble (saith the Author) by reason of them. 13. He saith also further-- and if to add unto this evil, there happen any other evil in the Signs, there will be quarrelling, controversies, wounds and thefts among the men in the Ship; they shall co zen and cheat one another. And this will chiefly happen when the infortunes happen to be located in those Signs, which dispose of the parts in the upper division of the Ship. 14. But if S do afflict after the same ma nner as before we said of Q , there will be many thefts committed in the Sh ip, and most of the fore-mentioned mischiefs, but no bloodshed. 15. And if the infortunate Signs signifie th e Bottom or lower part of the Ship, it presages drowning or breaking, or some dangerous Leak. 16. If the Sign unfortunated be in the Mid-Heaven, and Q prove the afflicting Planet, the Ship will be burnt, either by fire with in her, or by Thunder or Lightning without her, or by some ot her unhappy Meteor fa lling out of the Ayr. Mr. Lilly saith, This Aphorism wi ll take place but when the Signs are fierie, and neer violent fixed Stars. 17. If Q shall be in an humane Sign, the burn ing of the Ship sh all be occasioned by some conflict with the enemies, who shall tear and despoyl her by grapling with her. And the danger shall begin in that part the Ship signified by the Sign wherein the infortun e was placed in the Figure. 18. But if S shall be the threatening Planet in the stead of Q, and posited in the mid-Heaven, the Vessel will be prejudiced by the motion of violent winds, or by reason of Leaks, or using bad sayls: and the impediment will be either greater or lesser, according to the dignity or power of the infortune, and his remotion from the B eams of the good Planets. 19. If the Lord of the Ascendant in your Figure shall be fortunate, the Ship shall return with safety and good success; but if he shall in infortunate, she will suffer loss and damage. 20. If the Lord of the 8th shall infortunate the Lord of the A scendant; chiefly, if the Lord of the Ascendant be in the 8th, the danger and impediment that will"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" happen to the Ship, shall be of the nature of the Lord of the 8th; As, if the Lord of the 8th shall infortunate the Lord of the Ascendant, the M , and her Dispositor, it denotes the death of the Master of the Ship, or some of the principal Officers belonging thereunto. 21. And if the part of fort une and part of substance, and their Lords, shall be infortunate, it denotes loss in the Sale of the goods that are in the Ship. But if in the stead of their info rtunacy, they shall be fort unate, it prenotes much gain, and a profitable Voyage. 22 When the Lord of the Asce ndant, and the Dispositor of the M shall be slow of course, the Ship shall in all lik elihood will make a long and tedious Voyage of it; chiefly, if the Lo rds of those places be slow also. 23. But if the aforesaid Significators be quick in motion, the Ship will then sayl nimbly, and make a shorter cut or re turn of her Voyage then may be expected. 24. And if it shall to fall out that th ere be enmity between the Lord of the Ascendant, and the Dispositor of the M, and no reception happen between them, nor and assistance from the benevol ents; the Mariners or Sea-men will contend and strive one with another; and there will be discord also between the Captain, or Master, a nd them. But he whose Signifi cator is strongest shall prevail, or overcome:(i.e.) If the Lord of the Ascendant be most powerful, the Mariners and Sea-men; bu t if the Dispositor of the M be best fortified, the Master or Ca ptain overcomes. 25. If the Lord of the 2nd shall be re mote from his own 2nd, and from the 2nd house from the M , and the Lord of the Part of fortune removed from the part of fortune, (i.e. Cadent from them, or in d or b to them,) It then presages want of Victuals, and things necessar y: and if they shall be found in Aquatical Signs, there will be a paucity of fresh water, or water that is fit for use. If in Earthy or Ayri e Signs. they will he out to it for want of Victuals, and fire, by reason of which th ey will be much discontented. And thus much may serve sufficiently for the judging of any thing proper and convenient belonging to a Ship; and indeed, for the judgments pertaining to the first house . QUESTIONS BELONGING TO THE SECOND HOUSE. The second House is the Hous e of substance (as in Chap . 6. of the first part I have shewed;) and these Questions foll owing are appropriable thereunto, viz. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 1. Shall the Querent be rich or poor? 2. By what means sha ll he attain riches? 3. The time when? 4. Shall he obtain the Goods or Money Lent? 5. If her shall obtain the wages or stipend due? Of these in their Order; which being expl ained, will lead the Artist the ready way to judge any Question of the kinde whatsoever. Shall the Querent be rich or poor? 1. In resolving this Question, you must observe the Sign of the second and his Lord, the Planet or Planets located th erein; and casting rayes either to the Cusp or the Lord thereof; the v also, and his position. 2. When you finde all the Significator s free, and unafflicted by the bodies or Aspects of the Benevolent Planets, you may conclude the Querent will attain unto a very convenient degree of fo rtune, and shall escape Poverty. 3. When (on the contrary) you finde a ll the Significators afflicted, and the fortunate Stars afford them no assist ance, you need not fear to say, The person interrogating will be poor, and that in a manner continually. 4. If the Lord of the Ascendant or M , shall be joyned to the Lord of the House of Substance; or the Lord of the second, to the Lo rd of the Ascendant; or if the Lord of the House of substance shall be posited in the Ascendant; or if the Lord of the Ascendant or M , shall be in the House of Substance; or if the M, or any other Planet, sha ll transfer the light of th e Lord of the second, to the Lord of the Ascendant, or of the Lord of the As cendant, or the Lord of the second; the Querent th en shall attain Riches, and live in good esteem, according to his capacity of birth. 5. If none of these things happen, see to R the naturall Significator of substance; or P , who is a fortune; or North Node , which always portends good: For if they be free from the ill Beam s of the infortunes, or happen to be posited in the House of Substance, the Querent will most certainly be Rich, and will bear great sway in the place he lives. 6. When S, Q , or Cauda Draconis shall be in the second House, or afflict the Lord of the Second, R, P , or v, it is an Argument the Querent shall not attain Riches; or if ever he were in a good capacity, he will be reduced to beggery, or to a very mean Estate. 7. The Significators of substance swift in Motion, and in good parts of the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" Figure, and free from afflicti on, the Querent will be ri ch of a sudden: but if they be slow in Motion (although they are not afflicted) the Querent will attain Riches but slowly; chiefly if the Planets signifying Riches, are ponderous and in fixed Signs. By what meanes shall the Querent attain Riches? 1. Having acquainted your self well with th e Significators of substance, observe their several Locations, and the Houses they govern; for from thence is known by what meanes Riches come. 2. If the Lord of the second, or the other Significators of substance be fortunately placed in the Ascendant, the Querent shall attain to great Riches without much labour, in a manner unexp ectedly: But if the Lord of the second, &c. be in the sec ond, it shews the Querent shall obtain an estate by his proper industry. 3. The Adjuvant Planets being either in the Ascendant of Lord thereof, the Querent by his industry advanceth himsel f. If the Lord of the second, or in the second, he acquires wealth by Me rchandizing, and managing his flock, &c. If in the third, or Lord of the th ird, he gains by Brethren, Kindred, or Neighbours, &c. 4. The most assured testimony in Ast rology, upon a Question propounded, whether the Querent shall be rich, and cont inue so, is this: If the Lord of the first and second, and R , be in conjunction either in the second, first, tenth, fourth, seventh, or eleventh Houses; but if they be not in conjunction, yet if they apply by e or c to each other with mutual reception; nay, although they apply by d or b ; but if it be with reception, the party will thrive, or have an estate, though with much labour , and many intervening difficulties; yet he will ever mo re abound then want. The time when a man may attain Riches . 1. Consider seriously the application of the M , or Lord of the Ascendant, unto the Planet or Planets signifying the subs tance of the Querent; and so judge of the time when the Queren t may expect Riches. 2. For if you observe the Degrees of distance betwee n the Significators, and turn them into time, you have the true distance of time in which Riches, or the Goods of fortune are a ttainable by the Querent. 3. Fixed Signs prolong the business; bi-c orporeal, show an indifferency, or the time to be neither too long or too sudden. Moveable or Cardinal Signs hasten the matter."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 4. I always observe in things of this Natu re, the surest way is, to take the right or oblique Ascensions of your Significators, and direct them to their several Promittors, as in a Nativity, for that way alone is the time of a mans obtaining riches known; chiefly, when the Question is general: but if it be made of a particular su m of money, or the like , observe the Degrees of distance; and according to the Signs they are in, so measure out your time in Yeers, Months, Weeks, or Days, as I have plainly directed you before. Shall he obtain the Goods or Money Lent? 1. In this Question (as in others) you must observe, that the Lord of the Ascendant, and the M , are the Significators of the Querent; and the Lord of the second denotes his substance. Bu t the seventh House and his Lord represents the Person of whom you en quire; and the eighth House, and the Lord thereof, his substance. 2. See if the Lord of the Ascendant or M , be joyned to the Lord of the eighth, who is significator of the substance of the Party whom you enquire after; Or, see if either of them be joyned to, or in good Aspect wi th a Planet in the eighth House, and the Planet therein happe n to be a fortune, the Querent shall then obtain the Goods or Moneys enquired after. 3. And if it shall so happen, that an info rtune be either in the eighth House, or Lord of the eighth, and he receive either the Lord of the Ascendant or M , the Person enquiring shall obtain what he e xpects. But without reception it will hardly be; And if it s hould happen that he do obtai n it, it will be with so much difficulty, vexation, and trouble, that he might have been better without it. 4. When the Lord of the eighth shall be in the first, or in the second, and the Lord of the Second shall receive him, it denotes the perfection of the business enquired after. 5. But if the Lord of the Se venth, or Eighth, shall be posited in the First or Second, and not received of the Lord of the Ascendant, the Moon or Lord of the second, it shews the Querent shall no t only go without his desire, but if he pursue the business, he shall come off with much loss and detriment. 6. If the Lord of the Ascendant or the Moon shall be joyned to one of the fortunes which shall have dignity in the Sign Ascending, it denotes the dispatch of the business enquired after; or if either of them shall be joyned to an infortune, having dignities in the Ascendant, and shall receive the Lord of the Ascendant, or Moon, it denotes the accomplishment of the matter or business enquired after."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 7. And, if the Fortunes being in powe rful places of the Figure, shall be joyned to the Lord of the Ascendant or Moon, the matter or business Interrogated may be accomplished, although there be no reception. 8. Mr. Lilly very aptly renders it thus: Th e judgment of this chapter shall have place, and prove true, when as the ma tter in Question is amongst ordinary persons, or with such people with whom there is a Community (or dealing) as Citizens with Citizens, Country-m en with countrymen, one tradesman with another. From this judgment exempt Kings, Prices, Noble-men, and such who pay debts slowly, and of whom the law tak es little notice. If the Querent shall obtain his Wages or Stipend, that is due from the King or any Noble man, &c. 1. Behold the Ascendant, the Lo rd of the same, and the M , for they have signification of the Querent; and the second from the Ascendant, which is the Querent’s House of substance, and his Lord. And behold the tenth House and his Lord, which are the proper Signifi cators of the King or Nobleman, &c. And the eleventh House, and his Lord, shall signifie the s ubstance of him or them. 2. If in your Figure, you finde the Lord of the Ascendant or M joyned to the Lord of the Eleventh, or unto a Fort unate Planet in the Eleventh House, without let or impediment; the Querent then shall obta in the wages or stipend due, of the King or Noble-person, &c. 3. Now, if it shall happen, that the M or Lord of the As cendant shall bejoyned to an unfortunate Planet, and the unf ortunate Planet receive them, the Querent shall obtain his desire, although it be with long waiting and many solicitations, and after many fears. 4. But if there be no reception be tween the Lord of the Ascendant, M , and the aforesaid infortune, notwithstanding, any application bet ween them, yet the Querent will rarely obtain his m oney or wages enquired after. Of a Thing mislaid, how, or where to finde it. Having erected your Figure, and rightly considered of your Ascendant, &c. you may proceed to j udgment after this manner, viz. 1. If the Lord of the Second be in an Angle, the Thing missing is within the House of the Querent; But if the Lord of the Second, or M be in the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Ascendant, or in any Sign the Lord of he Ascendant is in, or disposed of by him, the thing missing is in that part of the House, which the Querent himself most frequents. 2. The Lord of the Second or M , in the tenth House, declares the Thing hid or mislaid to be in the Hall or Dining-roo m, if a Gentleman ask the Question; If a Tradesman, ‘tis in his shop, or Countinghouse. 3. But if the Lord of the Second, or M , be in the seventh, th e Thing is in that part of the House where the Querents Wife or Mayd-Servants use most to be. If in the sixth, where his serva nts alone have most to do &c. 4. To judge of the Nature or Quality of the place, you must observe the Nature and Quality of the Signs the Significators are in; which, if they be Aiery, the Thing wanting is in the upper part the Hou se; If fiery, ‘tis neer a Chimney, or where Iron is layd; If earthy, it is neer some pavement or Floor, or in some low place: If watry, then it is neer some Sink or Wash-House in some Moorish moyst place, &c. 5. You must also observe the Quarters th e Signs govern, for th at directs you to the right Angle c part of the House wher e the Thing is hid or mislaid; and in this judgments, Mr. Lilly saith, The signs are thru to be observed in their government. A East E East and by North I East and by South D North H North and by East L North and by West G West K West and by North C West and by South J South B South and by East F South and by West I observe, if the aforesaid Significators from good Houses of Heaven behold each other friendly, and this without im pediment or hinderance, the Querent will gain his money, &c. with facility. Bu t if any Planet, chiefly an infortune, impedite the Significator of the Querent’s good, consider what House he is Lord of, and that informs you of the Person or Thing that obstructs: as, suppose he should be Lord of the Third, tell the Qu erent, that a little expedition-money to the Kings or Noble-mans Servant would do amiss, that being the sixth from the tenth: I have in my practice several ti mes proved this true. And thus much for Judgments of the second House. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" JUDGMENTS PERTAINING TO THE THIRD HOUSE. This House judgeth of Brethren, Sister s, Kindred and Neighbours, &c. and of Inland Journeys and Rumours: and these Questions particularly are proper thereunto. 1.

If reports and rumors noys d about, be true or false? Diverse other questions may be propounded, that properly pertain to this house; but he that understands the manner of judging these, will with ease respond to any other that shall be propounded. Shall the Querent and His Breth ren, &c. and Neighbours accord? 1. You are to give the M , the ascendant and his Lord , unto him that enquires, for his Significators; the third house, and the Lord thereof, unto the persons Quesited; and then resolve the Question thus: 2. If the Lord of the Thir d be a benevolent Planet, a nd in the Ascendant, or the Moon be in good Aspect with a fortuna te Planet in the Third, the Querent and his Brethren and Neighbours will agree well. 3. When the lord of the Ascendant a nd Lord of the Th ird shall be in e or c of each other, and in mutual receptio n; or the Lord of the Third cast a e ' or c to the Cusp of the Ascendant; and the Lord of the Ascendant or M , cast the same to the cusp of the third house, it is an argument of great unity, love and concord between them. 4. When a fortunate planet is in th e ascendant, and the lord of the ascendant behold the cusp of the third, or apply frie ndly to the Lord of the third, it is an argument of a good disposition in the Querents, and speaks him willing to accord with his brethren, Kindred and Nei ghbours. And if a Fortune be in the third, and the Lord of the third appl y lovingly to the lord of the ascendant, the brethren, kindred, or neighb ours, &c. are most indulging. 5. Those Persons whose Significators do not apply, are most imperious, stout, and apt to disagree; and those whose Significators make application, are flexible, willing and yielding and migh ty desirous of an agreement and concord. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 6. When S Q or Y in such a Question, shall be in the Ascendant, it denotes the Person enquiring to be an obstinat e fellow, evil conditioned, and adverse to a friendly agreement; But if they, or either of them , are posited in the third, the brethren, neighbours, and kindre d are of a poysonous and malicious disposition. And if it fortune that S or Q shall be Peregrin e, Retrograde, or Combust, the malice and mischief they threaten will be more malicious and mischievous. 7. When S or Y is in the third, the Neighbo urs are Clowns, the Kindred covetous and sparing: If conjunct , the Kindred are Treacherous, the Neighbours thievish. And this is certain, wh en they are out of their Essential dignities, saith Mr. Lilly. Of the condition and estat e of an absent Brother. 1. For the resolution of the Question, y ou must consider the Lord of the third House, for that hath si gnification of Brethren; an d the House where he is posited, because that shews the state and condition of the Quesited. For if the Lord of the third be a d , or b of the infortunes, or in evil Aspect of the Lords of obscure Houses, the condition of the Brother is sorrowful; but if on the contrary, he be in good Aspect with the fortunes, and in propitious places of the Figure, you may judge his c ondition to be splendid and glorious. 2. If the Lord of Third sh all be posited in the Fourth , in an evil Aspect of the Malevolents, the Brother, &c., which is absent, hath an intention to enrich himself in the place where he is; for th e fourth House is the second from the third. 3. Si verofuerit in quinta, & fuerit junc tus cum domino quinta cum receptione, &c. (i.e.) If the Lord of the third shall be pos ited in the fifth, or shall be in a with the Lord of the fifth, with, or without the recepti on of the fortunes; for if the Lord of the fifth be not afflicted, it shews the absent Brother to be in health, jocund and merry, and very well pleased w ith the society of the Persons he lives among. 4. But if the Lord of the Third shall be in the Fifth voyd of course, or in corporal conjunction, or malicious Aspect of the infortunes, and this without reception, and the unfortunate Planets th emselves impedited, it declares the absent Brother in a discrasie conditi on, indisposed in health, and not contented in the place where he is. Bonatus renders this reason for it, Quoniam quinta est terria a’ domofratrum. 5. But, if he shall be found in any of the obscure parts of the Figure, which are naturally evil, as are the sixth, eighth, twelfth Houses, you may conclude the Brother that is absent, is not well in the place where he is, not in his"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" condition delightful. 6. When the Lord of the thir d is found in the eighth, either a, e, or c, of one of the fortunes, you may conclude the absen t brother not well; but you may also judge him not so ill, as that his reco very should be doubted : nevertheless, he is in a discrasie conditi on, and of body indisposed. 7. But if the Lord of the Third shall be joyned to evil planets in the sixth house, or in a with the Lord of the sixth, the absent Brother is not well, but in an infirm and sickly condition. If the Lord of the sixth be in the Third, except the Lord of the Third shall be we ll disposed, it denotes the same. 8. Behold (if you finde the Brother of th e Querent to be ill and infirm) whether the Lord of the Third be in a with the Lord of the eighth, or entering Combustion; for such a conf iguration declares he sh all die of the infirmity afflicting. But if you finde the Lord of the Third in the Se venth, the Brother is in the same Countrey he went unto at first, and continues there; and his condition is neither well nor ill. 9. If the Significator be in the Eighth, the absent Brother is afra id he shall die; chiefly, if he shall be combus t, or in a with the Lord of the Eighth, in the Eighth, in a or Aspect of the infortunes; Fo r these are Arguments of Death. 10. When the Lord of the Third is in th e Ninth, it is an Argument that the absent Brother is removed from th e place he went first unto, and gone into a more remote Countrey; or may possibly have sequestred hi mself from the world, and betaken himself to some religious Order; or else may be employed by Religious Persons, &c. 11. But if he shall be in the Tenth, in a, or in good Aspect of the fortunate planets, chiefly with reception, it de notes him to have acquired some honour, office or preferment in the place wh ere he lives. But if he shall be in a , d , or b of the infortunes, Combust, or any other way infortunated, it is to be feared the absent brother is dead. 12. If the Lord of the Third be in the Eleventh House, in a, or c of the fortunes, or in a with the Lord of the Eleventh, it denotes the absent Brother to be at the House or place of some friend that respects him well; and there he is very delightful, jo cund and merry. But if he sh all be maliciously beheld of the infortunate Planets, he is not delighted or pl eased with the condition he is in, but grieved and perplexed, &c. 13 . The significator of the absent part y, in the twelfth House, in a or good aspect of the fortunes with recepti on, and the fortunes themselves no wayes impedited, it portends that he shall Me rchandise and deal in Cattle of the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" greater sort, as Horses, Oxen &c . whence he will gain Riches. 14. But, if he shall be unfortunated in the twelfth House, either by the bad Aspects of the Malevolents, or Lord of the Eighth, or in Combustion, &c. It shews the absent Brother to be discont ented, troubled and perplexed, and he is afraid he shall never see the Land of his Nativity again; and indeed, it is possible he may die there. 15. When you finde the Lord of the Th ird in the first, you may conclude the absent Brother is joyful and merry, an d very well pleased and delighted in the place where he is; and is in a very good condition. 16. If the Lord of the Third be in the S econd (it being the twel fth from the third) the absent brother is in no very goo d condition; he would willingly remove from the place where he is, but cannot, for he hath committed some, unhandsome act, or the like, whereby his liberty is restrained. But if his significator shall be found retrograde, it is forty to one, but when those who have the charge of him least think of it, he will finde some trick or opportunity whereby to make his escape. And thus much may serve for the resolution of this Question. Shall the Querent Inland Journeys be prosperous? 1. Persons that travel much in the C ountrey where they live, and have not their nativities to direct them, may have occasion to make use of the Astrologer in this Question; for we k now certainly, that those who travel much, do not always travel safe, but sometimes are in danger either of thieves, sickness, or falls in their journeys, that may occasion them to repent the undertaking thereof. Now, for the prevention of such accidents, and enabling the Astrologer for the judging a Question of this Nature, I shall lay down these following Rules or Aphorisms. 2. Give the Ascendant and his Lord, and R , to the Querent; th e third House and Lord thereof, to signifie the Journey; And see if the Significators be swift in Motion, or in the Essential Di gnities of each other, or in a , e , or c each to other, in good places of the Figure; for if such things appear, do not dishearten the Querent, but tell hi m ‘twill be a good journey to him. 3. If the M be in the third, in aspect to th e Ascendant, or the Lord of the third cast a e or c to the Ascendant, or be in the same; and the Lord of the Ascendant so aspecting the Third, or in the Third, these portend a pleasant journey to the Querent. 4. If the Lord of the Ascendant or M apply to any Planet in the third house, or the Lord of the third to a planet in the Ascendant, it denotes the journey"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" enquired after to be pleasant. 5. Jupiter or Venus in th e third, shews a profitable and delightful journey; chiefly, if they cast a e to the Ascendant: the X in the th ird house shews the same. 6. When S , or Q , or Y , shall be posited in the thir d house, or shall afflict the lord thereof, or the M , it shews but an unlucky jour ney to the Querent, and very ill success therein. 7. Saturn shews the Querent to be Melanc holy and pensive in his journey; Mars and Y , shews him to be in da nger of thieves and robbers ; and if they shall be in humane signs or fierie, it denote s him to be cut and wounded in his journey. 8. When the Lord of the Ascendant, &c. shall be Retrograde, the Querent will return again before he hath gone to the place he intended: if the significators be slow, he makes but little hast e or speed in his journey. 9. If the Lord of the sixt h afflict the Significators, te ll the Querent, he will go neer to fall sick by the way; If the Lo rd of the twelfth, he will be kept prisoner, or hindred by ma licious people; if the Lo rd of the eighth be the afflicting planet, he shews danger of De ath; chiefly, if the Significators be neer violent fixed Stars. If Reports or Rumours noys’d about, be true of false? This question (as others) comes with in the compass of the judgments of Astrologie, and may be answered thus: 1. Observe the Lord of the Ascendant and M , and the Dispositor of the M , and see if either of them be in an angle or succedent House in a fixed sign, or in good aspect with R, N , or P for usually upon such configurations, the Reports and rumours are true. 2. But, if the Lord of the Ascendant or M be afflicted of S or Q or Cadent from an angle, although they be strong in the sign where th ey are, yet the Rumor be false. 3. Rumors are also true and good, wh en the Angles of the Figure are fixed signs, and the M and S in fixed signs, separating from the Infortunes, and applying to a Fortune posited in a ny of the angles of the Figure. 4. When the Angles of the tenth and fourth houses are fixed, and the M shall be received of them, although the Rumors and Reports be ill, yet they will hold"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" true. 5. If the Fortunate Planets, viz . R and P shall be in the Ascendant, and the M at the same time unfortunate, let th e Rumors or Reports be never so mischievous and unlucky, &c. they will be sure to pr ove false, and come to nothing. 6. Mercury being retrograde or otherways afflicted, d eclares ill Rumors to be false; the like doth the affliction of that planet, to whom S or the M doth apply. 7. If the Lord of the Ascendant or M shall be under the S uns Beames, the truth of the Rumor is kept secr et in the Brests of great Ones, and few shall know the truth thereof. 8. If the M be voyd of Course, or in # or \" of S , and neither of them cast their e or c aspects to the Ascendant, the news or Rumor merely vain and false, and many suddenly be contra dicted; and this Mr. Lilly, saith, he hath proved true. And thus much may serve for the judging of Rumors. Of the advice of a friend &c . whether good or evil. Many times Neighbors or Friends, &c. se eing a Person in a strait, or in a troubled condition, will advise and perswade with him what he ha d best to do in such or such a case, &c. Now if you would know whet her he or they intend faithfully, or persidiously, erect your Fi gure to the moment of time they first drop their counsel or advice into your ears, and judge as followeth: 1. Behold the Mid-Heaven (that being th e House signifying advice) and see if there be any fortunate Star or Planet pos ited therein; for th en the counsel or advice is serious and good, and will not be am iss for you to follow. 2. But if an Infortune shall be found in the tenth House, the friends that pretend Counsel intend knavishly, and are Ly ars and vain deceitful fellows. 3. Mr. Lilly saith, If the M be applying to the Lord of the Ascendant (with good aspect) we may then judge the Pers ons advising, come with an honest heart; and the advice they give is intended for your good, &c. 4. Haly averreth, When any one shall come to consult with a man, and the Ascendant of the Question, &c. shall ha ppen to be a Bi-corporal, or double- bodied Sign, and the Lord of the Ascendant and M , shall be found in signs common also; he is then a Deceiver, and comes on purpose to ensnare thee. Listen not therefore, or give ear unto him. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" JUDGMENTS OF THE FOURTH HOUSE. The fourth house giveth judgment of Po ssessions, Inherita nces, Lands, or Houses, and of things hi d and mislay’d; of the Fa ther, &c. and hath these Questions proper unto it, viz. 1. Shall the Querent purchas e the House or Land, &c. 2. Of the Quality thereof, and sha ll the Querent do well to take it? 3. If it be good for one to re move, or abide where he is? 4.

These questions being once resolv’d, will lead the Artist to the understanding of any thing of the like Nature. Shall the Querent purchase the House or Land, &c. 1. In the resolution of this Question, you are (according to the opinion of the Ancients) to give the Asce ndant and his Lord, and the M , to signify him that enquires; the Sign of the fourth house, an d Lord thereof, to signifie the thing Quesited. 2. If the Lord of the Ascendant, of the M , shall be in the fourth house; or the Lord of the fourth in the first, or if either of them shall be in a with the Lord of the Fourth, or in d or b unto him with reception, it declares the accomplishment of the thing without impe diment, let, or hinderance. But if they shall be joyned without reception, or shall be in d or b with perfect reception, Guido saith the Querent sh all have his desire. 3. But if the Significator shall not be joyned together, neither by Body or Aspect, yet if there be a Translation of light between them, either by the M , or another planet, it sh ews a possibility of the thing, although with much difficulty and trouble. 4. Haly adviseth us to judge of this quest ion after this manner: Give the sign ascending, and the Lord thereof, and the planet from whom the M is separated, to the Querent or Purch aser. The Seventh house and his Lord, and the planet to whom the M applies, to the Seller. 5. Give the fourth house and his Lord, th e planet or planets posited therein; and the M , to signifie the Thing to be boug ht or purchased; and the Mid-Heaven to signifie the price thereof."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 6. When you finde in your Figu re the Lord of the Asce ndant behold the Lord of the Seventh, and the Lord of the Seventh apply to th e Lord of the Ascendant, say that the Seller hath a great desire to deal with the Buyer; and if they Fortune to be in each others dignities, or any good transla tion of light happen between them, or if they apply to a Corporal a , the Querent will agree with the Seller, without much difficulty or trouble. 7. But if the application or tr anslation of light be by Qu artile or Opposition, the Buyer and Seller will at last agree; but it will be with much labor and expense of time, and after many probabilitie s of a breaking off. 8. See if the Lord of the Ascendant or M shall apply to the Lord of the fourth; or if the Lord of the fourth, or M , shall apply to the Lo rd of the Ascendant; or if the Lord of the fourth also sha ll apply to the Lord of the Ascendant, and there be a reception between them &c. Or , if the Lord of the Ascendant, or M , shall be in the fourth, or Lord of the fourth in the ascendant, all these portend the party enquiring shall buy or purchase the Land or inheritance enquired after. 9. But if neither of these happen, yet if the M shall transfer the light of one Significator to the other, it denotes that the thing shall be perfected, but by Mediation of friends, or by Messengers. 10. But if there be no receptions, or translation of light between them, nor dwelling in houses, &c. then it is impossible that an y thing shall be concluded be tween them. Of the Quality thereof; And shall the Querent do well to take it? 1. Look to the fourth house to resolve th is Interrogatory; and if you finde two Infortunate planets therein, either Pote nt or Peregrine, the Thing enquired after will be spoyled and wasted by the Buyer; and at the present ‘tis in no good Condition. 2. If you finde the Lord of the fourth unfortunated, either by Retrogradation, Detriment, Fall or Peregrin ation, it denotes the house or land, &c. to be but bad, or else so encumbred, that it will never continue long with the Purchaser. 3. If the Fortunate Planets shall be in the fourth house, or the X there, it shews the business enquired after to be good; a nd the buyer or purchaser shall be a gainer thereby. 4. When the Fortunate plan ets shall cast their Benevol ent Rayes unto the fourth house; and the Lord of the fourth shall be posited in a good house, in e or c"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" to the second house or his Lord, it is th en an Argument that the Land, &c. is good, and the Purchaser shal l be a gainer thereby. 5. If A , E , or I shall be upon the Cuspe of th e fourth house, you may then say the Ground (if ground be to be purchased) is Mountainous, Hilly, Hard and Dry. If B , F , or J , the ground is a Plain, and very good. If it, C , G, K , the ground is mixt, (i.e.) some part high, and some low; and is in Quality neither very good no r very bad. If D, H , L , the Ground is moyst, and over- burdened with much water. 6. An unfortunate Planet in the fourth Retrograde, shews the land or House, &c. to be very evil, and not worth the taki ng, ‘twill be accompanied with so many infelicities; if a Fortunate Planet be there strong, the Land is good, and may well invite the Querent to go on, for he will have a good bargain. If good for one to remove , or abide where he is? 1. In this Question (as in all others) you must give the Ascendant, and the Lord thereof, to signifie the Querent; the seventh Hous e and Lord thereof, to signifie the place unto whic h he would go; the fourth house and hi s Lord, the House or Land, &c. of the Querent; th e tenth House and his Lord, the profit of removal. 2. The Lord of the Ascendant or fourth in the seventh, and the Lord of the Ascendant and the seventh, fortunate Planets, swift in Motion, strong and potent where they are, the Querent then may do well to remain where he us, and not remove. 3. But if the Lord of the seventh be with a good planet, and the Lords of the Ascendant or fourth with an evil one, you may tell the Querent, it is his best way to remove, for he will get l ittle by continuing where he is. 4. Fortunate Planets in the Ascendant or fourth, may invite the Querent to stay in the place where he is: If the Lords of those Houses are in a , or good aspects with fortunate St ars, it denotes the same. 5. Unfortunate Planets in the Ascendant or fourth, tell the Querent ‘tis good to remove from the place where he is: and if the Lords of the Ascendant and fourth be afflicted by th e malignants, either by B ody or aspect, the same. 6. Observe the afflicting Planet or Plane ts, and the House or Houses he or they govern; for from thence the occasion of the mischief that the Querent sustains, is known; the like observe of the assisting or friendly Planets, &c. And you cannot fail in giving a ra tional Answer to the Proponent."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" Of Treasure hid, if attainable? 1. Common it is for Persons to hide Tr easure, and as commo n for those that hide a great deal, to forget where so me part of it may be; therefore after erection of your Figure, consider what application; reception, translation, &c. there may be between the Lords of the Ascendant and fourth house. 2. If there be a friendly application and reception, the Person enquiring shall obtain the Treasure he looke th for. But if there be d or b between the significators, without reception, the tr easure hid will very hardly be found. 3. When the Significators appl y to each other Corporally in a fixed sign, there is much hopes of finding and obtaining th e same suddenly; chiefly, if the application be in a good house. 4. Both or either of the lights in th e Ascendant no way unfortunated, or else friendly beholding the same, argues a sp eedy recovery of the treasure his: But if instead hereof they happen to be Cadent, or in d or b thereto, it denotes small hopes. 5. If the part of fortune shall be in the Ascendant, and there beheld by the fortunate planets, or the Luminaries, the Querent will then be in hopes of acquiring the Treasure hid. 6. But, if the Part of Fortune an d the Luminaries be Cadent, chiefly the M and neither of the lights cast a friendly aspect to the part of fortune or the Ascendant; Nor the Lord of the Ascenda nt behold the Ascendant, it is an argument the Querent cannot obtain the Treasure hid. 7. I always observe in Questions of this na ture, if the Fortunate Planets be in the fourth, or govern the fourth, that there is Treasure: and if the Lord of the Ascendant or M be in good aspect with those pl anets, the Querent doth attain unto it by search. 8. On the contrary, if Infortunes be in the fourth house, or the Luminaries weak there, it is an Argument of irrecovery ; or shews (sometimes) that it is taken away before. I remember about five or six years once, a Captain who had a Patent to search for hidden Treasu re, asked my opini on concerning a business he was about in Chick-Lane London; I erected a Scheam upon his proposal, and found the M in H in the fourth, in d to S : I told his I conceived there was no Treasure, or if there were, it was removed, and advised him to forbear his scrutinie, for fear of gaining prejudice instead of Treasure, in his going on. He enquired of me what prejudice? I answered (considering the Moons positi on in a moyst sign, in d to S in the twelfth"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" house) that either some malicious peopl e would put some trick upon him, or else some Vault might break in upon him and his Company, &c. the later of which I most feared, and not the fo rmer. The Captain was persuaded at present to break off, and went from me so resolved: But an inch of covetousness over-prevailed with him, and caused him straight-way to change purpose, and to digging he goes again (the same night he had been with me) and reaped what he well deserv ed, (for his mutability of minde) and was for all his pains, appayd with the breaking in of a Jak es upon him and his Company. Is there Treasure in the place supposed? 1. A Question being thus in a general way pr opounded, give the Lord of the Ascendant and the M to the Querent for his significators; the fourth house, and the planet or planets posited therei n, shall signifie the treasure enquired after. 2. When R P , or X is in the fourth house, they d eclare treasure to be in the place supposed; and if they be in the essential dignities , it is very certain that there is a great deal there. 3. If you find any of the other planets in their own houses, in the fourth house without impediment, &c. you may conclude that there is treasure in the place supposed; and it is of the natu re of the Planet signifying it. 4. If the Planet signifying the Treasure be N , you may say, there is Gold or jewels, &c. If the M ‘tis Silver. If S , Lead, Coles, or a quarry of Stone; according to the place supposed. If Q there is Brass or Iro n, or such like. If R Tin. If P , womens ornaments. If O , pictures, medals, books or such like. 5. If the fourth house be unfortunates (i.e. if the Y , S , or Q , be there, and no ways essentially dignified; or, if S , or Q , cast a d or b thereunto) you may safely judge there is no treasure at all. 6. The Lord of the fourth, or M separated from good planets, shews that there hath been some treasure in the place s upposed, but it is gone: But if he or she separate ill, tell your Querent there was never any treasure in the place supposed. 7. Some conclude the Lord of the seven th ought to shew the Nature and Quality of the Treasure. Those who have a desi re, may make tryal of that way: but for my part, I confess I understand no reason for it. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" Shall the Querent enjoy the Estate of his Father? Many there are (whose Fathers bridle them in to close) that have occasion to ask this Question; and the Astrolog er may resolve it according to these following Rules: 1. If in your Figure, you finde the Lord of the second, and Lord of the fifth, in the mutual Dignities of each other; of the Lord of the second in the fifth, or Lord of the fifth in the second; if a ny of these happen, the Querent will enjoy the Estate of his Father. 2. If the Lord of the fifth house be re trograde, or afflicted by some Malevolent Planet, it presages that much of the Estate which the Querents Father intended for him, will be w asted, or else it will be otherwise disposed of. 3.

OF JUDGMENTS BELONGING TO THE FIFTH HOUSE. This house giveth judgments of childre n, Messengers, Play s and delights, &c. and hath these Questions belonging unto it. 1. Whether a woman shall have children? 2. In what time may she conceive? 3. If a woman enquiri ng be with child?"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 4. If she be impregnated of a Boy or Girle? 5. Shall she have twins? 6. When will the birth be? 7. Of a Messenger sent of a Message? 8. Shall the Querent ga in or lose by play? He that knows how to r esolve these Questions, cannot be to seek to resolve any the belongs unto this House. I will deliver the Rules and Aphorisms that are pertinent to each Qu estion, in a section by itself , that the Artists may the more readily understand them. Whether a woman shall have Children ? 1. In the resolution of this Question , behold the Ascendant, and his Lord, and M , and see if either of them be joyned to the Lord of the fifth, (which is the House of Children) for if they be, th e Querent shall have children. And if neither of these bejoyned together, see if some other planet transfer the light of the Lord of the Ascendant to the Lord of the Fifth; For that is an Argument, that the Quer ent may have children. 2. Consider also, if the Sign of the Fifth be fruitful, and if the Lord of the fifth, the M , the Ascendant, and his Lord, be in prolifical Signs also, it is an assured Argument that the Qu erent shall have Issue. 3. If the Lord of the Ascendant, of M , shall be posited in the fifth House, say the Querent shall have children; And if th e Lord of the fifth House shall be in the Ascendant, it declares the same. 4. But, if neither the Lo rd of the Ascendant, or M , apply to the Lord of the fifth, yet if there be a translation of light and vertue between them, the Querent need not to doubt of having children. 5. If all the Significators be in sterile signs, and defective degrees of those Signs, the Querent will rarely have Issue. 6. If P the general Significator of children or Issue be afflicted, either by the presence of S , Q , or Y , or Combust of the Sun, the Querent will hardly have children. 7. Saturn, or Y in the fifth or affl icting the Lord of the Fifth, generally denies Issue; if S or Q shall be in d or b to the fifth House or his Lord, it portends the same. 8. Moreover, behold R , which hath naturally signification of children; if you finde him in the fifth, third, first, nint h, or eleventh Houses, free from all the abovesaid impediments, say that the Querent may judge the same. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" In what time may the woman conceive? 1. Having before found a possibility of Issue, you may judge in what time it may be, thus: observe in what sign you fi nde the Lord of the fifth House, and what Planet or Planets you finde him in configuration with: for, if you finde him in the Ascendant, fift h or eleventh houses, in fruitful Signs, and with fruitful planets, the Quer ent may suddenly conceive. 2. Some hold, that if the Lord of the fifth be in the firs t, the Querent may conceive in the first year. If in the s econd, the second year. If in the tenth, the third year. If in the seventh, the fourth year. If in the four th House, the fifth year. 3. Having considered the capacity and c ondition of the Querent for conception, I observe the distance between the friendly Aspects of the M , or Lord of the Ascendant, with the Lord of the fifth, and R or P , and so judge of the time. 4. If they shall be in moveable Signs , then Degrees of distance shews Weeks or Days; in common Signs, M onthes or Weeks; in fixed Signs, Yeers or Moneths. If a woman enquiring be with child? Mr. Culpeper in his Direct ory for Midwives, averreth, that it is as easie for a woman to be cozened a Moneth, &c. in her time of being with child at the first, as for to mistake one s hooe for another in the dark. If a woman therefore, suspecting her self with child, propounde d the Question, whether she be or not? answer according to these Rules: 1. If the Lord of the Ascendant, or M , behold the Lord of the fifth with any good Aspects or translation; or they, or e ither of them fortune to be posited in the fifth House; the woman enquiring is with child. 2. When the Significators apply friendly, or are posited in fruitful Signs, and if they be in fruitful Houses also, as ar e the Fifth, Eleventh, and Seventh; the party enquiring is with child. 3. The Lord of the Ascendant, or Lord of the fifth, aspecting a planet with reception in an Angle, and the M in reception with a Planet essentially fortified in an Angle also, shew s the Querent to be with child. 4. Jupiter, the natural significator of ch ildren, in the Ascendant, fifth, seventh, or eleventh Houses, no ways afflicted or the Infortunes, denotes the Querent to be with child. But if R . be afflicted of the Infort unes, or shall be Cadent, or Sub radiis, signifi cat quod non pragnans; the woman enquiring then is not with child. 5. Haly, saith, If the Lord of the Tenth and N shall be in good places of the Figure, and in friendly c onfiguration with the Fortunes, the woman then enquiring is with child. 6. Likewise, if the Moon, and the Lord of the trip licity she is in, shall be well"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" located in Signs of many children, as are D H L ; the woman then enquiring is with child. 7. If R , and P , shall be posited in Angles, free from the malicious Beams of the Infortunes; the woman enquiring is with child. 8. When you finde the Significators afflicted of S , or Q , or Y , you have then ground to judge that the wo man enquiring is not with child, but is troubled with some distemper, &c . whence she conceits her self to be with child. 9. The position of S , or Q , or Y in the fifth, shews a No n-conception: but if it so happen, that the testimonies for her being with child are the greater in number, they then threaten abortion. The like when they afflict either P , M , or the Lords of the fifth or Ascendant. Is the woman impregnated of a Boy or Girl? 1. For the resolution of this Question, you must observe the Ascendant, and his Lord, the fifth House and Lord thereof, and the M , and Planet to whom she applies; for if they, or the most of them, be in Masculine Signs, the Querent is with child of a Boy. If in Femini ne Signs, she then goeth with a Girl. 2. The aforesaid Significators being the mo st of them in Femi nine Signs, yet if they are in Aspect with Planets Masculine, and in Houses Masculine, and with Stars of a Masculine nature a nd disposition, the woman will have a Male-child. 3. Masculine Planets are S , R , Q , N ; Feminine are P , and M : O is in his nature convertible, and is either Mascu line or Feminine, according to the Planet or Planets he is in Aspect with: Yet some conclude him in his Orientality, Masculine; but occidental, Feminine. 4. Signs of a Masculine disposition or Nature, are A C E G I K And Feminine Signs, are B D F H J L These being heeded, the Sex is easily discovered. Shall she have Twins, or more than one? 1. Consider what Sign is Ascending, a nd where the Lord th ereof is, and what Sign is upon the Cusp of the fifth, &c . For, if the Significator be in Bi- corporeal or double-bodyed Signs, the Querent may very probably have two children. 2. If R P or X shall be in a fruitful Sign, eith er in the Fifth; or Ascendant, it is possible for the Querent to have three ch ildren; chiefly, if the Moon lend her assistance. 3. But if these planets be not posited in the Ascendant, or fifth house; yet, if they cast their friendly Rayes to either of them, it is an Argument the Querent hath Twins within her.

Mr. Lilly saith, If fixed signs or moveable, possess the Cusps of the Ascendant or Fifth, and the N or M be posited therein, ‘tis a certain argument the woman is w ith child but of one. When, or in what time will the birth be? 1. In resolving this Question, you are ser iously to consider the significators as well of the child, as the Person enquiring; and to observe the part of children, also (as Mr. Lilly directs:) and having truly taken it, and directed it by the oblique Ascentions, &c. unto the Degree of the fifth ho use or his Lord, or to R , or his good Aspects; and by allowing a day to each Degree of distance, you will come very neer the time of birth 2. Together with this, you ought to take notice of the time she hath to go: for it would be a meer madness in any man, to judge a woman shall be delivered at the end of a Moneth, two or three, althou gh the part of chil dren should at that time be directed to the place of R , or the Cusp of the fifth House, &c. 3. Observe therefore how long she may naturally go, and then consider what direction or transit there may be either to the fifth house, R , P , or M &c. and say at that time the woman may, be delivered; and you will not fail; chiefly, if the true transit or Directi on shall fall in the fifth, eleventh or Ascendant; and this is the way that I ob serve in such a Question. And so I end with womens business in this Chapter. Of a Messenger sent of an errand, &c. 1. If when any one enquires of you concerning a Message, &c. give the Ascendant and his Lord to him that se nt the Messenger; the seventh House and his Lord to signifie him to whom the Messenger is sent; and let the Moon signifie the Message it self: and the Lord of the fifth the Messenger, and his management or or dering of the business. 2. When the Lord of the fi fth House shall separate from the Lord of the seventh, and apply to the Lord of the Ascend ant, you may then judge the Messenger hath effected his business, and is returning again. 3. If he shall separate from the Lord of the second (I understand the Querent’s second, which is the Eighth); he then brings money with him, let the Significator of that House be e ither a Fortune or Infortune. 4. If you finde the Significator of th e Messenger separat e well, ‘tis an Argument he hath been honest, and he will bring good tidings of your business: But, if he separate from th e Malevolents, it shews the Messenger hath done his business lamely, or else hath been hindred in the performance of the Thing, or hath not done it at all. 5. But, if the Significat or of the Messenger, do apply to an Infortune by d or b and this before he can separate from the Lord of the seventh, it signifies that the Messenger hath had some let or impediment in the business he went"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" about, by the party to whom he was sent. 6. But if the Significator of the Messenger shall go to the d or b of either of the Infortunes, after he is separated from the Lord of the seventh; the Messenger will receive some prejudice or impediment in his returning home again. 7. If there shall be found an Infortune in the ninth; you may then judge that the Messenger will not travel safe, but will be in dange r of prejudice by Theeves. But if on the contrary, you finde a Fort une in the Ninth, judge the contrary. 8. I observe, if the Lord of the Ascend ant and the Lord of the Fifth are in reception, or in good aspect from good places of the Figure, that the Messenger is faithful, just, and honest; chiefly, if he shall be either a Fortune, or in good Aspect with a Fortune. But if there be no rece ption or Aspect, and he in configuration with, or in Di gnities of an Infortune, the contrary. 9. If there happen a reception between the Lord of the Seventh, and the Lord of the Fifth, you may safely judge the Messe nger will be received; and if at the same time the Lord of the Fifth or O translate the vertue of the Lord of the seventh to the Lord of the Ascendant, the Querent obtains whatever he hoped for by the Message, and this I have often proved true: and thus much may serve for the resoluti on of this Question. Shall the Querent gain or lose by Play? Divers Persons being much addict ed to play, do oftentimes run many dangerous hazards, as every days experi ence testifies: Now, for a sober Astrological Advice unto all Persons troubl ed with the Gamest ers Itch, I shall lay down these following Rules; which, if carefully observed, may prevent many prodigious mischiefs, that are commonly caused by Play. 1. The Lord of the Ascendant and Si gn Ascending, shall signifie the Querent; the Lord of the Fifth and fifth House, the Play or Game; the seventh House and his Lord, the Persons you ar e to play or Game withal. 2. If the Lord of the Fifth be in recepti on with the Lord of the Ascendant, and in good aspect, viz. a sextile, or trine, the Pe rson enquiring may advantage himself by his Play. 3. If the Lord of the Fifth, or Moon, sh all translate the light and vertue of the Lord of the eighth to th e Lord of the Second, or the Ascendant, the Querent will gain much if his Advers aries moneys by Play; or if R , being a natural Significator of Play, shall be in sextile or trine to the Lord of the Ascendant, or second, or unto the Cusps of the Ascendant or second, it signifies the same. 4. Venus in the Ascendant, or second house, in sextile or trine to a planet in the fifth, or to the Lord of the fifth decl ares the Querent to be a gainer by his play; R so posited, the same. 5. The Lord of the fift h, in the Dignities of R or O , thence casting a good"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury aspect to the Part of Fortune, or tran sferring the Light to the Dispositor of the Part of Play to the Lord of the As cendant or second house, shews gain by play. 6. But if none of these happen, but both the Lord of the Ascendant and second house be afflicted by the position of the Infortunes, or the d or b of P or the Lord of the fifth, the Queren t will then lose by his Gaming. If Y afflict the second house at the same time, and O happen to be Lord of the seventh, although he be in e or c to the Ascendant or Lord thereof, yet the Querent will be cheated and abused in his play. And this ma y serve for the judgments of the fifth house. JUDGMENTS BELONGING TO THE SIXTH HOUSE. The sixth House giveth judgments of si ckness, Servants, and small Cattle, &c. and these Questions following are commonl y attributed thereunto: 1. What part of th e body is afflicted? 2. Is the disease in th e body or minde, or both? 3. Shall the distemper be Cronique, or acute? 4. What is the cause of the distemper? 5. Shall the sick party recover, or die of the disease? 6. Of Servants, shall they prove just or knavish? 7. Of small Cattel, shall the Querent thrive by them or not? In the seventeenth Chapter of the first pa rt of this Book; I have shewed what diseases are attributed to each Planet, House, and Sign; unto which I refer the Reader that hath occasion to make use thereof: and having be en somewhat large there, in the judgments of the sixth house, I shall be the more brief in my answers to those questions: What part of the body is afflicted? Having erected your figure, you must observe the Ascendant, the sixth House and place of the M for they are natural Signif icators of the disease; and then judge as followeth: ____ 1. The Horoscope afflicted by the presence of an evil Planet, or by the position of Y there, the distemper lies chiefly in the head; (for the Ascendant always signifies the head, it bein g the first of Houses, as A is of Signs) but the sick party is afflicted also in that member or part of his body, represented by the Sign Ascending, &c. 2. If the M be afflicted by the Infortunes, say the sick party is grieved in that part of the body the Planet afflicting governs from his own House: The same understand of the Lord of the Sixth. In Chapter 17 of the first part, I have"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury inserted a Table by which you may know what Member each planet governeth in every of the twelve Si gns from his own House or Houses. 3. If the Ascendant be H , and Q and P in the Ascendant, or Sixth House, you may conclude the disease lies in the head, bowels and secrets, because Q governs those Members in either pl ace; you may understand the like of the rest. Is the Disease in the bo dy or minde, or both? 1. The Ascendant, the Dispositors of the N and M hath signification of the Spirit or minde; the Lord of the Ascendant and M the body. Now if you finde, the Ascendant, his Lord, the N and M afflicted, you may conclude the distemper hath seized the whole body, and minde also, of the sick party. 2. If the Ascendant and the Dispositors of N and M , shall be afflicted, the disease afflicts the minde; If th e Lord of the Ascendant and M be afflicted, the disease keeps court in the body, an the minde is free. 3. If Saturn afflict the Ascendant, and the Dispositors of the Luminaries, and the M at the same time in d or b him, or in d or b of the Lord of the Ascendant, the sick party is afflicted in minde; chiefly, about the things of the world, and about losses and crosses in Estate. 4. If R being Lord of evil H ouses, afflict the aforesaid Significators, (for you must know R , as he may be disposited, may be an Infortune and do mischief even as S , or Q ) the Querent is troubled in minde about Religious Tenets, &c. If P , it is about love toyes. If Q , or O ‘tis twenty to one but the sick party is Phrenetique: and th is well understood, is sufficient for to finde where the disease is resident. Shall Disease be Chronique or Acute? In the resolution of this, you are to consider the comple xion of the Person, his age, and the time of the year; for the knowledge of these conduce much to the discovery of the certainty of the ma tter propounded. Disea ses in Autumn and Winter, are usually reputed Chronical or l ong; but more long in Winter then in Autumn. In Spring and Summer, acute or sh ort, but more acute in Spring then in Summer. So infirmities afflicting young Pers ons or those in the first half of their age, are shorter or less dangerous, then t hose in elderly Persons, or those that are in the last part of their age. Likewise, Melancholy an d Phlegmatique Persons are subject to Chronical diseases; But Sangui ne and Cholerique Persons to acute. I shall not stand to give reasons to these th ings, because they ar e to be found very commonly in the writings of physicians; but shall come to speak of those necessary Rules in Astrology proper hereunto. _________ 1. Saturnine diseases which are cold and dry, are usually long and tedious; the Moon and Venus are protracters of th e infirmity; Jupiter, Mars, Sol, and Mercury, signifie diseases of no long co ntinuance (singly, and of themselves)"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury but such as return speedily; but by be ing Lords of evil places, or otherwise afflicted, they may have signi fication of Chronical Diseases. 2. The signs possessing the Ascenda nt, sixth House, or place of the M , being fixed, declare a Chronique disease; common signs shew diseases not very long, neither very short; moveable Si gns denote the disease to terminate quickly, either one way or other. 3. An Infortune being Lord of the Sixth , and in the Sixth, presages a lasting sickness: But if a Fortune be Lord of the Sixth, and in the Sixth, the disease will admit of a sudden cure. 4. The Lord of the Ascendant, and M or Lord of the Sixth in a e or c of the Lord of the Tenth, denotes the disease to be speedily cured by good medicine; and shews it to be of no long continuance. If they shall be in a e or c of the Fortunes the same. 5. But if the aforesaid, Significat ors or any of them shall be in a d or b , of the Infortunes, the disease will be both long and tedious; and if this shall happen in fixed Signs, it argues the durat ion or continuance to be the longer. And this shall serve for th e discovery of the length or shortness of a disease. What is the Cause of the Distemper? 1. The cause of the distemper is known fr om the position of the Significators of sickness (before described) in either of the four Trigons, or Triplicities; for therein they may shew the pred ominant humor that is peccant. 2. If in your Figure, they, or the most of them are in fierie Signs, they declare the distemper to have its original from Choler; whence Fevors and all such, like diseases proceed. 3. But if the Significators be in Aierie Signs, Blood is then predominant in the body, and the disease is thence cau sed; as Gouts, Leprosies, &c. 4. When in your Figure you finde the Significators of sickness in Earthy Signs, they declare the cause of the disease to have its original from Melancholy, and those diseases are us ually long and tedious, as Consumptions, Agues, &c. 5. The Significators of diseases in water y Signs, denote the infirmity to proceed from Cold and Moyst, as Flegme; a nd the diseases principally, are Coughs, Ptisique, and all noxious di seases of the Stomack. 6. When the positions of the Significat ors cannot throughly inform you of the nature of the distemper, make use of the fixed stars in your judgment, for they much assist in the discovery of the cause of a disease. Shall the sick party recover or die of the infirmity afflicting? 1. If in your Figure, the M deflux from the Infortunes, and apply to the Benevolents, without frustra tion, prohibition, or refr enation, there is great hopes the infirm party will recover. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury 2. The Significators of sickness no ways af flicted, but free from the ill Beams of the Malevolents, declare great hopes of the recovery of th e sick. If they are in c , or c of the Luminaries, or in any fr iendly reception with them, or either of them, the same. 3. The Moon increasing in light and mo tions, and being posited in good houses of Heaven, in e , or c of the Lord of the Ascenda nt, denotes great hopes of life; if the Lord of the A scendant be an Infortune, (i n this judgment) it will no ways hinder the sick. 4. When the M shall either be found in the Ascendant, in any of her own dignities, or shall cast a se xtile or trine thereunto, it is a great Argument the sick shall not die of the disease afflicting. 5. The Lord of the Ascendant, and the Moon Combust of the Sun, doth denote death, unless there be so me reception between the N and them; and if they shall be in conjunction with th e Lord of the eighth, (except R , or P interpose their friendly Be ames) it shews the same. 6. The Lord of the Eighth in an Angl e, and the and Lord of the Ascendant Cadent or afflicted of the Infortunes, presage Mortality; the application of the Lord of the Ascendant or M unto the Lord of the tent h by evil aspect, shews the same: and if he be an infort une, it has the matter past all doubt. 7. The Lord of the Ascendant in the eighth, or Lord of the eighth in the Ascendant, declares the irrecovery of the sick. If the Lord of the eighth shall be in the tenth, and the Lord of the As cendant in the fourth , sixth, or seventh Houses, any way afflicted, porte nds death to the sick party. 8. The Lord of the Ascendant and Moon with violent fixed stars, (briefly according to Latitude) as are Cor Leonis, Cor Scorpi Caput Medusa; The Serpent, the Vulture, the Pleiades, &c . denote death unto the sick. And thus much for this particular. Of Servants, shall they prove just or knavish? 1. When this question is by a Master pr opounded unto you, give the Lord of the Ascendant, and the Ascendant itself, to signifie the querent; the sixth house and his Lord, to signifie the Servant. And if you finde the Lord of the sixth commit his Dispositi on by any friendly aspect to the Lord of the Ascendant, say the servants shall prove just and honest. 2. If the Moon shall transfer the Light of the Lord of the Sixth to the Lord of the Ascendant, chiefly by a good Aspect, it sp eaks the honesty of the Servant. 3. The Lord of the sixth in the Dignities of the Fortunes in e or c to the Ascendant, pleads for the honesty of the ser vant. If he be neer Fixed Stars of a Benevolent nature, the same. 4. But if the Lord of the sixth shall be in a of the Infortunes, or in d or b to the Ascendant or Lord thereof, the servant will not behave very honest. 5. The Moon in the sixth, in quartile to the Lord of the sixth in the second, shews the Servant to be a pilfering cozening knave, and such a one as the Querent shall never grow rich by."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury 6. If the principal Significators are voyd of all reception, and there are neither good application or translation of light to be found among them, the servant is not to be trusted. 7. When S , the natural Significator of servan ts, shall be in the dignities of S or Mars, and in d or b to the Ascendant or second house, or either of their Lords, it gives great cause to suspect the Servant. If the Y be in the sixth, or doth afflict the Lord of the sixth, the same. Of small Cattle, shall the Querent thrive by them or not? 1. By small cattle, I intend Hoggs, Sheep, Goats; Coneys, &c. and if the Lord of the sixth and the Lord of the second are in a , in a good house of Heaven, the Querent may thrive by them; if they shall be in e or c , the same. 2. The Lord of the sixth cas ting a friendly Aspect to the v or being in good configuration with the Dispositor ther eof, prenotes much good to the Querent by dealing in small Cattle. 3. The Lord of the sixth in the second, in the Dignities of R or P , and R or P casting a e or c to the second, or in the second in a with him, argues great gain to the Querent by dealing in small Cattle. 4. But if on the contrary, the Lord of th e sixth shall be unfor tunate and shall he in evil Aspect with the Lord of the Ascendant or second, or cast malignant Rayes to either of their Cusps, the Querent will lose by dealing in small Cattle. 5. If the Lord of the sixth shall be in d or b to the Dispositor of the part of Fortune, or the Moon, th e Querent cannot thrive by dealing in small Cattle. The same, if the Lord of the sixth be afflicted, either by S Q or Y , shall be found either Retrograde, Combus t, Cadent, or Peregrine. 6. The Tail and Mars shews much loss therein by Knav es and Thieves, and ill bargains, &c. And Saturn denotes much damage therein by a Rot or Murrain. And so I conclude the judgm ents of the sixth house. Some may expect I should have here treated of the Decumbiture and Chrisis, &c. But having largely treated thereof in another work, I hold it altogether unnecessary to do that over ag ain, which I have already done; but shall refer the ingenious Reader thereunto. INTERROGATORIES AND JU DGMENTS BELONGING TO THE SEVENTH HOUSE. Astrologers from this House enquire of Marriages &c. Partnership, Law- suits, publike Enemies, War &c. of Th efts, Fugitives and Strays, &c. which because they are of several Complexions and Natures, I shall treat of them in three distinct Parts, the first of which shall be:"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury Of Marriage. This Part, for the better advantage of the Reader, I shall divide into these following Sections: 1. Shall the Querent Marry? 2. If Merry, how long before? 3. Shall the Querent Marry more than once? 4. What manner of Person shall the Querent Marry? 5. Shall they accord after Marriage? 6. Shall the Marriage be effected, or broke off? Shall the Querent Marry? 1. Herein you are to consid er the position of the Lo rd of the Ascendant, the Moon and Venus, and the Part of Marr iage, and their positi on; for they all have signification of the Part y enquiring in this case. 2. If either all, or the majo r part of them shall be in pr olifical or fruitful Signs; It is a very great Argument that the party enquiring shall many. 3. If the Moon or Lord of the Ascendant shall be in good asp ect with the Sun, or either of the Fortunes, or neer fixed stars of their Natures, the party may marry. 4. When the Lord of the Ascendant, the M or P , shall be in the seventh house, or in the dignities of the Lord of th e seventh, and the Lo rd of the seventh either in the ascendant, or in e or c to the aforesaid significators, the Querent no question will marry. 5. If none of these arguments appear, but on the contrary, all the Significators of marriage are in Sterile Signs, and in d or b the Lord of the seventh, or seventh house, you may conclude the Pa rty enquiring is averse to marriage; and in plain terms, he or she will not marry. If the Querent Marry, how long will it be first? 1. Finding the Significators of marriage a pplying to each other by a friendly aspect, or by a in the Oriental or Meridi onal parts of Heaven, you may judge that the Querent will be marryed suddenly; If in the Occidental part of Heaven, or Septentional, it will be mu ch prolonged, and a great while before accomplished. 2. All the Significators above the earth , and swift in Motion, do very much accelerate or hasten the matter; chiefly, if they shall be under the Earth, and slow in motion, the marr iage will be retarded. 3. I principally observe the Degrees of distance either in body or aspect, between the Lord of the Ascendant, a nd the Lord of the seventh, Sun or"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury Venus; and according to their position in fixed, Bi-corporal, or moveable signs, I judge of the time of Marriage , chiefly, if at th e same time there happen a good transit to bring on the business. 4. In this judgment, moveable signs gi ve Weeks or days; Bi-corporeal signs, give Monthes or Weeks; fixed signs , Years or monthes. The meaning whereof is this; If the Significators sh all be slow in Motion, and in fixed signs, the degrees of their distance will be so many yeers; if swift in Motion, then they give so many Monthes. Shall the Querent Marry more than once? 1. All the significators of marriage in bi-corporal or double-bodied signs, declare the Querent (be it either man or woman) to marry more than once. 2. The significators of marriage, in c onjunction, sextile or trifle with many planets, portends marriage to the Quer ent more than once; chiefly, from the fifth, seventh, or eleventh houses. 3. Many planets in the seventh house, in e or c to the Luminaries, or Lord of the Ascendant, denotes unto the Qu erent marriage more than once. 4. But if you finde all the significators of marriage in fixed signs, and in aspect with not above one planet, you may tell the querent (let it be either a he or she) that it presages marr iage no more then once. What manner of Person shall the Querent Marry, an d how Qualified? 1. See to that Planet the Lord of the Ascendant, or Moon, is neerest in aspect with, and observe the sign he is in, and describe the person (either man or woman) accordingly; for it will be such a one the Querent shall Marry. 2. If the Lord of the Ascendant or Mo on be in conjuncti on or Aspect with Venus, say the person is pleas ant and affable; If with the Sun, the Person is noble, or great Spirit, a nd imperious; If with Mars, the Person is many times rash, and furious, and subject to choler and passion. If with S , the person is inclinable to Melancholy, yet pr udent and gravely wise; If with R , you may say the person is just, honest , and religious; If with S , the person is subtil and cunning &c. Mix the fixed stars in your judgment that are neer the Significators, and the quality is known the better. 3. By considering the Digniti es and Debilities of the Plan et or Planets aforesaid, the shape, Qualifications and Temper ature of the Person whom the Querent shall marry will be the be tter known and discovered. Shall they accord after Marriage? 1. The Lord of the Ascendant, or Moon, in a e or c of the Lord of the seventh or Venus, argues much pleasu re and delight af ter Marriage, and shews they shall agree well, and not quarrel at all."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury 2. But if they shall be in d or b each unto other, it shews much quarrelling and contention to happen after Marr iage: and if they shall be in d a , or b of the Infortunes, chiefly in a ll places of the Figure, the same. 3. Saturn, Mars, or Cauda Draconis in the Ascendant, shews the Querent to be imperious after marriage, and by his or her obstin acie will occasion much discontent and trouble. But if they or e ither of them be in the seventh house, the person whom the Querent Marries, will be the occasion of the trouble and discontent. 4. Benevolent Planets possessing the se venth house, and a friendly reception between the Lord of the Seventh the Lo rd of the seventh, and Lord of the Ascendant, notes a good agreement after ma rriage. If there happen to be a reception, though they are in Qu artile, it signifies the same. Shall the marriage be effected, or broken off? 1. To any enquiring concerning the concluding or breaking off an intended Marriage, you must give the Lord of the Ascendant and Moon for Significators; and to the Person Quesited, the Lord of the seventh, and Planet from whom the M oon is separated. 2. If the Lord of the Ascendant or Moon be joyned to the Lord of the seventh, or in e or c of him, in any of his essential dignities, the Marriage intended shall be brought to perfection; chiefl y, if it shall be from good Houses of Heaven. 3. If there happen a Quartile or Oppos ition between the significators, and no manner of reception, you ma y conclude that the Marr iage intended shall be broken off, and come to nothing. 4. When there is no aspect between the Significators, see if there be by good translation of light between them, and this by a benevolent planet, and say that the Marriage may be effected by a person represented by the house that Planet is Lord or Governour of. 5. Finding the Significators of both Pa rties applying to a friendly Aspect, and before the Aspect be, an Infortune inte rposeth his malicious Rayes, you may conclude that the Marriage will be obs tructed by a person signified by the house the interposing Planet is Lord of. 6. If the interposing Planet be Lord of the Third, say that a Kinsman of the Querent, or a neighbour or Brother shall break off the business; if he shall be Lord of the tenth or fourth Houses, say the Father or Mother of the Querent will obstruct the Marri age intended, &c. I might have added divers questions more, relating to Marriage; but he that understands these, cannot be to seek in judging any others of this Nature. The Ancient Astrologers have been more la rge herein: But I labour chiefly to shew the substance of Art, not the circumstance. "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury Of Partnership, Pu blique Enemies, Law Suits, of Warr, &c. The Complexion of this part will look much the better, by being digested into these following particulars . 1. Shall two Partners agree in their Partnership? 2. Shall the Querent or his Adversary overcome in a Law-Suit? 3. Shall a Person return safe from the Wars? 4. Shall the Castle or strong Hold besieged be taken? 5. Shall the Querent have Publique Enemies? Shall two Partners agree in their Partnership? 1. The Lord of the Ascendant and sevent h, being friends according to Nature, and in reception or good asp ect each with other, decl are that the Partners shall agree in their Partnership, and ga in well by their undertaking the same. 2. If they shall be Enemies by Nature , and voyd of all good Rays toward one another, and in no reception, it is an Argument that they will never agree, but will be perpetually jangling, wra ngling and cozening each other. 3. The Lord of the Ascendant a more weighty Planet then the Lord of the Seventh, and better dignified, signifies the Querent to thrive best in the Partnership: But the Lord of the seventh the more ponderous, &c. the Quesited gains most. 4. Mars or Mercury, Lord of the Second, afflicting the Lord of the Eighth, the Querent will cheat and cozen his Partner; but if either of them shall be Lord of the Eighth, and shall afflict the Lord of the Second, the Partner shall cheat and cozen the Querent. 5. He whose significators are strongest, and in good places of Heaven shall thrive best in the Partnership, but whose Significators are weak and in evil places of the Figure, shall do worst in the Partnership. Shall the Querent or his Advers arie overcome in a Law-Suit? 1. If the Lord of the Ascendant be more potent then the Lord of the seventh, or the Ascendant better fortified then the seventh House (i.e.) either by the good aspects, or the presence of the fortunate Planets; there is great hopes the Querent will overcome in the Suit of Law, and worst his Adversarie. 2. But if the Lord of the Seventh be mo re powerful in Digniti es then the Lord of the Ascendant, and the seventh house better guarded by the presence of Rayes of the Fortunate Stars then the Ascendant, the Adversarie will overcome. 3. If the Lords of the Ascendant and th e seventh shall be afflicted by the Infortunes, neither Party sh all overcome, but they shal l be both ruined if they"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury go onward with the Suit. But if they sha ll be both afflicte d by the fortunate Planets, possibly some friend will make up the breach between them. 4. Both significators in their essentia l dignities, and in Angles, shew both Persons to be too high to hear of a r econcilement. If they apply friendly to each other, the matter will be ta ken up among themselves: he whose significator doth apply, shall seek peace, and prove himself the better Christian. Shall a Person return safe from the Wars? 1. The Lord of the Ascendant strong, a nd potent, free from the evil Beams of the Infortunes, is an Argument of great security to the Querent, and that he shall return safe from the Wars. If he shall be with a good planet, in a good house of Heaven, it shews the same. 2. If the Lord of the Asce ndant be Combust or Cadent, or in his Peregrination, admonish the Querent not to go to the Wars: If Mars (the General Patron of Wars) be weak in the figure of the Ques tion, the Querent will gain no honour or reputation by the Wars. 3. If the Lord of the Ascendant shall be with a good Plane t, and at the same time the Lord of the seventh be with an evil one, he may return home again; but he shall suffer great prejudice befor his return. 4. Saturn being in the first, or with th e Lord of the first, presageth much loss and damage to the Querent if he go to Wars: If Mars shall be with the Lord of the first, either by a , d , b , and weak; &c. and S locally in the Ascendant, the Querent will be wounded. But if Q or Y shall be ill dignified in the Ascendant, the Querent shall be w ounded to death; chiefly, if the Lord of the Ascendant and M shall suffer afflicti on at the same time. Shall the Castle or Strong Hold besieged be taken? 1. The Ascendant and Lord thereof are for the Besieger s; the fourth House, for the Castle, &c. besieged; The Lord of the fourth, for the Governour; The first House and his Lord, &c. fo r the ammunition, Souldier y, and the Assistance they either have or may expect. 2. If the Lord of the Ascendant be str ong and fortunate, and joyned to the Lord of the fourth in the Ascendant, or with the Moon or Lord of the tenth House, chiefly if any reception be; It is then an Argument that the Besiegers shall take the Castle, &c. 3.

Shall the Querent h ave Publique Enemies? Although there are but a few Persons in the world but have Publique Enemies, yet I presume there may be some (although they are rare to be found) that have none. But to finde whether a Person have any or not, these rules following shew. ____ 1. If the Lord of the Ascendant, or M , be in d or b to the Lord of the seventh, the Querent hath Publique Enem ies, or there are such Persons living in the world, that would do him a mi schief, if opportunity were offered. 2. When the Lord of the Ascendant is in d or b of many planets, the querent hath many enemies; or if many shall be in d or b to the Ascendant, the same. 3. Many planets in the seventh house, por tends many Publique Enemies: their relation, quality, or condition, is known by the houses they are Lords of, as, if Lord of the Third, they are Brethren and Kindred, &c. do so in the rest, and you cannot fail. 4. To know whether the Querent or his publique Enemies shall overcome, observe the rules of the second section in this part, and judge according to them. Of Thefts, Fugitives, And Strays, &C. 1. Of Fugitives or Strays, shall they be found or not? 2. Which way are they gone? what distance? 3. Things lost, if recoverable, or not? 4. Who is the Thief? of th e Age and Sex of the Thief. 5. Are there more Thieves then one? 6. Be they Strangers, or Familiars? 7. In what time shall the Thing stolen be recovered? Of the Fugitives or Strays, sh all they be found or not? 1.

If the Lord of the Seventh thereof sh all be Retrograde, the fugitive, &c. shall return again of his own accord, before he goeth very far from the Querents House, or from the place whence he went. 3. The Lord of the Ascendant or M in good Aspect with the Lord of the seventh, and the Lord of the seventh ap ply, it declares the f ugitive, &c. to be coming home again. If he do not a pply, the Querent may find him by enquiry. 4. But if the aforesaid Signi ficators behold each other by d or b or shall be in no Aspect at all; it denotes the Fugitiv e unwilling to return again, and an unliklihood of the Querents having him again: If the Lord of the seventh be in the Third or Ninth, you may say the Fugitive is gone a journey, and will not suddenly be found again. 5. If a Horse, Ox or Cow, &c. be straye d, observe the Lord of the Twelfth; and if he be found Retrograde, you may judge the stray will return of its own accord; and observe the same rules as be fore, only with the change of the Lord of your House. 6. If the M shall transfer the Light of the Lord of the Fugitive or Stray to the Lord of the Ascendant, it argues hope s of recovering them again. If she transfer S ’s Light or vertue, &c . it signifies the same. 7. The M in Good configuration with R . or P , or either of them; casting a good aspect to the Ascendant or his Lo rd, from good Houses of the Figure, shews hopes of a recovery. 8. The Lord of the seventh, either in the twelfth Hous e of the Figure or Question, denotes the Figure to be under the Bonds of restraint, perhaps in a Prison: S posited so, argues the same. 9. When in the Figure you finde any Pl anet separating from the House of the Moon, the Beast, &c. strayed, is ta ken into custody, and driven away and sold: if any planet shall be found to sep arate from the Lord of the second, the same. 10. If the M or Significator of the Stray, &c . shall apply to the Lord of the Eighth from his Ascendant, or shall be in the Eighth, it is then dead. If the Dispositor of the M , or Significator of the Be ast shall be posited in the Eighth House, applying to the d or b of an Infortune in the Fourth, the same. 11. The Lord of the Sixth or Twelfth, in the Sixth or Twelfth, or in the Ninth or Tenth, argues the Beasts strayed to be either in the Pound, or under the Command of some Officer. 12. The Lord of the Seventh, Twelfth, or Sixth, fortunated by the good Beams of Jupiter or Venus in the second, fi fth or eleventh houses or the N casting a c unto them there, they are very likely to be found again.

If the Significator of th e strays be in watry signs, they are Northward, and in some moyst Moorish places. If in Aier y signs, they are westward, and in Mountainous and high places. If in Earthy Signs, they are Southward, and in Melancholy Desert places, as Woods, &c. If in Fiery Signs, they are Eastward; and in open Places, where ground hath been newly digged up: you must always prefer the Sign before the Quarter. 3. The Moon in the same Quarter with the Lord of the Ascendant, there being not above one sign distance between them, they are then neer the place whence they went at first. But if they are distant above ninety Degrees, then they are gone far from the Querent. 4. If the M be distant from the Significator of the Fugitive or Stray, either seventeen furlongs, &c. from the Owner; if in Common Signs , they are five furlongs distant from the Owner, if in fi xed signs they are one furlong distant from the Owner: when there is a greater distance in Degrees, proportion your distance or place according to this Rule. Of things stolen or lost, if recoverable or not? 1. Fortunate Planets in e or c to the Lords of the Ascendant or second house, and dispositor of the Part of Fortune, and posited in the Ascendant or second House, declares recove ry of the goods lost. 2. Either of the fortunes in the Ascenda nt, having Dignities in the second house, or the Moon in the seventh, in e or c to the Lord of the Ascendant; both these are very certain Arguments of a r ecovery of the Thing or Things lost. 3. The Moon in the Tenth, in c to a Planet in the sec ond, or in the second in c to the Lord of the second ; or the Dispositor of the Part of Fortune, the Lord of the Ascendant in the Second; the lights in c to each other or in c to the Cusp of the second House, or the Lord of the second in the el eventh or fourth Houses; all these are Arguments of recovery. 4. The Lord of the Eighth in the Ascenda nt, or with the Lord of the Ascendant, denotes a recovery of the Goods lost: Ju piter, Venus or North Node in the eleventh house, give great hopes of th e same also, and th is I have often proved true. 5. The Moon, Part of Fortune, or his Dis positors, or Lord of the second in the eighth House, is a great Argument that the Goods lost cannot be recovered. 6. When both Luminaries are under the Ea rth, the Thing lost is hard to be recovered: If the second House or his Lord be any way hindred, it denotes the same. 7. But the greatest argument of an irrecovery, are the position of S , Q , or Y out of their essential Dignities in the se cond house; or the Lord of the second being either in Combustion, or in the eighth House; or if the Lord of the second be in d , or b with the Lord of the eighth. 8.

Who is the Thief? an d of his Age and Sex. 1. Astrologers account a Peregrine Planet in an angle, the significator of the Thief; chiefly, if the Peregrine Planet ha ve Dignities in the seventh House, or fortune to be Lord thereof: Because (say they) he being out of all his essential Dignities, may be well supposed to be in a condition necessitous and consequently shall prove the Thie f: The inference doth not naturally follow the premises; for a man may be poor and hon est; and although the Planet in an angle be peregrine; yet, if he neither afflict the substance, or his Lord; the part of fortune, or his Lord, &c. I shall take him to signifie a poor honest man in his place; but cannot ad mit him as significator of a Thief. 2. When no Planet maliciously Aspects the aforesaid Significators, you may admit the Lord of the Seventh to signi fie the Thief because he hath natural signification of theft and Thieves. 3. Let the planet afflicting the substance, or part of Fortune, or their Lords, be Peregrine, or essentially dignified, he shall signifie the Thief. And whereas some exempt a Planet essentially dignifi ed, from participating in any thing of this nature, I do not; for such a planet, as he is strong, he is able to do the most mischief. 4. If the planet afflicting the substan ce, &c. be masculine, and in a masculine sign and Quarter, it denotes the Thief to be a man. If the Planet be feminine, and in fortunate parts of the figure, you may conclude that the Thief is feminine, or a woman. 5. Saturn significator of the Thief, shews th e Thief to be old, except in the beginning of Signs: The Sun, Mars and Jupiter, about thirty, or somewhat more; Venus and Merc ury, youthful; the M , according to her age; in the first quarter, she signifies young; in her second quarter, between twenty and thirty; in her third, between thirty and forty five; in her fourth, between forty five and sixty. 6. A planet being in his Orientality, denotes the Thief more young; but in his Occidentality, the Thief is more aged . And thus much may serve for the Significator of the Thief, and for the discovery of the Age and Sex thereof. Are there more Thieves than one? 1. Many Planets afflicting the Significator s of substance, (it matters not whether they be Peregrine or not) shew many Th ieves, or more Thieves then one. 2. If the Significator of the Thief be in e or c with other Planets, chiefly in double-bodied Signs, there are more Thieves then one, although but one be found to afflict the Significators of substance. 3.

Be they Strangers, or Familiars? 1. The Luminaries beholding the Ascendant (or his Lord) or the Lord of the First in the first, in conjunction with the Lord of the Seventh; denotes the Thief to be a familiar, or one known to the Loser. 2. When the Lights are in their proper H ouses, or in the Houses of the Lord of the Ascendant, or in the Triplicity of the Lord of the Ascendant, it denotes the Thief well known to th e Querent or Loser. 3. The signification of the Thief strong in the Ascendant; noteth a Brother or Kinsman, chiefly if he chance to be th e Lord of the Third: The Lord of the seventh in the seventh, he is of the household. 4. The Lord of the Ascendant in the third or fourth hou se (saith Mr. Lilly) accuseth thine own household servant, An d this (saith he) I have oft proved true by experience. 5. The Significator of the Thief, in the Third or Ninth from his own House shews the Thief to be a stranger. If the Lord of the Ascendant, and the seventh, or significator of the Thief, be not of one Triplicity, it denotes the same. 6. Mars or Mercury significator of th e Thief, presages him to be a common profest knave; unless they govern a House of relation: which if they do, then they tell you who it is. 7. If the Thief be Domestical, Mr. Lilly teacheth us to know him thus: N , signifies Father or Mother; M , the Mother or Mistress; P the Wife or a woman; S a servant, or a stranger lying there by chance; Q , a Son, Brother, or Kinsman; O a youth, Familiar or Friend. A nd so I conclude this Section. In what time shall the Th ing stolen be recovered? 1. Seeing testimonies of recovery in your Figure, you may also discover the time thus:Observe the application of th e two Planets signifying recovery, and consider the Degrees of distance betw een their body or Aspect, and so turn the distance into time. 2. If they happen to be in moveable si gns, then give so many weeks or days as you have Degrees of distance, for the space, or time in which it may be recovered. If in common signs, give mont hes or weeks: If fixed signs, Years or Monthes. 3. When the N and M together behold the Ascend ant, the Thing lost shall suddenly be recovered; for they suffer nothing to lie long hid, or obscured: And if at the same time, the Lord of the Second be in the Ascendant, it will be had again very speedily. 4. The Significators increasing in light and motion, and posited in fortunate places of the Figure, presage a sudden re covery of the Goods lost or missing."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury I could have been more larg e in each particular of this Chapter; but my intent was to furnish the ingenious, with the b est and most approved Rules, and not with impertinent flourishes: beside s, should I have added each trivial circumstance, I should have obstructed the active fancie of some, and blunted the edge of the quick genius of othe rs; both which sins I have avoyded, by contracting my matter in this shor t (yet I presume sufficient) compass. JUDGMENTS PROPER TO THE EIGHTH HOUSE. This is the House of Death; and hen ce we enquire of the Death of each Querent, the manner thereof, &c. it is also the Significator of the Dowrie of the Wife, it being the Second from the Ei ghth: the Questions proper unto it are these: 1. Of the time of the Death of the Querent. 2. What manner of Death may he die? 3. Shall the Querent obtain the Wives Portion? 4. Shall the Querent or his Wife die first? Of the time of the Death of the Querent 1. In the resolution of this Question, you are to consider the Lord of the Ascendant, the Ascendant it self, and the M , for the Querent; the eighth House and Lord thereof, and the part of Death, together with the Planet or Planets in the eighth, to signi fie the Death of the Querent. 2. If the Lord of the Ascendant, and the M , be free from the Evil Beams of the Infortunes; or if no Infortunes or Y be posited in the Ascendant; these argue no danger to the Querent, but shew him to be of an indifferent long life. 3. If the aforesaid Significators, or eith er of them, shall be in conjunction or good aspect of the Fortun es, or the Fortunes posite d in the Ascendant, and the Part of Life free; all these presa ge the Querent according to Nature may live to a considerable Age. 4. Finding all the significators free, as in the fore-mentioned Aphorisms, you may conclude the Querent will live so many years, as there are Degrees between the a d or b of the Lord of the Eight h House, and the Lord of the Ascendant. 5. Or if (before the Lord of the Ascenda nt receive this affliction from the Lord of the Eighth,) he happen to be Combust of the Sun; chiefly, in the fourth, eighth, twelfth, or sixth Houses, the Degrees of distance between the Sun and he, shew the years the Quer ent may live, before he shall conclude his life. 6. But if you finde the aforesaid Significat ors afflicted, either by the Infortunes, or by the Lords of the fourth, sixth, eighth or twelfth Houses, you may then conclude the Parties life to be of no very long continuance. And in your"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury measure of time, you may give for Degr ees of distance, &c. in moveable Signs; in common signs, monthes; in fixed signs, yeers; and so may you discover the length (according to Natu ral causes) of th e Querents life. 7. I always (when a Question of this Nature is propounded to me) draw my figure into a Speculum, and direct th e Significators as in a Nativity; and when the Ascendant or Hylech sha ll come to any malicious direction (according to Maybod’s measure of time, as I have taught in the first part) I adjudge the person enquiring may be cu t off from the Land of the living. But this is to be understood, when the Na tivity of a Person is not to be had; for Horary Questions are onely substituted in the room or place of the Nativity: But if the Nativity be once discovered, the Question must give place unto it. What manner of Death the Querent die? 1. Either the Lord of the Eighth, or Pl anet posited in the eighth, shall shew the manner or kinde of Death the Querent sha ll be subject unto, together with the Planets beholding him or them. 2. If the aforesaid Significators shall be Jupiter or Venus, and they in their essential Dignities, they portend a gen tle death unto the Querent, except violent fixed stars be neer them. 3. Saturn being Significator, prenotes D eath by some violent Tertian, or some Ague, Dropsie, or Consumption; Q , by fevers or wounds; the N , by Pleuresies, or by some obstructions of the Vitals; O , by the ptisique, Frenzie, Madness, Lethargie, &c. M by drowning, or by Diseases proceeding from cold and moysture. 4. Whosoever judges of the kinde of th e Death of any Querent, I would advise to make use of those Rules and Aphorisms layd down in the judgments belonging to the eighth House in the Do ctrine of Nativities, for therein he may much advantage himsel f in that particular. Shall the Querent obta in his Wives Portion? 1. Every Querent is signified by the Ascendant, and the second House doth signifie his substance; The Quesited is signified by the seventh house, and the eighth House hath signification of the Querent’s substance, in this Question. 2. The Lord of the Eighth in the Eighth , no ways impedited or hindred by the unfortunate Planets, declares the Queren t shall have a good Estate with his Wife and shall have it without trouble. 3. Jupiter or Venus, or the Dragons He ad posited in the eighth house, or the cusp of the eighth in the terms of th e fortunes, the Lord of the eighth being no ways impedited, argues the Querent shall have his Wives Portion without any manner of trouble. 4.

But if there be d or b between the Significators, and no reception or translation of light; or if the Lord of the eighth shall be combust or Retrograde, the Querent will not obta in the Portion of his Wife without trouble and Difficulty. 7. If S or Q shall be in the eighth, and Peregrine, very little of the Wives Portion will be obtained; if any, ther e will be so much contention about it, that it were better for him to be without it. The Dragons Tayl in the eighth, portends the same. A Woman enquiring concerning th e Estate of a man she is to marry, these Rules will serve sufficiently; for the Ascendant is all one for the woman as it is for the man, if a woman enquire; and the seventh House must then be fir the man, and the eighth for his Estate. Shall the Man or Wife die first? 1. In this Question, behold the Lord of the Ascendant and the Lord of the Seventh 1 , and see which of them goeth to a d or b of the Lord of the eighth House, or to Com bustion of the Sun, or to the evil Aspects of the unfortunate Planets , and so judge. 2. If it be the Lord of the Ascendant that first suffereth this affliction, say the man (if a Man be Querent) shall die firs t; if the Lord of the seventh goeth first to those afflictions; the Woman wil die first. 3. Which of the Significators is strongest and most powerful in the Figure, the party signified thereby shall live the longest. And thus much may serve for the judgments belonging to the eighth House. INTERROGATORIES PERTAINI NG TO THE NINTH HOUSE. We judge of Voyages to Sea, their prospe rity or infelicity; of Science, &c. and of Persons and Things Religious, by the Ninth House: and these Questions are the most common hereunto: 1.

But if they shall be in d or b , voyd of all reception; or if there happen no good translation between them, you ma y judge the Querent will have an inauspicious Voyage of it; and before he return home again, will wish he had let it alone. 5. If the Lord of the Ascendant or M , shall be in a with a fortunate Planet in the tenth House, (that being the sec ond from the ninth) you may tell the Querent that he shall gain great store of Wealth by the V oyage he undertakes, and also shall have health of body. 6. But if the Lord of the Ascendant or M shall be in abject places of the Figure, or with the Lords of abject Houses, or in d or b to them, either Peregrine or Combust of the Sun, the Person will fall sick in the Journey, and the Voyage will be most unfort unate.

The Significators of the Person enquiri ng, and the Voyage, swift in Motion, Oriental, and in moveable Signs, denotes the Voyage to be short, and quick; but they being Occidental, shews some obstruction. 2. When the Lord of the Ascendant applies to the Lord of the ninth, or the Lord of the ninth to the Lord of the Ascendant ; or if a fortunate Planet transfer the light of the one to the other; Thes e are good Arguments of a safe return, considering the length of the voyage. 3.

The Lord of the Ascendant or Moon joyned unto the Lord of the ninth by body or by good aspect, gives great hope s that the Minister or Querent may obtain the Personage or Benefice sought after. 3.

Observe that Planet who calls a d or b either to the Lord of the Ascendant or Moon, and take notice of the House he is Lord of: for by that means, you may discover what, or who will be the occasion of hindring the business from taking effect. 11. The afflicting Planet being Lord of the Third, denotes a Neighbour, &c. to be the impeditor of the Thing; If of the Eleventh, some pretended friend plays the Knave with him; If of the Tenth, the Patron hath no good liking to him; If of the seventh or fifth, he is noted for a contenti ous and scandal ous Person, &c. 12. Fortunate Planets in fortunate Pl aces of the Figure, befriending the Significator, gives hopes of the business enquired after: If infortunate Planets being in unfortunate Places of the Figur e shall afflict the Significators of the business, it will not come to anythi ng.

Shall a Person remain in th e employment he possesses? 1. When a Person is in an Employment, Office &c. and is jealous of being turned out of the same; see if the Lo rd of the Ascendant or Moon, and the Lord of the Tenth, are going to Conjuncti on, or to any friendly Aspect, viz, a e or c or if there be any reception bet ween the two chief Significators; you may conclude that the Querent shall hol d and keep the Employment he at the present possesses, or makes enquiry after. 2. If the Lord of the Ascendant shall be in e or c to either of the two fortunes in the tenth House, and no affliction happen unto him from the infortunes, you may conclude the Querent shall enj oy the place he at present possesses. 3. The Lord of the Ascendant in the Tent h, or the Lord of the Tenth in the Ascendant, prenotes the Querent to k eep and remain in the place he at present possesses. 4. But if the Lord of the Ascendant or M , shall be in d or b with any Planet or Planets, and the same Planets in a e or c with the Lord of the Tenth, or the N you may conclude that the Quer ent will lose the Employment he possesses; and tell him that such and such Persons, that are Signified by the Planets in a e or c with the Lord of the Tenth, or the N , are endeavouring his prejudice in the business. 5. The Lord of the Ascendant Retrogra de and Combust of the Sun, shews the Querent to have incurr’d the displeasur e of those that ha ve power over him, and that they will take away the O ffice or Employment he holds from him therefore. 6. If the M or Lord of the Ascendant shall be in d or b , (and voyd of all manner of reception) with the Lord of the Tenth or the Sun, it portends the Querent in danger to lose the Office or Employment he holds or possesses. 7. The Lord of the Ascendant or M , separating from the Lord of the Tenth or the Sun, declares the Querent in da nger of losing the Office or Employment he holds; chiefly, if from their separation they apply to the malicious Aspects of the Infortunes. What Magistery or Prof ession will be best fo r any one to follow? This Question is only fit to be propounded by such Pers ons that are capable of a Profession, &c. and not by those that live and move in a higher sphere: and when a Person convenient and proper pro pounds the Question, either for himself or friends, &c. you may answer him acco rding to these fo llowing Rules and Aphorisms.

You are to consider the Lo rd of the Ascendant, and the M , for the Person enquiring; and the Lord of the tenth House, and the Planets Q and P , for the Trade or Profession of the Querent, &c . and consider the Aspects between the significators according to the Signs you finde them pos ited in, and so judge of the Profession of the Querent. 2. If the Significators or the major part of them shall happen in fiery Signs, you may judge the Querent will do well in any Profession that relates thereunto, according to his capacity of birth; as, if he be of quality suitable, let him turn Chymist, Physitian, Chirurgeon, Goldsmith, Silversmith, Jeweller or Apothecary: If of a mean condition he may make a good Armorer, Cutler, Smith, Baker, Glas-maker, or the like. 3. The Significators in Aereal Signs, if th e birth of the Querent be not mean, he may make a good Lawyer, Arithmeticia n Accomptant, Geometrician or Surveyor, Scriverner, Cl erk, Astronomer, &c. But if he be of mean Parentage, he may make a good Haber dasher of small Wares, a Millianor, a Painter, Draper, or one that may deal in all retain Commodities. 4. But if the Significators shall be in early Signs, the Querent may make a good Farmer, or Husbandman, Gardner, Groom, Grasier, Farrier or Coach-maker, Butcher or Brick-maker, Joyner, or Carpenter, Turner, or Shoo-maker, Collier, Shepherd, Neatherd, Day-labourer; and indeed, any kinde of a servile work or Employment. 5. The Significators of the Trade or Prof ession, in watery Si gns, may denote the Querent to do well in Brewing, Malting, in selling Wines, in Victualling, in turning a Fish-monger or Saylor: he may make a good Water-man, or do well in any thing that belongeth to the watiy Element. 6. When the Lord of th e Ascendant shall be in e or c to either all or most of the Significators of Trade, and they pos ited in Angles or other good Houses of the Figure, you may sa y the Querent shall do very well in the Trade or Profession he shall follow, if the M shall be in the like good configuration with any of them, it portends the same. 7. But if the Significators of Trade shall be afflicte d in Cadent places of the Figure, and the Lord of the Ascendant or M in d or b unto them or either of them, you may then say that the Qu erent will not thrive by his Trade or Profession he may follow.

"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury JUDGMENTS BELONGING TO THE ELEVENTH HOUSE. This House giveth judgments of the friends of each Querent, their Falsness or Fidelity, and of his hopes, &c. The Questions that are most common unto it, be these:. 1. Shall the Friends of the Qu erent prove faithful to him? 2. Shall the Querent obtain what he hopeth for? All other things relating particularly to this house, are comprehended under these two Heads; therefore I shall not use any further Division. Shall the Friends of the Qu erent prove faithful? &c. 1. The Ascendant and his Lord are for th e Querent, and the eleventh House and Lord thereof for the friend of the Querent. Now if there happen any benevolent Aspects between the Lords of the Ascendant and eleventh, or any friendly reception or translation of light between them, you may judge the friend of the Querent is not to be su spected, but he will prove faithful. 2. If the Moon shall aspect the Lord of the eleventh friendly, or there happen any good translation of light or recep tion between them, and this in good places of heaven; the friend proves just and faithful. 3. The Dispositor of the part of friends, in a e or c or in good reception with the Lords of the Ascendant in good Hous es of Heaven, and neer Stars of a benevolent nature, argues the Querents friend to be just and faithful unto him. 4. The Lord of the Ascendant or M in the eleventh House, and the Lord of the eleventh in the Ascendant, shews a reciprocal affec tion between the Querent and his friend. If either of the Fortun es cast their friendly beams unto them both at the same time , it argues the same. 5. On the contrary, if you find the Lord of the Ascendant or Moon in d or b of the Infortunes in the eleventh, or of the Lord of th e eleventh, you may safely judge the friends of the Querent are not faithful unto him. If there be no reception between them, you may be the more confident of your Judgment. 6. The Dragons Tayl afflicting the eleven th House, or the Lord thereof, shews the friends of the Querent to be very d eceitful, let them pretend never so fair. The same, if the Lord of the eleventh sh all be neer violent fixed Stars, as the Caput Algol, Oculus Tauri, Serpentarius, the Chale, &c. And if any of these happen to be in the eleventh House, neer the Cusp, they poyson the faith of friends. 3 7. If the natural Significator s of friendship (which are R and P ) shall be posited in the Ascend ant, or cast a friendly Aspect thereunto, or to the Lord"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury thereof, or M ; the friends of the Querent may pr ove faithful. But if they cast a d or b to the M or Lord of the Ascendant, or Ascendant itself; it bids the Querent beware of pretended friends. Shall the Querent obtain what he hopeth for? 1. When a person hath hopes of a thing, and is unwilling to declare what it is, yet would be resolved what the eff ect thereof may be, and accordingly propounds the Question aforesaid, you ar e to give the Ascendant and his Lord to Signifie him, and the eleventh House and his Lord, together with the fortunate Planets, to signifie th e matter or Thing hoped for. 2. And if you finde the Si gnificators in reception, or in good Aspect, with each other, you may conclude the business or matter hoped for, is possible to be attained; or if there be any good Transl ation of Light, or dwelling in Houses, it argues the performance of the Thing. 3. If the Lord of the Ascendant, and the Lord of the Eleventh , shall receive each other in Angles, or shall be received of the fortunate Planets in Angles or succedents, you may conclude, the Thing that the Querent hopeth for, shall be accomplished. 4. Either the Lord of the Ascendant, or M , received in fixed Signs, do shew the Querent shall obtain the business that he hopeth for, and that compleatly; if in moveable Signs, he shall either have nothing of what he hopes for, or else so little, that he had even as good have been without it: If in Bi-corporeal Signs, he shall then have onely a pa rt of what he hopeth to obtain. 5. But if on the contrary, you finde the Significators in d or b , and voyd of all manner of reception, having no good translation of Light between them; or if they shall be Combust, Cadent, Peregrine or Retrogra de, or with fixed Stars of an evil influence, you may th en judge the matter hoped for, will hardly be brought to perfection, or if it be the Queren t will have so many incumbrances and perplexities with it, that he will be willing to shake it off again, for the evils sa ke that attends it. 6. But if in the propounding the question, the Querent telleth you the particular Thing he hopeth for, you must then take your signification thereof from its proper place, and so vary your abovesai d Rules in your Judgment. And thus much may serve for the judgments of the eleventh House. JUDGMENTS BELONGING TO THE TWELFTH HOUSE. We judge by this House, of private En emies, Captivities and Imprisonments and the Questions hereunto belonging are : 1. Hath the Querent private Enemies? 2. Who are they, or how may he know them?"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions : John Gadbury 3. Of a Prisoner or Captiv e, when may he be freed? These questions being resolved, I shall co nclude the judgments, not only of this House, but of the Doctrine of Horarie Questions; and so put a period to this more prolix discourse of Astrol ogie than I at first intended. Hath the Querent private Enemies? 1. This Question being proposed indiffer ently, observe what Aspect there may be between the Lord of the Ascendant and twelfth House, and from what House of Heaven it happens; and so j udge of the Querents private Enemies. 2. If the Aspect be by d or b , and out of malignant Ho uses of the Figure, you may conclude the Querent hath privat e Enemies; and if the Lord of the Twelfth be a Superiour Planet, as S , R , or Q , and any way dignified, the Enemies are the more to be feared: But is he be any of the inferiors, they are not so dangerous: the more powerful the Significators of the Enemies are, the more detriment will the Querent sustain by them; the less powerful, the less evil and mischief will they be bale to do. 3. Generally in my Practice, I finde, if the Lord of any other House besides the Twelfth, be in d or b to the Lord of the Ascendant or M or to the Ascendant it self, from obscure places in the figure, the Querent hath private Enemies. 4. The Ascendant, the Lord thereof, and the M voyd of the ev il Aspects of any Planet or Planets, and befriended by th e good Rayes of the fortunes, and the Lord of the Ascendant and the in fo rtunate places of the Figure, you may conclude the Querent hath no private Enemies. Who are his private Enemies? how may he know them? 1. For to resolve this Question truly, y ou must observe the Position of the Lord of the Ascendant and twelfth House; fo r, if the Lord of the Twelfth shall afflict the Lord of the Ascendant, or the Ascendant from the third House, the Lord of the Third afflicting, tell the Querent his chiefest private Enemies are those that live neer him, or are neerly related to him; that is to say, either a Brother, Kinsman, Neighbour, &c. de scribe the person by the Planet afflicting, and the Sign in which he is posited. 2. If the Lord of the Twel fth afflict the Ascendant or his Lord from the fourth House, &c. the Father of the Querent is his Enemy; if in the Fifth, his children, (if he have any) or some Messenger, &c. will prove his private prejudicers; If in the sixth House his se rvants, or an Unkle will maligne him; If in the seventh House, &c. the Wife, or Partne r shall prove secretly mischievous unto him. 3. You shall finde the Person or Persons signified by that House, where the Dragons Tail is posited, to be malicious and prej udicial to the Querent; chiefly, if the Lord thereof afflict the Lord of the Ascendan t, the Ascendant it"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" The Doctrine of Horarie Questions, Gadbury self, or the Moon, at the same time. Of a Prisoner or Captive, when may he be freed? 1. The Lord of the Ascendant or Moon swift in Motion, denotes freedome from imprisonment in a short time; If either of them commit their vertues or dispositions to any Planet or Planets in the Third or Ni nth, or unto either of the Lords of then, not being posite d in Angles, argue s a release from imprisonment in a short time. 2. If the Lord of the Ascendant or M , shall be more potent in the Figure then the Lord of the Twelfth, or shall be separating from the ill Aspects of the Lord of the Twelfth, or the Dispositor of the part of Imprisonment, chiefly in moveable Signs, and thence immediatel y applying to the friendly Beams of the Fortunate Planets, viz. R or P you may then judg e the Prisoner or Captive cannot remain long in the Pris on where he is, but will be released. 3. The Lord of the Ascendant or M , in the Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, or Twelfth, or under the Suns Beams, or Retrograde, or unhappi ly afflicted of the Infortunes, viz. S or Q the Person under restraint will not be released from his bonds in a long time. And if the Infortune happen to be Lord of the Eighth, he will die in Prison. 4. If the Lord of the Ascendant or M , shall separate from the Lord of the Fourth, and immediately apply to R or P or if the Lord of the Fourth shall separate from the Lord of the As cendant; these argue good hopes that the Captive or Prisoner shall escape, and sh all not be unforced to lie in Prison long. 5. A fixed sign ascending at the time of the Question, and the Lord thereof a ponderous Planet, and in an Angle, it portends a tedious time of imprisonment. If common Signes, the affliction will not be so long; If moveable, it will be very short: If the Lord of the Ascendant be Cadent from his House or Exaltation, a nd the Moon happen to be in H or K , it presages long imprisonment. 6. If the Lord of the hour in which the Prisoner was taken, be an unfortunate Planet, and Unfortunately placed in the Heavens, it declares a tedious imprisonment, a very long Captivity: Bu t if he shall be a Fortune, the imprisonment cannot be long. 7. The only way for the discovery of th e time in which a Prisoner or Captive shall be released, is, by observing the Degrees of distance between the Significators and the Fortunate Planets or the Sun; and according to the Signs they shall be found in, be they either fixed, common or moveable, (as I have taught in several Places before) you ma y measure the Days, the Weeks, the Months, or Yeers of the Prisoners or Captives slavery.
