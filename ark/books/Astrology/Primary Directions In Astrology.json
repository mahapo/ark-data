For a long time the study of Primary Directions by the Semiarc method, together with expenditure of money on men of leisure capable of worki ng out a horoscope to a conclusion, I have come to the conclusion not onl y that Directions by Primary Arcs as commonly practised are unreliable, but also that they are unduly complex and therefore fi nally unsatisfactory. Here and there one finds luminous examples of the efficacy of these Directions, but mature experienc e shows that it is only at those points where they come into line wit h the true method of Direction. The notable failure of the Semiarc method to find adequate Directions for the most astounding War that was ever waged by men on this planet ought to show that at the crucial point of test th is system was a failure. Where, for instance, are the Prim ary Arcs in the horoscope of the Kaiser Wilhelm II, which ushered in this Great War? Where are the astounding and epoch-making Directions in the horoscope of King George V during the years 1914 and subsequently? Such as transpired in the course of calculati on were of a nature to which we are rendered familiar in the everyday life of the man who has lost a job and found another waiting for him! They are inadequate, insignificant, and astrologically puerile. Commander Morrison, for whose faculty I have always had the most profound respect, seems to hav e originated the method. It has been referred to Ptolemy by him and also by others, but I have not found anything in Ptolemy’s works which seems to indicate the exact method of his Directions, the most explicit of his statements being in favour of Directions by Oblique Ascension and Right Ascension, according to the quarter of the heav ens in which the Direction is formed. All such considerations di sappear in the Se miarc method, and the system at first devised has been rendered more complex by the introduction of Placidean Directions or Directions in Mundo. Now there are only two Direction s which can be made to any body, one is to its longitude in the zodiac and the other to its bodily place in the heavens. These are known as Directions in zodiac and in Mundo. But the immense mistake has been made of directing all bodies as if they were at the same elevation, instead of occupying various altitudes in the prime vertical."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" In the following pages it will be seen that only one method is followed, and this has respect to the varying altitudes of the several bodies directed to the places and as pects of others. The principle involved is, however, so simple of expression and so easy of application, while at the same time so completely satisfactory in results, that I have sought to br ing it into popular use by making it instantly accessible to any student fortified wit h a set of Tables of the Houses. After all, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and a method which indicates the course of events is preferable to any other that fails at crucial points, and only comes into line with the facts from time to time. Without in any sens e disparaging the great and really valuable labours of such writers as Commander Morrison, the noted author of the “Grammar”, and his successor, Mr. A. J. Pearse, whose “Text Book” and “Science of t he Stars” will always hol d a notable position in astrological literature, I cannot afford in the interests of the science to overlook the very great defects of the Semiarc method in regard to this world’s great epoch. One has only to refer to the arguments of its chief expositor ( Zadkiel’s Almanac, 1914-15) to see that recourse has to be made to the Directions of one Promi ttor to another, and of Significators to Fixed Stars, in order to account for the outbreak of the War, whereas it is contrary to the acknowledged practice and teaching to employ the planets as if they were Significators, which prerogative belongs only to the Sun, Moon, Ascendant and Midheaven. For if we start to direct planet to planet, and the various Signif icators to all the Fixed Stars in the zodiac, there will be no end to the array of arcs which problematically might be advanced as accounting for the course of events. Now we call the Sun, Mo on, Midheaven and Ascendant, “Significators”, because they signify something, and the planets we call Promittors because, by their several positions in the horoscope of birth, they promise something of good or ill according to their condition and aspects. The Significators remain in their radical places, and by the revolution of the earth the planet s are brought to the places and aspects of these radical Significator s. This is the bedrock of all our argument. For, by taking the Significators at their several elevations and directing the planets to them we shall find satisfactory indications of all the chief events in any life, whether it be that of king or commoner, prince or peer. In the following pages I shall show how these natural Directions are formed and how they may be approximately reckoned by mere reference to the Tables of the Houses, always within 15’ or three m onths of their exact mathematical measure, and several illustrations will be given to show that we need not go beyond them to find adequate illust ration of the principles of at true astrology."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"PRIMARY DIRECTIONS MADE EASY _______ CHAPTER 1. _______ Principles of Directing _______ What are known as “Directions” in Astrology are arcs of a right sphere measured in the plane of the Equator. They are counted from the point of Right Ascension occ upying the Midheaven at the moment of birth to the point which occupi es the Midheaven when the Direction is completed. The process of directing is the means by which we compute these arcs. To direct one celestial body to the conjunction or aspect of another in the zodiac we have to find the equatorial degrees which will pass over the meridian of a place while the first of these bodies moves to the place of the seco nd, either by Right Ascension or by Oblique Ascension. If we take in hand a Table of Hous es for any latitude, we shall see what degree of the zodiac is risi ng when a given Right Ascension coincides with the Midheaven. If now we add 30 degrees to the Midheaven we shall find that more or less than 30 degrees have passed over the horizon or Ascendant. The motion of the zodiac over the Midheaven is by Right Ascension, that over the horizon is by Oblique Ascension. Herein lies the difference in the method of directing. For if we suppose a body to have occupied the Midheaven at the time of a birth and another to be lower down the eastern heavens, then, by the motion of the Earth on its axis from West to East, the second body will be carried from the East towards the West and in certain degrees of Right Ascension it will reach the place originally held by the first body on the Midheaven. Now as all planets are held to impress their influence on the particular point of the heavens which they hold at the moment of birth, this coming of the planet to a place of another is to be regarded as a c onjunction of the two bodies. Therefore, in directing to the Midheaven, or to a planet which holds the Midheaven, we direct by degrees of Right Ascension, but to any other part of the heavens we di rect by Oblique Ascension. Thus a planet may be on the As cendant at birth and another below the horizon in the north-east quadrant of the heavens."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"This latter will come to the place of t he first at the time of its rising, and the interval of time will be measured by the degrees of Right Ascension which will have passed over the Midheav en in the course of its Oblique passage to the horizon. The difference between Right Asc ension and Oblique Ascension is called “Ascensional Difference”, and the amount of th is will depend entirely on the position of the body or place to which Direction is made, in connection with the delineation of the body thus directed. In astrology the latitude of a place is called its pole. The Pole of the Ascendant is the same as the lati tude of the place of birth. The Pole of the Midheaven is zero. Hence any body occupying a posi tion between the Midheaven and the Ascendant will have a Pole proportionate to its distance from the Midheaven. Therefore we have this general proposition: As the Semiarc of the planet is to the quadrant of 90 x so is its distanc e from the Midheaven (taken in Right Ascension) to its proportional distance. This proportional distance taken from it s Right distance will give its Ascensional difference under its own Pole. Then to find the Pole, to the log. sine of the Ascensional difference add the cotangent of the planet’s declination (or from it subt ract the tangent of the declination) and the result will be the l og. tangent of the Pole. We thus make a new “Ascendant” of the planet, and direct to it under its own latitude or Pole. THE SIGNIFICATORS Are the Sun, Moon, Midheaven and Ascendant. They are called “Significators” because they signify something concerning the state and condition of the subject of the hor oscope, not only radically by their positions and aspects but also tem porarily, by the Directions made to them by the Promittors. Thus the Midheaven signifies the honour, credit, status, and position of the subj ect. The Sun is related to all male relations, and has a general affinity with the things signified by the Midheaven. The Ascendant signifies the health, personal affections, accidents, and changes taking place in the surroundings of the subject. The Moon signifies female relations and has a general affinity with things signified by the Ascendant. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE PROMITTORS Are the planets which are directed to the Significators. In this sense the Sun and Moon may become “Promittors” when directed to the Midheaven and Ascendant. They are called Promittors because by their positions and aspects at birth t hey have the “promise” of certain events invested in them. Thus if Sa turn were in the Second House at birth, his Direction to one or other of the Significators would bring about the financial misfortunes “promised” or indicated by his radical position. DIRECTIONS Are formed by the Promittors to t he Significators by bringing their longitudes, or the aspects of their longitudes, to the places of the Significators under the seve ral Poles of those Sign ificators. Thus if Jupiter were in the western heaven el evated above the Sun, also in the western heavens, Jupiter would come down the heavens by the rotation of the Earth on its axis until it reached the place of the Sun. To calculate this Direction, we should merely regard t he Sun as being on the Descendant of a place whose latit ude is the same as the Pole of the Sun and find how m any degrees of Right Ascension pass over the Midheaven between the moment of birth and the setting of Jupiter under the Pole of the Sun. All Significators are supposed to remain fixed in the places they held at birth and all the Promittors are moved to form conjunctions and aspects with them. This process invo lves only an inspection of a set of Tables of Houses, and all Directions can by this mean s be calculated in a minute or so to within 15’ or three months of their actual occurrence. And this small limit is not of great consequence seeing that Directions which are calculated with the utmost care to the nearest minute of space do not frequently co incide with the events they are held to signify; but in all Primary Directions it is observed that they have an extensive influence and are brought into action by transits and lunations and frequently retarded or accelerated by ephemeral indications of this sort. Nevertheless, the system I am no w propounding is of great value in giving an immediate estimate of the Primaries in force at any given period of the life, and this has never yet been done in the various works of Astrologers. If greater accuracy is required it can be readily arrived at by reference to the Oblique Ascens ions of the Sign ificators and the Promittor, taken under the Pole of t he former. This process will be set out in due course. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CONVERSE DIRECTIONS Are those which are formed contrary to the order of the signs, by which the radical places of t he planets are carried to t hose of the Significators by the motion of the earth on its axis. DIRECT DIRECTIONS Are those formed according to the order of the signs by the apparent contrary motion of the Earth. Therefore when the Midheaven’s Ri ght Ascension is increased to form a Direction, it is a direct Direction; but when the Right Ascension is diminished in order to form a Direction it is a converse Direction. These are merely labels for the pur pose of distinction; they do not affect the nature of the Directions themselves. When, therefore, we speak of a converse Direction it is merely to indicate the method of calculation involved. It does not qua lify the effects of such Direction. Many expositors of Primary Dir ections have argued that converse Directions are prenatal, and that we ta ke the Significator to a place it occupied prior to the time for birth. This is not the case, at all events in the system I now expounding. The Significator remains where it was at birth as determined by its Pole, or t he latitude to which it corresponds, and the planet or its aspect, is brought to the place of that Significator under the Pole of that Si gnificator. Similarly planets or aspects that are succedent to the place of the Si gnificator are brought to it by the natural rising or setting of the signs. In the first case we are dealing with the localised imprin t of the planet and in t he other with the planet itself. Both Directions depend entirel y on the one fact of the Earth’s axial rotation.  "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II. _______ Polar Elevation. _______ There are very few, if any, wor ks upon Astrology which give a clear idea of what Polar Elevation means. I shall here attempt to remedy that defect. Imagine the Earth to be stationar y on its axis with the stars revolving around it once in twenty-four hours. Let the axis of the Earth be perpendicular, and the Equator at right angles to it will then be horizontal. Suppose now that a person is standing somewhere in London, facing South. The meridian of London will then pass over his head from North to South, a nd the point immediately over his head will be his zenith. This point will be 51 x 30’ N. of the Equator, because that is the north latitude of London. The imagi nary circle in which the person is standing will pass through the horizon Ea st and West at right angles because it is vertical to the plane of the horizon. But it will cut the Equator at an angle equal to the latitude of the place, in this case, 51 x 30’. Now, since the horizon is al ways at right angles to the meridian and also at right angles to the Prime Ve rtical, or that circle in which the person stands in any locality, the circle of the horizon will cut the meridian on the South at an angle wh ich is the complement of the latitude of the place. AT London, in latitude 51 x 30’ N., the horizon cuts the meridian South at an angle of 38 x 30’ below the Equator, and it therefore cuts the meridian North at an angle of 51 x 30’. So that the North Pole of the Earth is distant from the North horizon by an angle of 51 x 30’, which is the Polar Elev ation of the horizon of London. Suppose now that the person in London takes a direct South course and proceeds towards the Equator. His horizon will still be always sat right angles to his meridian, and always 90 x from his zenith or overhead point, so that by the time he reaches the Equator, his horizon will coincide exactly with the axis of the Earth and his zenith will be a point on the Equator. There will theref ore be no Polar Elevation. Hence we see that, as in latitude 51 x 30’ N. the Polar Elevation is 51 x 30’ and the Equator, in latitude 0 x 0’, the Polar Elevation is nil , it follows that Polar Elevation dimini shes in proportion as we reach the Equator. This is because there is no Ascensional Difference; but the planets rise and set always at right angles to the horizon from the point of view of a person on the Equator, whereas in North or South latitudes they rise and set upon the horizon obliquely. Hence planets that have"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"no Declination have only Right Ascens ion, but those with Declination have Oblique Ascension and Descension. Similarly places that have no latitude have no Polar Elevation, while those with latitude have Polar Elevation equal to the latitude. From these considerations we arri ve at the conclusion that a planet on the Ascendant of London will have the same Polar Elevation as that horizon, namely 51 x 30’, while a planet on the Midheaven will have none. Hence it depends on a planet’s proportional distance from the Midheaven as to what Pole (Polar Elevation) it has. Then to find the Pole of the Sun or Moon in a horoscope we say: As the Semiarc of the body is to 90 x (the quadrant), so is its Meridian Distance to the proportional distance. This taken from its Meridian Distance will give its Ascensional Difference under its own Pole. Then to the log. sine of this Ascensiona l Difference add the log. contan. of the body’s declination. The sum is t he log. tangent of the Pole of that body. PROBLEM 1 . – To find the Semiarc, or times of Right Ascension, that a body is above or below the horizon. Rule . – To the log. tang. of its Dec lination add the l og. tang. of the latitude of the birthplace. The sum is the log. sine of the Ascensional Difference under the Pole of that place. If the body is below the horizon a nd in South Declination, or above the horizon in the North Declination, add the Ascensional Difference to 90 x . The sum will be t he Semiarc of the body, diurnal if above, and nocturnal if below, the horizon. But if the body is below the horiz on in North Declination, or above the horizon in South Declination, subtract the Ascensional Difference from 90 x and the remainder wi ll be the Semiarc. PROBLEM 2. – To find the Meridian Distance of a body. First determine by inspection whether it is nearer the Midheaven or Nadir. Take that to which it is nearest. Having the Right Ascension of the Midheaven (as obtained in constructing the horoscope), add 180 x to it, and obtain the Right Ascension of t he Nadir or lower point of the Meridian. Then find the Right Asc ension of the body whose Meridian distance is required. This is given in the Nautical Almanac for every day, in the case of the Sun, and for various hours of the day in the case of the Moon. But they may be worked by logarithms quite easily. The Sun’s Right Ascension is thus derived: From the log. cosine of its distance in longitude from the nearest equinox, subtract the log. cosine of its Declination, and the rema inder will be the log. cosine of its Right Ascension from the same equinox. The Ri ght Ascension of Aries"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"0 x is 0 x , and that of Libra 0 x is 180 x , so that if you are reckoning from Libra you must add 180 x to the result obtained, or subtract it from 180 x . The Moon’s Right Ascension is thus derived: To the log. cosine of its longitudinal distance from the nearest equinox, add the log. cosine of its latitude, and from the sum s ubtract the log. cosine of its declination. The remainder is the log. cosine of its Right Ascension from the same equinox. Then having the Right Ascension of the Sun, and also that of the Moon, we may find their Meridian distances by taking the difference between their own Right Ascension and that of the point (Midheaven or Nadir) to which they are each nearest. Note that if the Meridian Dist ance is taken from the Midheaven the Semiarc employed in the followin g problem must be the diurnal Semiarc. But if taken from the N adir, then the nocturnal Semiarc must be used. PROBLEM 3 . – To find the Ascensional Difference of the Sun or Moon under its own Pole, and thence to find its Pole. This is worked by Ternary or Pro portional Logarithms, which will be found in any set of Mathematical Tables. Those published by Chambers are excellent. Rule . – To the logarithm of 90 x (.30103) add the log. of the Meridian Distance of the Sun (or M oon), and from the sum subtract the log. of the Semiarc. The remainder will be the log. of the proportional distance of the body, and if this be taken from its Meridian Distance (or the Meridian Distance from it, wh ichever may be the greater), the difference will be the body’s Ascensio nal Difference under its own Pole. From the log. sine of this Ascens ional Difference take the log. tang (or add the log. cotan.) of the Decli nation of the Sun (or Moon) and the result will be the log. tangent of the Pole. PROBLEM 4. – To find the Oblique Ascension or Oblique Descension of the Sun (or Moon) under its own Pole. Rule . – Consider whether the planet is risi ng or setting in the horoscope. If rising take its Oblique Ascension, if setting take its Oblique Descension. If in the North Declination subt ract the Ascensional Difference under its own Pole (see above) from its Right Ascension, or if in South Declination, add it. The result is the Oblique Ascension under that Pole. Add 180 x and you have the Oblique De scension of the opposite point under the same Pole. Here, we may conclude our initial problems. We have now in hand the Right Ascension of t he Midheaven, and by adding 90 x we have the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Oblique Ascension of the Asce ndant, or by subtracting 90 x the Oblique Descension of the Descendant. Also we have the Oblique Ascension or Descension of the Sun and Moon, and also their Poles. Now from the Oblique Ascension of the Sun and Moon (if rising) take 90 x and you have the Right Asc ension of the Midheaven at the time of their rising under their own Poles. Or, if setting, add 90 x to their Oblique Descension and you have th e Right Ascension of the Midheaven at their setting. Convert this into Sidereal Time by taking the degrees of arc as minutes of time, and the minutes of ar c as seconds of time. Multiply these minutes and seconds by four, and reduce to Hours, Minutes and Seconds. You thus have a horosc ope in which the Sun (or Moon) is rising or setting under that latitude which answers to the Pole of the Luminary. You can now work all your Direc tions both direct and converse by means of the Tables of Houses. The points to which Direction can be made are: The Midheaven, by Right Ascension; the Ascendant by Tables for the latitude of birth; the Sun, by Tables for the latitude answering to its Pole; the Moon by Tables answering to the latitude of its Pole.  "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CHAPTER III. _______ Illustration. _______ I shall take for my example horoscope that of Kaiser Wilhelm II, whose horoscope, calculated for 3 p. m. at Berlin on the 27th January, 1859, failed to show the tremendous cr isis of July, 1914, by the system of Semiarc method now gener ally in use; and it will here be shown that the system of directing under the Poles of the Significators most clearly indicated the crisis a nd equally shows the inevit able conclusion of the gigantic adventure to which the inor dinate ambition of the Kaiser has committed him. The Right Ascension of the Midheaven is 351 x 19’, which we convert to sidereal time thus: 351m . 19s. multiplied by 4 = 1,405m. 16s = 23h. 25m.16s. Under this S.T. we find the Directions of the Midheaven and Ascendant. The Kaiser was 55 years 6 months of age when the War broke out. This is equal to an arc of 55 x 30’ at the rate of one degree for a year. By calling these minutes and seconds of time and multiplying by 4 we get: S.T. 3h. 42m. Then, to direct the Midheaven in z odiac direct, we add this increment to 23h. 25m. 16s., and get the directed Midheaven under S.T. 3h. 7m.16s. In the Tabl es of Houses we find this S.T. corresponds with Taurus 19 x 15’, nearly. Referring to the horoscope, we find that this is approaching the sextile to Neptune, which it attains about 4 years later on, in 1918. We therefore make a note of it, and pass on. There are no ot her Directions of the Midheaven in zodiac direct. We now deduct 3h. 42m. from 23h. 25m. 16s., and obtain the converse Direction of the Midheaven, which falls under S.T. 19h. 43m. 16s., and this we find answers to Capricorn 24 x . Referring again to the horoscope, we find that this pass ed the sextile of the Moon and also the trine of Mars by nearly 3 years, and under t hese ambitious indications it is presumed that the idea of “Deutschland uber Alles” was considerably advanced. The great opportunity was missed. The crisis of 1912 was averted and, considering the internal state of our country at that time and our acknowledged unpreparedness for war, it is well for us that it was so. We see, however, that the Mi dheaven converse is coming to the sextile of Neptune in Pisces 22 x 57’, which it reaches in the course of a year, coinciding with 1915, the great year of Germany’s submarine activity and wholesale piratical destruction. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Having made a note of these Direc tions of the Midheaven in zod. direct, and in zod. converse, we now turn to the Ascendant. The Pole of the Ascendant is t he same as the latitu de = 52 x 30’. We therefore use the Tables for this latitude. Those for Birmingham, 52 x 28’ will serve very well.  "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" Pole of Ascendant 52 x 30’ tang 10.11502 Pole of Sun 40 x 53’ tang 9.93726 Pole of Moon 33 x 53.5’ tang 9.82721 Under the S.T. of the direct Direc tion of the Midheaven, 3h. 7m. 16s., we find the Ascendant is in the end of Leo. It has just passed the place of the famous fixed star, Regulus, which is in Leo 28 x 27’ and which coincided with the Ascendant in the year 1912. We also see that the Ascendant is in square aspect to Uranus in Taurus, 29 x 32’. This influences the year 1914, and denotes ruptures, dislocations, the severing of ties, breaking off of friendships, etc. (See “Directional Astrology”, Chap. 8). The fracture came under the transit of Uranus in conjunction with the Sun in the hor oscope during 1914. We see also that the Ascendant has recently passed the 135 x aspect of Mercury, which coincided with the trouble in the Balkans, and was, doubtless, the occasion of great anxiety to the Kaiser. We now take the converse Directions of the Ascendant. Taking 3h. 42m. from the radical Midheaven, we arrive at Capricorn 24 x and under this Midheaven we find the As cendant to be in Taurus 25 x . This we immediately see is just past the se xtile of Mars and the opposition of the Moon. These were formed in t he 54th year, answering to 1913, in the interval between the Balkan cris is and the beginn ing of the Great War. The Ascendant conjuncti on Uranus had happened in the 53rd year (1911). We consequently take note of these Directions, marking them direct or converse, according to whether we add or subtract from the radical Midheaven in order to obtain them. The next Directions are those of t he Sun. Here it is necessary to find under what latitude or Pole the Sun is placed at birth. The Right Ascension of the Sun is 309 x 35’. Its Declination is 18 x 30’ South. Then to find the Ascensional Differ ence and Semiarc of the Sun, we use the formula already given: "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Tang. of Lat. 51 x 30’ log. ... 10.11052 Tang. of Dec. 18 x 30’ log. ... 9.52452 Asc.

We can therefore use the Tables of Houses for New York = 40 x 43’ or any others that are nearer to the required latitude. We have found that the Ascensional Difference of the Sun under its own Pole is 16 x 50’, and if we take this from the Right Ascension of Sun = 309 x 35’, we shall have its Oblique Descension und er that Pole = 292 x 45’. To this add 90 x and we have the Right Ascension of the Mi dheaven at the time of sunset in latitude 40 x 53’ = 22 x 45’. This reduced to S.T. = 1h. 31m. Now, to find the direct Directions of the Sun for this period of the life concerning which we are ma king enquiry, namely, 53 years 6 months, we have to add 3h. 42m. to 1h. 31m. and we get 5h. 13m. as the directed Midheaven under the Sun’s Po le. Turning to the Tables of Houses for this latitude and under this S.T. we find the Ascendant to be Virgo 21 x . This shows the Sun to be nearly approaching the conjunction of Neptune in zodiac direct, the Direction being completed in 1917. For we have to regard t he Sun as fixed on the Descendant of a horoscope for latitude 40 x 53’ N., and by the addition of 55 x 30’ or 3h. 42m. S.T., we find Virgo 21 x rises and therefore Pisces 21 x sets, which means that the place of Neptune has come down to the West horizon and meets the conjunc tion with the Sun. We now turn to the converse Direction of the Sun, and by taking 3h. 42m. from the Midheaven 1h. 31m. (after adding 24h. for subtraction) we arrive at 21h. 49m . as the converse Midheaven by Direction. This we find in the Tables to correspond with Aquarius 25 x , the Ascendant being Gemini 20 x , and the Descendant Sagittarius 20 x . It is seen that the most recent Dir ections formed by the Sun were the sesquisquare of Saturn, the semisquar e of the Sun, and the square of Neptune, all within the spac e of five years, the conjunction with Venus coming in the train of evil Directions to modify the worst interpretation. The Sun was, however, exactly in sq uare to the radical Midheaven."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"These points being noted we may now turn to the Directions of the Moon. By calculation similar to that pur sued in the case of the Sun we find that its Pole is 33 x 53.5’, its Ascensional Diffe rence under that Pole 17 x 53’, its Oblique Descension 215 x 21’, and therefore the Midheaven at its setting was in Right Ascension 305 x 21’, which is equal to the Sidereal Time 20h. 21m. 24s. Then for the direct Directions of the Moon we add 3h. 42m. and arrive at 0h. 3m. which equals Aries 1 x , when the Ascendant in latitude 33 x 53’ N. is Cancer 16 x , and the Descendant Capricorn 16 x . We have therefore to regard the Moon as if she were directed to Capricorn 16 x . Here she is just separating from the sesquisquare of Uranus in the end of Taurus. The converse Direction of the Moon is found by subtracting 3h. 42m. from 20h. 21m. 24s. = 16h. 39m .and with this Midheaven we find that in the latitude of 33 x 53’ the Descendant has arrived at the end of Leo, which is therefore the Moon’s converse Directional place. Here she forms the square aspect of Uranus zod. com. and goes on to form the square of her own place in Scorpio 27 x . These Directions are therefore to be noted. We have now found all the Directions to the Midheaven, Ascendant, Sun and Moon, under their respecti ve Poles, and we are now able to bring into array the st range category of malevolent aspects through which Kaiser Wilhelm II has to wade on his halting march to World Conquest.

But we may equally direct the bodies of the planets to the Significators. This is done by ta king their Oblique Ascensions or Descensions under the Pole s of the Significator s instead of taking those of their longitudes under the Po les of the Significators, as we have thus far done. For purposes of illustration I have included in the foregoing list a mundane conjunction of Neptune wi th the Sun as well as its corresponding zodiacal conjunction. This difference is due to the fact that the body has latitude, and hence its declination is not the same as the declination of the longitude it holds. In the case of the Moon the latitude may be considerable, and the difference between its mundane and zodiacal positions may differ by several degrees. Therefore, to find the mundane posi tion of the planet, add the log. tangent of the planet’s declination to the log. tangent of the Significator to which it is to be directed, and the sum will be the log. sine of the planet’s Ascensional Difference under that Pole. This Ascensional Difference added to or taken from the Right Ascension of the planet will give the Oblique Ascension or Ob lique Descension under the same Pole. This serves for all mundane conjunctions , because we are here taking the Right Ascension of the pl anet, which includes its latitude, instead of the Right Ascension of the longitude of the planet as is done in zodiacal Directions. But in directing to the mundane aspects we have to take the aspect in the zodi ac and compute its Right Ascension with latitude equal to that of the planet. Thus in the case of the Moon in the foregoing horoscope, the longitude is Scorpio 26 x 51’, and the zodiacal square is in Leo or Aquarius 26 x 51’. But the Moon has 5 x 14’ of South latitude and, therefore, is much lower down the heav ens that its longitude indicates. Hence, in order to form a square as pect to the body of the Moon, which for convenience I here call the mundane aspect as distinguished from its zodiacal aspect, we have to take Leo 26 x 51’ with 5 x 14’ of latitude and find the Right Ascension of this point. Then with the declination proper to that degree we find its Ascensional Difference under the Pole of that Significator to which it is directed. Here follows and example:"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Bring the Sun to the square as pect of the Moon in Mundo.

I do not feel quite sure that these Directions ought to be called mundane , inasmuch as they are quite di stinct from those going by the same name in the system of Placidus. But I am somewhat at a loss for the correct name, and therefore wish it to be understood that I merely use the term “mundane” to distingu ish them from the zodiacal Directions, which are taken without la titude. For we may direct to conjunctions and aspects by longit ude only, or to conjunctions and aspects of the bodily position of the planet. The distinction is vastly important, though not gener ally recognised. It should here be noted that some care is needed in the method of stating a Direction. T he Significator to which Direction is made should be placed first, then the aspect formed, then the Promittor directed, and lastly the form, whether zod. or mundane, direct or converse.

"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"CHAPTER V. _______ Zodiacal Parallels. _______ These are formed by degrees of the zodiac which hold the same declination as a planet at birth. Having noted the dec lination held by any planet in the horoscope, we merely look through the Ephemeris and find the Sun in a similar declinati on, whether North or South does not matter. The Sun’s l ongitude at the time will then be noted opposite to this declination. Find the Obli que Ascension or Descension (as the case requires) of this degree taken un der the Pole of the Significator, and the difference between this and the Oblique Ascension or Descension of the same Significator under its own Pole will be the Arc of Direction. These parallels are eas ily found in the Ephemeri s, or in the Tables of Declination, by reference to th e longitude, for it will be observed that the same or a near degree of the zodi ac to that held by the planet will have the same declination, also another about the opposition, and another that is at the same distanc e from the equinox as the planet. Thus in the case of our exampl e we find the planet Saturn has 18 x 46’ declination. Looki ng through the Ephemeris we find that the Sun holds this declination when in Aquarius 6 x 5’, in Leo 6 x 5’, in Scorpio 23 x 56’, and Taurus 23 x 56’. Within the probable range of life we can direct the Sun to Leo 6 x 5’ or Aquarius 6 x 5’. The Moon can be directed to the parallel of Saturn in Scorpio 23 x 56’. The Ascendant can be directed to that in Taurus and also that in Leo, and the Midheaven c an be directed to that in Taurus. We may take the last named as an example. The Midheaven is directed by Right Ascension only. The Right Ascension of Taurus 23 x 56’ is 51 x 33’ and that of the Midheaven is 351 x 19’. This we state as follows: Right Ascension of aspect 51 x 33’ Add 360 x ... ... ... ... 360 x 0’ 411 x 33’ Right Ascension of M.C. ... 351 x 19’ Arc of Direction ... ... ... 60 x 14’ which equals Midheaven par Saturn. zod. d.

The Ascensional Differ ence due to the declination 1 x 43’ under the Pole of the Moon is thus calculated: Log. tang. declination 1 x 43’ - 8.47669 Log. tang.

We then observe that the Oblique Descension of Moon under its own Pole (already calculated) is 215 x 20’ = 14h. 21m. 24s., to which add 90 x = 6 hrs., and we have the Si dereal Time on the Midheaven when the Moon sets in lat. 33 x 53.5’ N., which is its Pole. This Sidereal Time will be 20h. 21m. 24s., and under this Midheaven in the Tables of Houses for lat. 34 x we get Taurus 21 x on the Ascendant, which is the opposition of the Moon’s mundane position. Then tracing back through the same Table we find that Virgo 25 x 42’ sets. Pisces of the same degrees rises when the Si dereal Time on the Midheaven is 17h. 49m. Then: h. m. 20 21 - 17 49 2 32 = 38 x = 38 years. By observing the direct and conver se position of the Moon or Sun, the Ascendant or Midheaven, to which by Direction they have severally arrived in the zodiac, and referring to those degrees either in the Ephemeris against the Sun’s daily longitude or in the Tables of Declination, it may at once be seen whether they are in parallel to any of the radical places of the planets."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" Thus in the horoscope submitt ed we have the following points of Direction and their corresponding declinations: Long.

The paralle l of Ascendant to Uranus fell in 1910, that to Saturn falls in 1914 (a disastrous indication), the Ascendant parallel Sun 1915, the Ascendant para llel Venus 1916, the Midheaven parallel Jupiter 1917. From these indications, which have to be included in the list of zodiac al Directions alr eady enumerated, we find that Saturn afflicts the Ascendant in zodiacal converse during 1915 and that 1917 brings such influences as will conduce to peace, namely: Ascendant parallel Venus zodiacal con. And Midheaven parallel Jupiter zodiacal con. Parallels have frequently a last ing influence owing to the slow Ascension of certain parts of the z odiac, and for other reasons parallels formed about the Tropics (Cancer and Capricorn) have a very durable effect, as will be seen by referring to the Tables of Declination where the 23rd and 24th parallels are seen to extent many years together. We may now refer to another kind of parallel which experience shows to be effectual as a signal of impending good or evil. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI. _______ Mundane Parallels. _______ Planets that have the same Pole are either in mundane conjunction or mundane parallel. A mundane parallel is formed by two bodies being at equal distances from the meri dian or horizon. Having the Pole of a planet we may direct another to its mundane parallel by the following rule: Find the Oblique Ascension or Descension (as the case may require) for the Significator on which the parallel is formed, taken under its own Pole. Next find the Obli que Ascension or Oblique Descension of the planet forming the parallel, under the same Pole. The difference will be the Arc of Direction. In the example horoscope we bring Saturn to the mundane parallel of the Moon. The Moon’s Pole is 33 x 53.5’, its Oblique Descension under that Pole is 215 x 21’. The Right Ascension of the cusp of the 4th is 171 x 19’, and therefore the Moon’s distance is 44 x 2’ westward of the Meridian. From the Right Ascension of the 4th 171 x 19’ subtract 44 x 2’ and we have the Oblique Ascension under the Pole of the Moon of the point eastward answering to the plane of the Moon westward of the name meridian, namely, 171 x 19’ – 44 x 2’ = 127 x 17’.

Bring Saturn to the mundane parallel of the Sun. The Sun’s Pole is 40 x 53’. Its Oblique Descension under that Pole is 292 x 45’. The distance of this from the Midheaven is 351 x 19’ – 292 x 45’ = 58 x 34’. We have to bring Saturn up to this distance from the Midheaven under the Pole of the Sun.

The process is very simple. We fi rst find the Oblique Ascension or Oblique Descension of the Significat or under its own Pole and take its distance from the Meridian. Find a point on the other side of the same meridian which as the same distance and bring the Promittor (or body directed) to it. This is done by taking the Oblique Ascension or Oblique Descension of the Promittor under t he same Pole as the Significator and the difference between this and t he point to which Direction is made will be in degrees of Oblique Ascension or Descension and will constitute the Arc of Direction. RAPT PARALLELS. These are formed by the motion of the Earth on its axis, whereby two bodies are brought to the same distance upon either side of the same Meridian. To get this Arc of Direction we ha ve to take the Oblique Ascension or Oblique Descension of the two bodi es under their own Poles; add the two together and divide by two. This will give the midway point on the meridian, and the difference betw een this and Right Ascension of the Midheaven at birth will be the Arc of Direction. Bring the Sun to the Rapt Parallel of the planet Saturn in the example horoscope. The Sun’s Pole has already been found to be 40 x 53’ and its Oblique Descension under that Pole 292 x 45’. The Pole of Saturn is found to be 39 x 40’, its Ascensional difference under this Pole 16 x 22’. This we take from its Right Ascension, 131 x 41’, and get its Oblique Ascension under its own Pole = 115 x 19’. Then from the Sun to Aries 0 x = 360 x – 292 x 45’ = 67 x 15’, plus Saturn 115 x 19’ = 182 x 34’, half of which is 91 x 17’. This added to the Sun’s Oblique Descension gives 384 x 2’, from which take the Right Ascension of Midheaven 351 x 19’ = Arc of Direction, Sun Rapt Parallel Saturn = 32 x 43’.

"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VII. _______ Summary. _______ We have not completed our surv ey of the various methods of directing, and have clearly seen t hat Directions which have hitherto been regarded as a complex matter for only skilful mathematicians to undertake, are comparatively easy work when properly approached. All Directions are seen to be e ffected by Oblique Ascension or Descension. Moreover, we have seen that the four Significators are fixed points and that all Directions are made to them by the planets under those latitudes which correspond with their several Poles. The Pole of the Midheaven being always 0 x and that of the Ascendant being always the same as the latitude of the birthplace, there remains only the Poles of the Sun and Moon to be found, and the simplest rule has been given for this calculation. Hitherto it has not been recogni sed as part of the system of directing under the Poles that mundane Directions can be as readily dealt with as zodiacal Directions. In fact it may be said that only zodiacal Directions ha ve been recognised. To these I have added all Directions of the bodies of the planets to Significators, mundane parallels and rapt parallels. The Spectrum necessary for all these calculations can be very easily made. It includes the Right Ascension of the planet taken with latitude, the declination, the Pole, the longitude of the planet and the declination of that latitude. With these we may proceed to make any of the calculations dealt with in this treatise with mathematical exactness. But for the benefit of those who need a ready means of estimating the Directions in force at any time of life, the facile use of Tables of the Houses has been suggested. This involves having three sets of Tables, namely, one for the latitude of the birthplace and one each for the latitudes of the Sun and Moon. The Midheaven, being di rected by Right Ascension only, needs no Tables of Houses. We may now regard the Directions in the example horoscope with a view to their interpretati on, for this after all is the ostensible object of all our labour. Under the Ascendant se xtile Mars zod. con., which fell out at the end of the year 1912, t ogether with the Ascendant opposition Moon, we have indications which tend to martial success and a strong policy of military efficiency, but at the same time the Kaiser would have experienced domestic troubles due to the Moon in the radical 5th"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"House, and some of the measures to which he lent his support at this time would be unpopular. Under the Ascendant square Ur anus and Ascendant par. Saturn towards the end of 1914 and the beginn ing of 1915 the Kaiser appears to have been committed to a breach of treaties which could only have the effect of producing an open fracture. Uranus being in the 11th and Saturn in the 2nd, there would be unfortunate alliances (such as that with Austria) and dangerous financial transactions which ultimately would tend to the ruin of his credi t. At the end of the same year we have the Direction of the Moon to the parallel of an afflicted Mercury, and an evil aspect of the Moon to Ur anus. This was followed by Sun parallel Saturn, a very sinister as pect, and also an evil aspect of the Moon to Uranus. Here the pinch cr eated by the blockade of the German Fleet and the unsuccessful atte mpt to coerce Italy produced conditions which pressed heavily on the internal resources of Germany in men, money and muni tions. Loan after loan was floated with only partial success. Private proper ty was commandeered to supply the materials for munitions of war and food supplies were raised fifty per cent. In price. The Balkan plot, which was concocted between Germany and Bulgaria in July, 1915, and which was only disclosed three months later, was a piece of successful st atecraft which had for its appropriate signification: Midheaven sextile Neptune zod. con. 56 x 30’ and Ascendant sextile Neptune 56 x 39’. This is followed by Ascendant par. Fun 56 x 42’, which is by no means a benef ic configuration owing to the radical import of the Sun semi square Neptune, semisquare Venus, opposition Saturn, the Sun being in its lo west dignities in Aquarius and in the 8th House, which denotes loss. This coincided with the severe reversals on the East and West fronts of the great campaign. The Ascendant par. Venus which fa lls in April, 1916,* cannot be regarded too hopefully as Venus is heav ily afflicted by Mars, Neptune, Saturn and the Sun at birth. It appears to point to a strong Peace agitation among the Germans themselv es by which the Kaiser may be affected. Peace overtures, at all ev ents, are likely to be the result of this Direction. 1 It is followed by Moon square Moon zod. con., which shows popular assaults and affr onts, disfavour of the people, hurts by women and a state of unrest and general misfortune. Inte rnal troubles are likely to affect the course of German policy. The Sun conjunct Neptune at the end of the year is of sinister import and shows an invo lved and complicated stat e of affairs, loss of   1 All statements referred to dates after 1915 must be regarded as predictions, this work having been delivered for publication in the autumn of that year. –S.

Jupiter, but the following conjunction of the Sun with Neptune in the zodiac is unfortunate and there is danger of enforced sequestration or even flight and exile. As to the end of this remarkable figure, I consider that he is doomed to see the end of the Hohenzol lern dynasty which has for so long a time dominated the fortunes of Germany, coerced the princes and reduced the people by a military aut ocracy. This is sufficiently indicated by the presence of Saturn in the 2nd House opposing the Sun in the sign of its fall and in t he House of Loss. The Sun being in the 8th House afflicted by the semisquare of Neptune and the opposition of Saturn, and the Moon also afflicted by the opposition of Uranus, there is great danger of a violent death, though the trine aspect of Jupiter appears to offer a safe exile and succour in obscuration. The horoscope of the Cr own Prince clearly indicates this loss of inheritance. We have now brought this study to a conclusion and may profitably consider the ground over which we hav e gone so that its principles and methods may be fixed in the memory and the whole system of directing thus made familiar to the student.    "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII. _______ Further Examples. _______ In the horoscope of King George V, which is set for London, 3rd June, 1865, at 1h. 18m. am. the Midheav en is in Right Ascension 271 x 1’ 15”. The Sun’s Pole is 22 x 33’, and its Oblique Ascension under that Pole is 61 x 8’, the Moon’s Pole is 50 x 8’ and its Oblique Descension is 176 x 51’. Now if we take 90 x from the Oblique Ascensi on of the Sun we shall have the Right Ascension of t he Midheaven when the Sun rises in latitude 22 x 33’. The Tables of Houses for Calcutta, 22 x 31’, will serve very closely for this latitude or Pole. Therefore, from Oblique Ascension Sun 61 x 8’ take 90 x , after adding 360 x for subtraction, and obtain Right Ascensi on of Midheaven 331 x 8’. This converted to Sidereal Time = 22h. 4m. 32s. Also if we add 90 x to the Moon’s Oblique Descension, which is 176 x 51’, we shall obtain Right Ascension of Midheaven 266 x 51’, when the Moon’s place sets in latitude 50 x 8’, which is the Moon’s Pole. This converted to Sidereal Time = 17h. 47m. 24s. The Tables for Plymouth will serve here. With these elements we can get to work, and by mere inspection of the Tables of Houses under the latitudes of the Poles of the Sun and Moon, and those for the latitude of the City of London, we can calculate all Directions in the zodiac to within 15’ of an arc of three months in the time of their maximum strength. Take the Directions of the Sun as an example. The Pole is 22 x 31’, and we are using the Tables of Houses for Calcutta. Against the Sidereal Time 22h. 4m. 32s. we find Aquarius 29 x on the Midheaven, and Gemini 12 x 23’ rising, which is practica lly the place of the Sun. This latter is the point from which we direct. The King was married on 6th July 1893, at the age of 28 years 1 month = 28 x 5’ = 1h. 52m. 20s. This we add to the Sun’s Midheaven, i.e. , the Sidereal Time on the Mid heaven when the Sun was rising, 22h. 4m. 32s., and obtain Sidereal Time 23h. 56m. 52s., against which in the same Table we find Cancer 8 x 32’ rising. This then is the Directional place of th e Sun in the zodiac direct . It will be seen that it applies to the sextile of Venus in Taurus 9 x 38’, which it reaches in about a year. Now we take the Arc of Direction , 1 h. 52m. 20s., from the Sun’s Midheaven and obtain "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 22 h. 4m. 32s. - 1h. 52m. 20s. 20h. 12m. 12s. = Aquarius 1 x . This gives Taurus 12 x rising, and therefore the Sun is directed to a near conjunction with Venus in zodiac conversely . We next take the Moon under latitude 50 x 8’, which we find is close to the Tables for Plymouth 50 x 22’, and we therefore use these. The Midheaven when the Moon sets in th is latitude was found to be 17h. 47m. 24s., which shows that the lati tude and declination of the Moon at birth, being both South, reduces t he actual place of the Moon in the horoscope to Virgo 23 x , which accordingly we find to be rising when the Moon’s place at birth sets. From the Moon’s M.C. 17h. 47m. 24s.  take 1h. 52m. 20s. 15h. 55m. 4s. This gives Capricorn 15 x rising or Cancer 15 x setting, which is therefore the Directional place of the Moon in zodiac converse. It forms no Direction at this time appar ently, but on reference to the declination of Cancer 15 x we find that it is 22 x 34’, and therefore the Moon by converse Direction in the zodiac is separating from the parallel of Jupiter and going to that of the Sun. Both favourable indications for the event. For the direct Direction of the Moon we have Moon’s Midheaven 17h. 47m. 24s.  Add 1h. 52m. 20s. Direction of Moon 19h. 39m. 44s. In the Tables we find that this gives Taurus 20 x rising or Scorpio 20 x setting, which is therefore the Directional place of the Moon in zodiac direct. This is separating from the opp osition of Mercury and applying to the mundane sextile of Moon in Virgo 23 x (see above). As the declination of this Directional place is 17 x 45’ it forms no parallel in the zodiac with the radical planets, and we therefore pass on to the Directions of the Mi dheaven and Ascendant. These can be taken together, because the Midheaven is directed by Right Ascension only, and the Asc endant is found in the Tables for London. The radical Midheaven is 18h. 4m. 5s., and to this we add the Directional arc 1h. 52m. 20s., maki ng 19h. 56m. 25s., and in the Tables for London we find this corresponds with the Ascension of"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Taurus 29 x , so that the Ascendant is clos e to the trine of the Moon in the zodiac direct. It is also approaching a parallel of Mars. For the converse Directions we have Radical Midheaven 18h. 4m. 5s. Subtract 1h. 52m. 20s. Directed M.C. conv. 16h. 11m. 45s. This gives the 5th of Aquarius on the Ascendant, and the Ascendant is therefore still opposition to Mars in zodiac direct at the time of the marriage, which is not a favourable indication. Lastly, we have the direct Direction of t he Midheaven as above = Capricorn 27 x in sesquisq. Aspect to Sun in zodiac. Also the converse Direction in Sagittarius 5 x , which is trine to Mars in t he radix, and therefore we have the Direction Midheaven separating from the trine Mars in zodiac converse. These Directions are all that are fo rmed at this time, and they have therefore to be collected. They can be tested as to the exact time of their formation by the following simple rule: Find the Oblique Ascension or Descension of the Signi ficator under its own Pole. To the tangent of this Pole (already extracted when we find the Oblique Ascension or Oblique Descension) add the tangent of the declination answering to the longitude of the Prom ittor. This will give the tangent of its Ascensional difference under t he same Pole. Apply this to its Right Ascension and so obtain it s Oblique Ascension or Oblique Descension (as the case requires) and the difference between this and the Significator’s Oblique Ascension or Oblique Descension is the Arc of Direction. The Arc of Direction for the death of King Edward is 44 x 56’ = 2h. 59m. 44s. which being added to and also taken from the respective Midheavens under the Poles of the Sun, Moon and Ascendant, yield the following indications: Midheav en opposition Mercury zod. con., Mon ad. Opposition Sun zod. d., Sun separating from opposition Saturn zod. con., Sun square Saturn zod. d., Moon square Neptune zod. con. The significant arc for th is event is Moon opposition Sun zod. d. acting in connection with Sun square Saturn. It will thus be seen that with considerable ease we may obtain close approximations to all arcs of Directions formed by the direct and converse motions of the planets to the Significators merely by an inspection of the Tables of Houses. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IX. _______ Suggested Method. _______ In order to make a methodical study of this system of Signpost marking, it will be necessary to pur sue a definite method. Otherwise there will be inevitable omissions from the list of current Directions. The following rules of procedure will therefore be found useful: Having found the Poles of the S un and Moon by the rule given for that calculation, it will be necessary to have a set of Tables of Houses for the corresponding latitudes, and also one for the Ascendant which is under the latitude of the place of birth. First take the Directions of the Midheaven and Ascendant under the latitude of birth. The point from which calculation is made in this case is that on the Midheaven at birth. Add the Arc of Direction for the current year, reduced to Sidereal Time. Refer to the Tables of Houses for the latitude of birthplace and take out the Midheaven and Ascendant for the year. Refer to the horoscope and find what aspects these points form to the planets in the horoscope of birth. Set these down as they are noted. Observe that the Significator directed must be set down first, then the aspect formed, next the planet to which the aspect is formed, and lastly whether it is direct or converse. When you add the Arc of Direction it is direct Direction, but when you subtract the Arc of Direction from t he radical Midheaven, it is converse Direction. Now note the declinations of the directed Midheaven and Ascendant. If these agree with the r adical declinations of any of the planets, note them and set down t he Direction, “Midheaven par. zod. d.”. Next subtract the Ar c of Direction for the cu rrent year of age from the Sidereal Time on the radical Midheaven, and ag ainst this (which is the converse Direction of the M.C.) y ou will find, in the same Tables of Houses, Midheaven and Ascendant. Take out the aspects, if any, thus formed to the radical planets. Al so note the declinations of the converse Direction of the M.C. and Ascendant and see if any parallels are formed to the radical declinations of the planets. Mark these “M.C. (or Asc) par. zod. con.”. Having thus directed both t he Midheaven and Ascendant under the pole of the latitude of birth to aspec ts and parallels of the radical Sun, Moon and planets, you will now pr oceed to direct the Sun. From the Sidereal Ti me answering to the Oblique Ascension (or Descension) of the Sun, subtract 6 hrs. for Oblique Ascension, or add 6 hrs. for Oblique Descension. This gives the Sidereal Time on the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Midheaven at the rising or setting (as the case may be) of the Significator in the lati tude answering to the Pole of that Significator. Now refer to the Tables of Houses for that latitude. Add the Arc of Direction answeri ng to the present age, and against this find the direct Direction of the Sun from the Ascending degree. Note the aspects thus formed to the radical planets. Note also the declination of the Ascending degree and see if it is in parallel to any of the planets at birth. Then subtract the Arc of Direction and find the converse Ascendant under the same latitude (Pole of Sun) and note the aspects and parallels thus formed. Next refer to the Moon’s Pole and take the Tables due to this latitude. Find the Midheaven due to t he rising or setting of the Moon in that latitude which answers to its Po le. Add the Directional Arc for the current age. Also subtract it. Fi nd the Directions to the planets in the radix formed by these tow positions of the Ascendant and also the parallels of declination, exactly as was done in the case of the Sun. These will then be the Directions current for the year. Those that are exact will operate that year. Those that are forming will ensue later. Past Directions may still re tain some degree of influence. Do not allow more than 1 x or 4’ of Sidereal Time for the operation of any Arc of Direction. A Direction begins to operate when it comes to within 1 x of an exact aspect. It lasts for 1 x and takes another degree to entirely pass away. Thus a Dir ection has an increascent and decreascent influence over a space of three years. The following Directions are si gnificant in the horoscope of 20th March, 1864, at 2.10 a.m., lat. 52 x 30’ N.: The Pole of the Sun is 26 x 34’ and that of the Moon is 39 x 54’. The death of the father occurred at 4 years 1 month 10 days, Arc of Direction = 4 x 7’. For this we have the following Directions: Ascdt. Opposition Uranus zod. con. 4 x 0’ Sun semisquare Mars zod. con. ... 4 x 28’ Sun conjunct Neptune zod. con. ... 5 x 17’ Ascdt. Square Sun zod. d. ... ... 5 x 21’ At 21 years a serious illness occurr ed under Ascdt. Square Saturn zod. con. The death of the mother took pl ace under the following Directions, the event being due on an Arc of 27 x 8’. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" Sun opposition Moon zod. con. ... 27 x 5’ Sun semisquare Uranus zod. d. ... 27 x 14’ Midheaven square Venus zod. d. ... 27 x 48’ Marriage took place under the following Directions: Ascdt.

For these events we have Directions: Ascendant opposition Moon m. ... 36 x 37’ Ascendant conjunct Jupiter m. ... 36 x 47’ Ascendant conjunct Mars zod. d. ... 37 x 31’ In this instance the conjuncti on of the Ascendant with Jupiter signified that assistance would be rendered to the savi ng of life, and this was actually the fact, Jupiter in Scorpio indicating the physician and surgeon whose skill was instrument al in averting what at first appeared to be certain death. Observe that the Ascendant is hyleg in this horoscope. These Directions appear to fully establish the validity of the “Signpost” system of direct ing under the Pole of Si gnificators. Hitherto it has been the practice to direct under the Pole of the planet to which Direction was made, but a little thought will show that if it be valid to direct the Ascendant under the Pole of the latitude of birthplace, it is equally valid to direct the Sun and Moon under t heir own Poles. We do, in fact, make of them two ot her Ascendants and di rect the planets to them both by conjunction and aspect. As a singular case for study, the following horoscope is submitted. Male born at Bombay at 8 mins. To 8 in the evening of 6th February 1884. The Midheaven is in Gemini 15 x 12’ and the Ascendant in Virgo 14 x 48’. The Moon is close to the Midheaven in square to Venus, and applying to the square of Uranus, but in trine to the Sun and separating from sextile Mars. Mars opposes t he Sun from Leo, the Sun being on the cusp of the 6th House. This subject died of fever in No vember 1913. The position of the Sun in the 6th House opposed by Mars from a fiery sign denotes sickness from fever. The Arc of Direction Ascendant opposition Sun is 29 x 45’, which measures exactly to the event. But as the Moon, being in the Midheaven is undoubt edly hyleg, we should expect to find some affliction of this point, and we do in fa ct find it from t he most appropriate"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"source, namely Mars, which was Directed to the Rapt Parallel of the Moon. This is effected by brin ging the mid-dist ance between the bodies of Mars and the Moon to the Midheaven by Right Ascension. And it will be further noted that Saturn was close to the Moon’s place at the time of this fatal event. In the horoscope of the late King Edward VII the attempt upon the King’s life by the maniac regicide Scipido took place under an Arc of 58 x 25’. For this event we have the following Directions in process: Sun square Uranus zod. con., Sun par. Moon zod. d., Moon conjunct Mercury zod. d. (Moon semisquar e Mars zod. d., Ascendant semisquare Neptune zod. d., Asc endant opposition Moon – applying), Ascendant square Neptune zod. c on., semisquare Moon zod. con., semisquare Saturn zod. con., sextile Mars zod. con., par Neptune zod. con., par Sun zod. con. An array of malefic influences which might well have proved fatal except that the hyleg (the Sun) was not heavily involved, the Directions being chiefly to the Ascendant. The radical indications of danger in foreign lands were: Moon on the cusp of the 9th semisquare Sun, square Saturn, sesquisquare Neptune. The Arc for Queen Victoria’s death was 59 x 19’. For this we have the following significant Directions : Midheaven square Moon zod. d. – Ascendant opposition Moon zod. d., and Sun conjunct Saturn zod. con. Here the Moon, as natural Significator of the Mother, is found to afflict both the angles of the horoscope by Direction. These Directions can be worked out accurately to the near est minute of an arc by using the logarithms of the tangent s. They are all within the limits of 1 x and are therefore current indications or signposts.  "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CHAPTER X. _______ General Review _______ The system here expounded presumes that the radical Sun, Moon, Ascendant and Midheaven remain fixed as Significator s of the general fortunes. The places of the planet s both bodily and in the zodiac are carried to the conjunctions and aspec t of these Significators by the diurnal rotation of the earth on its axis. All arcs are measured in Oblique Ascension or Oblique Descensi on. All planets are directed to the Significators under the Pole or geographical la titude of these Significators. Having found the Right Ascensio n of a Significator and its Ascensional difference under its own Pole (except the Midheaven, which has neither Pole nor Ascensiona l difference), and also that of the planet to be directed, taken under the same Pole, the difference of their Oblique Ascensions (or Descensions) will be the Arc of Direction. For the same declination as the planet to be directed, take its Right Ascension and Ascensional differenc e, and from these obtain its Oblique Ascension or Descension under the pole of the Significator to which Direction is made. The di fference between this and the Oblique Ascension or Oblique Descension of the Significator under its own Pole, will be the Arc of Direction. For mundane pa rallels, find a degree of Oblique Ascension or Descensi on, taken under the Pole of the Significator, which is on the opposite side of the meridian to that Significator. Bring this point to the Significator. The difference between the radical place of the poi nt taken under the Pole of the Significator and t hat of the Significator it self, taken under the same Pole, is the Arc of Direction. For Rapt Parallels, find the middle distance between any Significator and a Promittor, each taken under its own Pole. The difference between this and the Meri dian will be the Arc of Direction. To find what Directions are in process or forming, convert the Oblique Ascension or Descension of t he Significator un der its own Pole into Sidereal Time. From this subtract 6 hrs. if the Signi ficator is rising, or add 6 hrs. if it is setting. This will give the Side real Time on the Midheaven at the rising or setting of t hat Significator. To this add the Sidereal Time corresponding to the pr esent age of the Subject, refer to the Tables of Houses for the Pole of the Significator (Pole = latitude), and on the Ascendant or Descendant (a s the case may be) you will find the degree of the zodiac to which the Significator is directed, by direct"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Direction. It is then easy to see whether this point is forming any Direction to radical places of the planets. Also subtract the Sidereal Ti me for the age from the same Midheaven as that found above, and th is will give the degree of the zodiac to which the Sign ificator is directed conversely. Observe the aspects formed between it and the radical planets. Proceed thus with the Sun, Mo on and Ascendant. But for the Midheaven merely add and subtract t he Sidereal Time for age form the Right Ascension or Sidereal Time on the Midheaven at birth and this will give the degree which is on the 10th House by Direction both direct and converse. Note also the degrees on the A scendant or Descendant to which the Significators are thus directed and take out their declinations, and if any of them be that held by a planet at birth, such Significator will be in zodiacal parallel to that planet. Then for mundane parallels: Having the Sidereal Time equal to the Oblique Ascension or Descension of the Significator, and al so that of the radical Midheaven, find their difference. Add this difference to the Midheaven if the parallel is formed on the East side of the Meridi an, or subtract it if formed on the West side. This will give t he Oblique Ascension or Descension of the Point where the parallel forms. The difference between this and the Oblique Ascension of the planet taken under the same Pole as the Significator will be t he Arc of Direction. The use of the Tables of Houses is to form an approximate idea of the Directions in force or forming. These can afterwards be tested by exact calculation. In effect it will be found that this is the most satisfactory method of directing, inasmuch as it supplies ev idence of the true course of events at times when the Semiarc method absolutely breaks down. There is never any need to drag in the Fixed St ars nor to invest Promittors with the prerogatives of Significators, as has frequently been done of late by exponents in their desire to rehabili tate the Semiarc method. Even if we confine ourselves to Zodiacal as pects and parallels and leave out of consideration entirely t he mundane and Rapt Parallels, which hitherto have not been adjudged to be part of this system of directing under the Poles of Significators, we shall have abundant evidence that the course of events is clearly indicated by Dir ections derived from this system. It deserves, indeed, to be called the “Sign-Post” method, not only because it employs the Si gnificators under their respective Poles, but because truly it offers continual evidence of the nature of events we are called upon to deal with in our career, and very accurately indicates the times at which those events are to be expected. I understand that a complete set of Tables will be ready by 1917, and there already exists sets ranging from about 13 x to 56 x N., so that"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"there need be no difficulty experienced in testing the merits of this system. Dalton has a set which extends from 22 x to 56 x , but they are badly arranged for our purpose and are, moreover, vitiated to some extent by the introduction of a paralla x due to the oblate sphericity of the Earth. If, as we have every reason to believe from experience, the planets affect us via the Earth’s centre, the heavens being a right sphere extending from that centre , it does not matter what shape the Earth may be. The ordinary Tables of Houses calculated on a right sphere are more accurate and more suitable to our purpose. Worsdale’s Tables of Oblique Ascens ion are, of course, preferable in every way, as by them we can always get the Arc of Direction immediately without conversion into Sidereal Time.

The Moon, which by longitude is just below the West hor izon, is bodily several degrees below it, owing to the South latitude it has, namely, 2 x 27’. Its Pole is found to be 50 x 22’, and that of the Sun is found to be 25 x 2’. The Midheaven is in Right Ascension 271 x 18’. The Oblique Ascension of the Asc endant is therefore 90 x more, namely 361 x 18’, which reduced by the circle = 1 x 18’. R.A. 271 x 18’ M.C.

These are all the elements that we require for the calculation of the Directions. We can use the Tables for 50 x for the Moon’s Directions and those of 25 x for the Sun’s Directions, or we c an work by the Tables of Oblique Ascension, or again by logarithms. But as the whole purpose of this work is to make Directions easy, I shall work by the Tables. The King was married to Princess May of Teck on 6th July, 1893, being then 28 years 4 months, 3 days of age. This gives an Arc of 28 x 20’ at the rate of 1 x for every year. This is equivalent of 1h. 53m. 20s. of Sidereal Time. Add this to th e Midheaven at birth, which was Right"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Ascendant 271 x 18’ – 18h. 5m. 12s., and we get 19h. 58m. 52s., and in the Tables of Houses for the lati tude of London we find this to be equivalent to 27.5 x Capricorn, the Ascendant being then in Taurus 29 x . These two points represent the dire ct Direction of the Midheaven and Ascendant respectively. It is thus seen that the Midheaven has reached the sesquisquare as pect of the Sun at birth, which was in Gemini 12 x 25’. The Ascendant has the trine aspect of the Moon, within about 2 x . We now take the converse Directi ons of the same Significators, namely, the Midheaven and Ascendant, by subtracting the Arc of Direction instead of adding it. We thus obtain 16 hrs. 11m. 52s., which we find to give Sagittarius 5 x on the Midheaven, and Aquarius 4 x on the Ascendant. The former is just in tri ne to Mars in the 5th House of the radix, while the Ascendant is in tr ine to the Moon. None of these indications are, however, strong at the time of the event except the complete aspect of Midheaven trine Mars zod. con. The Moon’s Oblique Descension under its own Pole was found to be 177 x 14’, and for convenience we ta ke the Oblique Ascension of the opposite point, namely 357 x 14’, and from this we take 90 x to get the Right Ascension of t he Midheaven, namely 267 x 14’ which, being reduced to Sidereal Time = 17h. 48m. 56s., which is the Right Ascension of the Midheav en when the Moon’s place sets. Now to this we add, and also from it we take, the Arc of Direction, which we found to be 1h. 53m. 20s. We then get the direct and converse Directions of the Moon under the Asc endants of latitude 50 x 22’, which is the Moon’s Pole. The Direct Direction shows against 19h. 42m. 16s., the Midheaven is 24 x Capricorn. But we are not c oncerned with this, but only with the Ascendant which is in Taurus 22 x , and therefore we know that the 22nd degree of Scorpio (the opposite sign) has now reached the place of the Moon at birth, that is to say, the Moon is Directed to that point of the zodiac. No aspect is formed to this point. We therefore pass on to the Direction of the Moon conversely, by subtracting the Direction, 1h. 53m. 20s., from the Meridian of the lunar horoscope, 17h. 48m. 56s., and thus get 15h. 55m. 36s., which gives us the first degree of Aquarius rising, so that we kn ow the Moon has reached Leo 1 x by converse Direction, and this is in se xtile to the Moon’s radical place, the Moon at birth being on the cusp of the 7th House. So far, then, we have two Directions answering clos ely to the period of marriage, namely: Midheaven trine Mars zod. con. Moon sextile Moon zod. con., these Directions employing the 5th and 7th Houses of the radix, which is exactly what we should have expected."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" The Pole of the Sun was seen to be 25 x 2’. We have no Tables available for this latitude, and ther efore we use the Tables of Oblique Ascension for that latitude. To the Oblique Ascensio n of the Sun, 59 x 27’, we add the Arc of Direction, 28 x 20’, and obtain 87 x 47’, which under latitude 25 x we find to be the Ascension of Cancer 8 x 33’to which place the Sun is Directed. It is f ound to be in close sextile aspect to Venus, the ruler of the radical 7th H ouse. It is a st rong planet, being in its own sign and angular, and is al together suitable for marriage indication. The converse Direction of the S un is found by taking the Arc of Direction from the Sun’s radical Oblique Ascension, and against the remainder 31 x 7’ in the Tables of Oblique Ascension for lat. 25 x we find Taurus 10 x 47’, which is the place to which the Sun is conversely Directed. This, we observe, is in cl ose conjunction with Venus at birth. So that, taking all the current indi cations into account, we have four that are uniformly in harmony with the nature of the event, namely: Midheaven trine Mars zod. con. Moon sextile Moon zod. con. Sun sextile Venus zod. d. Sun conjunct Venus zod. con. Now, let us take another important event in the life of King George, namely, the death of his august father, King Edward VII, which happened in May, 1910, the Arc for the event being 44 x 56’, being within a month of t he 45th anniversary. Following out exactly the same methods, but with an Arc of 44 x 56’, which is equivalent to Sidereal Time 2h. 59m. 44s., we find the Directions to be as follows: 1. The Midheaven has reached Aquarius 13 x 45’, where it forms no Direction. But it is close to t he mid-distance of Uranus and Moon (see further below). 2. The converse Direction of the Midheaven is to Scorpio 18 x 50’, which is exactly the degree held by t he cusp of the 8th House (death) in the radix and in direct opposition to Mercury. 3. The direct Direction of the Ascendant is to Gemini 19 x 34’. Which falls between the longitudes of Uranus and the Sun and thus constitutes a parallel of Sun and Uranus on the angle of the Ascendant, and as both bodies move to form this aspect on the angle it is called a Rapt Parallel. 4. The converse Direction of the Ascendant is to Capricorn 13 x 15’, which forms no aspect. It is of interest, however, to note that it falls exactly in square aspect to the mid-distance of Saturn and the Moon, the exact position being Libra 12 x 33’. 5. The Moon is Directed to Sagittarius 14 x 1’, and has just passed the opposition of the Sun."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 6. Conversely the Moon is Directed to Cancer 11 x 56’, where it has the square aspect of Neptune. 7. The Sun by direct Di rection is in Cancer 23 x 7’, where it is close to the square of Saturn, ruler of the 10th House (the father). 8. Conversely the Sun is in Aries 19 x 38’, where it forms no aspect. We have thus the following significant Directions: Midheaven opposition Mercury. Sun Rapt Parallel Uranus. Moon opposition Sun (separating). Moon square Neptune. Sun square Saturn (applying). These are Directions which, falling together, signify change and death or hurt to the parents. If taken in connection with the eclipses which happened in June 1909, that of the Sun in opposition to the Ascendant of King Edward’s horoscope, and that of the Moon in opposition to the Sun in the horoscope before us, we shall have littl e difficulty in es timating the full significance of these Primary Directions. It should always be observed that when a point of Direction falls exactly between the longitudes of two bodies in the horoscope of birth, if this point be one of the angle s, Midheaven or Ascendant, Nadir, or Descendant, it constitutes a Rapt Parall el and is of great significance. I remember that one of the most di stressful periods of my life was attended by the Direction of the Midheaven to the mid-distance between Moon and Saturn = Moon Ra pt Parallel Saturn, while the death of my good mother was indicated by Moon Rapt Parallel Uranus, formed on the Western angle. These mid-distances appear to have been too much neglected and overlooked, owing, probably, to the fa ct that in the Semiarc method of Directing the positions of the bodies themselves (not their longitudes) are taken in proportion to their Semiar cs. But as we are dealing in this system solely with the longitudes, or positions in the zodiac, such mid- distances will take the place of Rapt Parallels. The mid-distances should be marked off on the horoscope so that they may be observed when coinciding with the place of Direction of either the Midheaven or Ascendant both by direct Direction and converse Direction. T hus in the Kaiser’s hor oscope the mid-distance between the Sun and the planet Neptune fa lls in Aquarius 29 x 47’, and therefore the Sun was Rapt Paralle l Neptune at the outbreak of the Great War. Neptune, it should be observed holds the 10th House, and it was surely the folly of madness for the Kaiser to have embarked on an enterprise of World Conquest at a time when the Sun was thus heavily afflicted, and when the Mi dheaven (honour and position) was"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Directed to a point which coincides wit h the cusp of the 8th House (loss of and death). It only illustrates once more the old saying: Quem Deus perdere vult prius dementat . This Parallel is easily calculated by the Tables of Houses, thus: Knowing the mid-distance to fall in Aquarius 29 x 37’, we find the rising of the opposite point, Leo 30 x , in the Tables for Berlin, and against this we find the Sidereal Time 3h. 6m. Add for subtraction 24 0 27 6 R.A. of M.C. radix, Subtract 23 27 3 39 = 55 degrees in Arc, or 55 years = 1914. In King George’s horoscope the mid-distance of Moon and Jupiter falls in Scorpio 13 x 22’, and this point has Right Ascension 220 x 54’ which, taken from t he radical Midheaven 271 x 18’ gives an Arc of Direction 50 x 24’,which measures to the end of 1915. Jupiter being in the 9th House, thus denotes the potent action of the Sword of Justice in foreign lands. Observe that Jupi ter here is on the Ascendant of the late King Edward, and being in the 9t h House denotes spiritual aid. The White Horse goes before the hos ts of Albion to good effect.  "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" CHAPTER XII. _______ The Telescopic View. _______ In the process of computing current Directions, as illustrated in the foregoing chapter, many opportunities occur for taking what I call “the telescopic view” of things. Thus it may be found on taking out the Directions to the Significators for the current year that there are none of special significance, but at the same time we may observe that the radical position of some striking Pr omittors, which include all of the planets, are in process of formation. It is then easy to estimate the times at which they will mature and become current Directions. This enables one to make long-distance fo recasts. The particular merit of this system of Directing under the Pole s of Significators is that it enables us to make a ready survey of current Directions, which cannot be done in the Semiarc me thod, owing to the Di rections being formed by proportion of the Semiarcs, and except in the Direction of the Ascendant and Midheaven the method is to this extent faulty. It deals in approximations and not in astronom ical facts, and can only be defended on the grounds of a natural symbolism. But in the present method, we have the current positions both direct and converse, of the four Significators, and we are therefore able, most frequently by a mere inspec tion of the Tables of Houses, to estimate the time of approaching Directi ons that strike us as important, and this by merely counting the Me ridian degrees that separate the current from the future position of the Significator, which is always supposed to be on the Ascendant of the Directional Horoscope. Thus we have the direct Directi on of the horoscope of King George for the year 1915. It is set for 50 years by adding 50 x to the Right Ascension of the Midh eaven at birth, thus: "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" B 5 A L 19 K 18 x 51’ J 28 x J 11 9 x P 38’ O 18 x 29’ N 12 x 26’ C 24 x 42’ 10 x U 9’ 25 x 40’ R 24 x 42’ I T 28 x 38’  5 x Q 35’ 24 x S 3’ 1 x M 4’ K 11 x D 28 x E 18 x 51’ F 19 G H 5 In this figure, which represents one fourth of the Directional work for the year, we are able to pick up the direct Directions of the Midheaven and Ascendant. These we see at a glance to be: Midheaven square Mercury zod. d., Ascendant opposition Jupiter zod. d., Ascendant semisquare Venus zod. d., and the Ascendant separating from the semisquare aspect of Mars. But we also perceive that Uranus is approaching the Ascendant, and inspection of the Tables of Houses fo r London shows that 4 x have to pass over the Midheaven before this Direction comes in to currency. This points to the year 1919 as one of extraordinary change and dislocations, of party strife and defections, with attendant governmental troubles. For Uranus was close to the lower Meri dian at the birth, and therefore opposed its influence to the Midheaven, which represents the supreme function and dignity of Rulership. The Midheaven will then be in Aquarius 23 x , and opposed by the opposition transit of Saturn, which planet begins his attack upon this point of the horoscope in the autumn of 1918. Consequently, we shall expect a considerable back-draught to result from the conclusion of the War, and many important dislocations and changes in the government of the country will transpire in consequence, all of which will be favourable to the resuscitation of the enemy, bruised and battered out of recognition though he may be, yet still alive and already smouldering with the ambition of la grande revanche . It is not for us her e to say what course the country will take, but it is predictable. It is obvious enough, however, from the fact that Jupi ter opposes the Ascendant and comes out of the radical 9th H ouse, that lawyers are t he present great source of hurt and detriment to the King. Unfortunately the circumlocution of our lawyer legislators cannot argue us out of the position into which they have brought the country."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" Similar figures to the above can be set up for the purpose of reviewing the current and future c onverse Directions of the Midheaven and Ascendant, and others for the Sun and Moon. But those who are capable of using the picture-memo ry, will be able to carry the horoscopes in their mind’s eye, and will have no difficulty in following the process already laid out and illustrated in the foregoing pages. In order to illustrate the system completely, however, I shall introduce the figures of the Solar and Lunar horosco pes, from which it will be seen that the radical S un and Moon are in the nature of Ascendants, which taken under the la titude of their polar elevation respectively, can be dealt with exac tly as if they were Ascendants under the equivalent latit udes, and thus they may be calculated entirely from Tables of Houses. These Poles of the Sun and Moon can be taken with near accuracy from their mundane positions in the radical horoscope. Thus, if the Sun be on the Ascendant it will have t he same Pole as the latitude of birth. If on the cusp of the 2nd, it will have the same Pole as the cusp of the 2nd House. These Poles of t he Houses are given in most works and are here repeated for convenience. (See Appendix.) But if the Sun be between the cusps of the tw o Houses it will have a Pole proportional to its distance from ei ther cusp. Thus, in the Royal Horoscope we have the Sun near the cusp of the 3rd House, the Pole of which in the latitude of London is 23 x 46’, and if it were on the cusp exactly, that would be its Pole. But the Sun is rather higher than the cusp of the 3rd House. The Pole of the 2nd being 40 x 51’ and that of the 3rd House 23 x 46’, their difference is 17 x 5’m and this is covered by 24 x of the zodiac included in the 2nd Hous e. Then we say: As 24 is to 17 so is 1, the distance of Sun fr om the 3rd cusp, to 1.5, or 1 x 20’, which being added 23 x 46’ gives 25 x 6’ for the Pole of the Sun. We can work quite closely enough by taking 25 x . The actual Pole of the Sun is 25 x 2’ as worked by proportion of its Semiarc to the quadrant and referred to its Meridian distance. In the case of the Moon the problem is also easy, but regard must be had to any latitude that the Moon ma y have at birth. This will affect its declination. But inasmuch as its Semiarc depends on its declination taken under the tangent of the latit ude of birth, it will have the same Semiarc as the adjacent degree of t he Ecliptic whose declination is at the same as that of the Moon. If we take the distance of this degree from the cusp of the hous e to which it is nearest and make proportion of the interval from the Poles of the including cusps, we shall arrive at a near approximation of the Pole of the Moon, near enough at all events for purposes of general observation. But if you require mathematically exact results you must pursue mathem atical methods and calculate all Arcs by Oblique Ascension from the Tables of Oblique Ascension to the nearest minute of space. The re sults obtained from the use of the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Tables of Houses can always be re lief upon to furnish a Direction, which will be correct to the nearest 15’ of space or three months of time. And this interval is an inconsiderable quantity when it is remembered that seldom do the Prim ary Directions operate exactly to time. They are hastened and retarded to some extent by the current transits and eclipses. In the case of doubtful data of birth, where the time is not accurately known, the Midheaven should first be corrected by an estimate made from several directions to the Midheaven and Ascendant, an average be ing generally correct within 1’ or so. Otherwise reference should be made to the Prenatal Epoch considered in relation to the Law of Sex. These considerations will enable the student to pursue the method of Directing here set forth with cons iderable easy and accuracy. The main object of all Directing is to know under what current influences a person may be and those also out of which the present condition arose and those to which the state of things tend. Nothing more than this is necessary, for the timing of events wi ll always be more readily effected by reference to transits and lunations (the entire equipment of the ancient astrologers0 than by any other means. The hands of a clock will show how major and minor indi cations should be estimated. The our hand of the clock corresponds wit h the Primary indications, the hour being the more impor tant consideration. The minute hand, which corresponds to the transits, will show the exact division of that hour. Thus from the general indications for the year current we come to the particular months wherei n the lunations fall in aspect to the radical positions of the planets, and lastly we come to the day on which the planets transit the places of Direct ion or the radical places of the Significators. Thus all the most accurately timed predictions are made by a cadence from the major to the minor indications. The diurnal horoscope is also of singular value in timing the passage of events indicated by the Directions, etc. thus in the Royal Horoscope we find that the planet Mars has progressed to Virgo 6 x by the year 1914, and the horoscope for 4th August, 1914, set for the same hour and minute as the birth figure, shows Pisces 6 x on the Midheaven. Also on October 29th of the following y ear, 1915, the Ascendant for the day was in Virgo 6 x , and on that day the King had a severe accident by being thrown from his horse, which became excited by the cheering of the soldiery. But most frequently it will be found that the ephemeral positions of the planets are transiting the Midheaven or Ascendant on the day of important ev ents, or the radical pl aces of the planets are similarly affecting the angles of the Diurnal Horoscope. There are very few events which are not thus indi cated if we take the radical, progressed, and diurnal places of the planets into account. "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIII. _______ The Solar and Lunar Horoscopes. _______ In the course of this short treatise we have made it clear that there are four separate Significators set up at the moment of a person'’ birth into this world as “Signposts” or markers. These Significators are set at different positions in the horos cope. The Midheaven and Ascendant guard the South and East points and the Sun and Moon are variously set according to their Poles, or t he latitude to which they correspond in the world. A Significator on the horizon would have the same Pole as the place of birth, and its rising would be mark ed by the transit of a point over the Meridian that is just 90 x or 6h. of Sidereal Time West of it. As it continued to rise it would alte r its Pole or place in the world, the latitude corresponding to it being less and less as it approached the Meridian, where it would be nil. Hence we measure its Arc by Right Ascension only when on t he Meridian, by the Oblique Ascension due to the latitude of birth when on the hor izon, and by that due to is Pole when in any intermediate place in t he horoscope. Therefore, we have to Direct it under its own Pole. This Direction is formed by keeping the Significator fixed and observing the rising and setting of the planets’ longitudes and aspects. And because every degr ee of the zodiac has the same Pole when it comes to t he same place in the world and forms a conjunction with the Significator, we do rightly to Direct that planet or longitude under the same Pole as the Significator, which is the same thing as finding the difference betw een their Oblique Ascensions or Oblique Descensions. But to take the Oblique Ascension of one planet under the horizon of birth and to apply it to the Oblique Ascension of a planet under another horizon is manifest ly inaccurate and can only lead to false results. If we take the Oblique Ascension of a Significator under its own Pole, however, and subtract from it 6h. or 90 x , we shall have the Midheaven in Right Ascension under which that Significator rises under the latitude corresponding to its Pole. This, I think, is sufficient proof that we are to treat the Sun and Moon as if they were rising in separate horoscopes for t he latitudes corresponding to their respective Poles. Accordingly, I have given two separate figures showing the Directional spheres of the Sun and Moon in the horoscope of Kaiser Wilhelm. Treating these as separat e horoscopes under their respective latitude of Poles, we shall easily find the Directions by merely consulting Tables of the Hous es for these latitudes, for all we have to regard is the rising degree in that horoscope after adding the Arc for the current year, and also subt racting it from the Midheaven."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"We merely have to note its declination and thus determine whether it forms any parallel with the planets at birth, and whether it forms any aspects in the zodiac.

The fact that the Moon had 5 x 14’ of South latitude accounts for this difference, for, in the Northern hemisphere, planets that have South latitude rise later and set earlier than the degree of the zodiac they hold. Incidentally this gives an entirely new method of interp retation, for it will be observed that, so far as the Sun is concerned, Neptune’s position indicates foreign affairs, and coming to the conjunction with the Sun it denotes foreign aggression, and especially of the naval order, Neptune being in the sign of Pisces. Observe the much afflicted Venus in the House of Progeny and the posit ion of Uranus on the cusp of the 11th opposing the Moon on the cusp of the 5th House. Here are broken relationships, defective alli es, and rescinded treaties by the score.

Find the Semiarc of the Body. – To the tangent of the latitude of the place add the tangent of the planet’s declination = the log. sine of the Ascensional Difference. If the body has North Declinati on, subtract this Ascensional Difference from 90 x for the nocturnal Semiarc, and add it to 90 x for the diurnal Semiarc. If the body has South declination, add the Ascensional Difference to 90 x for the nocturnal Semiarc, and subt ract it for the diurnal Semiarc. N.B. – For places South of the Equator, reverse the above. Find the Meridian Dist ance of the planet. – From the Right Ascension of the planet subtract the Right A scension of the nearest Meridian. The remainder is the Meridian Distance of that planet. Find the Pole of a Planet. – To the proportional logarithm of the Meridian Distance of the plane t, add the prop. log. of 90 x , and from the sum take the prop. log. of the planet ’s Semiarc. There will remain the prop. log. of the differ ence of the planet’s posit ion and the Meridian. Find the value of this and take it from the Meridian Distance of the planet. There will remain the Asc ensional Difference of the planet under its own Pole. From the sine log. of this take the tangent of the planet’s declination. The remain der will be the tangent of the Pole. NOTE. – A planet on the cusp of a House will have the same Pole as that cusp. Therefore, as the Semiarc of the Sun alters according to its declination, the degrees of the zodiac on the cusps of the Houses will alter under a given Meridian according to the date for which the calculation is made.

Of the latitude of the place of birth, add the log. tan of the Obliquity of the Ecliptic; the sum is the log. sine of the Ascensional Difference of the Tropic. Divide the Ascensional Difference by three, and to the log. sine of this add the contang. Of t he Ecliptic Obliquity (or subtract the log. tan., as above). The sum, or remainder, is the log. tan.
