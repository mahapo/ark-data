In fact, we can assume that simple empirical beginnings of astrology may have been rooted originally in the human capability to abstract and to generalize. The connection between the path of the Moon and the Sun through the sky and events in nature and behavior of living beings is easy to recognize. Likely these humans saw the Sun and the Moon as deities who had their influence upon events on nature. They observed the night sky and found that there were other bodies in the sky that move against the backdrop of the other stars. From this they may have generalized that those bodies were other gods who, like the Sun and the Moon indicated trends and events by their position in the sky. The position in the sky was perhaps seen as an expression of the will of these gods. The animistic system of the star cult was born. Humans began to observe the position of the planets and their angular distances in the sky, the planets. From such observations they developed a body of experience-based knowledge. From such simple beginnings astrology developed gradually into an extensive system of divination. The early astrologers did not just tell fortunes. They realized that the cosmic positions of the planets correlated with specific trends. Most of the ancient peoples saw these trends in an animistic way and thought of them as being gods. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs01.html (1 of 10)11/21/2005 10:01:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 1 The model of the astrological gods led to another development. Soon the ancients found ways in which they were capable of influencing these trends by way of interacting with the planetary gods. From there it was a small step to actually making, or generating, new trends with similar methods. The resulting magic, too, was an empirical science and so was the star cult that developed from a marriage between magic, astrological knowledge, and religious speculation. As far as magic is concerned, we know that magical action is one of the basic characteristics of life . Like astrology it developed from empirical knowledge. At some point in the past, a human being of ancient times may have had some bad thoughts of another person and soon that person was suffering some bad luck. After a few repeats that human being began to develop a mapping of the action, then pass it on to others, and soon a body of knowledge developed that was passed on as a tradition and later as a religion. I see the spontaneous emerging of a shaman in a group of humans as part of the genetic heritage of humankind. Astrological magic, then, is a logical way to take charge of one's destiny. The purpose of astrology is to describe trends for a human being or group of humans. On the other hand, magic that has its roots in astrology is an excellent way to reshape or eliminate undesirable trends, to enhance desirable trends, or to generate entirely new trends. See www.astrodyn.com for a system to generate astrology-based trends that you can apply with mindboggling ease! Magic is action upon the extended environment that makes use of life energy and structural links. (See my course \"Magic of the Future.\") Astrological magic develops structural links to desirable trends by employing astrological methods. Therefore, before you practice magical astrology, you need to gain a knowledge of natal astrology and of predictive astrology. Natal Astrology is the topic of the first part of this course. Any type magic that employs energies of astrological factors such as planets and signs is, strictly speaking, astrological magic. Designing a Venus talisman for the purpose of attracting a lover or to become more creative in the arts is astrological magic. So is the evocation of planetary spirits for the purposes of effecting change. It is irrelevant to what magical or religious tradition these spirits correlate. Magical astrology is a tool that helps us refine the technology of astrological magic. It is an astrology that helps us define and combine the energies that we need for very specific purposes. Approximate Methods Magic is action upon the universe. The magician employs life energy and structural links to generate trends. Traditional magicians connected with astrological energies when practicing astrological magic. Then they projected these energies to their target. Usually they calculated the exact time when such action was most favored by astrological trends. This ensured that the astrological trends were best for their magical operation. Some magicians of our days are still very strict in doing their work when the astrological aspects are correct. Astro Dynamic Manifestation is the most advanced branch of astrology that you can employ in your selection of the best times for action. Pop-magicians of our days are not as precise as the more scientific ceremonial magicians. Like followers of the wiccan religion, they are happy with a few rules concerning the path of the Moon through the sky. They do work to increase something when the Moon is waxing and they do work to diminish things when the Moon is waning. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs01.html (2 of 10)11/21/2005 10:01:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 1 Using more precise methods, practitioners of any kind have to find a \"window\" of astrological trends for the optimal effect of their work. However, this waiting for the exact time when an action at a distance was best limited the practitionner' effectiveness considerably. This was especially true when a problem needed immediate attention and did not allow the luxury of waiting. Consequently magicians of the old times went ahead to develop methods that allowed them to generate approximations to the trends they desired. The evocation of one or more planetary spirits is such a way. This practice ensures that the corresponding energies are present during the evocation. The magician uses a variety of methods to get an approximation to a real astrological field. One of these methods is a modification of a planetary spirit with the appropriate energy of a zodiacal sign. Another one is to generate astrological aspects by having the spirits connect with each other. Modern Methods to Generate Astrological Trends With the invention of the Chi Generator® (orgone generator®) in 1991 by Karl Hans Welz, this situation changed significantly and immediately. The Welz generator furnishes the life energy that is necessary to make an astrological trend powerful. For instance, if you put a structural link that connects with the energies of Mars (such as the magical square of Mars) in front of a Chi Generator®, you generate a strong field of these energies. Establish a psychic link with a target person (a target-Link) and you transfer these Mars energies to that person. That is what magicians of the old school can do as well. The essential difference between the traditional approach and the technological one (with the Chi generator®) lies in the fact that the Chi Generator® supplies life energy continuously. This ensures the continuity of the desired trend. Life energy is the carrier-medium of astrological energies that gives them power. Furthermore, with the invention of the Chi Generator®, we can now use a system of twelve (even more) of these life force generating devices, one for each sign, for example! The Astro Trend Generation System 3000 (ATGS 3000) is such a system of twelve Welz generators. In such a system you can set up a zodiac, with planets, signs, houses, even aspects. In fact, with the ATGS 3000 you can now set up astrological energy fields that never occur naturally! The applications of this excellent tool are infinite! This series of courses will introduce you to the magical astrology that you need to gain the full benefit of the ATGS 3000. Once you have mastered these courses you will be able to set for yourself the parameters of any type of \"astrological greenhouse\" that you desire -- to change events or for any type of action. Setting an astrological greenhouse is magical action! As a side benefit you will also learn how to interpret astrological charts. A New Dimension in Astrology! With this course I will introduce you to an innovation of epoch making importance in the field of practical astrology. This innovation is the ATGS 3000: The Astro Trend Generation System 3000. With special settings and attachments, this exciting device generates any trend, or astrological energy, you desire. Yes! With the help of Chi Generators, you can now generate any astrological field (chart condition) of your liking! This means that you can now modify, even totally override, any field of transiting or progressed planets. You can even change basic personality traits that appear in the birth chart of a person. In addition to that, you can generate your own astrological trend system that will support you in your quest for success, love, and for any other purpose. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs01.html (3 of 10)11/21/2005 10:01:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 1 There is more to the ATGS 3000! With the right structural link (or psychic link) it acts at any distance. In other words: you can generate any desired field of astrological energies or trends (even trends that never occur naturally) and then project it to any person, or location, on this planet. All you need is some basic knowledge of astrology and a good structural link to your target person or target area. This added capability will change for good the practice of astrology. WITH THE CHI GENERATOR®, ASTROLOGICAL PRACTICE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN, BECAUSE THE SERIOUS ASTROLOGER IS NOW CAPABLE TO HELP RATHER THAN JUST GIVE ADVICE. THE PRACTICING ASTROLOGER DOES SO BY GENERATING THE TRENDS THE CLIENT NEEDS, OR WANTS. IN THIS NEW CAPACITY, THE PRACTICING ASTROLOGER IS NOW AN ASTRO TECHNICIAN! The Astro Trend Generation System is technology that evolved from new knowledge of the nature of life energies in general and of astrological energies in particular. With it, you are now capable to help your clients more than ever before. Now you have the opportunity to go beyond describing future trends and giving your advice of how your client may use these trends. With the JU 99, and, especially, the ATGS 3000, you are now able to GENERATE TRENDS for your clients: any TRENDS THEY DESIRE. If you want to be part of an ever growing number of astrologers of the future who go beyond mere consultation services, I invite you to read on. All you need is an open mind and the willingness to make a difference by getting the edge over others because of new astrological technology. Why Astrology Works Astrology is an empirical science. Millennia ago it has developed as a result of careful observation of the positions of the Sun, Moon and planets in the zodiacal signs in relation to the time and place of an event. Gradually a huge body of knowledge developed. Thanks to this knowledge, astrologers can describe in detail such things as character, psychological traits, and trends of destiny. They can do so with an accuracy and speed that no \"academic method\" such as psychology can ever achieve. Most astrologers assume that astrology works because the earth is surrounded with a field of planetary and zodiacal energies that determine trends of destiny at all times. With the movement of the planets, this field is continuously changing. Many astrologers of our time view these energies as having characteristics very much like the electromagnetic energy that physics describes. Although this type of thinking is a nice compromise with the opinions that are presently dictating academia, it cannot explain many things in astrology. Astrologers who think this way are at a complete loss in the attempt to explain why the astrological effect of planets that are far away is just as strong as the influence of closer planets, and why symbolic directions, progressions, and Arabian parts are useful. Another group of present day astrologers evades such models completely. They speak of \"synchronicity\" and of cosmic archetypes. On closer examination, these words seem to be to be nothing more than labels without meaning. The Horoscope Represents Structural Settings An excellent and logical model of astrology that explains comprehensively its working comes from a relatively young science: from radionics. Radionics is a technology that is structure oriented. Its results file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs01.html (4 of 10)11/21/2005 10:01:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 1 show that it works. Practitioners of radionics, too, have a problem in explaining how their technology works. The holographic approach sounds fascinating, but it is too complicated. To this day I have not seen any new basic technology resulting from the holographic approach. Our research led us to the conclusion that the reason for the effectiveness of radionics lies in hyper space mathematics, which developed from a thorough analysis of the effects of life energies. It is structure based. Structures of this kind transcend the space time continuum of relativistic physics. From this follow the many applications of radionic practices. For the flow of life energy, and anything attached to it, distance is a result of structural differences! Establish very similar structures and life energy transfers nearly without any dissipation of \"loss!\" This is so because life energy follows the laws of negative entropy, i.e., the stronger field draws from the weaker! Astrology, too, finds a better explanation in this hyper space mathematics. The zodiac, combined with the ever changing positions of the planets and houses, can be regarded as a structural setting for the event that it describes, very much like radionics. Life energy is the carrier of the spectrum of astrological energies. It establishes a direct link between the planetary positions and the human being. The Solar system, which is object of astrological analysis, can be regarded as a huge radionics box that spans around the place-time position of an event. Seen this way, the workings of symbolic directions are easy to understand, as do progressions, Arabian parts, and other astrological procedures that do not quite fit the current modernistic models of astrology. The Wise Rules the Stars Astrologers of ancient times considered astrological energies to be deities. By their positions in the sky, these deities communicated their will. Since they regarded these deities as persons, the ancient astrologers began to devise methods to make deities change their minds. The astro magicians of ancient cultures did what conventional astrologers of modern times have long forgotten: rather than just consulting their clients, they created a workable model that enabled them to change the trends of destiny. In other words: they participated in the shaping of destiny. This is the true meaning of the old saying that the wise rules the stars. Main stream astrologers of our times are too busy compromising with concepts of modern sciences such as psychology and astro physics. Therefore they are incapable of accepting any technology that has evolved from the ancient \"magical\" perception of the universe. Since main stream astrologers have not even come up with any satisfactory theory on their own to explain why astrology works, they are equally incapable of conceiving a technology that can generate or modify astrological trends. Their ignorance forfeited one basic characteristic of the human species: the skill of modifying the environment to make things happen that would not occur naturally. As a result of this ignorance, the capability of the modern astrologer is reduced to describing trends and to consulting. In no way can we see the mainstream astrologer of our days as being \"the wise who rules the stars.\" A mere consultant never rules! Astrology and Life Energy Astrological trends are the result of life energy in interaction with the planetary positions in the Solar system. These planetary positions, as seen from the Earth, take the aspect of being a large radionics device. Our experimental research has found proof that the energy of the planets is transferred by means of life energy (structural links). Life energy is not bound to the space time of electromagnetic vibrations. Its transfer is based on structures. This explains the many phenomena of pyramid energy, crystal energies, Runic energies, ESP, psychic phenomena, magical procedures, etc. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs01.html (5 of 10)11/21/2005 10:01:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 1 Electromagnetic energy follows the principle of entropy. If you bring together a hot object and a cold object, an energy exchange takes plane that eventually leads to a balance: both objects have the same temperature. Electric energy also operates within the confines of the physical space. Life energy, to the contrary, follows the principle of negative entropy. If you connect two objects of different potentials of life energy, the flow of life energy goes from the stronger object to the weaker one. Life energy is structure related. Simply stated, if you have identical structures, there is no distance for life energies. Magicians of all times have known of this \"action at a distance\" and they devised their methods accordingly. From the preceding follows that electromagnetic energy and life energies (Prana, Chi, Orgone, etc.) act like opposite polarities. The interplay of both forms of energy makes life possible. Our research led us one step further: When we energized symbols that represent the structural qualities of a planet with life energy, we created a strong force field of this planetary energy. On the basis of this principle we developed generators of astrological trends. We developed this technology further to send the astrological trends to any target. This was possible with a structural link, or \"psychic link\" as some traditionalists prefer to call it. The technology that we developed led naturally to the technology of the astrological greenhouse. The Astrological Greenhouse The seasons of the year are cyclical in nature. The climate of plant growth is in the main determined by the motion of the Sun. Each season has its own characteristics. The seasons determine when it is good to sow, to cultivate, and to harvest. The astrological climate is comparable to the seasonal climate. The positions of the stars indicate when it is good to begin something, when an action is favorable, and when it is better to diplomatically delay and wait. Since ancient times, human beings have devised methods to be less dependent on the challenges of the environment. The seasonal cycle of sowing, growing, and harvesting is such a challenge. In a greenhouse, you can grow whatever you want independent from the outside climate. This is so because in a greenhouse you create the climate that you find most appropriate for the plants you intend to cultivate. With a system of Chi Generators® such as the ATGS 3000, you are now capable of generating an astrological climate that you can custom tailor to the individual, depending on his or her needs or wants. Just as a greenhouse protects plants from the biting frosts of the winter outside and allows lush growth, so can a well-tuned ATGS 3000 cause an astrological climate that provides you with decisive success at times when the overall cosmic trends are not promising at all. The new technology of the Chi Generator® allows you to make the step from being ruled by the stars to being wise who rules of cosmic energies. 'Everything has its time,' says the astrologer-consultant. 'I can make the right time for everything,' says the Astro Trend Manager, or Astro Technician, who uses the ATGS 3000. With the ATGS 3000, you can now build your own astrological greenhouse to make your dreams come true. You can use the same technology to generate the trends that cause others to do your bidding. Therefore, the astrological greenhouse gives you a decisive advantage in any one of your endeavors: be it success in love, business, power aspirations, or spiritual ventures. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs01.html (6 of 10)11/21/2005 10:01:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 1 In the following lessons you will find the instructions that you need to properly tune your ATGS 3000. This course is also a good introduction into astrology. With this course, you are going to be introduced into the following: 1. A description of the energetic fundamentals of astrology. What are the energies that astrology describes? How do these energies relate to each other within the realm of the solar system? How do they correlate to human beings, life, and events that we observe on this planet. 2. A system to interpret natal charts that you can learn and apply with ease. I am using the key word method that allows the intelligent student to delineate a natal chart after a very short period of study. 3. A similar system that helps you to describe the field of astrological energies in more generalized terms. 4. Methods that help you in the timing of events, using the existing astrological positions. 5. Methods to create for yourself any astrological system of trends that you desire to help you succeed in your goals. At that time you will be able to rule the stars in a way that would make the ancient astro magicians very jealous. Needless to say, it is the high-tech approach of the ATGS 3000 that makes this possible! The Energetic Basis of Astrology There is no event of this planet for which we could not design an astrological chart, or horoscope. This is simply so because our planet is surrounded by the planets of our Solar system and the stars at all times! The astrological chart, or horoscope, is a map that we draw. In this map we show the position of the planets, stars, and other astrological factors, at the time of an event. The astrological chart is a map that serves a purpose. Therefore many factors that are not relevant for the astrological interpretation, such as the distance of the planetary bodies, are left out. All that counts is the position of the planet in the sky that we observe. Using methods of interpretation that have developed throughout the millennia as an empirical science, we derive from the astrological chart descriptions of the event that it represents. We have reason to believe that the zodiac acts like a gigantic radionic device, the structure of which is transfered by the life force of the universe. The Astronomical Basis of Astrology Every event that we analyze astrologically has its place and its time on our planet, or in relation to our planet. An astrological chart, then, maps the positions of the astrological factors, mainly planets, houses and signs, around the place of this event at the time of the event. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs01.html (7 of 10)11/21/2005 10:01:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 1 Because an event is understood as having specific space-time coordinates, there is no event on this planet for which we cannot erect an astrological chart that corresponds to these coordinates. The fundamental factors in an astrological chart are the positions of the stars and planets in relation to the event that the chart relates to. The astrological chart is a graphic representation of the actual positions of the astrological factors around the event. Being an abstraction, factors that are irrelevant for the interpretation of the chart are left out. The system of astrological houses is a twelve-fold subdivision of the horizon that surrounds the event. The houses describe the fields of manifestation of astrological trends. The fixed stars, Sun, Moon, and planets appear to revolve around the place as a result of the rotation of the Earth around its axis. In this apparent motion, the Sun, Moon, planets and stars make a complete orbit around the place once every day. In this daily orbit, these celestial bodies travel through all twelve houses once a day. Consequently the impact of a planet will manifest differently with each house through which it passes in its daily orbit. The planets, Sun and Moon are moving in relation to the background of the seemingly \"fixed\" stars at their own speeds. These celestial bodies remain close to an imaginary circle in the sky that astronomers call the \"ecliptic.\" This circle, the ecliptic, is subdivided into twelve equal parts, which are the astrological signs. The signs modify the planetary functions, i.e., they are used to describe the manner in which the planets operate. In their path through the ecliptic, the planets continuously change their positions relative to each other, forming different angles to each other. If these angles fall within the range of specific degrees, we say that the planets in question are in mutual aspect. In the astrological interpretation, two planets in aspect indicate that their functions interact more strongly. The nature of the aspect determines whether such interaction is of a harmonic or disharmonic nature. The exactness of the aspect determines its power. How to read a chart In the following I will not give you an introduction of astronomy as it relates to astrology. This you will learn in a later part of your studies. What is essential at the beginning of your studies is that you learn how to read an astrological chart and that you understand its structure. This is so because the chart is the basis for astrological interpretation and for astrological magic, or the creation of trends. In the booklet that comes with this course you learn how to draw and read a chart. In this course I will not bother you with teaching the primitive twelve-equal-wedges chart drawing that is still in use in the English speaking countries. It is a chart that shows the position of houses and planets in the signs of the zodiac. The twelve-equal-wedges chart is worthless if you want to practice effective astrological magic. After you finish studying this booklet I suggest that you order a printout of your chart, or, better yet, order a blank chart and the data of your chart, then inscribe the planets, houses, and aspects yourself as shown in the booklet. To use your own chart adds a fascinating new dimension to your studies of astrology. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs01.html (8 of 10)11/21/2005 10:01:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 1 To have your chart calculated, you need to give us the following data: Your date and year of birth, the time of your birth and the place of your birth. The Sample Chart As I have pointed out above, the chart represents the positions of the planets and signs as they were found at the time of the event for which the chart was erected. For you to understand better the elements of the chart, I am proceeding step by step. As you have seen in the introduction, the zodiac is subdivided in twelve signs. The signs of the zodiac are arranged in a counterclockwise manner, beginning with the sign of Aries. The zodiac has a full circle of 360 degrees. Therefore each of the zodiacal signs has 30 degrees of arc. In the zodiac we have marked another twelve fold subdivision. This subdivision is the system of astrological houses. Each of these houses represents a field of life experiences, or a sphere of life. The houses are arranged in a counterclockwise manner. Each house is marked with a number. Some astrologers prefer Roman numerals for the twelve houses. At the beginning of each house you see a number and a letter that tell you in which sign the house falls and in what degree and minute of the sign. The beginning of the house is also called the cusp of the house. As you can see in the chart, the signs are always 30 degrees each, while the houses are never 30 degrees each. The axis that connects the first and seventh house cusps is called the horizon, while the axis between the tenth and fourth house cusps is called the meridian. The cusp of the first house is the ascendant, or rising degree. This is so because the ascendant is the point of the ecliptic that rises in the East at the time of the event. The cusp of the tenth house is the Mid heaven. It is the point of the ecliptic (the yearly path of the sun through the sky) that is above the place of the event at the time of the event. Because of the rotation of the Earth, all signs orbit apparently through ascendant, mid heaven and the other houses once every day. In astrology ascendant and mid heaven are treated very much like planets, i.e., the aspects of these points with planets are considered in the astrological interpretation. At the beginning of each house (its cusp) you find numbers that indicate its position in the sign: 25 le 45 means that the house cusp falls in 25 degrees 45 minutes of arc of the sign of Leo. This chart shows the position of the planets in the zodiac for the time of the event. Again, each planet has its symbol, and its position in the sign is marked with the appropriate numbers and letters. If we combine both charts, the chart of the houses and the chart of the planets, we have all significant points of the astrological chart inscribed. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs01.html (9 of 10)11/21/2005 10:01:31 PM"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 1 Below you see the same chart twice: in the primitive twelve equal wedges manner and in the scientific manner that we use for astrological magic. As an exercise you may take the planetary and house positions of your birth time and put them into the chart step by step: First you enter the houses, then the planets. This is topped off by drawing the aspects between planets, ascendant and mid heaven into the chart. We will deal with the planetary aspects later.

These factors are: the planets, the zodiacal signs, the mundane houses, and the aspects. The planets represent functions, human inclinations, motivations, and tendencies. The sign in which a planet is located indicates the character of the planetary function, or how it operates. The aspects between planets tell about the mutual interaction of their functions, whether harmonic, disharmonic, strong or weak. Finally, the houses show the fields of life experience where the planetary and zodiacal forces most likely manifest. Since the planets represent human inclinations and motivations, it will be useful to gain an understanding of the planetary principles before we go on to describe the signs and houses. An astrological interpretation is a translation from chart structures into statements that we make with our language. The easiest way to do this translation is the method of key words. With this method we can derive sentences that describe the individual directly from his or her chart. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs02.html (1 of 9)11/21/2005 10:01:53 PM"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 2 The key word method is very effective, provided that you know your key words. With practice you can use these key words as trigger that help you expand on the statements that you make in your astrological interpretation. It is essential that you learn your key words well. Without knowledge of the various elements of astrology, i. e., the planets, signs, houses, etc., you cannot properly interpret astrological charts, let alone design charts for specific purposes in your work of astrological magic. With knowledge of your key words the interpretation of a chart or the developing of an astrological trend structure for magical purposes compares very much to the translating of one language into another. The basic key words for the planets Planet Key word for its inclination and motivation Sun to integrate, to express, to project Moon to respond, to react, to regulate Mercury to communicate, to concentrate, to transmit Venus to relate, to unite, to connect Mars to initiate, to activate, to move Jupiter to expand, to mature, to experience Saturn to limit, to control, to discipline Uranus to deviate, to invent, to reform Neptune to refine, to detect, to transcend Pluto to eliminate, to transform, to regenerate The zodiacal sign in which a planet is located reveals the manner in which the person brings forth the inclination and motivation of the planet. The mundane house in which the planet is found describes the sphere of life upon which the person concentrates the inclination and motivation of the planet. The aspects between the planets show special modifications that will effect the actual efforts. In the following, you find a more detailed description of the planets. It is essential that you study it carefully.

After you have carefully studied these key words and the symbolic associations of each of the planets, review these principles often and systematically. Strive to establish firmly in your mind the planetary principles so that you can, as your study progresses, expand the symbolic representation to encompass all matters that properly belong with each planet, including the magical ones. For example, you should realize that Mercury is associated with all matters of communication, including the abilities to reason and to express one's thoughts. Thus, this planet is logically connected with the media for communication. It is the key word extensions that suggest to you the vastness of the associations. Later, you will see how reasonably these planetary principles take on significant form and reveal through the birth chart both the disposition and the indisposition of the person concerned. Finally, you should become familiar with the various tables of planets, signs, houses, etc., so that you will begin to use the symbols and review the key words.

Now, you will see that it is the signs of the zodiac that reveal human attitudes toward and manners of expression of these inclinations and motivations. The sign in which the Sun falls, for example, will reveal the manner in which the person seeks to integrate, to express, and to project. Later you will see the sphere of life upon which the planetary inclination, operating in the manner of the sign, will be concentrated. Then, you will see how this particular effort, manifesting itself in a certain manner, and concentrating upon a specific area of life, will be qualified or modified by aspects to the planet in question. Now, remembering the presentation of the zodiac in relationship to the Solar system, envision in your mind the huge circle or belt surrounding the Earth, inside which the Earth completes a rotation within the twenty- four hour period and a revolution around the Sun within a one year period. Then, recall that outside this huge circle or belt the outer planets are in constant motions in their orbits around the Sun. It is, therefore, this outside the belt activity with which you are concerned as you begin to understand planetary motion through the signs. The imaginary belt, or the zodiac, naturally contains 360 degrees, file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs03.html (1 of 14)11/21/2005 10:02:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 3 since it is a circle. This circle is divided into twelve equal parts, each part containing 30 degrees. These twelve parts, then, are the signs of the zodiac. According to its distance from the Sun and its revolutionary speed, each planet spends a specific period of time in each sign as it makes a complete journey around the zodiac. It is this orderly progress through the signs that accounts for the changes in manners of operation of the planetary inclinations and motivations. Because the zodiac, being a circle, has no beginning and no end, one must select a starting point as a frame of reference. Astrologers have for centuries considered the sign Aries to be the first sign of the twelve. This selection has a symbolic meaning because the entry of the Sun into Aries on March 21 heralds the first day of spring, the season of new life. Therefore, using Aries as the point of beginning, the signs in their natural manner in a counter clockwise motion fall into the horoscopic chart as you see in the companion brochure. Logically, the actual positions of the signs in a specific chart will be determined through scientific calculations, using the precise birth data of the person concerned. Nevertheless, the order will always be the same; it is the horoscopic positions that vary from one to the other. Begin now to gain an insight into the significance of the keywords that identify the attitudes and manners of expression that are associated with each sign of the zodiac. It will be obvious that the attitudes of expression are presented in the form of adjectives and that the manners of expression are presented in adverbs. Sign Attitudes of Expression Manners of Expression Aries Assertive, Urgent Assertively, Urgently Taurus Enduring, Possessive Enduringly, Possessively Gemini Versatile, Variable Versatilely, Variably Cancer Sensitive, Protective Sensitively, Protectively Leo Impressive, Creative Impressively, Creatively Virgo Analytical, Critical Analytically, Critically Libra United, Harmonious Unitedly, Harmoniously Scorpio Intense, Secretive Intensely, Secretively Sagittarius Free, Wide Freely, Widely Capricorn Prudent, Reserved Prudently, Reservedly Aquarius Indifferent, Unconventional Indifferently, Unconventionally Pisces Impressionable, Intuitive Impressionably, Intuitively At this point, you should readily see that you can make the first step in interpreting the Sun in your chart, although you have not learned to read a chart. Everyone knows the sign of his own Sun; it is this knowledge that gave rise to pop-astrology. Thus, if your Sun is in Libra, you can now say about yourself: \"my inclination to integrate, to express, and to project will operate unitedly and harmoniously.\" file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs03.html (2 of 14)11/21/2005 10:02:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 3 Note that this latter sentence contains the key words for the Sun and the key words for the manner of expression of the sign Libra. Later, of course, you will be able to identify the sphere of life upon which this inclination in the specified manner will concentrate, as well as you will be able to make any modifications that aspects may require. Presently, however, study carefully and thoughtfully the ensuing presentation of the signs.

Planet Affiliations Piscean principles have a very close correspondence to the inclinations and motivations of the planets Neptune and Jupiter. Concomitant Relations Pisces has an affinity with illusions, delusions, spiritual matters, mysticism, alcohol, drugs, the sea, institutions, and abstractions. These, then, are the twelve attitudes and manners of expression through which a planet will operate as it makes its never ending journey through the zodiac, spending a certain period of time in each of the signs. These attitudes and manners are made even more clear, however, through three systems of grouping the signs: sextuplets, triplicities, and quadruplicities. The Sextuplets The first of these groupings, the sextuplets, concerns positive and negative polarities. Beginning with Aries, the signs have been traditionally classified alternatively as positive and negative; that is, Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius are positive signs; Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces are negative signs. These two classifications do not carry a connotation of superiority and inferiority; instead the term positive means outgoing or active. Correspondingly the term negative means indrawn or passive. In other words, a planet in a positive sign is prone to operate somewhat extravertedly; and a planet in a negative sign is prone to operate somewhat introvertedly. Consequently, you should become familiar with the key words for this particular grouping of the signs. Grouping Attitude of Expression Manner of Expression Positive Vigorous Vigorously Negative Passive Passively Thus, in the interpretation of a planet in a sign, you must consider, in addition to the key words for the sign itself, the key word for the positive or negative grouping. For example, if your own natal Sun is in Libra, you would now say this about yourself: \"My inclination to integrate, to express, and to project will operate unitedly, harmoniously, and vigorously.\" Note that the key word vigorously is added because Libra is a positive sign. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs03.html (10 of 14)11/21/2005 10:02:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 3 On the other hand, if your natal Sun is in Virgo, a negative sign, you would say this: \"My inclination to integrate, to express, and to project will operate analytically, critically, and passively.\" The Triplicities The next of these groupings, the triplicities, concerns itself with the four basic elements in man -- fire, earth, air, and water. Beginning with Aries and continuing in natural order, the signs are grouped by the elements in that order; hence, the fire signs are Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius; the earth elements are Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn; the air elements are Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius; and the water signs are Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. This method of grouping the signs was developed when astrologers discovered that the three signs of each group share a common basis for harmony through the element. In addition, each grouping has a correspondence to the ancient concepts of the choleric (fire), the melancholic (earth), the sanguinic (air), and the phlegmatic (water) temperaments. Consequently, you should become familiar with the key words for this further grouping of the signs. ElementAttitude of ExpressionManner of Expression Fire Forceful Forcefully Earth Cautious Cautiously Air Pensive Pensively Water Emotional Emotionally Now, in the interpretation of a planet in a sign, you must consider, in addition to the key words for the sign itself and the key words for the positive and negative grouping, the key word for the element associated with the sign. For example, if the natal Sun is in Libra, you would take on the additional insight as follows: \"My inclination to integrate, to express, and to project will operate unitedly, harmoniously, vigorously, and pensively.\" Note that the word pensively is added because Libra is an air sign. Correspondingly, a natal Sun that is in Virgo, an Earth sign, would be interpreted in the following fashion: \"My inclination to integrate, to express, and to project will operate critically, analytically, passively, and cautiously.\" The Quadruplicities The last of the three groupings, the quadruplicities, concerns itself with the three basic characteristics of INITIATIVE, STABILITY, and ADAPTABILITY; thus, the groups are called cardinal, fixed, and mutable. Beginning with Aries and continuing in natural order, the signs are grouped by these characteristics in that order; hence, the cardinal signs are Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn; the fixed signs are Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius; and the mutable signs are Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs03.html (11 of 14)11/21/2005 10:02:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 3 This method of grouping the signs was developed when astrologers discovered that the four signs of each group share a common basis for starting, staying, and adjusting. Further, this method of grouping has a symbolic relationship to the sun's apparent journey through the signs as this journey marks the seasons of the year. For example, the Sun enters Aries on March 21, the first day of spring; hence, new startings take place. Next, the Sun enters Taurus on April 21; hence, spring is staying. Finally, the sun enters Gemini on May 22; hence, spring is adjusting to the approaching summer. Similarly, you can follow through and see that each group of three successive signs is related to the onset of, the fixation to, and the changing of a season. Consequently, you should become familiar with the key words for this last grouping of the signs. ClassificationAttitude of ExpressionManner of Expression Cardinal Enterprising Enterprisingly Fixed Stable Stably Mutable Adjustable Adjustably Finally, in the interpretation of a planet in a sign itself, you must consider, in addition to the key words for the sign itself, the key word for the positive or negative grouping, and the key word for the element -- the key word for the classification. Thus, the natal Sun in Libra would now be initially interpreted as follows: \"My inclination to integrate, to express, and to project will operate unitedly, harmoniously, vigorously, pensively, and enterprisingly.\" Note that the key word enterprisingly is added because Libra is a cardinal sign. On the other hand, a natal Sun in Taurus, a negative, earth, fixed sign, would be initially interpreted as follows: \"My inclination to integrate, to express, and to project will operate enduringly, possessively, passively, cautiously, and stably.\" At first, this kind of structure may seem quite awkward or pompous. Nevertheless, you will eventually see that the Sun in Taurus ultimately would be interpreted in a fashion such as this: \"My natural urge to become a significant part of the environment will manifest itself in an inobtrusive manner that may go unnoticed to others. At the same time, there is beneath this quiet cleverness a certain amount of persistence and prudence that will sustain me through any difficulties that I may encounter as I reach for that which I feel I must have.\" Review regularly, now, these key words that are associated with the signs, as well as the physiological, planetary, and concomitant correspondences. In the chart below, you see the planets that are called the rulers of the signs. This term does not connote any dictatorial type of ruler. Instead, ruler suggests affinity. Begin, also, to use the symbols for the signs and for the planets. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs03.html (12 of 14)11/21/2005 10:02:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 3 Sign Keywords Pos/Neg Element Classification Aries Assertive Urgent Vigorous Forceful Enterprising Taurus Enduring Possessive Passive Cautious Stable Gemini Versatile Variable Vigorous Pensive Adjustable Cancer Sensitive Protective Passive Emotional Enterprising Leo Impressive Creative Vigorous Forceful Stable Virgo Analytical Critical Passive Cautious Adjustable Libra United Harmonious Vigorous Pensive Enterprising Scorpio Intense Secretive Passive Emotional Stable Sagittarius Free Wide Vigorous Forceful Adjustable Capricorn Prudent Reserved Passive Cautious Enterprising Aquarius Indifferent Unconventional Vigorous Pensive Stable Pisces Impressionable Intuitive Passive Emotional Adjustable Click here for Lesson IV - Back to Lesson II Back to Astrology Page file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs03.html (13 of 14)11/21/2005 10:02:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 4 A Course in Natal Astrology by Karl Hans Welz, inventor of the Chi Generator®, Orgonite®, etc. ADM - Astro-Dynamic Manifestation Techniques: A new astrology-based technology to optimize the energies in your house, apartment, business, and for yourself Knowing your astrological trends compares to a road map in an otherwise unknown city.

Now, you will see that it is the houses of the birth chart that point toward affairs of life upon which these efforts, functioning in a specified manner, will be concentrated. First of all, the houses are traditionally referred to as mundane houses because they point toward worldly activities. Actually, the houses are divisions of the planet Earth; hence, Earth is the third art of the three part relationship that is the foundation for basic astrological conclusions: planets, signs, and earth. the fourth factor, aspects, depends upon this three part relationship, as you will see later. In chart casting procedures, the houses always remain in the same position; Thus, the first house is the first house in all charts. It is the planets in signs that will move among the various houses, as determined by the birth date, the birth hour, and the birth place. Note, then, the following chart with the numbers of the houses in their proper places. This numbering will NEVER change. The spokes, or dividing lines between houses, are called CUSPS: and it is on these cusps that the signs of the zodiac are recorded in the twelve equal wedges chart, as you will see later. Note that the cusps of the file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs04.html (1 of 11)11/21/2005 10:02:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 4 houses are numbered. They correspond to the houses that they in effect open, following a counter clockwise motion. Further, the first cusp is called the ASCENDANT. This is so because it is the exact point on the eastern horizon that indicates the demarcation line between the end of the night and the beginning of day. Next, the tenth cusp is called MEDIUM COELI, or the MIDHEAVEN, because it marks the exact overhead point that separates morning from afternoon; then, the seventh house cusp is called DESCENDANT, because it is the exact point in the West that indicates the demarcation line between the end of the day and the beginning of the night. Finally, the fourth cusp is called the IMMUM COELI or MIDNIGHT, because it is the exact point that marks the end of one day and the beginning of the next one. With these points in mind, study the following chart to see how, for purposes of chart casting, the motions of the signs and the planets are treated, remembering that the houses never move. Now, begin to gain insights into the affairs of each house by studying carefully the key words that are listed below. House Affairs and Activities First Personal and self-related concerns Second Personal possessions and security Third Relationship to the immediate environment Fourth Personal home and private life Fifth Instinctive affections and re-creation Sixth Services given and received and health Seventh Partnership relationships at a personal level Eighth Material relationships involving shared resources Ninth Mental and physical explorations Tenth Place in society and standing in the world Eleventh Hopes and wishes and impermanent attachments Twelfth Freedom from restrictions file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs04.html (2 of 11)11/21/2005 10:02:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 4 At this point, you should readily see that you can make another step in interpreting the Sun in a chart, providing you know the house in which the Sun falls. For example, if a person's Sun is in Libra and in the seventh house, you should construct this basic sentence: \"The person's inclinations and motivations to integrate, to express, and to project will operate unitedly, harmoniously, vigorously, pensively, and enterprisingly, concentrating upon partnership relationships at a personal level.\" These key words, of course, are taken from the previous lessons for the Sun and for Libra, and from this lesson for the seventh house. This basic sentence may still seem to be artificially formal or pompous. Nevertheless, if you will study it closely, you will see that after some experience with charts you would come to interpret it as follows: \"This person will be very pleasant and cooperative, but at the same time actively watchful and clever, as he seeks to become a significant part of the environment and the society in which he finds himself. Of great importance to him in these efforts will be the formation of lasting partnerships, whether this be in a business, a profession, or a marriage. He will function best when he is not alone.\" Reasonably, the planetary aspects to the Sun would modify this interpretation with either ease or difficulty. You would, however, have to complete the foregoing procedure and then revise it accordingly to accommodate the impact of the aspects. Proceed now to make a close study of the houses, giving careful attention to the key word extensions, the planet and sign affiliations, and the concomitant relations.

Then, you should conduct yourself, using the chart below, a cumulative review of the planets, the signs, and the houses. Note that a planet may fall into any of the twelve signs as well as into any of the twelve houses. Thus, there are a possible 1440 combinations for the key words of these three factors of a chart. Large though this number of combinations may seem, you need only to grasp ten concepts for planets, twelve concepts for signs, and twelve concepts for houses. You will then be able to make 1440 combinations as any one of the combinations is needed when you are reading a chart. Practice, now, making the combinations, using this basic pattern for constructing a sentence: file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs04.html (7 of 11)11/21/2005 10:02:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 4 The inclinations and motivation (inset the key words for the planet) will operate (insert the key words for the sign), concentrating upon (insert the key words for the house).

Charts where planets and houses are inscribed in the circle of 360 degrees representing the zodiac (not the primitive twelve-equal wedges chart that is commonly used in the Anglo Saxon countries!) show the aspects as lines between planets and other important points of the chart. The computer printout is sufficient for you to know the aspects. Usually the printout also indicates the orb of an aspect, i.e., how close the distance of the two planets is to the exact aspect. The larger the orb, the weaker the influence of the aspect will be. Aspects are angular distances between planets in the zodiac, and between planets and the cusps of the first and tenth houses. Distances between planets which are considered to be major aspects are the following: 0 degrees apart, or conjunction 60 degrees apart, or sextile 90 degrees apart, or square 120 degrees apart, or trine 180 degrees apart, or opposition. In our present work we use the major aspects only. When we say that two planets are in mutual aspect, we mean that the distance between these two planets is within a specific range. The distance is measured in degrees. This is so because the planets are inscribed in the periphery of a circle that represents the ecliptic, or the path on which the planets make their way through the zodiac. To figure out the aspects is easy when you draw the planets and houses into the astrological signs. Each sign has 30 degrees, proceeding counter clockwise. Aspects are strongest when they are correct. For instance when they are conjoint in the same degree, or exactly 60, 90, 120, or 180 degrees apart. When an aspect is exact, then its impact is strongest. The further planets are away from the point of the exact aspect, the weaker is the influence of the aspect. The range within which planets are effective is called the maximum orb of the aspect. Two planets that are 54 degrees or 66 degrees apart are still considered to be in the sextile aspect which would be exact at the distance of 60 degrees. However the influence of a sextile that measures 54or 66 degrees is much less than the influence of an exact sextile of 60 degrees. As far as the orb of an aspect is concerned, opinions differ and so do computer programs. As a good rule you may consider 8 degrees maximum orb for the opposition and conjunction, 7 degrees for the square and trine, and 6 degrees for the sextile. Besides the major aspects, astrologers work with many minor aspects such as aspects of 30, 45, 135, and 150 degrees. We will not consider these aspects at the beginning of our work.

There are definitely no short cuts to success in this art. There are, however, definite procedures that you should follow so that you will always produce an accurate judgment. The first thing to do after you have erected a chart and have calculated and drawn in the aspects, or received a computer printout of a chart, is to determine in which of the sextuplets the planets fall, in which of the triplicities, and in which of the quadruplicities. See the sample chart and how the needed information is recorded. Next, you assign values to each of the planets and sum all values up for each of the sextuplets, quadruplicities, and triplicities. The next step concerns the taking of accurate and complete notes in a definite order. Naturally, the more nearly complete your notes are, the more information you will be able to glean from the chart. Further, the very act of writing out the notes serves to strengthen your understanding of the art of reading a chart. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs05.html (1 of 13)11/21/2005 10:02:25 PM"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 5 This chapter, then, consists of three sections, the first of which outlines a fifteen step procedure for making notes. The second section consists of a fifteen part reference for use in carrying out the fifteen steps of making notes, and the third section presents the actual notes made from the sample chart that was erected. Section I: Fifteen Steps for Making Notes on a Chart As you carry out the following fifteen steps for making notes on a chart, you should use for each step a 5 x 8 index card, or a sheet of paper of comparable size, so that when you are finished you will be able to make an efficient use of the notes. All references in these steps are to the parts of section II of this chapter. Further, as you make notes, place in the left margin of each note the astrological symbols, or abbreviations, to identify the note. Remember, too, that all aspects except those to the MC will appear twice throughout the notes. Step 1 From part 1, make notes on the sign that is on the ascendant of the chart. Then, from part 5, make notes on all aspects to the ascendant. Step 2 From parts 2,3,4, and 5, make notes as indicated on the planet that rules the sign on the ascendant. a. From part 2, make notes on the planet in the sign and in the house. b. From part 3, make notes on the planet in the sign. c. From part 4, make notes on the planet in the house. d. From part 5, make notes on all aspects to this planet. Step 3 Follow the directions of step 2 and make notes on the Sun, unless, of course, the Sun is the ruler of the ascendant.

Once you know these basic structures, you have done in a matter of minutes the task that takes a psychologist a few hours of elaborate testing, ... and more! You do the structuring by means of categorizing. For instance, it makes a significant difference whether most planets are above the horizon at the time of birth or whether they are below the horizon. What Groupings are Dominant? The next task is to find out what groupings of signs and houses are the dominant ones, i.e., which characteristics are dominant in the horoscope. For instance, it is useful to know the dominant quadruplicity, which gives indication whether a person has initiative, stability, or capability to adjust as a main quality. The more planets are found in a group of signs, or houses, the more the qualities of the group gains on strength and importance. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs07.html (1 of 7)11/21/2005 10:02:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 7 The task of the astrologer, therefore, is to calculate the strength of each group. This calculation is more than a mere adding up of the numbers of the planets, because there are planets in the chart that are more important than others. Also, if the results are very close, it is often better to consider other factors. In calculating the strength of groups of signs or houses, you use the following point system: Give three points each for the Sun, Moon, Ascendant, and Midheaven. These are by far the most individual parts of the horoscope. Give two points each to the faster planets Mercury, Venus and Mars. Give one point each to the slower planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. If you include the Lunar node, give it one point. Look at the sample chart for an example! Now you continue as follows: Part 6 -- North Node Construct this sentence with the North Node: The subject will receive benefits in matters concerning -- (key statement from part 4 for the house in which the North Node falls.) Part 7 -- South Node Construct this sentence about the south Node: The subject will be called upon to make sacrifices through matters concerning -- (key statement from part 4 for the house in which the South Node falls). Part 8 -- Part of Fortune Construct this sentence about the Part of fortune: Whether or not the subject is consciously aware of the fact, he (she) will be frequently focus his (her) thoughts upon matters concerning -- (key statement from part 4 for the house in which the part of fortune falls). Part 9 -- Sextuplets Hot and Cold (positive and negative signs) Look at the distribution of the planets in positive and negative signs. (a) If the numbers are approximately the same, i.e., no more difference than two points, the statement is: There is a balance between active and passive characteristics. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs07.html (2 of 7)11/21/2005 10:02:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 7 (b) If the difference lies between 3 and 5 points in favor of the positive signs, record this sentence: The person is (\"you are ...\" if you read for someone) slightly more active than self-repressive. (c) If the difference is between 3 and 5 points in favor of the negative signs, state the following: The person is slightly more self-repressive than active. (d) If there is a significant difference (more than 5 points) in favor of the positive signs, record the following: The person is more active than self-repressive. (e) If the difference is in favor of the negative signs, state the following: The person is more self-repressive than active. 2. Sextuplets Dry and Humid (fire + earth versus water + air) Electric signs, or dry signs, i.e., fire and earth signs, give tension. Magnetic signs, or humid signs, i.e., water and air, relax. Add up the points for fire and earth, then add up water and air, then compare which grouping is stronger. (a) If the difference is two points or less, record this sentence: There is a balance between tension and relaxedness. (b) If there is a difference between 3 and 5 points in favor of the dry signs (fire and earth), record this sentence: The person is slightly more tense than relaxed. (c) If there is a difference between 3 and 5 points in favor of the humid signs (air and water), record this sentence: The person is slightly more relaxed than tense. (d) If there is a considerable difference in favor of the dry signs, record this sentence: The person is generally tense. (e) If there is a considerable difference in favor of the humid signs, record this sentence: The person is generally relaxed. Part 10 -- Triplicities -- Elements The next thing you do is evaluate the elements and then record the appropriate sentence or sentences. (a) If fire and air are not more than 2 points different, record nothing. (b) If fire is three or more points stronger than air, record this sentence: The person usually expends more energy that he or she has ideas. He/she is a doer who has the tendency to act first and think later. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs07.html (3 of 7)11/21/2005 10:02:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 7 (c) If there is a significant overweight of air signs, record the following sentence: The person has more ideas than she/he will expend energy. she/he is a thinker who wants everything well thought-over before acting. (d) If earth signs and water signs show no more than two points of difference, record nothing. (e) If earth signs are three or more points stronger than water signs, record this sentence: The subject has some difficulties in bringing into reality some of her/his undertakings because she/he tends to be overly cautious. (f) If water signs are three or more points stronger than earth signs. record this sentence: The subject has some difficulties in bringing into reality some of her/his undertakings because she/he tends to take too many risks. Part 11 -- Quadruplicities Now you evaluate the distribution of the planets among the quadruplicities. (a) If there is a fairly even distribution of the planets among the cardinal, fixed, and mutable signs, record this sentence: The person is able to exhibit initiative, stability, and adaptability. (b) If the cardinal signs are excessively strong, record this sentence: The subject readily undertakes new projects, but he/she may lack the stability to finish everything and the skill to adapt to changing circumstances, or adversity. (c) If there is an excessive dominance of fixed signs, record this sentence: The person does not readily accept innovation and he/she is not easily persuaded to see more than one side of an issue. However, once he/she started something, he/she stays with it until it's finished. (d) If there is a preponderance of mutable signs, record this sentence: The person my tend to be somewhat flighty and easily influenced. (e) If cardinal and fixed signs are well represented, but there is hardly any mutable sign influence, record this sentence: The person readily initiates new projects and has the power to follow through with them, but he/she dislikes change and he/she has a lack of adjustability which could be necessary to cope with changing circumstances and adversity. (f) If cardinal and mutable signs are well represented, but there is a marked lack of fixed sign influence., record this sentence: The person readily undertakes new projects and has the power to cope with adversity, but he/she lacks the stability necessary to stay with things once they have been set in motion. (g) If fixed and mutable signs are well represented but there is a marked weakness in cardinal sign representation, record this sentence: The person can stay with things once he/she has begun them and he/ she can easily adjust to changing circumstances, but he/she lacks initiative to begin new ventures. Part 12 -- Stellium file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs07.html (4 of 7)11/21/2005 10:02:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 7 A stellium is formed when four or more planets are found in a house. If you find a stellium in any house, say: You experience an unusual amount of activity through matters concerning ... (here you insert the key words for the house in which the stellium is found). Part 13 -- Special Aspects Examine the aspects (ideally in the \"zodiacal\" charts that show degrees, with aspects drawn into the chart, and not the primitive twelve-equal-wedges chart as is still used in Anglo Saxon countries) for the special ones and construct the appropriate sentence or sentences. (a) If there is a grand trine, construct this sentence: The subject may experience too much of ease in (key statements from part 4 for the houses in which the planets fall) and may easily become incapable of dealing with adversity in these matters. (b) If there is a grand cross, construct this sentence: The subject will have opportunities to develop unusual ability and strength of character through or will accept defeat in (key statements from part 4 for the four houses in which the four planets fall). (c) If there is a T-square, construct this sentence: The subject will experience difficulties through (key statements from part 4 for the three houses in which the planets fall that form the T-square). (d) If there is an unaspected planet, construct this sentence: The subject will encounter impediments to his/ her efforts to perfect his/her life pattern as he/she seeks to (key words from part 3 for the unaspected planet). Part 14 -- Hemispheric Distribution Count the number of planets in the southern half of the chart, in the northern half, in the eastern half, and in the western half. Then record the appropriate sentence or sentences. (a) If the distribution of the planets between the north and the south of the chart is even, record nothing. (b) If the number of planets in the southern half of the chart is greater than the number of planets in the northern half, record this sentence: The subject is more objective than subjective; thus, he/she is more concerned with the practical and the visible. (c) If the number of planets in the northern half of the chart is greater than the number of planets in the southern half, record this sentence: The subject is more subjective than objective; thus, he/she is more concerned with the spiritual and the invisible. (d) If the distribution of the planets between the east and the west of the chart is even, record nothing. (e) If the number of planets in the eastern half of the chart is greater than the number of planets in the western half, record this sentence: The subject can dictate the course of his/her own career and life quite well. file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs07.html (5 of 7)11/21/2005 10:02:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 7 (f) If the number of planets in the western half of the chart is greater than the number of planets in the eastern half, record this sentence: The subject is seldom the real author of his/her own destiny; often he/ she needs someone to start him/her off. Part 15 -- Chart Patterns The twentieth century American astrologer, Marc Edmund Jones, developed a system of dividing birth charts into seven types. This system is based upon the placement and distribution of the planets within the chart. When you determine the pattern of the chart, you need to disregard the part of fortune and the nodes. Type 1: Splash The planets occupy almost all signs, and there are no adjacent vacant signs. Record this note: The subject is uninhibited, has universal interests, and a thirst for wide knowledge. He/she will either scatter the energies indiscriminately or will organize them on the widest possible scope. Type 2: Bundle The planets occupy the confines of a trine (120 degrees) or an even smaller space. Record this note: The subject does not respond to stimuli from without, has narrow interests, and develops inhibitions. Nevertheless, he/she gains the power to capitalize with surprising effectiveness upon limited resources. Type 3: Bowl The planets occupy one half of the chart (180 degrees). Record this sentence: The subject is a strongly self-contained person and has great inner resources. The occupied half of the chart reveals the activity and organization of the self, which continually seed to explore the activity symbolized by the vacant half. Type 4: Bucket All planets except one (or two together) occupy no more than one half of the chart. The one or two planets together oppose the other planets. Record this sentence: The subject will direct his/her efforts toward a single purpose; and his/her inclinations (key words for the planet of planets isolated) will be especially active. He/she has a compelling orientation to the whole of life and places a strong emphasis upon self projection. Type 5: Seesaw The planets fall into two opposing groups. The vacant zodiacal areas measure at least 90 degrees or one segment 90 degrees and the other 60 degrees, never less. Record this sentence: The subject realizes two directly opposed types of experience, thereby developing an awareness of conflict that either enables him/ her to find a happy medium or causes him/her to struggle perpetually with diametrically opposed urges. His/ her pattern of life has an up and down motion. Type 6: Locomotive file:///D|/00WWW/CoursesMain/Astrology/Astcrs07.html (6 of 7)11/21/2005 10:02:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"A Free Astrology Course in Natal Astrology, Lesson 7 The planets fall more or less evenly within two thirds of the chart, leaving an empty trine (120 degrees), Record this sentence: The subject will develop high executive abilities and a strong self-driving individuality. He/she will also have a strong sense of lack that will produce an inner compulsion to seek fulfillment. He/she will try to project the whole self into life and its experiences and will rebel at discipline. Type 7: Splay The planets are not arranged into any one of the other six patterns but are distributed somewhat irregularly around the chart, usually based upon three points of emphasis, an arrangement that may result in a grand trine. Record this sentence: The subject has the ability to entrench himself/herself into his/her own stronghold so that he/she always has something to which he/she can always turn in times of stress. He/she is likely to be a sturdy person and can be a ruthless one. Back to Lesson VI Back to Astrology Page This web site contains a free astrology course in seven lessons.
