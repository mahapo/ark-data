SOME years ago it was my privilege to enjoy the ac quaintance of Miss Frances Rolleston, of Keswick, and to carry on a correspondence with her with respect to her work, Mazzaroth : or, the Constellations. She was the first to create an interest in this important subject. Since then Dr. Seiss, of Philadelphia, has endeavoured to popularize her work on the other side of the At lantic ; and brief references have been made to the subject in such books as Moses and Geology, by Dr. Kinns, and in Primeval Man; but it was felt, for many reasons, that it was desirable to make another effort to set forth, in a more complete form, the witness of the stars to prophetic truth, so necessary in these last days. To the late Miss Rolleston, however, belongs the honour of collecting a mass of information bearing on this subject ; but, published as it was, chiefly in the form of notes, unarranged and unindexed, it was suited only for, but was most valuable to, the student. She it was who performed the drudgery of collecting the facts presented by Albumazer, the Arab astronomer to the Caliphs of Grenada, 850 A.D. ; and the Tables drawn up by Ulugh Beigh, the Tartar prince and a 2"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"IV PREFACE. astronomer, about 1450 A.D., who gives the Arabian Astronomy as it had come down from the earliest times. Modern astronomers have preserved, and still have in common use, the ancient names of over a hundred of the principal stars which have been handed down ; but now these names are used merely as a convenience, and without any reference to their significance. This work is an attempt to popularize this ancient information, and to use it in the interests of truth. For the ancient astronomical facts and the names, with their signification, I am, from the very nature of the case, indebted, of course, to all who have preserved, collected, and handed them down ; but for their inter pretation I am alone responsible. It is for the readers to judge how far my conclu sions are borne out by the evidence ; and how far the foundation of our hopes of coming glory are strengthened by the prophecies which have been written in the stars of heaven, as well as in the Scriptures of truth.

V drawings my thanks are due to my friend Miss Amy Manson. It is the possession of &quot; that blessed hope &quot; of Christ s speedy return from Heaven which will give true interest in the great subject of this book. No one can dispute the antiquity of the Signs of the Zodiac, or of the Constellations. No one can question the accuracy of the ancient star-names which have come down to us, for they are still preserved in every good celestial atlas. And we hope that no one will be able to resist the cumulative evidence that, apart from God s grace in Christ there is no hope for sinners now : and apart from God s glory, as it will be manifested in the return of Christ from Heaven, there is no hope for the Church, no hope for Israel, no hope for the world, no hope for a groaning creation. In spite of all the vaunted promises of a religious World, and of a worldly Church, to remove the effects of the curse by a Social Gospel of Sanitation, we are more and more shut up to the prophecy of Gen. iii. 15, which we wait and long to see fulfilled in Christ as our only hope. This is beautifully expressed by the late Dr. William Leask : And is there none before ? No perfect peace Unbroken by the storms and cares of life, Until the time of waiting- for Him cease, By His appearing to destroy the strife ? No, none before."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"VI PREFACE. Do we not hear that through the flag- of grace By faithful messengers of God unfurled, All men will be converted, and the place Of man s rebellion be a holy world ? Yes, so we hear. Is it not true that to the Church is given The holy honour of dispelling night, And bringing back the human race to heaven, By kindling everywhere the Gospel light ? It is not true. Is this the hope that Christ the Lord will come, In all the glory of His royal right, Redeemer and Avenger, taking home His saints, and crushing the usurper s might ? This is the hope. May the God of all grace accept and bless this effort to show forth His glory, and use it to strengthen His people in waiting for His Son from Heaven, even Jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come.

The question is, Did God leave Himself without a wit ness ? The question is answered very positively by the written Word that He did not. In Rom. i. 19 it is declared that, &quot; that which may be known of God is manifest in them ; for God hath showed it unto them. For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse.&quot; But how was God known? How were His &quot;invisible things,&quot; i.e., His plans, His purposes, and His counsels, known since the creation of the world ? We are told by the Holy Spirit in Rom. x. 18.

This is settled by the fact that the passage is quoted from Ps. xix., the first part of which is occupied with the Revelation of God written in the Heavens, and the latter part with the Revelation of God written in the Word: This is the simple explanation of this beautiful Psalm. This is why its two subjects are brought together. It has often perplexed many why there should be that abrupt departure in verse 7 &quot; The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul.&quot; The fact is, there is nothing abrupt in it, and it is no departure. It is simply the transition to the second of the two great Revelations which are thus placed in juxtaposition. The first is the Revelation of the Creator, El, 7tf, in His works, while the second is the Revelation of the Covenant Jehovah, PIJT, in His Word. And it is note worthy that while in the first half of the Psalm, El is named only once, in the latter half Jehovah is named seven times, the last being threefold (Jehovah, Rock, and Redeemer), concluding the Psalm. Let us then turn to Ps. xix., and note first The Structure * of the Psalm as a whole. A | 1-4-. The Heavens. B | -4-6. &quot; In them &quot; (DflJ) the Sun. A | 7-10. The Scriptures.

Thus the two parts are significantly connected and united. Ewald and others imagine that this Psalm is made up of two fragments of separate Psalms composed at different periods and brought together by a later editor ! But this is disproved not only by what has been said concerning the structure of the Psalm as a whole, and the interlacing of the astronomical and the literary terms in the two parts, but it is also shown by more minute details. Each half consists of two portions which correspond the one to the other, A answering to A, and B to B.

Surely there is something more referred to here than a mere wonder excited by the works of the Creator ! When we read the whole passage and mark its struc ture, and note the words employed, we are emphatically told that the heavens contain a revelation from God ; they prophesy, they show knowledge, they tell of God s glory, and set forth His purposes and counsels. It is a remarkable fact that it is in the Book of Job, which is generally allowed to be the oldest book in the f From 153, to be heavy, weight, the context determining whether the weight spoken of is advantageous or not. The first occurrence is Gen. xii. 10, &quot; The famine was grievous (153) in the land.&quot; The next, xiii. 2, &quot; Abram was very rich (133)-&quot; It is often applied to persons who are of weight and importance, hence, glorious and honourable. It is used of the glory of the Lord, and of God Himself, as we use Majesty of a person. See Isa. iii. 8 ; iv. 2 ; xi. 10 ; xliii. 20 ; Hag. ii. 8 ; Ex. xvi. 7 ; xxiv. 1751 Sam. iv. 21 ; Pss. xxvi. 8 (honour) ; Ixiii. 3. J From TJ3, to set before, to set forth, to shew.

By the figure of metonymy the line which measures is put for the portion or heritage which is measured, as in many other places. See Ps. xvi. 6, &quot;The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places ; yea, I have a goodly heritage.&quot; (See also Ps. Ixxviii. 55, &c.) Here, it means that &quot;Their measuring line has gone forth unto all the earth (|HK) &quot; j i.e., All the earth inherits this their testimony (i.e., has this testimony for its heritage), and to the ends of the world (bjfl, the inhabited world} their instruction has gone forth. With this agrees, in sense, the LXX. here, and Rom. x. 1 6, which each has &amp;lt;t&amp;gt;86yyos, a sound, or voice ; i.e., a sound in relation to the hearer, rather than to that which causes it. The meaning of the passage is, &quot;All the earth has their sound or testi mony as its heritage, and the ends of the world hear their words. &quot; Symmachus has J5x*&amp;gt; a sound, or report. ** non means that which is hot* and is a poetical name of the sun itself."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. 7 Bible,* if not in the world, that we have references to this Stellar Revelation. This would be at least 2,000 years before Christ. In that book the signs of the Zodiac and the names of several stars and constella tions are mentioned, as being ancient and well-known. In Isa. xl. 26 (R.V.) we read : &quot; Lift up your eyes on high, And see who hath created these, That bringeth out their host by number : He calleth them all by name; By the greatness of His might, And for that He is strong in power, Not one is lacking.&quot; We have the same evidence in Psalm cxlvii. 4. (R.V.) &quot; He telleth the number of the stars ; He giveth them all their names.&quot; Here is a distinct and Divine declaration that the great Creator both numbered as well as named the stars of Heaven. The question is, Has he revealed any of these names ? Have any of them been handed down to us ? The answer is Yes ; and that in the Bible itself we have the names (so ancient that their meaning is a little obscure) of Ash (Bty, a name still connected with the Great Bear), Cesil (S DJ), and Cimah (H^3). They occur in Job ix. 9 : &quot; Which maketh Arcturus (R.V. the Bear), Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.&quot; (Marg., Heb., Ash, Cesil, and Cimah.) Job xxxviii. 31, 32: &quot; Canst thou bind the sweet influences (R.V. cluster) of the Pleiades (marg., the * Job is thought by some to be the Jobab mentioned in Gen. x. 29, the third in descent from Eber."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"8 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. seven stars, Heb.

The former in both versions is referred to the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac, while the latter is rendered &quot; planets,&quot; and in margin, the twelve signs or constellations. Others are referred to by name. The sign of &quot; Gemini,&quot; or the Twins, is given as the name of a ship : Acts xxviii. n, bumcwpu (i.e. Castor & Pollux). Most commentators agree that the constellation of &quot; Draco,&quot; or the Dragon (between the Great and Little Bear), is referred to in Job xxvi. 13 : &quot; By His Spirit He hath garnished the heavens ; His hand hath formed the crooked serpent (R.V. swift. Marg. fleeing or gliding. See Is. xxvii. i ; xliii. 14).&quot; This word &quot; garnished &quot; is peculiar. The R.V. puts in the margin, beauty. In Ps. xvi. 6, it is rendered goodly. &quot; I have a goodly heritage.&quot; In Dan. iv. 2, it is rendered, &quot; I thought * Note the structure of this verse : A | The seven stars, B | Orion, A | The twelve signs, B \\ Arcturus."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE WITNESS OF THE STARS.

It ap pears from this that God &quot; thought it good to show &quot; by these signs written in the heavens the wonders of His purposes and counsels, and it was by His Spirit that He made it known ; it was His hand that coiled (/ in) the crooked serpent among the stars of heaven. Thus we see that the Scriptures are not silent as to the great antiquity of the signs and constellations. If we turn to history and tradition, we are at once met with the fact that the Twelve Signs are the same, both as to the meaning of their names and as to their order in all the ancient nations of the world. The Chinese, Chaldean, and Egyptian records go back to more than 2,000 years B.C. Indeed, the Zodiacs in the Temples of Denderah and Esneh, in Egypt, are doubtless copies of Zodiacs still more ancient, which, from internal evidence, must be placed nearly 4,000 B.C., when the summer solstice was in Leo. Josephus hands down to us what he gives as the traditions of his own nation, corroborated by his re ference to eight ancient Gentile authorities, whose works are lost. He says that they all assert that &quot; God gave the antediluvians such long life that they might perfect those things which they had invented in astronomy.&quot; Cassini commences his History of Astro nomy by saying &quot;It is impossible to doubt that astro nomy was invented from the beginning of the world ; history, profane as well as sacred, testifies to this truth.&quot; Nouet, a French astronomer, infers that the Egyptian Astronomy must have arisen 5,400 B.C. !"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"10 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. Ancient Persian and Arabian traditions ascribe its invention to Adam, Seth, and Enoch. Josephus asserts that it originated in the family of Seth ; and he says that the children of Seth, and especially Adam, Seth, and Enoch, that their revelation might not be lost as to the two coming judgments of Water and Fire, made two pillars (one of brick, the other of stone) , describing the whole of the predictions of the stars upon them, and in case the brick pillar should be destroyed by the flood, the stone would preserve the revelation (Book i. chs. 13). This is what is doubtless meant by Gen. xi. 4,&quot; And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven.&quot; The words, &quot; may reach&quot; are in italics. There is nothing in the verse which relates to the height of this tower. It merely says D?to$l iBW 1 ), and his top with the heavens, i.e. with the pictures and the stars, just as we find them in the ancient temples of Denderah and Esneh in Egypt. This tower, with its planisphere and pictures of the signs and constellations, was to be erected like those temples were afterwards, in order to preserve the reve lation, &quot; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.&quot; This is corroborated by Lieut. -Gen. Chesney, well known for his learned researches and excavations among the ruins of Babylon, who, after describing his various discoveries, says,* &quot; About five miles S.W. of Hillah, the most remarkable of all the ruins, the Sirs Nimrond of * General Chesney allowed the late Dean Goode to copy the passage, among other matters, from his private MS. The Dean quotes it in his Warburtonian Lectures (2nd Ed., Note I. to Sermon IV., p. 170-1)."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. II the Arabs, rises to a height of 153 feet above the plain from a base covering a square of 400 feet, or almost four acres. It was constructed of kiln-dried bricks in seven stages to correspond with the planets to which they were dedicated : the lowermost black, the colour of Saturn ; the next orange, for Jupiter ; the third red, for Mars ; and so on.* These stages were surmounted by a lofty tower, on the summit of which, we are told, were the signs of the Zodiac and other astronomical figures ; thus having (as it should have been translated) a representation of the heavens, instead of a top which reached unto heaven. &quot; This Biblical evidence carries us at once right back to the Flood, or about 2,500 years B.C. This tower or temple, or both, was also called &quot; The Seven Spheres&quot; according to some ; and &quot; The Seven Lights,&quot; according to others. It is thus clear that the popular idea of its height and purpose must be abandoned, and its astronomical reference to revelation must be admitted. The tower was an attempt to preserve and hand down the antediluvian traditions ; their sin was in keeping together instead of scattering themselves over the earth. Another important statement is made by Dr. Budge, of the British Museum. f He says, &quot; It must never be forgotten that the Babylonians were a nation of star- gazers, and that they kept a body of men to do nothing else but report eclipses, appearances of the moon, sun- spots, etc., etc.&quot; * Fragments of these coloured glazed bricks are to be seen in the British Museum, f Babylonian Life and History, p. 36."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"12 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. 11 Astronomy, mixed with astrology, occupied a large number of tablets in the Babylonian libraries, and Isaiah, xlvii. 13, refers to this when he says to Babylon, Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now thy astrologers (marg. viewers of the heavens), the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators stand up. The largest astrological work of the Babylonians con tained seventy tablets, and was compiled by the com mand of Sargon of Agade thirty-eight hundred years before Christ ! It was called the Illumination of Bel. &quot; &quot; Their observations were made in towers called &quot; ziggurats&quot; (p. 106). &quot; They built observatories in all the great cities, and reports like the above [which Dr. Budge gives in full] were regularly sent to the King&quot; (p. no). &quot; They were able to calculate eclipses, and had long lists of them.&quot; &quot; They found out that the sun was spotted, and they knew of comets.&quot; &quot; They were the inventors of the Zodiac&quot; (?). There are fragments of two (ancient Babylonian) planispheres in the British Museum with figures and calculations inscribed upon them. &quot; The months were called after the signs of the Zodiac &quot; (p. 109). We may form some idea of what this &quot;represen tation of the heavens &quot; was from the fifth &quot; Creation Tablet,&quot; now in the British Museum. It reads as follows : &quot; Anu [the Creator] made excellent the mansions [i.e. the celestial houses] of the great gods [twelve] in number [i.e. the twelve signs or mansions of the sun]. The stars he placed in them. The lumasi [i.e. groups of stars or figures] he fixed."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. 13 He arranged the year according- to the bounds [i.e. the twelve signs] which he defined. For each of the twelve months three rows of stars [i.e. constellations^ he fixed. From the day when the year issues forth unto the close, he marked the mansions [i.e. the Zodiacal Signs\\ of the wandering- stars \\\\.e.planets~\\ to know their courses that they might not err or deflect at all.&quot; Coming down to less ancient records : EUDOXOS, an astronomer of Cnidus (403 to 350 B.C.), wrote a work on Astronomy which he called Phainomena. ANTIGONUS GONATAS, King of Macedonia (273-239 B.C.), requested the Poet ARATUS to put the work of EUDOXUS into the form of a poem, which he did about the year 270 B.C. ARATUS called his work Diosemeia (the Divine Signs). He was a native of Tarsus, and it is interesting for us to note that his poem was known to, and, indeed, must have been read by, the Apostle Paul, for he quotes it in his address at Athens on Mars Hill. He says (Acts xvii. 28), &quot; For in Him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.&quot;* Several translations of this poem have been made, both by CICERO and others, into Latin, and in recent times into English by E. Poste, J. Lamb, and others. The following is the opening from the translation of Robert Brown, jun. : &quot; From Zeus we lead the strain ; he whom mankind Ne er leave unhymned: of Zeus all public ways, All haunts of men, are full ; and full the sea, And harbours ; and of Zeus all stand in need. We are his offspring : and he, ever good and mild to man, * TOU -yap Kai ytvos tcrpfv."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"14 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. Gives favouring- signs, and rouses us to toil.

Moreover, ARATUS describes them, not as they were seen in his day, but as they were seen some 4,000 years before. The stars were not seen from Tarsus as he describes them, and he must therefore have written from a then ancient Zodiac. For notwith standing that we speak of &quot; fixed stars,&quot; there is a con stant, though slow, change taking place amongst them. There is also another change taking place owing to the slow recession of the pole of the heavens (about 50&quot; in the year) ; so that while Alpha in the con stellation of Draco was the Polar Star when the Zodiac was first formed, the Polar Star is now Alpha in what is called Ursa Minor. This change alone carries us back at least 5,000 years. The same movement which has changed the relative position of these two stars has also caused the constellation of the Southern Cross .to become invisible in northern latitudes. When the constellations were formed the Southern Cross was visible in N. latitude 40, and was included in their number. But, though known by tradition, it had not been seen in that latitude for some twenty centuries,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. 15 until the Cape of Good Hope had been discovered. Then was seen again The Southern Cross depicted by the Patriarchs. Here is another indisputable proof as to the antiquity of the formation of the Zodiac. PTOLEMY (150 A. D.) transmits them from HIPPARCHUS (130 B.C.) &quot; as of unquestioned authority, unknown origin, and unsearchable antiquity.&quot; Sir William Drummond says that &quot; the traditions of the Chaldean Astronomy seem the fragments of a mighty system fallen into ruins.&quot; The word Zodiac itself is from the Greek zS&amp;lt;a/co&amp;lt;, which is not from z, to live, but from a primitive root through the Hebrew Sodi, which in Sanscrit means a way. Its etymology has no connection with living creatures, but denotes a way, or step, and is used of the way or path in which the sun appears to move amongst the stars in the course of the year. To an observer on the earth the whole firmament, together with the sun, appears to revolve in a circle once in twenty-four hours. But the time occupied by the stars in going round, differs from the time occupied by the sun. This difference amounts to about one-twelfth part of the whole circle in each month, so that when the circle of the heavens is divided up into twelve parts, the sun appears to move each month through one of them. This path which the sun thus makes amongst the stars is called the Ecliptic* * Besides this monthly difference, there is an annual difference ; for at the end of twelve mouths the sun does not come back to exactly the same point in the sign which commenced the year, but is a little behind it. But this difference, though it"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"l6 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. Each of these twelve parts (consisting each of about 30 degrees) is distinguished, not by num bers or by letters, but by pictures and names, and this, as we have seen, from the very earliest times. They are preserved to the present day in our almanacs, and we are taught their order in the familiar rhymes : &quot; The RAM, the BULL, the heavenly TWINS, And next the CRAB, the LION shines, The VIRGIN and the SCALES ; The SCORPION, ARCHER, and SEA-GOAT, The MAN that carries the Water-pot, And FISH with glittering- scales.&quot; These signs have always and everywhere been pre served in this order, and have begun with ARIES. They have been known amongst all nations, and in all ages, thus proving their common origin from one source. occurs every year, is so small that it will take 25,579 years for the sun to complete this vast cycle, which is called The precession of the Equinoxes ; i.e., about one degree in every 71 years. If the sun came back to the precise point at which it began the year, each sign would correspond, always and regularly, exactly with a particular month; but, owing to this constant regression, the sun (while it goes through the whole twelve signs every year) commences the year in one sign for only about 2, 131 years. In point of fact, since the Creation the commencement of the year has changed to the extent of nearly three of the signs. When Virgil sings &quot; The White Bull with golden horns opens the year,&quot; he does not record what took place in his own day. This, is another proof of the antiquity of these signs. The Ecliptic, or path of the sun, if it could be viewed from immediately beneath the Polar Star, would form a complete and perfect circle, would be concentric with the Equator, and all the stars and the sun would appear to move in this circle, never rising or setting. To a person north or south of the Equator the stars therefore rise and set obliquely ; while to a person on the Equator they rise and set perpendicularly, each star being twelve hours above and twelve below the horizon. The points where the two circles (the Ecliptic and the Equator) intersect each other are called the Equinoctial points. It is the movement of these points (which are now moving from Aries to Pisces) which gives rise to the term, &quot; the precession of the Equinoxes."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. IJ The figures themselves are perfectly arbitrary. There is nothing in the groups of stars to even sug gest the figures. This is the first thing which is noticed by every one who looks at the constellations. Take for example the sign of VIRGO, and look at the stars. There is nothing whatever to suggest a human form ; still less is there anything to show whether that form is a man or a woman. And so with all the others. The picture, therefore, is the original, and must have been drawn around or connected with certain stars, simply in order that it might be identified and asso ciated with them ; and that it might thus be remem bered and handed down to posterity. There can be no doubt, as the learned Authoress of Mazzaroth conclusively proves, that these signs were afterwards identified with the twelve sons of Jacob. Joseph sees the sun and moon and eleven stars bowing down to him, he himself being the twelfth (Gen. xxxvii. 9). The blessing of Jacob (Gen. xlix.) and the blessing of Moses (Deut. xxxiii.) both bear wit ness to the existence of these signs in their day. And it is more than probable that each of the Twelve Tribes bore one of them on its standard. We read in Num. ii. 2, &quot; Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own STANDARD, with the ENSIGN of their father s house &quot; (R.V. &quot;with the ensigns of their fathers houses&quot;). This &quot;Standard&quot; was the Degel (^.7) on which the &quot; Sign &quot; (Hltf, Oth) was depicted. Hence it was called the &quot; En-sign&quot; Ancient Jewish authorities declare that each tribe had one of the signs as its own, S. 1005.

If the Lion were appropriated to Judah, then the other three would be thus fixed, and would be the same four that equally divide the Zodiac at its four cardinal points. According to Num. ii. the camp was thus formed : EAST. ISSACHAR JUDAH (Cancer). The Lion (Leo). ZEBULON (Virgo). LEVI The Scales (Libra).

IQ connection will be clearly seen. Levi, for example, had no standard, and he needed none, for he kept &quot; the balance of the Sanctuary,&quot; and had the charge of that brazen altar on which the atoning blood out weighed the nation s sins. The four great signs which thus marked the four sides of the camp, and the four quarters of the Zodiac, are the same four which form the Cherubim (the Eagle, the Scorpion s enemy, being substituted for the Scorpion). The Cherubim thus form a compendious expression of the hope of Creation, which, from the very first, has been bound up with the Coming One, who alone should cause its groanings to cease. But this brings us to the Signs themselves and their interpretation. These pictures were designed to preserve, ex pound, and perpetuate the one first great promise and prophecy of Gen. iii. 15, that all hope for Man, all hope for Creation, was bound up in a coming Redeemer ; One who should be born of a woman ; who should first suffer, and afterwards gloriously triumph ; One who should first be wounded by that great enemy who was the cause of all sin and sorrow and death, but who should finally crush the head of &quot; that Old Serpent the Devil.&quot; These ancient star-pictures reveal this Coming One. They set forth &quot;the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow.&quot; Altogether there are forty-eight of them, made up of twelve SIGNS, each sign containing three CONSTELLATIONS. These may be divided into three great books, each B 2"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"20 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. book containing four chapters (or Signs) ; and each chapter containing three sections (or Constellations). Each book (like the four Gospels) sets forth its peculiar aspect of the Coming One ; beginning with the promise of His coming, and ending with the destruction of the enemy. But where are we to begin to read this wondrous Heavenly Scroll ? A circle has proverbially neither beginning nor end. In what order then are we to con sider these signs ? In the heavens they form a never- ending circle. Where is the beginning and where is the end of this circle through which the sun is constantly moving ? Where are we to break into this circle ? and say, This is the commencement. It is clear that unless we can determine this original starting point we can never read this wondrous book aright. As I have said, the popular beginning to-day is with ARIES, the Ram. But comparing this Revelation with that which was afterwards written &quot; in the Volume of the Book,&quot; VIRGO is the only point where we can in telligently begin, and LEO is the only point where we can logically conclude. Is not this what is spoken of as the unknown and insoluble mystery &quot;The riddle of the SPHINX &quot; ? The word &quot; Sphinx &quot; is from opfyyw, to bind closely together. It was therefore designed to show where the two ends of the Zodiac were to be joined together, and where the great circle of the heavens begins and ends. The SPHINX is a figure with the head of a woman ad the body of a lion ! What is this but a never- ceasing monitor, telling us to begin with Virgo and"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. 2,1"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"22 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. to end with Leo ! In the Zodiac in the Temple of Esneh, in Egypt, a Sphinx is actually placed between the Signs of Virgo and Leo, as shown in the illustration on the preceding page. It is a tracing from the draw ing of Signer Bossi, executed on the spot, under the direction of the late Mr. Edward J. Cooper, in 1820. Beginning, then, with VIRGO, let us now spread out the contents of this Heavenly Volume, so that the eye can take them in at a glance. Of course we are greatly hindered in this, in having to use the modern Latin names which the Constellations bear to-day.* Some of these names are mistakes, others are gross per versions of the truth, as proved by the pictures them selves, which are far more ancient, and have come down to us from primitive times. After the Revelation came to be written down in the Scriptures, there was not the same need for the preservation of the Heavenly Volume. And after the nations had lost the original meaning of the pictures, they invented a meaning out of the vain imagination of the thoughts of their hearts. The Greek My thology is an interpretation of (only some of) the signs and constellations after their true meaning had been forgotten. It is popularly believed that Bible truth is an evolution from, or development of, the ancient religions of the world. But the fact is that they themselves are a corruption and perversion of primitive truth ! * It is exactly the same with the books of the Bible. Their order and their names, as we have them in the English Bible, are those which man has given them, copied from the Septuagiut and Vulgate, and in many cases are not the Divine names according to the Hebrew Canon."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. 23 We will now give the contents of this Heavenly Volume of Divine Revelation, and afterwards proceed to develope it, explain it in detail, and compare it with the same truth which was afterwards written down in the Scriptures. first :fi$oofc.

Though for more than 2,500 years His people had not this Revelation written in a book as we now have it in the Bible, they were not left in ignorance and darkness as to God s purposes and counsels ; nor were they without hope as to ultimate deliverance from all evil and from the Evil One. Adam, who first heard that wondrous promise, repeated it, and gave it to his posterity as a most precious heritage the ground of all their faith, the substance of all their hope, the object of all their desire. Seth and Enoch took it up. Enoch, we know, pro phesied of the Lord s coming, saying, &quot; Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints to execute judgment upon all&quot; (Jude 14).

This Revelation, coinciding as it does in all its facts and truths with that afterwards recorded &quot; in the Volume of the Book,&quot; must have had the same Divine origin, must have been made known by the inspiration of the same Holy Spirit.

HERE is the commencement of all prophecy in Gen. iii. 15, spoken to the serpent : &quot; I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed : it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise His heel.&quot; This is the prophetic announcement which the Revelation in the heavens and in the Book is designed to unfold and develope. It lies at the root of all the ancient traditions and mythologies, which are simply the perversion and corruption of primitive truth.

The name of this sign in the Hebrew is Bethulah, which means a virgin, and in the Arabic a branch. The two words are connected, as in Latin Virgo, which means a virgin; and virga, which means a Branch (Vulg. Isa. xi. i). Another name is Sunbnl, Arabic, an car of corn. In Gen. iii. 15 she is presented only as a woman; but in later prophecies her nationality is defined as being of the stock of Israel, the seed of Abraham, the line of David; and, further, she is to be a virgin. There are two prominent prophecies of her and her seed : one is connected with the first coming in in carnation, Isa. vii. 14 (quoted in Matt. i. 23). &quot; Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, And shall call his name Immanuel.&quot; The other is connected with His second coming, leaping over the sufferings and this present interval of His rejection, and looking forward to His coming in glory and judgment, Isa. ix. 6, 7 (quoted in Luke ii. u and i. 32, 33) &quot;For unto us a child is born, Unto us a son is given ; * And the government shall be upon His shoulder; And His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mig-hty God, The Everlasting- Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government there shall be no end. * Here, the fact of His humiliation, together with this long period of His rejection, is leaped over, and the prophecy passes on at once over at least a period of 1893 years to this &quot;glory which should follow.&quot;"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"VIRGO. 31 Upon the throne of David, and upon His kingdom, To order it, and to establish it With judgment and with justice From henceforth even for ever.

This star is in the ear of corn which she holds in her left hand. Hence the star has a modern Latin name, which has almost superseded the ancient one, Spica, which means, an ear of corn. But this hides the great truth revealed by its name A I Zimach. It foretold the coming of Him who should bear this name. The same Divine inspiration has, in the written Word, four times connected it with Him. There are twenty Hebrew words translated &quot; Branch,&quot; but only one of them (Tsemech) is used exclusively of the Messiah, and this word only four times.* Each of these further connects Him with one special account of Him, given in the Gospels.

This is the Branch foretold by the star A I Zimach in the ear of corn. The star 3 is called Zavijaveh t which means the gloriously beautiful, as in Isa. iv. 2. The star e, in the arm bearing the branch, is called Al Mureddin, which means who shall come down (as in Ps. Ixxii. 8), or who shall have dominion. It is also known as Vin- demiatrix, a Chaldee word which means the son, or branch, who cometh. Other names of stars in the sign, not identified, are Subilah, who carries. (Isa. xlvi. 4.) Al Azal, the Branch. (As in Isa. xviii. 5.) Subilon, a spike of corn. (As in Isa. xvii. 5.) The Greeks, ignorant of the Divine origin and teaching of the sign, represented Virgo as Ceres, with ears of corn in her hand. In the Zodiac in the Temple of Denderah, in Egypt, about 2000 B.C. (now in Paris), she is likewise repre sented with a branch in her hand, but ignorantly ex plained by a false religion to represent Isis !

Passing to the three constellations anciently as signed to the sign Virgo, we come to what may be compared to three sections of the chapter, each giving some further detail as to the interpretation of its teaching. i. COMA (The Woman and Child). The Desired of all Nations. The first constellation in Virgo explains that this coming &quot; Branch &quot; will be a child, and that He should be the &quot; Desire of all nations.&quot; The ancient name of this constellation is Comah* the desired, or the longed for. We have the word used by the Holy Spirit in this very connection, in Hag. ii. 7 : &quot; The DESIRE of all nations shall come.&quot; The ancient Zodiacs pictured this constellation as a woman with a child in her arms. ALBUMAZARJ (or ABU MASHER), an Arabian astronomer of the eighth century, says, &quot; There arises in the first Decan,J as the Persians, Chaldeans, and Egyptians, and the two HERMES and ASCALIUS teach, a young woman, whose Persian name denotes a pure virgin, sitting on a throne, nourishing an infant boy (the boy, I say), having a Hebrew name, by some nations called * From nn3, which occurs only in Ps. Ixiii. I, &quot;my flesh longeth for thee.&quot; It is akin to 1n to desire. Ps. xix. 10 ; Is. liii. 2 ; Hag. ii. 7 ; etc. f A Latin translation of his work is in the British Museum Library. He says the Persians understood these signs, but that the Indians perverted them with inventions. J The constellations are called Decans.

There we find to-day a woman s wig ! It appears that BERENICE, the wife of EUERGETES (PTOLEMY III.), king of Egypt in the third century B.C., when her husband once went on a dangerous expedi tion, vowed to consecrate her fine head of hair to Venus if he returned in safety. Her hair, which was hung up in the Temple of Venus, was subsequently stolen, and to comfort BERENICE, CONON, an astronomer of Alex andria (B.C. 283-222), gave it out that Jupiter had taken it and made it a constellation ! This is a good example of how the meaning of other constellations have been perverted (ignorantly or intentionally). In this case, as in others, the transition from ancient to more modern languages helped to hide the meaning. The Hebrew name was COMA (desired). But the Greeks had a word for hair, C6-me. This again is transferred to the Latin coma, and thus &quot; Coma Berenices &quot; (the hair of Berenice) comes down to us to-day as the name of this constellation, and gives us a woman s wig instead of that Blessed One, &quot;the Desire of all Nations.&quot; In this case, however, we are able to give absolute proof that this is a perversion. The ancient Egyptian name for this constellation was Shes-mi, the desired son !

The Lord said by Balaam (Num. xxiv. 17), &quot; There shall come * a star out of Jacob, And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel.&quot; Thomas Hyde, an eminent Orientalist (16361703), writing on the ancient religion of the Persians, quotes from ABULFARAGIUS (an Arab Christian Historian, 1226- 1286), who says that ZOROASTER, or ZERDUSHT, the Persian, was a pupil of Daniel the Prophet, and that he predicted to the Magians (who were the astronomers of Persia), that when they should see a new star appear it would notify the birth of a mysterious child, whom they were to adore. It is further stated in the Zend A vesta that this new star was to appear in the sign of the Virgin. Some have supposed that this passage is not genuine.

It was this that caused HIPPARCHUS to draw up his catalogue of stars, which has been handed down to us by PTOLEMY (150 A.D.). This new star would show the latitude, passing at that time immediately overhead at midnight, every twenty-four hours ; while the prophecy would give the longitude as the land of Jacob. Having these two factors, it would be only a matter of observation, and easy for the Magi to find the place where it would be vertical, and thus to locate the very spot of the birth of Him of whom it was the sign, for they emphatically called it &quot; His Star.&quot; There is a beautiful tradition which relates how, in their difficulty, on their way from Jerusalem to find the actual spot under the Zenith of this star, these Magi sat down beside David s &quot; Well of Bethlehem &quot; to refresh themselves. There they saw the star reflected in the clear water of the well. Hence it is written that &quot; when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding joy,&quot; for they knew they were at the very spot and place of His appearing whence He was to &quot;come forth.&quot; There can be little doubt that it was a new star.

Sir John Herschell observed this star to be growing rapidly brighter. It may be, therefore, one of the changeable stars, and its name may be taken as an indication of the fact that it was known to the ancients.

He was supposed to be immortal, but he volun tarily agreed to die; and, wounded by a poisoned arrow (not intended for him) while in conflict with a wild boar, he transferred his immortality to Pro metheus ; whereupon he was placed amongst the stars. We can easily see how this fable is the ignorant perversion of the primitive Revelation. The true tradition can be seen dimly through it, and we can discern Him of whom it spoke, the all-wise, all- powerful Teacher and Prophet, who &quot;went about doing good,&quot; yet &quot; despised and rejected of men,&quot; laying down His life that others might live.

We see his effort repeated when he used Athaliah to destroy &quot; all the seed royal&quot; (2 Kings xi.), and how &quot; the king s son &quot; was rescued &quot; from among &quot; the slain. We see his hand again instigating Haman, &quot;the Jews enemy,&quot; to compass the destruction of the whole nation, but defeated in his designs. When the woman s Seed, the virgin s Son, was born, we are shown the same great enemy inciting Herod to slay all the babes in Bethlehem (Matt, ii.), but again he is defeated. * Antares seems also to have been known as Lesath."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"56 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. In the wilderness of Judaea, and in the Garden of Gethsemane the great conflict is renewed. &quot; This is your hour and the power of darkness,&quot;* He said to His enemies. The real wounding in the heel was received at the Cross. It was there the scorpion struck the woman s seed. He died, but was raised again from the dead &quot; to destroy the works of the devil.&quot; To show us this ; to prevent any mistake ; to set forth the fact that this conflict only apparently ended in defeat, and that it did not really so end, we have the first two constellations belonging to this sign presented in one picture ! Indeed, the picture is threefold, for it includes the sign itself (as shown on the cover) ! If these pictures had been separated, then the conflict would have been separated from the victory ; the deadly wound of the serpent s head from the temporary wound in the Victor s heel. Hence, three pictures are required, in which the scorpion, the serpent, and the man, are all involved, in order to present at the same time the triumphant issue of the conflict. Hence, we must present, and consider together, the first two sections of this mysterious chapter. i AND 2. SERPENS AND OPHIUCHUS. The Struggle with the Enemy. Here, Serpens, the serpent, is seen struggling vainly in the powerful grasp of the man who is named 0-phi-u-chus. In Latin he is called Serpentarius. * Luke xxii. 53 : comp. Col. i. 13 and Eph. vi. 12."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"SCORPIO: (SERPENS AND QPHiucHus). 57 He is at one and the same moment shown to be seizing the serpent with his two hands, and treading on the very heart of the scorpion, marked by the deep red star Antares (wounding). Just as we read the first constellation of the woman and child Coma, as expounding the first sign VIRGO, so we have to read this first constellation as expounding the second sign LIBRA. Hence, we have here a further picture, showing the object of this conflict on the part of the scorpion. In Scorpio we see merely the effort to wound Ophiuchus in the heel ; but here we see the effort of the serpent to seize THE CROWN, which is situated immediately over the serpent s head, and to which he is looking up and reaching forth. The contest is for Dominion ! It was the Devil, in the form of a serpent, that robbed the first man of his crown ; but in vain he struggled to wrest it from the sure possession of the Second Man. Not only does he fail in the attempt, but is himself utterly defeated and trodden under foot. There are no less than 134 stars in these two constellations. Two are of the 2nd magnitude, four teen of the 3rd, thirteen of the 4th, etc. The brightest star in the Serpent, a (in the neck), is named Unuk, which means encompassing. Another Hebrew name is Alyah, the accursed. From this is Al Hay (Arabic), the reptile. The next brightest star is (in the jaw), named, in Arabic, Cheleb, or Chelbalrai, the serpent enfolding. The Greek name,"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"58 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. Ophiuchus, is itself from the Hebrew and Arabic name Afeichus, which means the serpent held. The brightest star in Ophiuchus, a (in the head), is called Ras al Hagus (Arabic), the head of him who holds. Other Hebrew names of stars, not identified, are Triophas, treading under foot; Saiph (in the foot* of Ophiuchus), bruised; Carnebus, the wounding ; Megeros, contending. \\ In the Zodiac of Denderah we have a throned human figure, called Api-bau, the chief who cometh. He has a hawk s head to show that he is the enemy of the serpent, which is called Khu, and means ruled or enemy. All these combine to set before us in detail the nature of the conflict and its final issue. That final issue is, however, exhibited by the last of the three constellations of this chapter. The Victor Himself requires a whole picture to fully set forth the glorious victory. This brings us to 3. HERCULES (The Mighty Man). The Mighty Vanquisher. Here the mighty one, who occupies a large portion of the heavens, is seen bending on one knee, with his right heel lifted up as if it had been wounded, * In 1604 a new star appeared in the eastern foot of Ophiuchus, but disappeared again in 1605. f There is an ancient Greek fable which calls Ophiuchus ^Esculapius, the son of Apollo. Having restored Hippolytus to life, he was everywhere worshipped as the god of health, and hence the serpent entwined around him is, to this day, the symbol of the medical art ! This, however, is, doubtless, another perversion of the primitive truth that the Coming One in overcoming the serpent, should become the great healer of all the sorrows of the world, and cause all its groanings to cease."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"SCORPIO: (HERCULES). 59 while his left foot is set directly over the head of the great dragon. In his right hand he wields a great club, and in his left hand he grasps a triple-headed monster (Cerberus}. And he has the skin of a lion, which he has slain, thrown around him.* In the Zodiac of Denderah we have a human figure, likewise with a club. His name is Bau, which means who cometh, and is evidently intended for Him who cometh to crush the serpent s head, and &quot; destroy the works of the devil.&quot; In Arabic he is called Al Giscale, the strong one. There are 113 stars in this constellation. Seven are of the 3rd magnitude, seventeen of the 4th, etc. The brightest star, a (in his head), is named Ras al Gethi, and means the head of him who bruises. The next, /3 (in the right arm-pit), is named Kornephoms, and means the branch, kneeling. The star K (in the right elbow) is called Marsic, the wounding. The star x (in the upper part of the left arm) is named Ma asyn, the sin-offering. While 01 (in the lower part of the right arm) is Caiam, or Guiam, punishing; and in Arabic, treading under foot. * Cerberus^ or the serpent with three heads, was placed by Hevelius (1611-1687) by the side of Hercules. Bayer had previously placed the apple branch in his hand. This was symbolical of the golden apples of Hesperides, which he obtained by killing this three-headed hydra, by whom they were guarded. In our picture these are com bined, and a bow nnd quiver added from other ancient authorities."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"OO THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. Thus does everything in the picture combine to set forth the mighty works of this stronger than the strong man armed! We can easily see how the perversion of the truth by the Greeks came about, and how, when the true foreshadowings of this Mighty One had been lost, the many fables were invented to supply their place. The wiser sort of Greeks knew this perfectly well. ARISTOTLE (in his Metaphysics, x. 8) admits, with regard to Greek mythology, that religion and philo sophy had been lost, and that much had been &quot; added after the mythical style,&quot; while much had come down, and &quot; may have been preserved to our times as the remains of ancient wisdom.&quot; Religion, such as it was (POLYBIUS confesses), was recognised as a &quot; necessary means to political ends.&quot; NEANDER says that it was &quot; the fragments of a tradition, which transmitted the knowledge of divine things possessed in the earliest times.&quot; ARATUS shews the same uncertainty as to the meaning of this Constellation of Hercules. He says : . &quot;Near this, and like a toiling man, revolves A form. Of it can no one clearly speak, Nor what he labours at. They call him simply The man upon his knees : In desperate struggle Like one who sinks, he seems. From both his shoulders His arms are high-uplifted and out-stretched As far as he can reach ; and his right foot Is planted on the coiled Dragon s head.&quot; Ancient authorities differ as to the personality of Hercules, and they disagree as to the number, nature, and order of what are sometimes called &quot;the twelve"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"SCORPIO: (HERCULES). bi labours of Hercules.&quot; But there is no doubt as to the mighty foretold works which the woman s Seed should perform. From first to last Hercules is seen engaged in destroying some malignant foe : now it is the Nemean lion ; then it is the slaying of the boar of Erymanthus ; again, it is the conquest of the bull of Crete ; then the killing of the three-headed hydra, by whose venom Hercules afterwards died. In the belly of the sea monster he is said to have remained &quot;three days and three nights.&quot; This was, doubtless, a perversion of the type of Jonah, introduced by LYCOPHRON, who (living at the court of PTOLEMY PHILADELPHIA, under whose auspices the Hebrew Scriptures were trans lated into Greek) would have known of that Divine miracle, and of its application to the Coming One. Bishop Horsley believed that the fables of the Greek mythology could be traced back to the prophecies of the Messiah, of which they were a perversion from ignorance or design. This is specially true of Hercules. In his apparently impossible tasks of over throwing gigantic enemies and delivering captives, we can see through the shadow, and discern the pure light of the truth. We can understand how the original star-picture must have been a prophetic repre sentation of Him who shall destroy the Old Serpent and open the way again, not to fabled &quot; apples of gold,&quot; but to the &quot;tree of life&quot; itself. He it is who though suffering in the mighty conflict, and brought to His knee, going down even to &quot; the dust of death,&quot; shall yet, in resurrection and advent glory, wield His"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"62 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. victorious club, subdue all His enemies, and plant His foot on the Dragon s head. For of Him it is written : &quot;Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder; The young- lion and the dragon shalt Thou trample under foot.&quot; (Ps. xci. 13.) &quot; Come, Lord, and burst the captives chains, And set the prisoners free; Come, cleanse this earth from all its stains, And make it meet for Thee ! Oh, come and end Creation s groans Its sighs, its tears, its blood, And make this blighted world again The dwelling-place of God.&quot; CHAPTER IV. THE SIGN SAGITTARIUS. The Redeemer s Triumph. THIS is the concluding chapter of the first great book of this Heavenly Revelation ; and it is occupied wholly with the triumph of the Coming One, who is re presented as going forth &quot; conquering and to conquer.&quot; The subject is beautifully set forth in the written Word (Ps. xlv. 3-5) : &quot; Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O most mighty, \\Gird Thy self ~\\ with Thy glory and Thy majesty, And in Thy majesty ride prosperously, Because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness; And Thy right hand shall teach Thee terrible things. Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the King s enemies ; Whereby the people fall under Thee.&quot;"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"SAGITTARIUS. 63 John, in his apocalyptic vision, sees the same mighty Conqueror going forth. &quot; I saw (he says) a white horse, and He that sat on him had a bow, . . . and He went forth conquering and to conquer &quot; (Rev. vi. 2). This is precisely what is foreshadowed in the star-pictured sign now called by the modern Latin name Sagittarius, which means the Archer. The Hebrew and Syriac name of the sign is Kesith, which means the Archer (as in Gen. xxi. 20). The Arabic name is Al Kaus, the arrow. In Coptic it is Pimacre, the graciousness, or beauty of the coming forth. In Greek it is Toxotes, the archer, and in Latin Sagittarius. There are 69 stars in the sign, viz., five of the 3rd magnitude (all in the bow), nine of the 4th, etc. The names of the brightest stars are significant : Hebrew, Nairn, which means the gracious one. This is exactly what is said of this Victor in the same Psalm (xlv.), in the words immediately preceding the quotation above (verse 2) : &quot; GRACE is poured into Thy lips ; Therefore God hath blessed Thee for ever.&quot; Hebrew, Nehushta, the going or sending forth. We see the same in the Arabic names which have come down to us : Al Nairn, the gracious one; Al Shaula, the dart; Al Wanda, who comes forth ; Ruchba cr rami, the riding of the bowman. An ancient Akkadian name in the sign is Nun-ki, which means Prince of the Earth."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"64 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. Again we have the picture of a Centaur as to his outward form, i.e. a being with two natures. Not now far down in the south, or connected with His sufferings and sacrifice as man ; but high up, as a sign of the Zodiac itself, on the ecliptic, i.e. in the very path in which the sun &quot; rejoiceth in his going forth as a strong man.&quot; According to Grecian fable, this Sagittarius is Cheiron, the chief Centaur; noble in character, righteous in his dealings, divine in his power. Such will be the coming Seed of the woman in His power and glory : &quot; The sceptre of Thy king-dom is a right sceptre. Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness; Therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.&quot; (Ps. xlv. 6, 7.) In the ancient Zodiac of Denderah he is called (as in Coptic) Pi-maere, i.e. graciousness, beauty of the appearing or coming forth. The characters under the . hind foot read Knem, which means He conquers. This is He who shall come forth like as an arrow from the bow, &quot; full of grace,&quot; but &quot; conquering and to conquer.&quot; In all the pictures he is similarly represented, and the arrow in his bow is aimed directly at the heart of the Scorpion. Thus ARATUS sang of Cheiron: &quot; Midst golden stars he stands refulgent now, And thrusts the scorpion with his bended bow.&quot;"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"SAGITTARIUS: (I.YKA). 65 In this Archer we see a faint reflection of Him who shall presently come forth, all gracious, all wise, all powerful ; whose arrows shall be &quot; sharp in the heart of the King s enemies.&quot; &quot; God shall shoot at them with an arrow ; Suddenly shall they be wounded. So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon them selves ; All that see them shall flee away. And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; For they shall wisely consider of His doing. The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in Him ; And all the upright in heart shall glory.&quot; (Ps.

LYRA (The Harp). Praise prepared for the Conqueror. 11 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion &quot; (Ps. Ixv. i).

The Twenty- first Psalm should be read here, as it tells of the bursting forth of praise on the going forth of this all-gracious Conqueror. &quot; The King- shall rejoice in Thy strength, O LORD ; And in Thy salvation how greatly shall He rejoice! . . . Thine hand shall find out all Thine enemies ; Thy right hand shall find out all that hate thee. . . , Their fruit shalt Thou destroy from the earth; And their seed from among- the children of men. For they intended evil against Thee ; They imagined a mischievous device which they are not able to perform, Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back (Heb. Margin, &quot;set tJicm as a bntt&quot;^), When Thou shalt make ready Thine arrows upon Thy string s \\_And shoot thcni\\ against the face of them. Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength ; SO WILL WE SING AND PRAISE THY POWER.&quot;. (Ps. xxi. i, 8, 10-13.) Beautifully, then, does the harp come in here, following upon the going forth of this victorious^, Horseman. This Song of the Lamb follows as naturally as docs the Song of Moses in Ex. xv. I : &quot; I will sing unto the LORD, for He hath triumphed gloriously.&quot; its brightest star, a, is one of the most glorious in the heavens, and by it this constellation may be easily known. It shines with a splendid white lustre. It is called Vega, which means He shall be exalted. Its root occurs in the opening of the Song"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"SAGITTARIUS : (LYRA). 6/ of Moses, quoted above. Is not this wonderfully expressive ? Its other stars, (3 and y, are also conspicuous stars, of the 2nd and 4th magnitude. is called Shelyuk, which means an eagle (as does the Arabic, A I Nesr) ; y is called Sulaphat, springing up, or ascending, as praise. In the Zodiac of Denderah, this constellation is figured as a hawk or an eagle (the enemy of the serpent) in triumph. Its name is Fent-kar, which means the serpent ruled. There ma)^ be some confusion between the Hebrew *$}, Nesher, an eagle, and &quot;lib p, Gnasor, a harp ; * but there can be no doubt about the grand central truth, that praise shall ascend up &quot; as an eagle toward heaven,&quot; when &quot; every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that is in them,&quot; shall send up their universal song of praise: &quot;Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.

Listen once again. &quot; Alleluia f: Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our * In our picture we have combined the two great thoughts, taking the harp from a picture dug up at Ilerculaneum, and adding an eagle soaring up with it. f This is the first time that the word &quot;Alleluia&quot; occurs in the New Testament, and it is praise for judgment executed. Where is its first occurrence in the Old Testament? In Ps. civ. 35, where we .have the very same solemn and significant connection : &quot; Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, And let the wicked be no more.

With &quot; that blessed hope &quot; before us, Let no HARP remain unstrung-; Let the coming- advent chorus Onward roll from tongue to tongue, Hallelujah, &quot; Come, Lord Jesus,&quot; quickly come. This brings us to 2. ARA (The Altar). Consuming Fire Prepared for His Enemies. Here we have an altar or burning pyre, placed significantly and ominously upside down ! with its fires burning and pointing downwards towards the lower regions, called Tartarus, or the abyss, or &quot; outer- darkness.&quot; It is an asterism with nine stars, dt which three are of the 3rd magnitude, four of the 4th, etc. It is south of the Scorpion s tail, and when these constellations were first formed it was visible only on the very lowest horizon of the south, pointing to the completion of all judgment in the lake of fire. In the Zodiac of Denderah we have a different picture, giving us another aspect of the same judg ment. It is a man enthroned, with a flail in his hand. His name is Bau, the same name a.s Hercules has, and means He cometh. It is from the Hebrew fc^D (Boh], to come, as in Isa. Ixiii. i: &quot; Who is this that cometh from Edom, With dyed garments from Bozrah.&quot;"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"SAGITTARIUS: (ARA). 69 This is a coming in judgment, as is clear from the reason given in verse 4 : &quot; For the day of vengeance is in Mine heart, And the year of My redeemed is come. And I looked, and there was none to help ; And I wondered that there was none to uphold; Therefore Mine own arm brought salvation, And My fury, it upheld Me.&quot; (Isa. Ixiii. 4, 5.) The completion of judgment, therefore, is what is pictured both by the burning pyre and the Coming One enthroned, with his threshing instrument. In Arabic it is called A I Mugamra, which means the completing, or finishing. The Greeks used the word Ara sometimes in the sense of praying, but more frequently in the sense of imprecation or cursing. This is the curse pronounced against the great enemy. This is the burning fire, pointing to the completion of that curse, when he shall be cast into that everlasting fire &quot; prepared for the devil and his angels.&quot; This is the allusion to it written in the midst of the very Scripture from which we have already quoted (p. 66), Ps. xxi., where we read in verse 9 (which we then omitted) : &quot;Thou shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of Thine anger: The LORD shall swallow them up in His wrath; And the fire shall devour them.&quot; This brings us to the final scene, closing up this first great book of the Heavens."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"70 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. 3. DRACO (The Dragon). The Old Serpent, or the Devil, cast down from Heaven. Each of the three great books concludes with this same foreshowing of Apocalyptic truth. The same great enemy is referred to in all these pictures. He is the Serpent; he is the Dragon; &quot;the great dragon, that old serpent, called the Devil and Satan &quot; (Rev. xii. 9). The Serpent represents him as the Deceiver; the Dragon, as the Destroyer. This First Book concludes with the Dragon being cast down from heaven. The Second Book concludes with Cetus, the Sea Monster, Leviathan, bound. The Third Book concludes with Hydra, the Old Serpent, destroyed. Here, at the close of the First Book, we see not merely a dragon, but the Dragon cast down ! That is the point of this great star-picture. No one has ever seen a dragon ; but among all nations (especially in China and Japan), and in all ages, we find it described and depicted in legend and in art. Both Old and New Testaments refer to it, and all unite in connecting with it one and the same great enemy of God and man. It is against him that the God-Man &quot; the Son of God goes forth to war.&quot; It is for him that the"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"SAGITTARIUS: (DRACO). 71 eternal fires are prepared. It is he who shall shortly be cast down from the heavens preparatory to his completed judgment. It is of him we read, &quot; The great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out and his angels with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ ; for the accuser of our brethren is cast down &quot; (Rev. xii. 9, 10). It is of him that David sings : &quot; God is my king 1 of old, Working 1 salvation in the midst of the earth . . . Thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces.&quot; (Ps. Ixxiv. 12-14.) Of him also the Spirit causes Isaiah to say, &quot;In that day, shall this song be sung in the land of Judah&quot;; &quot; In that day the LORD, with his sore, and great, and strong sword, Shall punish leviathan the piercing (R.V. swift) serpent, Even leviathan that crooked serpent; And he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.&quot; (Isa. xxvi. i ; xxvii. i.) This is exactly what is foreshadowed by this constellation of Draco. Its name is from the Greek, and means trodden on, as in the Scptuagint of Ps. xci. 13 : &quot; The dragon shalt thou trample under feet,&quot; from the Hebrew Tt, Dahrach, to tread."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"72 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. In the Zodiac of Denderah it is shown as a serpent under the fore-feet of Sagittarius, and is named Hcr-fent, which means the serpent accursed! There are 80 stars in the constellation ; four of the 2nd magnitude, seven of the 3rd mag nitude, ten of the 4th, etc. The brightest star, a (in one of the latter coils), is named Thuban (Heb.), the subtle. Some 4,620 years ago it was the Polar Star. It is manifest, therefore, that the Greeks could not have invented this constellation, as is confessed by all modern astronomers. It is still a very important star in nautical reckonings, guiding the commerce of the seas, and thus &quot; the god of this world &quot; is repre sented as winding in his contortions round the pole of the world, as if to indicate his subtle influence in all worldly affairs. The next star, /3 (in the head), is called by the Hebrew name Rastaban, and means the head of the subtle (serpent}. In the Arabic it is still called A I Waid, which means who is to be destroyed. The next star, y (also in the head), is called Ethanin, i.e., the long serpent, or dragon. The Hebrew names of other stars, not identified, are Grumian, the subtle; Giansar, the punished enemy.

In the Zodiacs of Denderah and Esneh, in Egypt, it is half-goat and half-fish, and it is there called Hu-penius, which means the place of the sacrifice. In the Indian Zodiac it is a goat passant tra versed by a fish. There can be no doubt as to the significance of this sign. In the Goat we have the Atoning Sacrifice, in the Fish we have the people for whom the atone ment is made. When we come to the sign &quot; PISCES &quot; we shall see more clearly that it points to the multitudes of the redeemed host. The Goat is bowing its head as though falling down in death. The right leg is folded under neath the body, and he seems unable to rise with the left. The tail of the fish, on the other hand, seems to be full of vigour and life. The Hebrew name of the sign is Gcdi, the kid or cut off, the same as the Arabic Al Gcdi. CAPRI CORNUS is merely the modern (Latin) name of the sign, and means goat. * There is a fish tail here. The third Decan of CAPRICORNUS is a fish (Delphiniis). There is again a fish (Piscis Australis) in the next sign (AQUARIUS), and then the following sign is PISCES, or the Fishes.

Of &quot; the goat of the sin-offering&quot; it is written, &quot;God hath given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congre gation, to make atonement for them before the LORD&quot; (Lev. x. 16, 17): of the other goat, which was not slain, &quot; he shall let it go into the wilder ness &quot; (Lev. xvi. 22). Here is death and resur rection. Christ was &quot; wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities.&quot; &quot; For the transgres sion of MY PEOPLE was He stricken&quot; (Isa. liii.). He laid down His life for the sheep. In the first chapter of the First Book we had the same Blessed One presented as &quot;a corn of wheat.&quot; Here we see Him come to &quot; die,&quot; and hence not abiding alone, but bringing forth &quot; much fruit&quot; (John xii. 24).

It is, however, not merely the actual death which is set before us here. The first chapter in each book has for its great subject the Person of the Redeemer in prophecy and promise. The last chapter in each book has for its subject the fulfilment of that prophecy in victory and triumph, in the Person of the Redeemer : while the two central chapters in each book- are occupied with the work which is the accomplish ment of the promise, presented in two aspects the former connected with grace, the latter with conflict. Thus the structure of each of the three books is an epanodos, having for its first and last members the Person of the Redeemer (in &quot;A&quot; in Prophecy; in &quot;A&quot; in Fulfilment], while in the two central members we have the work and its accomplishment (in &quot;B&quot; in grace; and in &quot; jB &quot; in conflict}.

As a matter of fact it did actually point out the time when the Sun of Righteousness should arise, and &quot; the Light of the World &quot; appear. For when this Promised Seed was born the Sun was actually in this sign of Cap- ricornus ! &quot;The fulness of time was come,&quot; and &quot;God sent forth His Son TO REDEEM them that were under the Law&quot; (Gal. iv. 4).

The days began immediately to lengthen when He, &quot; the true light,&quot; had come into the world.* Astronomers confess that the perverted legends of the Greeks give but &quot; a lame account &quot; of this sign, &quot; and it offers no illustration of its ancient origin.&quot; Its ancient origin reveals a prophetic knowledge, which only He possessed who knew that in u the fulness of time &quot; He would send forth His Son. We now come to the three constellations which give us three pictures setting forth the death of this Sacrifice and of His living again. i. SAGITTA (The Arrow). The Arrow of God sent forth. It is not the Arrow of Sagittarius, for that has not left his bow. That arrow is for the enemies of God. This is for the Son of God. It was of this that He spoke when He said, in Ps. xxxviii. 2 : &quot; Thine arrows stick fast in me, And Thy hand presseth me sore.&quot; He was &quot; stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted, He was wounded for our transgressions&quot; (Isa. liii. 4, 5). He was &quot;pierced,&quot; when He could say with Job, &quot; The arrows of the Almighty are within me &quot; (vi. 4). * When we come to the last chapter of this book we shall see that the Sun was in the sign of the other sacrificial animal, ARIES, at the very hour of the Crucifixion. And ARIES sets before us the victory of &quot;the Lamb that was slain.&quot;"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"80 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. Here the arrow is pictured to us in mid-heaven, alone, as having been shot forth by an invisible hand. It is seen in its flight through the heavens. It is the arrow of God, showing that Redemption is all of God. It was &quot;the will of God&quot; which Jesus came to do. Not a mere work of mercy for miserable sinners, but a work ordained in eternity past, for the glory of God in eternity future. This is the record of the Word, and this is what is pictured for us here. The work which the arrow accomplishes is seen in the dying Goat, and in the falling Eagle. There are many other stars in the heavens in a straighter line, which would better serve for an arrow. Why are these stars chosen ? Why is the arrow placed here ? What explanation can be given, except that the Revelation in the stars and in the Book are both from the inspiration of the same Spirit ? There are about 18 stars, of which four are of the 4th magnitude. Only y and % are in the same line, while the shaft passes between a and |3. The Hebrew name is Sham, destroying, or desolate. 2.

The names of the stars, all of them, bear out this representation. The constellation contains 74 stars. The brightest of them, a (in the Eagle s neck), is a notable star of the ist magnitude, called A I Tair (Arabic), the wounding. The star (in the throat) is called A I Shain (Arabic), the bright, from a Hebrew root meaning scarlet coloured, as in Josh, ii. 1 8. The star y (in the back) is called Tarared, wounded, or torn. 8 (in the lower wing) is named Alcair, which means the piercing, and e (in the tail), A I Okal, has the significant meaning wounded in the heel. How can the united testimony of these names be explained except by acknowledging a Divine origin ? even that of Him who afterwards foretold of the bruising of the Virgin s Son in the written Word ; yea, of Him &quot; who telleth the number of the stars and giveth them all their names.&quot; 3. DELPHINUS (The Dolphin). The Dead One Rising again. This is a bright cluster of 18 stars, five of which are of the 3rd magnitude.

It is always figured as a fish full of life, and always with the head upwards, just as the eagle is always with the head downwards. The great peculiar characteristic of the dolphin is its rising up, leaping, and springing out of the sea. When we compare this with the dying goat and falling eagle, what conclusion can we come to but that we have here the filling in of the picture, and the completion of the whole truth set forth in Ca- pricornus ? Jesus &quot; died and rose again.&quot; Apart from His resur rection His death is without result. In His conflict with the enemy it is only His coming again in glory which is shown forth. But here, in connection with His people, with the multitudes of His redeemed, Resurrection is the great and important truth. He is &quot;the first-fruits of them that slept&quot;; then He, too, is here represented as a fish. He who went down into the waters of death for His people ; He who could say &quot; All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me&quot; (Ps. xlii. 7), He it is who rises up again from the dead, having died on account of the sins of His redeemed, and risen again on account of their justification (Rom. iv. 25). This is the picture here. In the Persian plani sphere there seems to be a fish and a stream of water. The Egyptian has a vessel pouring out water. The ancient names connected with this constella tion are Dalaph (Hebrew), pouring out of water;"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"CAPRICORNUS : (DELPHINUS). 83 Dalaph (Arabic), coming quickly; Scalooin (Arabic), swift (as the flow of water); Rotaneb or Rotaneu (Syriac and Chaldee), swiftly running. Thus, in this first chapter of the Second Book we see the great truth of Revelation set forth ; and we learn how the great Blessings of Redemption were procured. This truth cannot be more elo quently or powerfully presented than in the language of Dr. Seiss : &quot;This strange goat-fish, dying- in its head, but living in its afterpart falling as an eagle pierced and wounded by the arrow of death, but springing up from the dark waves with the matchless vigour and beauty of the dolphin sinking under sin s condemnation, but rising again as sin s conqueror de veloping new life out of death, and heralding a new spring time out of December s long drear nights was framed by no blind chance of man. The story which it tells is the old, old story on which hangs the only availing hope that ever came, or ever can come, to Adam s race. To what it signifies we are for ever shut up as the only saving faith. In that dying Seed of the woman we must see our sin-bearer and the atone ment for our guilt, or die ourselves unpardoned and unsanctified. Through His death and bloodshedding we must find our life, or the true life, which alone is life, we never can have.&quot; &quot; Complete atonement Thou hast made, And to the utmost farthing paid Whate er Thy people owed : Nor can His wrath on me take place, If sheltered in His righteousness, And sprinkled with the blood.

THE SIGN AQUARIUS (The Water Bearer). Their Blessings Ensured, or the Living Waters of Blessing Poured Forth for the Redeemed. THE Atonement being made, the blessings have been procured, and now they can be bestowed and poured forth upon the Redeemed. This is the truth, whether we think of Abel s lamb, of patriarchal sacrifices, the offerings under the Law, or of that great Sacrifice of which they all testified. They all with one voice tell us that atonement made is the only foundation of blessing. This was pictured and foreshown in the heavens from the beginning, by a man pouring forth water from an urn which seems to have an inexhaustible supply, and which flows forth downwards into the mouth of a fish, which receives it and drinks it all up. In the ancient Zodiac of Denderah it is the same idea, though the man holds two urns, and the fish below seems to have come out of the urn. The"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"AQUARIUS. 85 man is called Hupei Tirion, which means the place of him coming down or poured forth. In some eastern Zodiacs the Urn alone appears. This agrees with its other names Hebrew, Deli, the water-urn, or bucket (as in Num. xxiv. 7) ; the Arabic Delu is the same. There are 108 stars in this Sign, four of which are of the 3rd magnitude. Their names, as far as they have come down to us, are significant. The star a (in the right shoulder) is called Sa ad al Melik, which means the record of the pouring forth. The star &amp;lt;3 (in the other shoulder) is called Saad al Sund, who goeth and returneth, or the pourer out. The bright star 8 (in the lower part of the right leg) is well-known to-day by its Hebrew name Scheat, which means who goeth and returneth. The bright star in the urn has an Egyptian name Mon or Meon, which means simply an urn. Aquarius is the modern Latin name by which the sign is known. It has the same meaning, the pourer forth of water. Can we doubt what is the interpretation of this sign ? The Greeks, not knowing Him of whom it testified, were, like the woman of Samaria, destitute of that living water which He alone can give. They therefore invented some story about Deucalion, the son of Prometheus ; and another, saying he is Gany- ?ncde, Jove s cup-bearer 1 But, as an astronomer says, &quot;We must account otherwise for the origin of this name ; for it is not possible to reconcile the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"86 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. symbols of the eleventh * sign with Grecian mytho logy.&quot; No ! we must go further back than that, and not cramp our vision, and distort the Scriptures, by confining our thoughts to &quot; the Church.&quot; The Church is nowhere seen in these Signs, as she is nowhere revealed in the Old Testament. This we shall enlarge on when we come to the sign Pisces. Meanwhile we must read the witness of the stars as if there had been no Church ! Christ is first. Yea, He is all in all. The Scriptures testify of Him ; and the very stars in this Sign tell of His going away and His coming again. These prophetic signs have to do with Him, with the Atonement He wrought, with the conflict He endured, with the blessings He secured, with the victory He shall win, and the triumph He shall have. For it is written : &quot; He shall pour the water out of His buckets, And His seed shall be in many waters, And His king- shall be higher than Agag, And His kingdom shall be exalted.&quot; (Num. xxiv. 7.) It tells of that glorious day when &quot; A King shall reign in righteousness ; And princes shall rule in judgment ; And a MAN shall be as an hiding place from the wind, And a covert from the tempest ; As RIVERS of WATER in a dry place.&quot; (Isa. xxxii. I, 2). * The eleventh, because everyone begins to reckon from ARIES, and not as we have done from VIRGO, as shown by the riddle of the Sphinx. See page 20."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"AQUARIUS. 87 It speaks of that glorious time when Israel shall be restored, and their &quot;eyes shall see the King in His beauty &quot; ; when the peace of Zion shall be no more disturbed, &quot; but there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams &quot; (Isa. xxxiii. 17, 20, 21). Then &quot;The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; And the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose, For in the wilderness shall waters break out, And streams in the desert.&quot; (Isa. xxxv. I, 6.) &quot; I will open rivers in high places, And fountains in the midst of the valleys ; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, And the dry land springs of water.&quot; (Isa. xli. 1 8.) &quot; Fear not, O Jacob, My servant ; And thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen, For I will POUR WATER upon him that is thirsty, And floods upon the dry ground ; I will pour My Spirit upon thy seed, And My blessing upon thy offspring. Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, And his Redeemer the LORD of hosts.&quot; (Isa. xliv. 2, 3, 6.) This is the meaning of the Sign. The MAN Christ Jesus, who was humbled in death will yet be seen to be the pourer forth of every blessing. Physically pouring forth literal waters, removing the curse, and turning this world into a paradise : &quot; Making her wilderness like Eden, And her desert like the garden of the LORD.&quot; (Isa. li. 3.) And morally pouring forth His Spirit in such abund ance as to fill the whole earth with peace, and blessing, and glory, &quot; as the waters cover the sea.&quot;"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"88 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. Upon Israel restored He will pour out His bless ing. They will be sprinkled with clean water, and possess a new heart and a new spirit (Ezek. xxxvi. 24-28; Joel ii. 28-32). Such are some of the Scriptures which tell of this glorious Water-pourer. We need not rob Christ of His glory, or Israel of her blessing, in order to see in all this Pentecost or the Church. These are quite independent of the great line of prophetic truth. They are parenthetical, and distinct, and true, quite apart from the glorious prophecies of Israel s scattering and gathering. The physical marvels referred to in the texts above can never be satisfied or exhausted by any spiritual fulfilment. We may make an application of them as far as is consistent with the teaching of the epistles ; but the interpretation of them belongs to the Person of Christ, and the nation of Israel. That interpretation is pictured for us in the Sign, and in its three con stellations. i. PISCIS AUSTRALIS (The Southern Fish). The Blessings Bestowed. This first constellation is one of high antiquity,* and its brilliant star of the first magnitude was a subject of great study by the Egyptians and Ethiopians. It is named in Arabic Fom al Haut, the mouth of the fish. There are 22 other stars. * And in great contrast with several modern ones near it, e.g., the Balloon, the Sculptor s.

In the Denderah Zodiac it is called Aar, a stream. It sets forth the simple truth that the blessings procured by the MAN the coming Seed of the woman, will be surely bestowed and received by those for whom they are intended. There will be no failure in their communication, or in their recep tion. What has been purchased shall be secured and possessed. 2. PEGASUS (The Winged Horse). The Blessings Quickly Coming. Not only shall they be received, but they shall be brought near. They will not have to be fetched, but they will be caused to come to those for whom they are procured, and will yet be brought by Him who has procured them. In the Denderah Zodiac there are two characters immediately below the horse, Pe and ka. Peka or Pega, is in Hebrew the chief, and Sus is horse. So that the very word (Pegasus) has come down to us and has been preserved through all the languages. The names of the stars in this constellation de clare to us its meaning. There are 89 altogether ; one of the 1st magnitude, two of the 2nd, three of the 3rd, nine of the 4th, etc. And, as astronomers testify, &quot;they render Pegasus peculiarly remarkable.&quot;"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"go THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. The brightest, a (on the neck of the horse at the junction of the wing), comes down to us with the ancient Hebrew name of Markab, which means returning from afar.

The star e (in .the nostril) is called Enif (Arabic), the water. The star i] (in the near leg) is called Matar (Arabic), who causes to overflow. These names show us that we have to do with no mere horse. A winged horse is unknown to nature. It must therefore be used as a figure ; and it can be a figure only of a person, even of Him who is u the Branch&quot; as the star Enif shows, who said, &quot;If I go away I will come again,&quot; as the star Scheat testifies. He who procured these blessings for the re deemed by His Atonement, is quickly coming to bring them ; and is soon returning to pour them forth upon a groaning creation. This is the lesson of Pegasus. &quot; Come, blessed Lord, bid every shore And answering- island sing The praises of Thy royal Name, And own Thee as their King. Lord, Lord !

It consists of two stars which revolve about each other, and yet have a progressive motion common to each ! This mighty bird is not falling dead, like Aquila, but it is flying swiftly in mid-heaven. It is coming to the earth, for it is not so much a bird of the air, but a bird peculiarly belonging to both the earth and the waters. Its brightest star, a (between the body and the tail), is called Deneb (like another in Capricornus), and means the judge. It is also called Adigc, flying swiftly, and thus at once it is connected with Him who cometh to judge the earth in righteousness.

The names of the stars explain the constellations, and the names of the constella tions explain the sign, so that we are left in no doubt. By His atoning death (as set forth in CAPRI- CORNUS) He has purchased and procured unspeakable blessings for His redeemed. This sign (AQUARIUS) tells of those blessings being poured forth, and of the speedy return of Him who is to bring &quot; rivers of blessing,&quot; and to fill this earth with blessing and glory &quot; as the waters cover the sea.&quot; &quot; Then take, LORD, thy king-dom, and come in Thy glory ; Make the scene of Thy sorrows the place of Thy throne, Complete all the blessing- which ages in story Have told of the triumphs so justly Thine own.&quot; CHAPTER III.

One fish is represented with its head pointing upwards towards the North Polar Star, the other is shown at right angles, swimming along the line of the ecliptic, or path of the sun. The ancient Egyptian name, as shown on the Denderah Zodiac, is Pi-cot Orion, or Pisces Hori, which means the fishes of Him that cometh. The Hebrew name is Dagim, the Fishes, which is closely connected with multitudes, as in Gen. xlviii. 26, where Jacob blesses Joseph s sons, and says, &quot; Let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.&quot; The margin says, &quot; Let them grow as fishes do increase &quot; It refers to the fulfilment of Gen. i. 28, &quot; Be fruitful and multiply.&quot; The multitude of Abra ham s seed is prominent in the pronouncement of the blessings, where God compared his future pos terity to the stars of the sky, and the sand upon the sea shore. &quot; A very great multitude of fish,&quot; as in Ezek. xlvii. 9.

And here we must maintain that &quot; the Church,&quot; which is &quot; the Body of Christ,&quot; was a subject that was never revealed to man until it was made known to the Apostle Paul by a special revelation. The Holy Spirit declares (Rom. xvi. 25) that it &quot;was kept secret since the world began.&quot; In Eph. iii. 9 he declares that it &quot;from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God&quot;; and in Col. i. 26, that it &quot; hath been hid from ages and from genera tions, but now is made manifest to His saints.&quot; In each scripture which speaks of it as &quot; now made manifest,&quot; or &quot;now made known,&quot; it is distinctly stated that it was &quot;a mystery,&quot; i.e., a secret, and had, up to that moment, been hidden from man kind, hidden &quot; in God.&quot; How, then, we ask, can &quot; the Church,&quot; which was a subsequent revelation, be read into the previous prophecies, whether written in the Old Testament Scriptures, or made known in the Heavens ? If the Church was revealed in pro phecy, then it could not have been said to be hidden or kept secret. If the first revelation of it was made known to Paul, as he distinctly affirms it was, then it could not have been revealed before. Unless we see this very clearly, we cannot &quot;rightly divide the word of truth&quot; (2 Tim. ii. 15). And if we do not rightly divide the word of truth, in its subjects, and times, and dispensations, we must inevitably be landed in confusion and darkness, interpreting of the Church, scriptures which belong only to Israel.

Not that the Church of God was an after-thought. No, it was a Divine secret, kept as only God Himself could keep it. The Bible therefore would have been complete (so far as the Old Testament prophecies are concerned) if the Epistles (which belong only to the Church) were taken out. The Old Testament would then give us the kingdom prophesied ; the Gospels and Acts, the King and the kingdom offered and rejected ; then the Apocalypse would follow, showing how that pro mised kingdom will yet be set up with Divine judg ment, power, and glory. If these Signs and these star-pictures be the results of inspired patriarchs, then this Sign of PISCES can refer to &quot; His seed,&quot; prophesied of in Isa. liii. : &quot; He shall see His seed.&quot; It must refer to &quot; The n:ition whose God is the LORD, And the people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance.&quot; (Ps. xxxiii. 12.) &quot; Such as be blessed of Him shall inherit the earth.&quot; (Ps. xxxvii. 22.) &quot;The LORD shall increase you more and more, You and your children, Ye are blessed of the LORD.&quot; (Ps. cxv. 14, 15.) &quot; Their seed shall be known among- the Gentiles. And their offspring- among the people ; All that see them shall acknowledge them, That they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.&quot; (Isa. Ixi. 9.) &quot; They are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, And their offspring with them.&quot; (Isa. Ixv. 23.)"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"96 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. The prophecy of this Sign was afterwards written in the words of Isa. xxvi. 15 the song which shall yet be sung in the land of Judah : &quot; Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, Thou hast increased the nation.&quot; And in Isa. ix. 3 (R.V.), speaking of the glorious time when the government shall be upon the shoulder of the coming King: &quot; Thou hast multiplied the nation, Thou hast increased their joy.&quot; Of that longed-for day Jeremiah sings (xxx. 19) : &quot; I will multiply them And they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, And they shall not be small.&quot; Ezekiel also is inspired to say: &quot; I will multiply men upon you, All the house of Israel, even all of it : And the cities shall be inhabited, And the wastes shall be builded ; And I will multiply upon you man and beast; And they shall increase and bring- fruit.&quot; (Ezek. xxxvi. 10, 11.) &quot;Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; It shall be an everlasting covenant with them ! And I will place them, and multiply them, And will set My sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.&quot; (Ezek. xxxvii. 26.) Indeed, this Sign of PISCES has always been inter preted of Israel. Both Jews and Gentiles have agreed in this. ABARBANEL, a Jewish commentator, writing on Daniel, affirms that the Sign PISCES always refers to the people of Israel. He gives five reasons"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"PISCES. 97 for this belief, and also affirms that a conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn always betokens a crisis in the affairs of Israel. Because such a conjunction took place in his day (about 1480 A.D.) he looked for the coming of Messiah.* Certain it is, that when the sun is in PISCES all the constellations which are considered noxious, are seen above the horizon. What is true in astronomical observation is true also in historical fact. When God s favour is shown to Israel, &quot;the Jew s enemy&quot; puts forth his malignant powers. When they increased and multiplied in Egypt, he endeavoured to compass the destruction of the nation by destroying the male children ; but their great Deliverer remembered His covenant, defeated the designs of the enemy, and brought the counsel of the heathen to nought. So it was in Persia ; and so it will yet be again when the hour of Israel s final deliverance has come. There can be no doubt that we have in this Sign the foreshowing of the multiplication and bless ing of the children of promise, and a token of their coming deliverance from all the power of the enemy. But why two fishes ? and why is one horizontal and the other perpendicular? The answer is, that not only in Israel, but in the seed of Seth and Shem there were always those who looked for a heavenly portion, and were &quot;partakers of a heavenly calling.&quot; In Heb. xi. we are distinctly told that Abraham * How inconsistent when there were three such conjunctions in one year, all in the same sign of PISCES, immediately preceding the birth of the woman s Seed ; and in addition to this the new star which had been foretold.

They desired &quot;a better country, that is, an HEAVENLY : wherefore God is not ashamed * to be called their God ; for He hath prepared for them a city&quot; (v. 16). It is clear, therefore, that what are called the &quot; Old Testament Saints&quot; were &quot;partakers of THE HEAVENLY CALLING&quot; (Heb. iii. i), which included a heavenly portion and a heavenly home ; and all through the ages there have been &quot; partakers of the heavenly calling.&quot; This is quite distinct from the calling of the Church, which is from both Jews and Gentiles to form &quot; one body,&quot; a &quot;new man&quot; in Christ (Eph. ii. 15). It must be distinct, for it is expressly stated at the end of that chapter (Heb. xi. 40) that God has &quot; PROVIDED (marg. foreseen) SOME BETTER THING FOR us.&quot; How can this be a &quot; better thing,&quot; if it is the same thing? There must be two separate things if one is &quot; better &quot; than the other ! Our calling in Christ is the &quot;better thing.&quot; The Old Testament saints had, and will have, a good thing. They will have a heavenly blessing, and a heavenly portion, for God has &quot; prepared for them a city,&quot; and we see that prepared city, even &quot; the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of HEAVEN, * The figure of Tapeinosis, which calls our attention to that fact that He was delighted thus to be called."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"PISCES. 99 prepared as a bride adorned for her husband &quot; (Rev. xxi. 2).

Its ancient Egyptian name was U-or, which means He cometh. Its Arabic name is A I Risha, the band, or bridle.

And her coming Deliverer thus addresses her : &quot; O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, Behold, ... in righteousness shalt thou be established : Thou shalt be far from oppression ; for thou shalt not fear : And from terror; for it shall not come nigh thee.&quot; (Isa. liv. 1 1-14.) &quot; Hear now this, thou afflicted. . . .

His name in the Denderah Zodiac is Pe-ku-hor, which means this one cometh to rule. The Greek name by which he is now known, Cepheus, is from the Hebrew, and means the branch, and is called by EURIPIDES the king. An old Ethiopian name was Hyk, a king.

Here we are first shown the foundation on which that victory rests, namely, Atonement. Hence we are taken back and reminded of the &quot; blood of the Lamb.&quot; This is pictured by a ram, or lamb, full of vigour and life ; not falling in death as Capricornus is. In the Denderah Zodiac its name is Tametouris Amman, which means the reign, dominion, or govern ment of Amman. The lamb s head is without horns, and is crowned with a circle. The Hebrew name is Taleh, the lamb. The Arabic name is A I Hamal, the sheep, gentle, merciful. This name has been mistakenly given by some to the principal star, a. The Syriac name is Amroo, as in the Syriac New Testament in John i. 29: &quot;Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.&quot; The ancient Akkadian name was Bara- &quot;i^ar. Bar means altar, or sacrifice ; and ziggar means right making; so that the full name would be the sacrifice of righteousness. There are 66 stars in this si^n, one being of the 2nd magnitude, two of the 4th, etc. Its chief star, a (in the forehead), is named El Natli* or El Natik, which means wounded, slain.

This rejoicing connected with the Lamb shines faintly through the heathen perversions and myths : for HERODOTUS tells us how the ancient Egyptians, once a year, when it opened by the entrance of the sun into ARIES,* slew a Ram, at the festival of Jupiter Ammon ; branches were placed over the doors, the Ram was garlanded with wreaths of flowers and carried in procession. Now the sun entered ARIES on the i4th of the Jewish month Nisan, and another lamb was then ordered to be slain, even &quot;the LORD S pass- over &quot;the type of that Lamb that should in the fulness of time be offered without blemish and with out spot. Owing to the precession of the equinoxes, the sun, at the time of the Exodus, had receded into this sign of ARIES, which then marked the Spring Equinox. But by. the time that the antitype the Lamb of God, was slain, the sun had still further receded, and on the i^th of Nisan, in the year of the Crucifixion, stood at the very spot marked by the stars a, El Natli, the pierced, the wounded or slain, * TAURUS then marked the Spring Equinox."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"ARIES: (CASSIOPEIA). 107 and |3, A I Shcratan, the bruised or wounded!

In the Denderah Zodiac her name is Set, which means set, set up as Queen. ALBUMAZER says this constellation was anciently called &quot;the daughter of splendour.&quot; This appears to be the meaning of the word Cassiopeia, the enthroned, the beautiful.

No more coming &quot; forth &quot; to suffer and die, a sacrifice for sins ; the reference now is only to His second coming in glory; His coming &quot; unto &quot; this earth is not to suffer for sin (Heb. ix. 28.), but it will be a coming in power to judge the earth in righteous ness, and to subdue all enemies under His feet. Like the other two books, it consists of four chapters. The first chapter is the prophecy of the coming Judge of all the earth. The second sets before us the two-fold nature of the coming Ruler. The third shows us Messiah s redeemed possessions the Redeemed brought safely home, all conflict over. The fourth describes Messiah s consummated triumph."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"I2O THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. CHAPTER I. THE SIGN TAURUS (The Bull). Messiah, the coming Judge of all the Earth. THE picture is that of a Bull rushing forward with mighty energy and fierce wrath, his horns set so as to push his enemies, and pierce them through and destroy them. It is a prophecy of Christ, the coming Judge, and Ruler, and &quot;Lord of all the earth.&quot; The Egyptian Zodiac of Denderah already, 4,000 years ago, had forgotten the truth to which the pro phecy had referred, and called him Isis, i.e., who saves or delivers, and Apis, i.e., the head or chief. The Bull is clearly represented, and in all the zodiacs which have come down to us is always in the act of pushing, or rushing. The name of the sign in Chaldee is *Ylfl, Tor. Hence, Arabic, Al Thaur ; Greek, Tauros; Latin, Taurus, etc. The more common Hebrew name was ^VifcjJ, Shur, which is from a root which means both coming and ruling. There are several Hebrew words for bulls and oxen, etc. But the common poetical term for all is D&O, Reem, conveying the idea of loftiness, exaltation, power, and pre-eminence. We find the root in other kindred languages (Etruscan, Sanscrit, etc.), and it can be traced in the name of Abram, which means pre-eminent or high father ; Ramah, high place, etc."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"TAURUS. 121 The stars in Taurus present a brilliant sight. There are at least 141 stars, besides two important groups of stars, which both form integral parts of the sign. The brightest star, a (in the bull s eye), has a Chaldee name Al Debar an, and means the leader or governor. The star 3 (at the tip of the left horn) has an Arabic name El Nath, meaning wounded or slain. Another prophetic intimation that this coming Lord should be first slain as a sacrifice. Then there is the cluster of stars known as the Pleiades. This word, which means the congregation of the judge or ruler, comes to us through the Greek Septuagint as the translation of the Hebrew nip*3, Chima, which means the heap or accumulation, and occurs in Job ix. 9; xxxviii. 31, 32, and Amos v. 8. It consists of a number of stars (in the neck of of Taurus) which appear to be near together. The brightest of them, marked ij in all the maps,* has come down to us with an Arabic name Al Cyone, which means the centre, and has given the idea to some astronomers that it is the centre of the whole universe. The Syriac name for the Pleiades is Succoth, which means booths. Another group of stars (on the face of the Bull) is known as The Hyades,\\ which has the similar meaning of the congregated. * The others have names, but they were given by the Greeks from the names of the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione. The Hyades were their sisters. Together they tell us that the saints will be secure with this mighty Lord when he comes to rule. f The Pleiades and Hyades are sometimes spoken of as constellations, but this is a mistake ; they are integral parts of Taurus."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"122 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. Other stars, not identified, are named Palilicium (Hebrew), belonging to the judge; Wasat (Arabic), centre or foundation; A I Thuraiya (Arabic), the abundance; VergilicB (Latin), the centre (Arabic, vertex] turned on, rolled round. Every thing points to the important truth, and all turns on the fact that the Lord is COMING TO RULE ! This is the central truth of all prophecy. &quot; The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.&quot; All hope for Creation, all hope for the world, all hope for Israel, all hope for the Church, turns on this, that &quot; Jesus is coming again,&quot; and that when He comes His saints, &quot;the daughters of the King&quot; (like the Pleiades and Hyades), will be with Him. There is nothing of &quot; the Church &quot; revealed here. The Church will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air, to be for ever with the Lord (i Thess. iv. 17) before He thus comes unto the world in judgment. He will come forth to receive the members of His Body unto Himself, before He thus comes with them to destroy all His enemies and &quot;judge (or rule) the world in righteousness.&quot; When we read this Sign of Taurus, therefore, we are to understand that His Church will be with Him, safe from all judg ment. There is very much in the Scripture of the Book, (as there is in the prophecies in the heavens) about the coming of the Lord in judgment ; and about this time of His indignation.

We have said (pages 17, etc.) that at a very early period these signs were appropriated to the Twelve Tribes of Israel, and borne upon their &quot;stand ards.&quot; This may be traced in the Blessing of Jacob (Gen. xlix.), and in the Blessing of Moses (Deut. xxxiii.). Taurus was assigned to Joseph, or rather to his two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, like the two powerful horns : &quot; The firstling- of his bullock (marg. his firstling bullock] majesty is his, And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox (Reeni).

This is the united testimony of the two Revela tions. It is pictured in the heavens, and it is written in the Book. It is the prophecy of a coming Judge, and of a coming judgment. It is, however, no mere Bull that is coming. It is a man, a glorious man, even &quot; the Son of Man.&quot; This is the first development, shown in the first of the three constellations belonging to the sign. i. ORION (The coming Prince).

His name is given as Ha-ga-t, which means this is he who triumphs. The hieroglyphic characters below read Oar. Orion was anciently spelt Oarion, from the Hebrew root, which means light. So that Orion means coming forth as light. The ancient Akkadian was Ur-ana, the light of heaven. Orion is the most brilliant of all the constellations, and when he comes to the meridian he is accompanied by several adjacent constellations of great splendour. There is then above the horizon the most glorious view of the celestial bodies that the starry firmament affords ; and this magnificent view is visible to all the habitable world, because the equinoctial line (or solstitial colure) passes nearly through the middle of Orion. ARATUS thus sings of him : &quot; Eastward, beyond the region of the Bull, Stands great Orion. And who, when night is clear, Beholds him gleaming bright, shall cast his eyes in vain To find a Sign more glorious in all heaven.&quot; The constellation is mentioned by name, as being perfectly well known both by name and appearance, in the time of Job ; and as being an object of familiar knowledge at that early period of the world s history. See Job ix. 9; xxxviii. 31, and Amos v. 8 (Heb. Ap^, Chesil, which means a strong one, a hero, or giant).

Thus beautifully is set forth the brilliancy and glory of that Light which shall break forth when the moment comes for it to be said, &quot;Arise, shine, for thy light is come.&quot; The picture presents us with &quot; the Light of the world.&quot; His left foot is significantly placed upon the head of the enemy.

The name of the fourth star, 8 (one of the three in the belt), carries us back to the old, old story, that this glorious One was once humbled ; that His heel was once bruised. Its name is A I Nitak, the wounded One* Similarly the star K (in the right leg) is called Saiph, bruised, which is the very word used in Gen. iii. 15, thus connecting Orion with the primeval prophecy. Like Ophiuchus, he has one leg bruised; while, with the other, he is crushing the enemy under foot. This is betokened by other stars, not identified, named Al Rai, who bruises, who breaks (as in Ce- pheus) ; and T habit (Hebrew), treading en.

The next star, (at the source of the river), is named Cursa, which means bent down. The next, y (at the second bend in the river), is called Zourac (Arabic), flowing. Other stars, not identified, are Pheat, mouth (of the river) ; and Ozha, the going forth. Here, then, we have a river flowing forth from before the glorious Orion. It runs in a serpentine course towards the lower regions, down, down, out of sight. In vain the sea monster, Cetus, strives to stop its flow. It is &quot; the river of the Judge,&quot; and speaks of that final judgment in which the wicked will be cast into the lake of fire. It was evidently originally associated with fire; for the Greek myths, though gross perversions, still so connect it. According to their fables, something went wrong with the chariot of the sun, and a universal conflagration was threatened. In the trouble, Phaeton (probably a reference to the star Pheat) was killed and hurled into this river, in which he was consumed with its fire. The whole earth suffered from such a burning heat that great disasters ensued. We see from this myth two great facts pre served in the perverted tradition, viz., judgment and fire.

AURIGA is from a Hebrew root which means a shepherd. It is a beautiful constellation of 66 stars ; one of the ist magnitude, two of the 2nd, nine of the 4th, etc. The brightest star, a (in the body of the goat), points her out as the prominent feature of the con stellation, for its name Alioth (Hebrew) means a she goat. It is known by the modern Latin name Capella, which has the same meaning. The next star, |3 (in the shepherd s right arm), is called Menkilinon, and means the band, or chain of the goats, and points out the truth that they are never more to be lost again, but to be bound, with the bands of love, to the Shepherd for evermore."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"TAURUS: (AURIGA). 135 The name of another star is Maaz, which means a flock of goats.

The Arabic A I Tauman means the same. We need not trouble ourselves with the Grecian myths, even though we can see through them the original and ancient truth. The two were both heroes of peculiar and extraordinary birth sons of Jupiter. They were supposed to appear at the head of armies ; and as they had cleared the seas of pirates, they were looked upon as the patron saints of navigation. (Hence the name of the ship in Acts xxviii. n.) They were held in high esteem both by Greeks and Romans ; and the common practice of taking oaths and of swearing by their names has descended even to our own day in the still surviving vulgar habit of swearing &quot; By Gemini ! &quot; The more ancient star-names help us to see through all these and many other myths, and to discern Him of whom they testify; even Him in His twofold nature God and Man and His two fold work of suffering and glory, and His twofold coming in humiliation and in triumph. There are 85 stars in the sign : two of the 2nd magnitude, four of the 3rd, six of the 4th, etc. The name of a (in the head of the one at our right hand) is called Apollo, which means ruler, or judge; while /3 (in the head of the other) is called Hercules, who cometh to labour, or suffer. Another star, y (in his left foot), is called A I Henah, which"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"GEMINI. 139 means hurt, wounded, or afflicted. Can we have a doubt as to what is the meaning of this double presentation ? In Ophiuchus we have the two in one person : the crushed enemy, and the wounded heel. But here the two great primeval truths are presented in two persons ; for He was &quot; two persons in one God,&quot; &quot; God and man in one Christ.&quot; As man, suffering for our redemption ; as God, glorified for our com plete salvation and final triumph. A star, e (in the centre of his body), is called Waset, which means set, and tells of Him who &quot; set His face like a flint &quot; to accomplish this mighty Herculean work ; and, when the time was come, &quot; steadfastly set His face to go &quot; to complete it. He bears in his right hand (in some pictures) a palm branch. In the one from which our illustra tion is taken, it is a club ; but both the club of this one and the bow of the other are in repose ! These united ones are neither in action nor are they preparing for action, but they are at rest and in peace after victory won. The star e (in the knee of the other, &quot; Apollo &quot;) is called Mebsuta, which means treading under feet. The names of other stars, which are not identified, have come down to us with the same testimony. One is called Propus (Hebrew), the branch, spreading; another is called A I Giauza (Arabic), the palm branch; another is named A I Dim (Arabic), the seed, or branch.

LEPUS (the Hare), THE ENEMY. The Enemy Trodden under Foot. The names of the three constellations of this Sign, as well as the pictures, are all more or less modern, as is manifest from the names being in Latin, and having no relation to the ancient names of their stars. To learn their real meaning, there fore, we must have recourse to the ancient Zodiacs. In the Persian planisphere the first constellation was pictured by a serpent. In the Denderah (Egyptian) Zodiac it is an unclean bird standing on the serpent, which is under the feet of Orion. Its name there is given as Bashti-beki. Bashti means confounded, and Beki means failing. ARATUS says, &quot;Below Orion s feet, the Hare Is chased eternally.&quot; It is a small constellation of 19 stars (all small), three of which are of the 3rd magnitude, seven of the 4th, etc. The brightest, a (in the body), has a Hebrew name, Arnebo, which means the enemy of Him that cometh. The Arabic, Arncbeth, means the same. Other stars, not identified, are Nibal, the mad; Rakis y the bound (Arabic, with a chain] Siigia, the deceiver. There can be no mistaking the voice of this united testimony.

Ix. 12), as He has said: &quot; I will tread them in Mine anger, And trample them in My fury . . . For the day of vengeance is in Mine heart, And the year of My redeemed is come.&quot; (Isa. Ixiii. 3, 4.) 2. CANIS MAJOR (The Dog), or SIRIUS (The Prince). The coming Glorious Prince of Princes (S iritis). This second constellation carries on the teaching, and tells of the glorious Prince who will thus subdue and reign. In the Denderah Zodiac he is called Apes, which means the head. He is pictured as a hawk (Naz, f%, caused to come forth, coming swiftly down). The hawk is the natural enemy of the serpent, and here it has on its head a pestle and mortar, indicating the fact that he shall crush the head of the enemy. In the Persian planisphere it is pictured as a wolf, and is called Zeeb, which in Hebrew p8|) has the same meaning. Plutarch translates it IL/ooVrr^, Leader. In Arabic it means coming quickly.

Two are of the ist magnitude, two of the 2nd, four of the 3rd, four of the 4th, etc. Of these a (in the head) is the brightest in the whole heavens ! It is called Sirius, the Prince pb&amp;gt;, Sar), as in Isa. ix. 6. Sirius * was, by the ancients, always associated with great heat. And the hottest part of the year we still call &quot; the dog days,&quot; though, through the variation as observed in different latitudes, and the precession of the equinoxes, its rising has long ceased to have any relation to those days. Virgil says that Sirius &quot; With pestilential heat infects the sky.&quot; Homer spoke of it as a star &quot;Whose burning 1 breath Taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.&quot; It is not, however, of its heat that its name speaks, but of the fact that it is the brightest of all the stars, as He of whom it witnesses is the &quot; Prince of princes,&quot; &quot;the Prince of the Kings of the earth.&quot; Though this &quot;Dog-Star&quot; came to have an ill- omened association, it was not so in more ancient times. In the ancient Akkadian it is called Kasista, which means the Leader and Prince of the heavenly host. While (as Mr. Robert Brown, Junr., points out) &quot; the Sacred Books of Persia contain many praises of the star Tistrya or Tistar (Sirius) t l the chieftain of the East. &quot;t * Our English &quot;Sir &quot; is derived from this word. \\ Etiphratean Stellar Researches."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"144 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. The next star, (in the left fore foot), speaks the same truth. It is named Mirzam, and means the prince or ruler. The star 8 (in the body) is called Wesen, the bright, the shining. The star e (in the right hind leg) is called Adhara, the glorious. Other stars, not identified, bear their witness to the same fact. Their names are Aschere (Hebrew), who shall come ; A I Shir a A I Jemeniya (Arabic), the Prince or chief of the right hand! Seir (Egyptian), the Prince; A bur (Hebrew), the mighty; A I Habor (Arabic), the mighty ; Muliphen (Arabic), the leader, the chief. Here there is no conflicting voice ; no discord in the harmonious testimony to Him whose name is called &quot; Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God . . . the Prince of Peace&quot; (Isa. ix. 6). The names of the stars have no meaning what ever as applied to an Egyptian Hawk, or a Greek Dog. But they are full of significance when we apply them to Him of whom Jehovah says : &quot; Behold, I have given Him for a witness to the people, A LEADER and commander to the people.&quot; (Isa. Iv. 4.) This is &quot; the Prince of princes &quot; (Dan. viii. 23, 25) against whom, &quot; when transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance . . . shall stand up,&quot; &quot;but he shall be broken without hand,&quot; for he shall be destroyed &quot;with the brightness of His coming&quot; (2 Thess. ii. 8).

The Egyptian name in the Denderah Zodiac is Sebak, which means conquering, victorious. It is repre sented as a human figure with a hawk s head and the appendage of a tail. This small constellation has only 14 stars accord ing to the Britannic catalogue.

THE SIGN CANCER (The Crab). Messiah s Redeemed Possessions held fast. WITH regard to the sign of CANCER, one thing is certain, that we have not got the original picture, or anything like it. It does not agree with the names either of its three constellations which have come down to us, or of its stars. In the ancient Denderah Zodiac it is represented as a Scarabcsus, or sacred beetle.* In the Zodiac of Esneh and in a Hindu Zodiac (400 B.C.) it is the same. According to the Greeks, Jupiter placed this Crab amongst the signs of the Zodiac. In Sir William Jones s Oriental Zodiac we meet with a crab, and an Egyptian Zodiac found at Rome bears also the crab in this sign. The more ancient Egyptians placed Hennannbis, or Hermes, with the head of an ibis or hawk, as the symbol of the sign now allotted to Cancer. The Denderah name is Klaria, or the cattle-folds, and in this name we have the key to the meaning of the sign, and to the subject of this chapter. * The Scarabceus, passing its early existence as a worm of the earth, and thence issuing as a winged denizen of heaven, was he!d sacred by the Egyptians as an emblem of the resurrection of the body.

The Arabic name is Al Sartan, which means who holds or binds, and may be from the Hebrew &quot;OK, to bind together (Gen. xlix. n). There is no ancient Hebrew word known for the crab. It was classed with many other unclean creatures, and would be included in the general term &quot; vermin.&quot; The Syriac, Sartano, means the same. The Greek name is Karkinos, which means holding or encircling, as does the Latin, Cancer, and hence is applied to the crab. In the word Khan, we have the traveller s rest or inn ; while Ker or Cer is the Arabic for en circling. The ancient Akkadian name of the month is Su-kul-na, the seizer or possessor of seed. The sign contains 83 stars, one of which is of the 3rd magnitude, and seven are of the 4th magni tude, and the remainder of inferior magnitudes. In the centre of the Sign there is a remarkably bright cluster of stars, so bright that they can be sometimes seen with the naked eye. It looks like a comet, and is made up of a great multitude of stars. Modern astronomers have called it the Bee hive. But its ancient name has come down to us as Praesepe, which means a multitude, offspring. . The brightest star, (in the head), is called Tegmine, holding. The star a (or a 1 and a 2 ), in the lower large claw, is called Acubene, which, in Hebrew and Arabic, means the sheltering or hiding-place.

Asellus means an Ass, and one was called Asellus Boreas, tJr northern Ass; while the other, Asellus Amir alls, is the southern Ass, The sign was afterwards known by the symbol T, which stands for these two asses.* This connects it with the Tribe of Issachar, who is said to have borne upon the Tribal standard the sign of two asses. This is doubtless the reference in Jacob s blessing (Gen. xlix. n, R.V.) : &quot; Issachar is a strong&quot; ass, Couching- down between the sheepfolds ; And he saw a resting-place that it was good ; And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became a servant under task work.&quot; Have we not here the gathering up of the teaching of this sign Messiah s redeemed possessions held fast.

The three constellations develope the truth. What is now called Ursa Minor is the Lesser Flock ; Ursa Major gives us The Sheep/old and the Sheep; while Argo, The Ship, shows the travellers and the pilgrims brought safely home all conflict over.

HE under took the mighty task of saving His people from their sins. &quot; Their Redeemer is strong &quot; (Jer. 1. 34) ; for help was laid on &quot; One that was mighty&quot; (Ps. Ixxxix. 19). And His redeemed shall come to a resting- place that is good, and to a land that is pleasant. No earthly Khan on earth affords them a home. They look for a heavenly home, and in the many mansions of the Father s house they shall find eternal rest. Here we see that sheltering home to which the names of these stars point ; where the assembled thousands (Ma alaph) shall be received into the true Klaria, even the &quot; everlasting habitations.&quot; These are now to be shown to us. i. URSA MINOR (The Little Bear). The Lesser Sheep/old. Here we come to another grievous mistake, or ignorant perversron of primitive truth, as shown in the ancient names of these two constellations. It is sufficient to point to the fact that no Bear is found in any Chaldean, Egyptian, Persian, or Indian Zodiacs, and that no bear was ever seen with such a tail ! No one who had ever seen a bear would have called attention to a tail, such as no bear ever had, by placing in its very tip the most important, won drous, and mysterious Polar Star, the central star of the heavens, round which all others revolve. The patriarchal astronomers, we may be sure, committed no such folly as this."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"CANCER: (URSA MINOR). 151 The primitive truth that there were two. or a pair of constellations is preserved ; and that of these two, one is larger, and the other smaller. But What were they? We have the clue to the answer in the name of the brightest star of the larger con stellation, which is called Dubhch. Now Dubhch means a herd of animals. In Arabic, Dubah means cattle. In Hebrew, &quot;ll 1 !, Dohvcr, is a fold ; and hence in Chaldee it meant wealth. The Hebrew K?^, Dohveh, means rest or security; and certainly there is not much of either to be found or enjoyed with bears ! The word occurs in Deut. xxxiii. 25: &quot;As thy days so shall thy strength be.&quot; The Revised Version gives in the margin, &quot; So shall thy rest or security be.&quot; This accords with what we have already seen under &quot;CANCER&quot;: &quot;Couching down between the sheep- folds,* he saw a resting-place that it was good.&quot; Here are the two Sheepfolds, then ; the Greater fold, and Lesser ; and here is the rest and security which the flocks will find therein. But in Hebrew there is a word very similar in sound, though not in spelling ^ or nn&amp;gt; dohv, which means a bear! So we find in Arabic dub; Persian, decb and dob. We can see, therefore, how the Hebrew Dohvcr, a fold, and Dohv, a bear, were confused ; and how the Arabic Dubah, cattle, might easily have been mistaken by the Greeks, and understood as a bear. The constellation, which we must therefore call THE LESSER SHEEPFOLD, contains 24 stars, viz., one of the 2nd magnitude, two of the 3rd, four of the 4th, etc. * The word is so rendered in Judges v. 16, in A.V."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"152 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. The brightest star, a (at the point of the tail), is the most important in the whole heavens. It is named A I Ruccaba, which means the turned or ridden on, and is to-day the Polar or central star, which does not revolve in a circle as does every other star, but remains, apparently, fixed in its position. But though the star does not revolve like the others, the central point in the heavens is very slowly but steadily moving. When these constellations were formed the Dragon possessed this important point, and the star a, in Draco, marked this central point. But, by its gradual recession, that point is sufficiently near this star Ruccaba, in the Lesser Shccpfold, for it to be what is called &quot; the Polar Star.&quot; But, how could this have been known five or six thousand years ago ? How could it have been known when it received its name, which means the turned or ridden on ? That it was known is clear: so likewise was it made known in the written Word that the original blessing included not merely the multiplication of the seed of faithful Abraham, but it was then added, &quot;And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies&quot; (Gen. xxii. 17). This star was called by the Greeks Kuy&roupo, the &quot; Cynosure&quot; ARATUS seems to apply this term to the whole of the seven stars of the Lesser Bear. Mr. Robert Brown, Junr., shows* that KuvoVoupa, once supposed to be Hellenic, is non-Hellenic, and possibly Euphratean in origin, from a word which he trans literates An-nas-sur-ra, and renders it, &quot;as it literally means, high in rising, i.e., in heavenly position.&quot; Is * Euphratean Stellar Researches, pp. 8, 9."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"CANCER: (URSA MINOR). 153 not this the primitive truth of the Revelation ? Will not this Lesser Fold be high, yea, the highest in heavenly position ? The Polar Star has been removed from the Dragon, and is now in the Lesser Fold ; and when the Dragon shall be cast down from the heavens, the heavenly seed will be safely folded there. But this is the Lesser Shccpfold. These are they who all through the ages have been &quot; partakers of the heavenly call ing,&quot; who desired a better country, that is, a heavenly ; wherefore God &quot; hath prepared for them a city,&quot; the city for which Abraham himself &quot; looked.&quot; This was no earthly city, but a city &quot; whose builder and maker is God&quot; (Heb. xi. 10-16). These have always been a smaller company, a &quot; little flock,&quot; but the kingdom shall be theirs, even the kingdom of God, for which they now look and wait. They have not yet &quot; received the promises ; but, having seen them afar off&quot; by faith, they &quot;were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth&quot; (Heb. xi. 13). Their Messiah has accomplished &quot; the redemption of the purchased possession,&quot; and in due time the redeemed will inherit it, &quot; unto the praise of His glory&quot; (Eph. i. 13). The bright star is named Kochab, which means waiting Him who comcth. Other stars, not identified, are named Al Pherkadain (Arabic), which means the calves, or the young (as in Deut. xxii. 6), the redeemed assembly. Another, Al Gedi, means the kid.

This brings us to 2. URSA MAJOR (The Great Bear). The Fold and the Flock. Of these it is written : &quot; But in Mount Zion there shall be those that escape, And it shall be holy : And the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.&quot; (Obad. 17-19, R.v.) It is a large and important constellation, con taining 87 stars, of which one is of the ist magni tude, four of the 2nd, three of the 3rd, ten of the 4th, etc. It always presents a splendid appearance, and is perhaps, therefore, the best known of all the constellations. In the Book of Job (ix. 9, and xxxviii. 31, 32) it is mentioned under the name of Ash. &quot; Canst thou guide Ash and her offspring?&quot; which is ren dered in the A.V., &quot; Arcturus and his sons,&quot; and in the R.V., &quot;The Bear with her train &quot; (marg., &quot;sows&quot;)."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"CANCER: (URSA MAJOR). 155 The Arabs still call it A I Naish, or Annaish, the assembled together, as sheep in a fold. The ancient Jewish commentators interpreted Ash as the seven stars of this constellation. They are called by others Septentriones, which thus became the Latin word for North. The brightest star, a (in the back), is named Dubhe, which, as we have seen, means a herd of animals, or a flock, and gives its name to the whole constellation. The star |3 (below it) is named Merach (Hebrew), the flock (Arabic, purchased). The star y (on the left of $) is called Phaeda, or Phaeda, meaning visited, guarded, or numbered, as a flock ; for His sheep, like the stars, are both num bered and named. (See Psalm cxlvii. 4.) The star e is called Alioth, a name we have had in Auriga, meaning a she goat. The star (in the middle of the tail) is called Mizar, separate or small, and close to it A I Cor, the Lamb (known as &quot;g&quot;). The star TJ (at the end of the so-called tail) is named Bend Naish (Arabic), the daughters of the as sembly. It is also called Al Raid, the assembled. The star i (in its right foot) is called Talitha.

There is not one discordant voice in the rich abundance of this testimony. We have nothing to do here with the Grecian myths about bears or wild boars. We see only the innumerable seed gathered by Him who scattered (Jer. xxxi. 10). Many are the Scriptures we might quote which speak of this gathering and assembling of the long- scattered flock. It is written as plainly in the Book, as it is in the heavens. The prophecies of this gathering are as conspicuous in the Word of God as the &quot; Seven Stars &quot; are in the sky. It is difficult even to make a selection from the wealth of such promises ; but few are more beautiful than that in Ezek. xxxiv. 12-16 : &quot; As a shepherd seeketh out his flock In the day that he is among- his sheep that are scattered; So will I seek out my sheep, And will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. And I will bring- them out from the people, And gather them from the countries, And will bring them to their own land, And feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers And in all the inhabited places of the country.

It is of this judgment with which this book, and indeed the whole Revelation, ends, in the next and final chapter. But before we come to that we have one more picture in the third constellation of this Sign, which combines the first two in one. 3. ARGO (The Ship). The Pilgrims safe at Home. This is the celebrated ship of the Argonauts, of which HOMER sung nearly ten centuries before Christ. Sir Isaac Newton puts the expedition of the Argo nauts shortly after the death of Solomon (about 975 B.C.). While Dr. Blair s chronology puts it at 1236 B.C. Whatever fables have gathered round the story there can bo no doubt as to its great antiquity. Some think that the story had its origin in name, as well as in fact, from the Ark of Noah and its mysterious journey. All that is clear, when divested of mythic details, is that the sailors in that ship,, after all their dangers, and toils, and battles were"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"158 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. over, came back victorious to their own shores. The &quot;golden fleece,&quot; for which .the Argonauts went in search, tells of a treasure that had been lost. &quot; Jason,&quot; the great captain, tells of Him who re covered it from the Serpent, which guarded it with ever-watchful eye, when none else was able to approach it. And thus, through the fables and myths of the Greeks, we can see the light primeval shine ; and this light, once seen, lights up this Sign and its constellations, so that their teaching cannot be misunderstood. ARATUS sings of Argo : &quot; Stern-foremost hauled ; no mark of onward-speeding- ship.

One half of the southern meridians is occupied with these galleys and their construction and decorations.

There are 64 stars in Argo (reckoning by the Britannic catalogue) ; one of the ist magnitude, six of the 2nd, nine of the 3rd, nine of the 4th, etc. Only a small part of the ship s poop is visible in Britain.

CHAPTER IV. THE SIGN LEO (The Lion). Messiah s Consummated Triumph. HERE we come to the end of the circle. We began with Virgo, and we end with Leo. No one who has followed our interpretation can doubt that we have here the solving of the Riddle of the Sphinx. For its Head is Virgo and its Tail is Leo ! In Leo we reach the end of the Revelation as inspired in the Word of God ; and it is the end as written in the heavens. BAILLY (Astronomy) says, &quot;the Zodiac must have been first divided when the sun at the summer solstice was in i Virgo, where the woman s head joins the Lion s tail.&quot; As to its antiquity there can be no doubt. JAMIESON says, &quot; the Lion does not seem to have been placed among the Zodiacal symbols, because Hercules was fabled to have slain the Nemean Lion. It would seem, on the contrary, that Hercules, who represented the Sun, was said to have slain the Nemean Lion, because Leo was already a Zodiacal sign. Hercules flourished 3,000 years ago, and consequently posterior to the period when the summer solstice accorded with Leo &quot; (Celestial Atlas, p. 40). There is no confusion about this sign. In the ancient Zodiacs of Egypt (Denderah, Esneh) and India we find the Lion. The same occurs on the"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"LEO. 163 Mithraic monuments, where Leo is passant, as he is in Moor s Hindu, and Sir William Jones s Oriental Zodiacs.

Its Egyptian name is Pi Mentekeon, which means the pouring out. This is no pouring out or inundation of the Nile, but it is the pouring out of the cup of Divine wrath on that Old Serpent. This is the one great truth of the closing chapter . of this last Book. It is THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH AROUSED FOR THE RENDING OF THE PREY. His feet are over the head of Hydra, the great Serpent, and just about to descend upon it and crush it. The three constellations of the Sign complete this final picture : 1. Hydra, the old Serpent destroyed. 2. Crater, the Cup of Divine wrath poured out upon him. 3. Corvus, the Bird of prey devouring him. The Denderah picture exhibits all four in one.

Knem means who conquers, or is con quered, referring to the victory over the serpent. The woman s name is Her-ua, great enemy, referring to the great enemy for which her two cups are prepared and intended. The Hebrew name of the sign is Arieh, which means the Lion. There are six Hebrew words for Lion,* and this one is used of the Lion hunting down his prey. The Syriac name is Aryo, the rending Lion, and the Arabic is Al A sad; both mean a lion coming vehemently, leaping forth as a flame ! It is a beautiful constellation of 95 stars, two of which are of the ist magnitude, two of the 2nd, six of the 3rd, thirteen of the 4th. The brightest star, a (on the Ecliptic), marks the heart of the Lion (hence sometimes called by the moderns, Cor Leonis, the heart of the Lion). Its ancient name is Rcgulus, which means treading under foot. The next star, 0, also of the ist magnitude (in the tip of the tail), is named Denebola, the Judge or Lord who cometh.

All is harmony, and all the names unite in pointing us to what is written of &quot; the Lion of the Tribe of Judah.&quot; And why is Messiah thus called ? Because it is applied to Him in Rev. v. 5 in connection with His rising up for judgment : and because the Lion is known to have been always borne upon the standard of Judah, whether in the wilderness (Num. ii.) or in aftertimes. In Israel s dying blessing the prophetic words foretold of Judah : &quot;Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; . . . Judah is a lion s whelp; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up. He stooped down, he couched as a lion, And as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?&quot; (Gen. xlix. 8, 9.) In the prophecy of Balaam (Num. xxiv. 8, 9), we read : &quot; He shall eat up the nations his enemies, And shall break their bones, And pierce them through with his arrows, He couched, he lay down as a lion, And as a great lion ; who shall stir him up ? &quot;"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"166 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS.

The lion hath roared, who will not fear?&quot; (Amos iii. 4, 8.) When &quot; the Lion of the tribe of Judah &quot; is roused up for the rending, the Spirit describes the scene in Isa. xlii. 13 : &quot; The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, He shall stir up jealousy like a man of war; He shall cry, yea, roar; He shall prevail against His enemies.&quot; And this is what is meant and included when the Elder says for John s comfort, &quot; the Lion of the Tribe of Judah hath prevailed&quot; and hence, is &quot;worthy ... to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing&quot; (Rev. v.). Whether we look, therefore, at the primeval Reve lation in the heavens, or at the later Revelation in the Word, the story is one and the same. And what we see of Leo and his work in both, we find developed and described in the three con stellations of the Sign. i. HYDRA (The Serpent). The Old Serpent Destroyed. The time has at length come for the fulfilment of the many prophecies pictured in the heavens : and"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"LEO: (HYDRA AND CRATER). 167 in its three final constellations we see the consum mation of them all in the complete destruction of the Old Serpent, and all his seed, and all his works. It is the special work of the Messiah, as &quot; the Lion of the tribe of Judah,&quot; to trample it under foot. It is pictured as the female serpent (Hydra), the mother and author of all evil. Hydra has the signi ficant meaning, he is abhorred! It is an immense constellation extending for above 100 degrees from east to west, beneath the Virgin, the Lion, and the Crab. It is composed of 60 stars ; one of the 2nd magnitude, three of the 3rd, twelve of the 4th, etc. The brightest star, a (in the heart of the Serpent), is sometimes called by the moderns Cor Hydra on that account. Its ancient name is Al Phard (Arabic), which means the separated, put away. An other is called Al Drian, the abhorred. Another star is named Minchar al Sugia, the piercing of the deceiver. There can be no doubt as to what is taught by the constellation of Hydra, nor is it necessary to quote the Scriptures concerning the destruction of the Serpent. We pass on to consider the second. 2. CRATER (The Cup). The Cup of Divine wrath Poured out upon Him. &quot; God is the Judge. He putteth down one, and setteth up another, FOR IN THE HAND OF THE LflRD THERE IS A CUP,"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"l68 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS.

This is no fabled wine-cup of Bacchus ; but it is &quot; The cup of His indignation &quot; (Rev. xiv. 10) ; &quot; The cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath &quot; (Rev. xvi. 19). This is what we see set forth in this con stellation. The Cup is wide and deep, and fastened on by the stars to the very body of the writhing serpent. The same stars which are in the foot of the Cup form part of the body of Hydra, and are reckoned as belonging to both constellations. This Cup has the significant number of thirteen stars (the number of Apostacy). The two Al Ches (a), which means the Cup, and (|3) determine the bottom of the Cup. 3. CORVUS (The Raven). The Birds of Prey devouring the Serpent. Here is the final scene of judgment. We have had Zeeb, the Wolf ; now we have Oreb, the Raven. Her-na is its name in the Denderah Zodiac.

The bright star a (in the eye) is called Al Chibar (Arabic), joining together, from the Hebrew Chiba (Num. xxiii. 8), which means accursed. This star, then, tells of the curse inflicted. The star 3 (in the right wing) is called Al Goreb (Arabic), from Hebrew Oreb, the Raven. A third star is named Minchar al Gorab (Arabic), and means the Raven tear ing to pieces. This brings us to the end. There is nothing beyond this. Nothing remains to be told. We know from the Word of God that &quot;The eye that mocketh at his father, And despiseth to obey his mother, The ravens of the valley shall pick it out.&quot; (Prov. xxx. 17.) We remember how David said to the Giant Goliah a type of this enemy of God s people &quot; I will smite thee, and take thy head from thee ; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth&quot; (i Sam. xvii. 46). When the great day of this judgment comes, an angel standing in the sun will cry &quot;to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come, and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God ; that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great&quot; (Rev. xix. 17, 18)."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"iyO THE WITNESS OF THE STARS.

It is all summed up in Jer. xxv. 30-33 : &quot;Therefore prophesy against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, And utter His voice from His holy habitation; He shall mightily roar upon His habitation ; He shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, Against all the inhabitants of the earth.

It was religious men, not the common rabble, whom the Old Serpent made use of to wound Him in the heel. The Devil could not touch Him himself; he must use them as his instruments ; and it was only religious men that could be so used.

It is true of the Scriptures, as it will be of the heavenly Jerusalem &quot;THE LAMB is THE LIGHT THEREOF&quot; (Rev. xxi. 23). The Church of Rome has been used of the great enemy to rob the Lamb of God of His promised glory. JEROME, in his Latin translation of the Bible (405 A.D.), wrote &quot; ipse&quot; HE, in Gen. iii. 15, as the &quot; bruiser of the serpent s head.&quot; And, in spite of the fact that JEROME himself so quotes it in his com mentary, and that it is masculine in all the other ancient translations of the Bible, Rome has first corrupted JEROME S Vulgate by changing the &quot; e &quot; into &quot; a,&quot; and putting &quot; ipsa &quot; (she) instead of &quot; ipse &quot; (He) ; then she has so translated this corruption and per petuated this perversion in various languages ! So that in all her versions, in her pictures and statues, in the decree of Pope Pius IX., which promulgated the dogma of the u immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary,&quot; this lie of the Old Serpent has been foisted on unnumbered thousands of deluded souls, who have thereby been deceived into putting Mary in the place of Jesus; the &quot; co-Redemptress &quot; in the place of the Redeemer ; the creature in the place of the Creator ; the woman in the place of the woman s Seed ; until the outcome is reached by emblazoning, in huge gilt"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"LEO: (CORVUS). 173 letters, on the outside of a large church in Rathmines, Dublin, &quot; MARI/E PECCATORUM REFUGIUM,&quot; to Mary the Refuge of Sinners !

This is done on the plea of ex pediency, in order that these versions might come to many as Protestant truth instead of Popish error ; but thus misleading those who were seeking for light, while confirming Papists in their darkness. But through all the &quot; wisdom of the Serpent &quot; we can detect his lie. It is very thinly veiled, and the Old Serpent has not succeeded in blinding the eyes which the Spirit of God has opened.

The Saros shows no break, and no interruption ; nor does the character of the eclipse surfer any abrupt change. The district over which it is visible moves in a slow and orderly fashion from occurrence to occurrence over the earth s surface. Now the important point is this, that if we take the prophetic reckoning of 360 days to the year, we have the following significant Biblical numbers : In the first place, we already have the f jo Sari divided into two portions of 33 + 37. A perfect cycle is accomplished in 33 Sari, or 595 years, when the eclipse, by a series of unbroken * These facts are kindly supplied by Mr. E. W. Maunder, of the Royal Obser vatory, Greenwich, who gives another example, as follows : In A. D. 586 there were two solar eclipses : on June 22 (Julian) the old and dying eclipse, and on July 22 (Julian) another (the new one). A Saros (viz. 18 years and II days) earlier there was only one, viz. on June II (Julian), A.D. 568, there being no eclipse on July 1 1 of that year. The last appearance of this new eclipse, which first appeared on July 22, 586, was on August 28 (Greg.), 1848, so that it had a life history of 70 Sari, amounting to 1,262 years 36 days (after the Julian dates have been corrected to correspond to the Gregorian). Thus the eclipse that died, so to speak, on August 28 (Greg.), 1848, first appeared on July 22 (Julian) in A. D. 586. See an important article on Eclipses by Mr. E. W.

There must be something to be learned in the occurrence and repetition of these heavenly cycles, which for nearly 6,000 years have been constantly repeated in the heavens, especially when we find these same numbers very prominently presented in the Word of God in connection with the fulfilment of prophecy.

Apocalypse the half of this great period presented as &quot;days&quot; (1,260), as &quot;months&quot; (42), and as &quot;times,&quot; or years (3!). Futurists believe that these &quot;days&quot; and &quot; months,&quot; etc., interpret for us the purposes and counsels of God as connected with &quot; the time of the end,&quot; and as meaning literal &quot;days&quot; and &quot;months,&quot; etc. Historicists take these terms, and themselves inter pret the numbers, in the sense of a &quot; day &quot; being put for a. year, and they believe that these &quot;1,260 days&quot; will be fulfilled as 1,260 years. One party boldly and ungraciously charges the other with teaching &quot; The Fallacies of Futurism&quot; ; while the other might well retort with a reference to the Heresies of Historicism. But is there any necessity for the existence of two hostile camps ? Is it not possible that there may be what we may call a long fulfilment in years ? And is it not more than probable that in the time of the end, the crisis, there will be also a short and literal ful filment in days ? We firmly believe that there will be this literal and short fulfilment. We believe that when God says &quot;days,&quot; He means days; and that when He says &quot;42 months,&quot; He means months, and not 1,260 years. In all the passages referred to by historicists in sup port of what is called &quot;the year-day theory,&quot; the Holy Spirit uses these words &quot;days&quot; and &quot;years&quot; in the sense of days and years. In the two particular instances of Israel s wanderings (Num. xiv. 34), and Ezekiel s prophesying (Ezek. iv. 6), He chooses to"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"FOR SIGNS AND FOR SEASONS. 183 take the number of days as denoting the same number of years ; but He does not tell us that we are to do the same in other cases ! He only asserts His sove reignty by thus acting, while we only show our pre sumption in taking His sovereign act as a genera] principle. But while fully believing in the short fulfilment, we are quite prepared to admit that there may be a long fulfilment as well; and that, owing to the wondrous harmony, and marvellous correspondence, and infinite wisdom of all the works and ways of God, there may be a fulfilment, or rather a &quot;filment,&quot; if we may coin the word, in years, which will be only a foreshadowing of the literal /^/-filnient afterwards to take place in days. If historicists will allow us this liberty as to inter pretation, and permit us to believe that God means what He says, we will give them some remarkable evidence in support of their views, by way of appli cation. In other words, if they will allow us to in terpret &quot; days &quot; as meaning days, we will gladly allow them, and be at one with them, in applying them to years. So that while we believe the interpretation to mean &quot; days,&quot; and to teach a short fulfilment at the time of the end, we will thankfully admit an applica tion which shall take these days as foreshowing a long fulfilment in years. In applying, then, these significant numbers (42, 70, 594, 666, 1,260, and 2,520) to years, from what point or date shall we begin to reckon the &quot;times of the Gentiles&quot; (Luke xxi. 24) ?

That there are &quot;seven times&quot; of Gentile dominion is more than intimated by the sym bolic episode in the life of Nebuchadnezzar as recorded in Dan. iv. ; and that there are &quot;seven times&quot; of Israel s punishment is clearly stated in Lev. xxvi. 18. &quot; Seven times,&quot; according to the Historicist school of interpreters, are equal to 2,520 years. Instead of asking where they begin, let us first note the fact that it is duration which is emphasised in the Scriptures rather than chronology ; and look at the duration of these years independently of, and before we attempt to fix, their beginning and ending. In Daniel ii. and vii. it is shown first to Nebu chadnezzar in a &quot; dream,&quot; and afterwards to God s servant the prophet in a &quot;vision,&quot; that Israel was to be put on one side and become &quot; Lo-Ammi &quot; (not My people), while government was to be put into the hands of the Gentiles. Jerusalem was the central point of both these great and solemn facts. That is to say, during 2,520 years, while Jerusalem should remain in the power of the Gentiles, Israel could be &quot; no more a nation &quot; in possession of their land and city. We know, as a matter of fact, that to-day Jeru salem is in the hands of the Turks, and that it is still &quot; trodden down of the Gentiles.&quot; If we ask how long it shall continue to be &quot; trodden down &quot; ? how long it will be before Israel shall again possess their city and their land ? the answer brings us at once to the heart of our subject."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"FOR SIGNS AND FOR SEASONS. 185 In seeking to determine both duration and chrono logy, it is necessary to plant our feet on sure ground. To do this, let us take a point on which all are agreed. There is one date which is universally accepted ; and concerning which the evidence is unquestioned. ABU OBEIDA, the Mahommedan General, laid siege to Jerusalem towards the close of 636 A.D. The city was then occupied by the Romans, who held out for four months. When they capitulated, the Patri arch SOPIIROXIUS obtained a clause in the treaty giving security to the inhabitants, and requiring the ratifica tion of OMAR himself. OMAR, who had therefore to be sent for, arrived some six months afterwards, and the delay caused the actual delivering up of the city to take place early in the autumn of A.D. 637.* The year A.D. 636-7 is therefore the accepted date of the passing over of Jerusalem from the Romans to the Turks. OMAR seems to have stayed in the city only about ten days, during which he must have given his in structions for the erection of the Mosque on the site of the Temple. This Mosque, therefore, stands as the sign and the symbol of the treading down of Jerusalem, and while it remains, those times of tread ing down cannot be considered as fulfilled. How steady was Israel s decadence from Nebu chadnezzar to OMAR ! Nothing would exceed that darkest moment in Israel s history, when Israel was * This is the date which concerns only .the City of Jerusalem.

Thus OMAR becomes the great central point of the 2,520 years, whether reckoned as Lunar, Zodiacal, or Solar, dividing them equally into two portions of 1,260 years.* Having thus fixed the central date, which already points forward to the end, let us go back and find the starting point, that we may the better understand the end. When Daniel was explaining to Nebuchadnezzar his mysterious dream, he said, &quot; Thou art this head * This date 636-7 is a great and important central date, whether we reckon backwards or forwards ; whether we reckon them as Lunar, Zodiacal (360 days), or Solar (365 days) years. If we take Lunar years (=1222% Solar) reckoning backward, we get to 587 B.C., the very date of the destruction of the Temple by Nebuchadnezzar. reckoning forward, we get to 1860 A. D., the very date of the European intervention in the Lebanon, which has brought the Eastern Question into its present prominent position. If we take Zodiacal years (=1242 Solar) reckoning backward we get to 6oS B.C., the date of the battle of Car- chemish (2 Chrou. xxxv. 20), when Babylon completed the conquest of Assyria, and became supreme ; utterly shattering all the hope which Israel had in Egypt. reckoning forward brings us to 1879 A.D., when, by the Treaty of Berlin, Ottoman power received a blow from which it has never recovered, and which has prepared the way for its extinction. If we take Solar years, then reckoning backward, we get to B.C. 624 (A.M. 3376), the beginning of the Babylonian kingdom, the &quot;head of gold.&quot; reckoning fonvard we get to 1896-7 A. D., which is yet future. These reckonings in their beginnings and endings form an introversion, or Epanodos, thus : 587 ) 6oS 1-3.C. dates increasing. 624) iSoo j 1879 -A.

(Dan. ii. 38). This moment is popularly, but erroneously, supposed to mark the commence ment of the Babylonian kingdom the first of these four great Gentile powers. But Daniel spoke of what ALREADY existed, and was explaining the then condition of things. He said, &quot; God hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory&quot; (Dan. ii. 37). The kingdom of Babylon had already been in existence for more than thirty years, for its king had destroyed Jerusalem and burnt the Temple with fire, and brought away many captives, amongst whom was Daniel and his companions. The opening words of the book make this very clear. The monumental history of Babylon, as now dug up, shows that before this it had been sometimes tributary to, and sometimes almost independent of, Assyria. In A.M. 3352, after a severe struggle with Assurbanipal, the Assyrian king, Babylon was once more subdued, and its king setting fire to his palace perished in the flames. After that there was peace for twenty-two years, during which time Kandalanu governed Babylon in succession to Sumas-sum-ukin, a son of Assurbanipal. In A.M. 33/5 (i.e. B.C. 627),* another revolt broke out, and the Assyrian king sent a general of great ability to quell it. His name was Nabu-pal-user (which means Ncbo protects his son). He put down * These dates are those furnished by the Monuments, as given by Dr. Budge, of the British Museum, in his Babylonian Life and History, R.T.S., 1885.

He shortly after wards, in A.M. 3376, himself rebelled, and made himself King of Babylon. Associating with him his son Nebuchadnezzar, they commenced a campaign against Assurbanipal, which ended in the fall of Nineveh and the complete subjugation of Assyria. The kingdom of Babylon, thus commencing in B.C. 625,* became the first great Gentile kingdom as foretold in Daniel. There is practically no question, now, as to this date. The actual duration of the three kingdoms that followed Babylon, Medo-Persia, and Greece, may not perhaps be so accurately determined. Their total duration is known, because it is fixed by a known date at the other end, but it might introduce controversial matter if we attempted to assign to them their exact relative duration. Probably they were, roughly : Babylon about go years ; Medo-Persia about 200 years ; Greece about 304 years. We believe these to be fairly proportionate,! but whether they are or not, their total amount must have been 594 years, because the undisputed date of the battle of ACTIUM, by which Augustus became the head of the Roman Empire, was September B.C. 31. * In adjusting the A.M. and B.C. dates, the latter are always apparently one year in advance of the former, because B.C. 4000 was A.M. I, and B.C. 3999 was A.M. 2. Hence A.M. 3376 is not B.C. 624, but it is B.C. 625. f Cyrus took Babylon, according to the Monuments, iu the I7th year of Nabonidus, B.C. 539.

From this it appears that 1896-7 A.D. would mark the fulfilment, and complete the duration, of &quot;times of the Gentiles.&quot; The above reckoning has the following advantages over all previous historicist interpretations : 1. Controverted dates are excluded. 2. The whole period of 2520 years is dealt with, instead of only the latter half (1260), as is usually the case. 3. It confines these &quot; times &quot; to the one place where the Lord Himself put them, viz., &quot;JERUSALEM.&quot; He said, &quot;Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.&quot; These &quot; times,&quot; therefore, are confined to Jerusalem. This &quot; treading down &quot; is confined to Jerusalem. It is not the city of Rome that is to be trodden down for 1260 years. Why, then, should these &quot;times&quot; be separated from what is characteristic of their duration, and applied to Rome, papal or imperial ? Why should historicists search for some act of em perors or popes in the early part of the seventh century in order to add it to 1260, so as to find some terminal date in or near our own times ! * We claim that the Lord Himself has joined these &quot; times of the Gentiles&quot; with the city of &quot;Jerusalem,&quot; and we say, &quot; What, therefore, God hath joined together, let not man put asunder&quot; (Matt. xix. 6). * While the premisses of the Historicist school arc thus streugtheued, their con clusions are shown to be erroneous."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"FOR SIGNS AND FOR SEASONS. , 1 When Jesus spoke of this treading down, it looks as though it were then still future ; for He said, &quot; Jerusalem shall be trodden down,&quot; etc. The occu pation of Jerusalem by Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, was for purposes of government rather than for a wanton treading down. Government on the earth was committed unto them. But when Jerusalem passed from the government of the Roman Empire into the hands of the Turks, it could then be said, in a very special sense, to be &quot; trodden down.&quot; For of any government worthy of the name there has been none ; and of desolation and desecration the city has been full. Under the feeble rule of the Turks, all the Gentiles seem to have combined in laying waste the holy city. Though Jews are returning thither in ever-increas ing numbers, they are only strangers there. They have as yet no independent position, nor can they make any treaties. But when these &quot; times &quot; shall end, it means that they will have a position of sufficient independence to be able to make a treaty or league with the coming Prince (Dan. ix. 27) ; and then the course of events will bring on another treading down of 1260 literal &quot;days,&quot; which will thus have had a fore-shadowing fulfilment in years !

They refer only to the end of the Gentile possession of Jerusalem, and to the settlement of the Jews in their own city and land. These &quot; times and seasons &quot; have nothing what ever to do with &quot; the Church of God&quot; (i Thess. v. i). The mystical Body of Christ, whenever its members are complete, &quot; will be taken up to meet the Lord the Head of the Body in the air, so to be ever with the Lord&quot; (i Thess. iv. 15-17). This glorious event has nothing to do with any earthly sign or circumstance, so far as the members of this mystical Body are concerned. * And cause sacrifice and oblation to cease (Daii. ix. 27).

We are not referring to what is commonly and erroneously called &quot;the end of the world.&quot; We are merely pointing out that the end of Gentile dominion over Jerusalem is drawing near ! And we cannot close our eyes to the marvellous manner in which the veil is being removed from Jewish hearts : to the change which has come over the Jewish nation in its attitude towards Christ and Christianity, chiefly, under God, through the unparalleled circulation of more than a quarter of a million copies of a new translation of the New Testament into He brew, by the late Isaac Salkinson, published by the Trinitarian Bible Society, and freely distributed by the Mildmay Mission to the Jews : to the Pales tine literature which has sprung up amongst the Jews in recent years : to the persecutions in various countries which are stirring their nest, and setting the nation in motion : to the organized emigration to Argentina, which its promoters avowedly speak of as &quot; a nursery ground for Palestine&quot; (Daily Graphic, March loth, 1892) : to the railways completed and in course of construction in the Holy Land : to the numerous Societies and their branches which have permeated the whole nation, which, while having various names, have only one object &quot; the colonisa tion of Palestine.&quot; When we put these events side by side with the teaching of the heavens as to the &quot; cycles &quot; or appointed times, we are merely showing how S. 1005.

Nor are we absolutely naming a definite year or day even for these Palestine events. After all, they can be only approximate, for man has so misused every gift that God has ever given him, that even with such wondrous heavenly time-keepers he cannot really tell you what year it is ! And, besides this loss of reckoning, there is confusion as to the com mencement of the A.D. era, which makes absolute accuracy between the A.M., B.C., and A.D. dates impossible. Added to this, there is another point to be borne in mind, viz., that when the &quot;times of the Gentiles&quot; shall end, Jewish independence need not be either immediate or complete! For when Nebuchadnezzar began his kingdom of Babylon in A.M. 3376 (B.C. 625), the Jews, though in their land and city, were not independent. Nebu chadnezzar went to and fro to Jerusalem, and put down and set up whom he would ; and it was not till some thirty years afterwards that he destroyed the City and Temple and made the people captives. So, likewise, in the time of the end, there may be an epanodos.

So that while we name the dates 1896-7 as being significant, we are not &quot; fixing dates &quot; in the ordinary sense of the term, but merely pointing out some of &quot; the signs of the times,&quot; concerning which we ought not to be ignorant. The true interpretation will in any case still remain, and will surely be literally fulfilled in its own time. The Word of God will be vindicated ; its pro phetic truth will be verified ; God Himself will be glorified ; and His people saved with an everlasting salvation. Meanwhile the members of His Body will &quot; wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come&quot; (i Thess. i. 10).

They will &quot; look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ,&quot; from heaven, believing that there is no hope either for &quot; the Jew, the Gentile, or the Church of God,&quot; or for a groaning creation, until &quot; the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord ; and He shall send Jesus Christ, whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God N 2"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"ig6 THE WITNESS OF THE STARS. hath spoken by the mouth of ALL HIS HOLY PROPHETS SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN&quot; (Acts iii. 19-21). &quot; The world is sick, and yet not unto death ; There is for it a day of health in store ; From lips of love there comes the healing- breath, The breath of Him who all its sickness bore, And bids it rise to strength and beauty evermore.

And just as in the constellation above it, the Serpent is struggling with the man, while at the same time it is stretching out its neck to seize the crown,* so here the Scorpion, while trying to sting the same man in the heel, is stretching out its claws to seize the altar.

And thus the Scorpion monopolised two Signs ; its body one, and its claws the other. This led to the mistake of SERVIUS, the intelligent commentator on ViRGiL,f that &quot; the Chaldean Zodiac consisted of but eleven con stellations.&quot; We now know that there were twelve Signs, and the mistake is thus explained.

He speaks of &quot;The brig-ht one of those at the end of the southern Claw.&quot; (It is named Zuben el Genubi and now marked a). &quot;The one more northerly than it, and dimmer&quot; (now named /). &quot;The bright one of those at the end of the northern Claw&quot; (named Zuben el Chemali, and now marked )3). &quot; The one in front of it and dim &quot; (8). &quot;The one in the middle of the southern Claw&quot; (i i). &quot; The one in the middle of the northern Claw &quot; (now marked &amp;lt;y). &quot; The one behind it in the same Claw &quot; (if). &quot; The foremost of the three more northerly than the northern Claws&quot; (i f). &quot;The southern one of the two hindmost&quot; (). &quot; The hindmost of the three between the Claws &quot; (one of the stars now marked K or A). &quot;The northern of the two remaining and preceding ones :r (?) &quot;The southern one of them &quot; (n).

This corruption of the primitive teaching of the ALTAR, shows how the enemy attempted to seize on the Atonement, bring in &quot; the way of Cain,&quot; and substitute human merit for the atoning sacrifice of Christ ; thus perverting the truth at its fountain head. Just as in Gen. -iii. we have the woman s promised Seed in conflict with the Enemy, so in Gen. iv. we see the Scorpion s claws &quot;the way of Cain&quot; in conflict with &quot; the way of God.&quot; There can be but little doubt, therefore, that the first Sign of the Zodiac was VIRGO, the second was the ALTAR, and the third was the SCORPION. The lesson which they teach is clear : The Seed of the woman (VIRGO), who was to come as a child, should be a sacrifice (the ALTAR) for the sins of His people ; endure a great conflict with the enemy (SCORPIO), in which He should be wounded in the heel ; but should in the end crush and tread the enemy under foot."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"w&e ^\\ *&amp;gt; tf-rt&amp;lt;rj2&amp;lt;@r"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"WORKS BY THE REV.

The plan is exhibited on which the Psalm is actually constructed, showing that the words &quot;which the Holy Ghost teacheth&quot; are not written with the imperfection which pertains to man s writings, but with an order, method, perfection and precision peculiar to them selves, and not found in any mere human composition.
