Additionally, there are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The energy of the Planets influences our everyday lives. That said, it's what we do with this energy that truly matters. The more recently-recognized Planets (Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) do not dilute the message of the other Planets, they simply add to our spectrum of experience. Many consider Jupiter to be the most benevolent of the Planets, with Venus a close second. The Sun, Moon and Mercury also tend to cast a golden glow. On the flip side of things is Saturn's hard energy, followed by the sharpness of Mars, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The Planets move at varying speeds, some faster (the Moon) and some slower (Pluto), depending on how close they are to the Sun. The fastest Planets (Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars) are commonly referred to as the inner Planets and speak to the inner self. The social Planets are Jupiter and Saturn, while the outer Planets (Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) fix their gaze on the external world. Each of the Planets exerts its most powerful energy over the Sign it rules. This is also referred to as the Sign of its dignity. There is a second Sign with which each Planet interacts well, known as the Sign of its exaltation. Directly opposite each Planet's Sign of dignity is the Sign of detriment; this Planet's energy is generally unfavorable. Opposite the Sign of exaltation is the Sign of fall; these Planets exhibit a weakened energy. A Planet in its natural House (such as Mars in Aries) is accidentally dignified and strengthened as a result. Perhaps the most important Planet of all is the one that rules the Ascendant. For example, those with Virgo on the Ascendant will find that Mercury, as the ruler of Virgo, exerts a considerable influence over their chart. The movement of the Planets is categorized as stationary, direct or retrograde. A stationary Planet (which will soon be direct or retrograde) brings with it highly-focused and significant energy. Direct Planets also exert considerable influence. It is the retrograde Planets which serve to mix things up. By appearing to move backward, these Planets generate a diffused and unfocused energy. The message of retrograde Planets will be garbled and less effective as a result."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Sun: Planet of Self As the Sun puts forth light, so it brings forth life. This Planet (also known as a luminary and a star) represents the self, one's personality and ego, the spirit and what it is that makes the individual unique. It is our identity and our face to the world. The Sun also speaks to creative ability and the power of the individual to meet the challenges of everyday life. One's natural father, husbands and other male influences are ruled by the Sun, as are children. The Sun's energy is a forceful one, and in its wake comes authority, the ability to lead and an individual's essence, their core being. Through the will of this Planet, we learn to manifest ourselves in the world. The Sun is majestic, and in keeping with its regal air, it rules royalty and higher office. This orb also lords over our health and well-being. The Sun's golden glow is a vital life force which imbues us with strength, energy and a will to succeed. It is the Sun which gives strength to the other Planets, which is why this Planet occupies a key role in Astrology. The Sun spends about a month visiting each Sign and takes a year to journey through the twelve Signs of the Zodiac. It is masculine energy and rules Leo and the Fifth House."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"varied emotions in order to make ourselves complete and one with the world. The Moon also helps us see that which we want, and to use memory and the past as part of this process. The Moon spends roughly 2 1/2 days in each sign and takes 28 days to circumnavigate the Zodiac. It is feminine energy and rules Cancer and the Fourth House. The Moon: Ruler of the Emotions Since the Moon is the closest 'Planet' to Earth, this satellite literally zips around the Zodiac, completing its circuit in less than a month. It also touches us more deeply than most Planets. As the ruler of the tides, it is fitting that the Moon should be the ruler of our emotions. Still waters run deep? Making waves? A wellspring of emotion? Yes, our emotions have long been portrayed in terms of the sea: fluid, momentous, churning from within. Mood swings, instinct, how we feel about things and how our feelings affect others are all influenced by the Moon. Whereas the Sun gives us our spirit, it's the Moon which gives us our soul. The Moon is goddess-like in that it symbolizes mother and the relationship between woman and child. This Planet (also known as a luminary) speaks to the women in one's life and their role as nurturer. Fertility, pregnancy and childbirth are also governed by the Moon. We see the Moon casting its silvery glow from our earliest moments, when we were stroked and caressed by our mother and felt her tender touch. Our emotions manifest themselves through our being and set the tone for our daily lives. The Moon is party to this continuum, rendering us vital one moment and fragile the next. We're up and down, naughty or nice, and may laugh wildly or cry at will. Through the Moon's energy, we endeavor to reconcile these"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Mercury: Planet of Communication Mercury, much like the winged messenger of the gods, comes in on feather-light wings and commands us to speak. Communication, intellect and awareness are all within Mercury's domain, as are logic and reasoning, our manner of thinking, and how we create and express our thought processes. A mercurial nature brings to mind restlessness and motion. Rat- a-tat-tat -- things happen fast here. Mercury is about a quick wit, quick thinking, possibilities, opinions, reasoning and the ability to rationalize things. Mercurial energy can be good or bad, but it will certainly be energizing! This Planet also prompts us to move from one thing to the next and to get answers on both a physical and psychological level. Further, Mercury's energy is both dexterous and perceptive. Mercury is about short trips: a visit to a neighbor or a friend across town, the workaday commute, a weekend getaway. Siblings, and transportation in general, are also within Mercury's realm. Speaking, writing, books, online communications and learning are all within Mercury's domain. This Planet implores us to express ourselves often -- and well. When Mercury goes retrograde (the appearance of traveling backward), however, our communications will be challenged. Mercury is never more than 28 degrees from the Sun; it takes about 88 days to complete its orbit of the Sun. It is neither masculine nor feminine energy and assumes the gender of the Sign it is in. It rules both Gemini and Virgo and the Third and Sixth Houses."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Venus: Planet of Love and Money Venus is all about pleasure, especially pleasure shared with someone else. This Planet concerns itself with love, romance and harmony in our emotional attachments, marriages, friendships and other unions (like business partnerships). Venus is content to spread happiness and tenderness, all the while teaching us how to love and appreciate others and the things that we possess. We appear attractive -- and we attract others -- thanks to Venus's energy. Socializing with and relating to others are important to this Planet. Beauty is also strongly associated with Venus. The arts (music, dance, drama and literature, to name a few) and a sense of the aesthetic fall within the ream of Venus. Venus beseeches us to indulge our senses and revel in the beauty of our world. This Planet is inextricably linked to refinement, culture, charm and grace. Venus also deals with the pleasure we derive from our possessions. Luxuries (jewelry, paintings, expensive cars), good food and drink, a beautiful home and a sense of refinement all please Venus's interests. This Planet asks us to appreciate the exquisite nature of things. It's a sensual -- though not necessarily sexual -- world as far as Venus is concerned. Venus takes 225 days to complete its orbit of the zodiac; it is never more than 47 degrees from the Sun. It is a feminine energy and rules both Taurus and Libra and the Second and Seventh Houses."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Mars: Planet of Passion Mars is the action Planet of the Zodiac. The 'Red Planet,' after all, should be pretty fiery, and Mars does not disappoint. Energy, passion, drive and determination are all right up Mars's alley. This Planet commands you (and yes, Mars does rule the military) to stand up, be noticed and get things done -- sitting on the sidelines belongs somewhere else in the heavens. Simply put, Mars speaks to the power and confident expression of the individual. Ambition and competition are also within Mars's realm. Whether it's at work or on the field of play, Mars encourages us to face challenges and to be our best -- or better. Aggression is part of the plan here, although Mars also values courage and honor. Assertion and a daring, fearless nature please this Planet. It's important to note that Mars's energy can be constructive or destructive. The God of War in ancient times, Mars could be brutally violent. While this energy still emanates from the Planet, it also asks us to harness this force for good. Stamina, ambition and achievement are all part of Mars' mantra. Mars rules our sexuality and sexual energy, and governs weapons, accidents and surgery (the last two illustrating the yin and yang nature of this Planet). In the end, however, the energy of Mars can be quite useful if used properly. It takes nearly two years for Mars to complete its orbit through the Zodiac. It is masculine energy and rules both Aries and Scorpio and the First and Eighth Houses."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Jupiter: Planet of Luck Jupiter is the thinking person's Planet. As the guardian of the abstract mind, this Planet rules higher learning and bestows upon us a yen for exploring ideas, both intellectually and spiritually. Intellectually speaking, Jupiter assists us in formulating our ideology. In the more spiritual realm, Jupiter lords over religions and philosophy. A search for the answers is what Jupiter proposes, and if it means spanning the globe to find them, well, that's probably why Jupiter also rules long-distance travel. In keeping with this theme, Jupiter compels us to assess our ethical and moral values; it also addresses our sense of optimism. Luck and good fortune are associated with Jupiter for good reason. This is a kind and benevolent Planet, one which wants us to grow and flourish in a positive way. Jupiter may be judge and jury, but it's mostly an honorable helpmate, seeing to it that we're on the right path. While our success, accomplishments and prosperity are all within Jupiter's realm, this largesse can, at times, deteriorate into laziness and sloth (Jupiter, at its worst, is associated with weight gain!). More often than not, however, Jupiter will guide us down the primrose path. Leisure time is also one of Jupiter's pastimes. Sports of all kinds, games of chance, and a stroll in the park with the family pet (Jupiter loves animals) are all ruled by this Planet. Finally, Jupiter often presages great wealth, material and otherwise. This is a good friend in the heavens! It takes Jupiter about twelve years to circle the Zodiac (the Planet visits an average of one Sign a year). It is masculine energy and rules both Sagittarius and Pisces and the Ninth and Twelfth Houses."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Saturn: Planet of Karma Saturn doesn't make things easy. That's the role of the taskmaster of the Zodiac. Saturn commands us to get to work and to work hard. Discipline and responsibility are important to this Planet, yet if we're eager to conquer the world, that's okay, too. Much like Father Time, Saturn implores us to look at the clock (its glyph, after all, is the sickle of Chronos, the God of Time). Is there time for everything we want to do, or are there limits? Those limitations are important to Saturn, and we must learn to manage them. Restrictions are the province of this Planet, as is any form of discipline or delay. In keeping with the passage of time, Saturn governs old age along with the lessons it teaches us. Learning life's lessons is key to this Planet, in keeping with its role as teacher. The majesty of older age also brings with it a certain sense of tradition, conventionality (our learned patterns of behavior) and wisdom, and Saturn is mindful of these characteristics. This Planet applauds our perseverance and the fact that we've withstood the test of time (yes, time comes up once again). This senior status further brings with it a measure of authority, and Saturn lords over that as well. Structure, order and the way in which we conduct our affairs are all ruled by this ringed Planet. Contraction and the reining in of assets are also important here. Lastly, Saturn, again in its role as teacher, concerns itself with karma and the lessons which past experiences might bring. It takes Saturn 28-30 years to complete its orbit of the zodiac. It is masculine energy and rules Capricorn and Aquarius and the Tenth and Eleventh Houses."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Uranus: Planet of Rebellion The Planet Uranus wasn't discovered until 1781. As one of the outermost Planets, it moves rather slowly through the Zodiac. The result is that its effect is felt more generationally than individually. Uranus brings with it a new way of looking at things, and its approach is best met with an expanded consciousness. Originality, inventions, computers, cutting-edge technologies and future events are all ruled by this Planet. Uranus sees no need for the status quo, preferring instead to break with tradition and create a new mold. While the building blocks (science, electricity) are safe here, this Planet would rather focus its gaze on a new world order. To that end, rebellion, revolution, dictators, an autonomous state and free will all fall under the aegis of this Planet. No one will ever characterize Uranus as subtle. This is the Planet which coaxes erratic and bizarre behavior and byzantine schemes. A bohemian, utopian society is more in keeping with Uranus's bent, as are humanitarian ideals. Freedom and creativity are important to this Planet; Astrology is also within its realm. Lastly, in keeping with its sudden, sometimes violent and often unexpected manner, Uranus rules earthquakes and other natural disasters. It takes Uranus 84 years to complete its trip around the zodiac. It is an androgynous energy and rules Aquarius and the Eleventh House. Uranus is considered to be the higher octave of Mercury and the first of the transcendental Planets."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Neptune: Planet of Illusion Neptune, another of the outer Planets, was discovered in 1846. Its slow orbit around our Zodiac ensures that its effect is generational in nature. Neptune's glyph is the trident of Poseidon, God of the Seas. Much about this Planet is fluid (Neptune rules the oceans of the Earth), changeable and illusory in nature. Dreams, illusion, abstract thought and the mysterious are all governed by Neptune. Our spirituality is important to this Planet, and how we harness that energy for our personal betterment. Neptune invites us to let its energy wash over us and to use a meditative state to gain insights and heightened awareness. Poetry, music and dance are among the trance-like activities which this Planet favors. Neptune does have its showier side, as it rules movies, television, theater, fashion and all forms of glamour. In essence, Neptune is creating an illusion -- of what is enchanting on the outside and captivating within. Neptune has a mystique which doesn't reveal itself easily. It can be a poser, too, dabbling in flattery -- and subversion. The shadow side of Neptune is akin to the aging star who cannot make one more curtain. When the lights are low, this Planet plays in a netherworld of drugs, alcohol, trances and hypnosis. Neptunian energy reeks of escapism on its darker days, a sea of delusion, hypochondria and abnormality. Sleep and dreams are also lorded over by this Planet. At the end of the day, Neptune keeps coming at you -- how will you receive it? It takes Neptune 165 years to complete its whirl around the Zodiac, spending roughly 14 years at each Sign. It is feminine energy and rules Pisces and the Twelfth House. Neptune is known as the higher octave of Venus and is the second of the transcendental Planets."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Pluto: Planet of Power As the outermost Planet in our solar system, Pluto is also the farthest from the Sun. It has only recently been discovered, having come to light (albeit a dim one) in 1930. Pluto's energy may be subtle, but its results will hit you like a ton of bricks. This Planet is about transformation, regeneration and rebirth. Things aren't pretty with Pluto, but they do get done. Pluto says 'out with the old and in with the new,' and we'd better be ready for it. If we're not, this Planet will simply have us wallow in our misery. Pluto asks us to transcend that which we know, redeem ourselves in the process, and come out stronger as a result. For all that Pluto (re)creates (it also governs the reproductive system), it loves to destroy. This Planet rules destruction, death, obsession, kidnapping, coercion, viruses and waste. That's definitely not pretty. Pluto also governs crime and the underworld, along with many forms of subversive activity (terrorism, dictatorships). This Planet is about all that is secret and undercover, that which is hidden from view. Is this the story of good vs. evil? Yes. No one will deny Pluto's power (it rules atomic power, too) and intensity. This Planet's energy is often focused on the masses and what the collective will do. Pluto beseeches the masses to look inward (and to their subconscious) to see what's there. It may be scary, but Pluto doesn't care. This Planet knows how to push buttons. It takes Pluto approximately 248 years to complete its orbit around the Zodiac. Due to the eccentricity of its orbit, it takes this Planet between 12 and 31 years to pass through a Sign. It rules Scorpio and the Eighth House. Pluto is the last of the transcendental Planets and is the higher octave of Mars."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"In looking at an individual's astrological chart, the presence of more Fire Signs may well indicate a fiery, combustible personality. Along the same lines, the absence of Earth Signs would indicate someone who is not very grounded or practical. The presence of a mix of all of the Elements would be a sign of a well-rounded individual. Each Element reflects a quality of human nature and corresponds with the Suits in both playing cards and the Tarot. Element Keyword Suit Tarot Fire Physical Clubs Wands Earth Practical Diamonds Coins Air Intellectual Spades Swords Water Emotional Hearts Cups There are two classifications of the Signs of the Zodiac -- Elements and Qualities -- and they each refer to core human characteristics. The Elements, which are also known as Triplicities (as in groupings of three), speak to the basic nature and temperament of a Sign, whereas Qualities address their manner of expression. The Elements (Fire, Earth, Air and Water) are based on ancient Greek philosophy. The ancients took it back to square one, the building blocks of life: the solid earth upon which we stand, the running water we use as a resource, the air we breathe and the fire which keeps us warm and aids in the creation of additional resources. It's easy to see a kinship to science in this elemental plan. With the individual in mind, the Greeks started philosophizing a bit. In this scenario, the body is considered earthy, feelings are fluid, thoughts often airy and activity animated and energetic. As Astrology developed, the ancients attached these elemental characteristics to the Signs, seeing as how it made sense to place a watery label on a more emotional sort. Thus evolved the classification of the Signs to their corresponding Elements. The four Elements and their corresponding Signs are Fire (Aries, Leo and Sagittarius), Earth (Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn), Air (Gemini, Libra and Aquarius) and Water (Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces). While the Elements in and of themselves help to describe our basic nature, once combined in our overall astrological chart, they help to define us as a whole and complex person."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Fire The Element of Fire is associated with the Signs Aries, Leo and Sagittarius, and it also rules the First, Fifth and Ninth Houses. As one would expect, those graced by Fire are fiery, indeed. They are enthusiastic and sometimes larger than life. Just like a fire that is left untended, however, Fire Signs can burn out of control. Ouch! It's best to tend those embers. A Fire Sign is also an indicator of creativity. This Element manifests itself in creative and unique ways, and those in its glow are also wonderfully courageous, lively spirits. Those influenced by a Fire Sign are self-sufficient, spontaneous and possess a tremendous zest for life. It also stands to reason that a combustible Fire Signer would be ardent in the game of love. Yes, these are the sexiest Signs of the Zodiac, knowing they are the cat's meow and climbing ever higher in the name of love. To their credit, those touched by Fire are often an inspiration to others, certainly for their adherence to solid moral and religious ideals. If there's a flip side to the Element of Fire, it can be that those who bear its will can be overly strident in getting their way. Call it bossy, even. These folks can come across rather forcefully. Selfishness and an overdeveloped ego can also be seen as part of a fiery individual's shadowy side. Fire Signs are strong, self-assured, creative and fun. When they get too hot to touch, though, it may be a good idea to stand back!"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Earth The Element of Earth is attached to the Signs Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn, and it also rules the Second, Sixth and Tenth Houses. All the earthy metaphors are appropriate here: salt of the Earth, feet firmly planted on the ground and so forth. Those graced by an Earth Sign in their horoscope are practical, grounded and dependable. These folks aren't taking big risks, much preferring a sure thing. Much like the Elements are considered the building blocks in nature, Earth Signs are the builders of the zodiac. To these Signs, creation is a tangible proposition. Whether it's building jobs or homes, or creating comfortable rooms within that home through the acquisition of possessions, Earth Signers are about all what is solid around us. Those influenced by this Element feel best once they have accumulated a goodly number of worldly possessions. The risk inherent in this, however, is that these individuals may become greedy and far too materialistic. The Element of Earth also confers a sense of duty, responsibility and reliability to those in its sphere. These are the people you can count on to be there when you need them. Those influenced by Earth also tend toward caution and conservatism, in both desire and approach. That said, they are sensualists, certainly in that they appreciate a good meal and fine wine better than anyone else. The logical mind of an Earth Signer is always appreciated. In keeping with this measured approach, these folks also display considerable recuperative powers. On the flip side of things, however, those supported by Earth may be so caught up in their objectives that they might overlook the feelings of others. It is a big picture, after all, but these folks may be more concerned with the finish line than the journey they are taking. Earth Signs are dependable, practical and conservative, yet fairly materialistic. They have their feet on the ground but their eyes on the prize."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Air The Element of Air is attached to the Signs Gemini, Libra and Aquarius. It also rules the Third, Seventh and Eleventh Houses. It is rarefied air which usually surrounds those graced by this Element, as this is the marker of the intellectual. Airy people are smart thinkers and handle abstract reasoning well. They love to analyze, synthesize and probe. Do you have a dilemma? Hand it over to an Air Sign and watch them go to work. Air Signs are also about communication. These individuals want to get the word out, and it's not likely to be fluff. They are alert, curious and perceptive. The world as seen by an Air Sign will be an interesting one, as their analysis and subsequent explanation (hopefully in terms we can understand) will indicate. Those influenced by Air are inventive and clever. They see all sides of the equation and are able to glean the best approach. Balance is important to these airy folk. So, are Air Signers fresh as a summer breeze or howling like the wind? Probably both, depending on when you catch them. While these folks are often cool, calm and collected, they can turn cold if their equilibrium is upset. A word to the wise: there's little upside in baiting an Air Sign. Another plus with Air is that it manifests itself in a most humane way. Those influenced by Air can truly wear another's shoes, as it were. They are objective, cooperative and really want to help make a better world. There's no prejudice with these folks, just a bright and shiny idealism which can accomplish much. Air Signs are communicative, intellectual, clever and fair. They can blow hot and cold, though, so beware of a chilly draft!"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Water The Element of Water is associated with the Signs Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces, and it also rules the Fourth, Eighth and Twelfth Houses. The watery words flow with this Element: fluid, flowing, wavering. These terms can easily apply to an individual's emotions, which are exactly the realm in which Water exerts its influence. Water Signs are intuitive, sensitive and feel more intensely than the rest. They are emotional and nurturing and, like a river, run deep. How things feel is what matters to these folks, and they base their actions on sense, rather than on logic or intellect. Water is also about compassion and understanding, since the receptive talents of these individuals are remarkably high. Water Sign people can take in the feelings of others, process them, and put forth a plan or solution that will be conscientious to all. Those graced by Water love to take their sense of the world and translate it into the artistic. They desire aesthetic beauty -- and for everyone to be happy as a result of that beauty. Much like still water can become stagnant, however, an inactive Water Sign person is not a Water Sign person at their best. Water Signs feel most fulfilled when they are helping others, and they do so in an enchanting, considerate and even romantic way. The flip side of this dreamy Water world is the tendency of these individuals to brood. Water Signs are susceptible to mood swings, and, at their worst, they could become self-indulgent, controlling and hostage to a fantasy world. This also brings up the ability of these folks to see things more clearly than others. Call it psychic, if you will. Water Signs are emotional, empathetic, receptive and feel things deeply. Alternately calm like the sea or possessing the force of a torrential rain, the emotions brought forth by this Element are plentiful, indeed."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The three Qualities defined in Astrology are, after the Elements, the second major classification that defines the nature of the Signs. The Qualities assign the Signs into Quadruplicities, groups of four Signs each that reflect the three common modes of Signs. Signs that are 90 degrees apart or opposite each other -- 180 degrees, also known as Signs in Polarity -- have the same Quality. The Signs that belong to the same Quality generally do not function smoothly together, despite their likeness -- or perhaps because of them. They are often uneasy with one another, but those in polarity complement each other, even though tension sometimes exists between them. Within an astrological chart, the Quality describes a person's attitudes in life and the way they approach projects. The three Qualities are Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable. The Cardinal Signs are Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn. These four Signs are the initiators of the Zodiac. Their common characteristics include action and drive; they have initiative and strong motivation. On a team, Cardinal Signs are the people who come up with ideas and get the project moving, but they are not very good at completion and follow-through. The Cardinal Houses are the First, Fourth, Seventh and Tenth; if a chart has a number of Planets in these Houses, the chart is weighted toward Cardinal energy. The Fixed Signs are Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius. These four Signs are the members of the Zodiac who dedicate themselves to seeing projects through to completion. Their common characteristics include determination and persistence; they are stable and self-reliant. On a team, Fixed Signs are the people who keep a project going and see it through to the end, but they can also be stubborn and inflexible. The Fixed Houses are Second, Fifth, Eighth and Eleventh; if a chart has a number of Planets in these Houses, the chart is weighted toward Fixed energy."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Mutable Signs are Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces. These four Signs are the flexible members of the Zodiac, happy to fill an assigned role. Their common characteristics include adaptability and changeability; they are flexible and versatile. On a team, Mutable Signs adapt easily to changing conditions, and they don't have a particular agenda. They can, however, be wishy-washy or inconsistent. The Mutable Houses are Third, Sixth, Ninth and Twelfth; if a chart has a number of Planets in these Houses, the chart is weighted toward Mutable energy. Many people don't realize how important the Elements and Qualities are in true Astrology. It's the combination of Elements and Qualities that makes the Signs what they are; they combine in twelve distinct ways, one for each Sign.

Together, they are a quick reference for Astrology."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Cardinal A Cardinal Quality is attached to the Signs Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn. The Cardinal Houses are the First, Fourth, Seventh and Tenth; if an astrological chart shows a preponderance of Planets in these Houses, its energy is weighted toward cardinality. Cardinal Signs are the initiators of the Zodiac. They are also found at key jumping-off points on the chart wheel, specifically the Ascendant, Medium Coeli (M.C. or Midheaven), Descendant and Imum Coeli (I.C.). Individuals possessing a Cardinal Quality like to get things going. They are active, quick and ambitious. Many projects get started, thanks to Cardinal initiative, although a good deal of them are never finished. That's because Cardinal folks are much fonder of starting things than finishing them. You won't find a Cardinal person slacking off. These people are full of vim and vigor and possess a drive and ambition that is unmistakable. Enthusiasm and a zest for life fill the Cardinal individual. Some might perceive this rampant energy as domineering, and, at times, it can be. Cardinal people can easily forget about the rest of the pack when they are busily focusing on their own endeavors. Even so, their energetic spirit often wins the day. Cardinal folks are clever and want to win. They love to start things, and whether they finish them or not, there's always a lot going on.

The Fixed Houses are the Second, Fifth, Eighth and Eleventh; if an astrological chart shows a preponderance of Planets in these Houses, its energy is weighted toward fixity. Fixed Signs understand that steadiness is the key. Those influenced by this Quality are happy to forge ahead with their projects, calmly working away until they have achieved their objectives. This is no struggle for Fixed folks, rather it's what makes them tick. These individuals are stable, determined and resolute. They want to get to the finish line and have the persistence and ability to concentrate, characteristics which will get them there. There is no lack of confidence in Fixed individuals. Self-reliance could be a Fixed person's middle name. Those possessed of a Fixed nature are powerful, yet purposeful. There are no wasted motions here: Fixed folks move patiently and steadily toward their goals. They are also steady and reliable and always remember those who helped them out. Conversely, those born under a Fixed Sign can at times be stubborn, my-way-or-the- highway folks. They may have a tendency to get stuck in their ways and to believe that they are always right. Those influenced by a Fixed Quality are determined, reliable and persistent. They have great strength, and strength of purpose, and love to get the job done. So what if they refuse to budge? They get results."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Mutable A Mutable Quality is attached to the Signs Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces. The Mutable Houses are the Third, Sixth, Ninth and Twelfth; if a horoscope shows a preponderance of Planets in these Houses, its energy is weighted toward mutability. Mutable Signs know how to go with the flow. They are adaptable and flexible and can change their form of expression to whatever a situation requires. Standing their ground is of little import to Mutable folks. These people would much rather conform to the norm, so long as their doing so will help the greater good. Luckily, Mutable individuals are versatile and find it quite easy to change. Consider them the chameleons of the Zodiac, since they can take on varied personae. Mutable people are blessed with a tremendous resourcefulness. Talk about making lemonade out of lemons! They know how to squeeze that last drop of juice and make things better in the process. Those influenced by a Mutable Quality in their horoscope also enjoy learning, play fair and are diplomatic and well-liked by others. To their further credit, they are sharp, sympathetic and can see (via a sixth sense?) the essential elements of a situation. At times, however, their desire to please everyone can get them into hot water. They may come across as wishy-washy, inconsistent and downright duplicitous. All this in the name of aiming to please! The beauty of mutability is that those possessing it are flexible, versatile and highly resourceful. These folks are quick to help others and are selfless in the process. While they may occasionally stretch themselves to the breaking point, they know how to bounce back."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Astrological Houses One way to put the components of your astrological chart into a real world context is to look at the twelve Houses of the Zodiac.

By examining the placement of the Planets and Signs in the various Houses, the image of your 'astrological make up' is further sharpened. If, for example, your chart finds Uranus, the Planet of Rebellion, in the First House, the House of Self, you may seem a little odd to others because you wear your individuality on the surface. Technically speaking, to place the Houses within the chart wheel, divide the wheel into twelve equal pie-shaped pieces. The first piece of this astrological pie begins at the nine o'clock spot and heads south: That is the First House. The Second House begins at the eight o'clock position ... and so on. The first Sign of the Zodiac, Aries, is the ruler of the First House; Taurus, the second Sign, rules the Second House, and so on around the wheel. Any of the twelve Signs can visit a particular House and add its own characteristics to it, based on time, date and place of birth. It would be correct to infer that the Houses possess similar traits to the Signs which rule them, as well as taking on traits of each Planet that travels through them. However, while the Signs deal with inner traits and qualities located at the six o'clock position, which is also the start of the Fourth House. The IC looks inward and represents childhood, home and family. The ascendant, descendant, MC and IC are also known as the angles of the chart wheel. Having one's correct birth time available allows for an accurate placement of the Planets in their corresponding Houses when drawing up a chart wheel. This placement adds much texture to the reading -- and meaning -- of an individual's chart. relating to the Self, the Houses speak to the external world and outer influences. The First House, at the nine o'clock position, is said to be on the \" ascendant\", or horizon. One's outward image is largely defined by the planetary placement at the ascendant. For example, if Virgo is on the ascendant in a particular chart, it will add its own flavor and characteristics to the First House. Directly across from the First House is the Seventh House, at the three o'clock position. This is referred to as the descendant and addresses how we view our relationships with others. The high noon position, at the beginning of the Tenth House, is also occupied by the medium coeli, or MC. Through the MC, we can glean much about an individual's social status and public persona. Opposite the MC on the chart wheel is the imum coeli, or IC, located at the six o'clock position, which is also the start of the Fourth House. The IC looks inward and represents childhood, home and family. The ascendant, descendant, MC and IC are also known as the angles of the chart wheel. Having one's correct birth time available allows for an accurate placement of the Planets in their corresponding Houses when drawing up a chart wheel. This placement adds much texture to the reading -- and meaning -- of an individual's chart."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The First House House of Self The First House is commonly referred to as the House of Self. The cusp of the First House is the home of the Ascendant, the Sign which was rising on the eastern horizon at the precise moment of one's birth. By thinking of this in terms of sunrise and new beginnings, one begins to grasp the concepts of the First House. The new beginnings here are centered around the individual: the self and the attendant voyage of discovery which defines a person. Who are you? What will you become? How do you realize your best self? The First House speaks to the realization of one's ultimate potential. This process of becoming a unique individual is one of the greatest contributions we make to the world in which we live. The distinct qualities which we possess are often referred to as personality. The First House addresses the individual, his or her comportment and approach to life. In other words, the sum total of one's being. This is the package we give to the world. The packaging itself, or our outer being, is also governed by the First House -- think the physical body and the way in which we present ourselves, and in particular, the head and face. Early childhood is also ruled by the First House. Everything from our earliest steps to our view of the emerging world is considered here. How will we develop? What is our view on life? It all begins at the beginning (the First House) and serves to shape us for all time. In sum, the First House speaks to the person we are becoming and will become, both internally and externally. It addresses our personality and presentation to the world, our essential qualities, approach to life, demeanor and basic sensibilities. The inner self and outer body are what the First House is all about. The First House is ruled by the Sign Aries and the Planet Mars."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Second House House of Possessions The Second House is commonly referred to as the House of Possessions. While this speaks to that which we own, it's not limited simply to tangible things. We own our feelings and emotions, as well as our inner selves, abilities, needs and wants. When we own up to something, we are in fact claiming ownership of our greatest possession, our self. Using our possessions, including material goods, to maximum advantage is also within the realm of the Second House. Our possessions should enhance our lives and those of others in addition to fostering a general sense of well-being. This brings forth the concept of value which is key to the Second House. What do we value, both tangibly and intangibly? Why do we value it? Who do we value? What do we really own? What do we want to own? Why? Our effective resolution of these questions is a large part of what the Second House is all about. Specific possessions covered by the Second House include earned income and our ability to influence it, investments and moveable property (cars, clothing, jewelry and the like). Debt is also part of the equation here, since we own the responsibility to pay our bills. How we view money, the acquisition of wealth (and debt), financial reversals, savings, budgeting and financial status are all ruled by the Second House. For those of us who believe that money will set us free, it's interesting to note that this maxim finds a home in the Second House. Personal freedoms as established by financial capability and sensibility are addressed within this House. To a great extent, our possessions and what we do with them help to define us as viable human beings. Taking it a step further, will these material goods help us gain social standing, recognition, friendship and love? Used properly, they very well might. Therefore, the goal implicit in one's possessions could be defined as the ability to use those possessions honestly and to our best advantage and for the greater good. If our possessions work for us and those around us, what more could we ask? Well, one more question does come to mind: what goes around comes around? Sounds about right! The Second House is ruled by the Sign Taurus and the Planet Venus."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Third House House of Communication The Third House is commonly referred to as the House of Communication. In this House, much of the communication is going on between the individual and those he or she holds close: brothers and sisters, as well as neighbors. While communication here can be both written and verbal, it also has a conscious quality to it. Think about kindred spirits and mental connections. This serves to highlight the role of intelligence within the Third House. Intelligence, as viewed in this realm, is the analytical ability one possesses within his or her environment, specifically a basic grasp of things and a practical sensibility. We use this intelligence to help us work effectively within our world and with those in it. The Third House reminds us that it's okay to use our conscious skills, as well as a more reflective intelligence, in order to make our way. A symbiotic relationship with those we hold close is also part of the plan. Let's not forget that our minds are powerful, quick and dexterous. Some things will be well- thought out, others nearly automatic. Maximizing our sum potential is the key. Early education, effectively teaching us how to think and communicate, is also covered by the Third House, as are short trips. Again, the proximate nature of travel speaks to the intimate nature of the Third House: those we know well, in our environment, keeping that environment tight. Harnessing our intelligence and sharing it effectively with others is the essence of the Third House. How do we best state our case with others, often those we love the most? Will our actions be true to our environment, and our planet, for all time? This brings to the fore emerging forms of intelligence-gathering, such as computers. Will they make or break communication as we know it? The questions posed by the Third House can be answered by listening to that House: think, process, share. The Third House is ruled by the Sign Gemini and the Planet Mercury."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Fourth House House of Family and Home The Fourth House is commonly referred to as the House of Home. When we think of home, we think of that place where we put down our roots. We lay our foundation and plant ourselves firmly into the Earth, as it were. One day, we will return to that very same Earth. The Fourth House brings things full circle by also addressing old age, endings and our final resting place. Much of the emphasis of the Fourth House, however, is on the concept of home. By laying down roots, we make a home for ourselves, or more specifically, the self. It's worth noting that in addition to the external home (all the bricks and mortar around us), we have really brought the essential self home. 'I'm home.' The words themselves have a peaceful ring to them. The self is now centered, grounded, one and at peace with the Earth. We seek to come home both physically and psychically, for ourselves and for those we love. By creating home, we create a meeting place, a sanctuary, a sacred place for ourselves and for others. In our home, we integrate the self with all that has come before us and helped to shape what we are today. We create a domestic space which comforts and nurtures us and serves to keep safe those we love. Also important here are family history, cultural and societal norms, and ways of being. All of these are ruled by the Fourth House, as are our ancestry, roots and heritage. These qualities are brought 'home' through us and integrated into the place we call home. Helping to create the home we make are our parents, for it is they who greatly nurture and shape our being. Therefore, the Fourth House can also be thought of as the House of the Mother, the Parent or the Nurturer. Looking at things from a strictly tangible point of view, we can see that the Fourth House also encompasses physical structures (houses) and real estate. The Fourth House represents family, history and traditions. All of these contribute to the process of becoming a true, actualized and individualized self. This is how we come home. The Fourth House is ruled by the Sign Cancer and the Moon."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Fifth House House of Pleasure The Fifth House is commonly referred to as the House of Pleasure. Oftentimes, pleasure is the result of a creative act. The simple act of creating is, essentially, giving of oneself and making something -- making another? Yes, the Fifth House does speak to procreation and children, but it also addresses the creation of art and culture. The creative life is one from which we can derive much personal pleasure and self-satisfaction. Do I like this? Does it make me feel good? Does it bring me pleasure? The answers therein are the domain of the Fifth House. Taking this pleasure principle a step further, one can give it a more human face, even two faces. Romance and romantic affairs, both emotional pleasures, are within the realm of the Fifth House. Emotional satisfaction can be gained in many ways, and yet another way addressed by this House is gambling. While this implies a financial risk, it can also be viewed as the willingness to take a risk -- on love, with money or in life. A gut risk in the hopes of a pleasurable outcome is how the Fifth House sees it. This House is actually quite rich with pleasures since it also lords over fun, games and hobbies. Life is more than just being or doing, it also includes finding -- finding the pleasure in the acts in which we engage. Children as a source of pleasure are also important in the Fifth House. This brings us back to creativity, since through our children, we create an extension of ourselves and then watch it grow. Giving our children all the good we had (and have), and then some, is certainly a pleasurable pursuit. How will this manifest itself? What form of pleasure and emotional release is best for our children? Music, dance, theater, art, science, literature -- these fancies are for them and for us. Play for the purpose of emotional enrichment and pure pleasure is what the Fifth House is all about. The Fifth House is ruled by the Sign Leo and the Sun."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Sixth House House of Health The Sixth House is commonly referred to as the House of Health. Implicit in maintaining good health is the ability to cope in the face of adversity, and this theme rings truest in the Sixth House. As human beings, we naturally have shortcomings. What will we do with them? How will we react in the face of a personal crisis? Crises, illnesses and reversals of fortune are all part of our Earthly trek. How we confront these situations and deal with the lessons they invariably teach us helps to define the person we become. Our fears may hold us back, but if we can meet them head-on and come out stronger on the other side, we may learn the valuable lesson of service or what our life's work should be. Work and service are central to the Sixth House. The focus here is on employment (employers and employees), training, those who serve us (along with those we serve) and those who depend on us. Keeping ourselves strong throughout these efforts is also important here, which is why this House further focuses on health (good and bad), diet, fitness and hygiene. Essential to the work we do in life is the work we do on our self. Duty, responsibility and personal growth all contribute to the creation of a fully-realized being. We work for others as well as for ourselves; we are at service to those who need us, including our own being. There will be times when crises of health or faith will stand in the way of our best self. At those times, we must endeavor to heal ourselves (again, the focus of this House is on health) so that we can return to the work of realizing our sum potential, of serving our world. The Sixth House also addresses the daily dailiness of life: what will I wear today? Do I need a haircut? Has the dog been fed? These simple matters keep our engines humming and enable us to do the more important work of our choosing. It's a patchwork quilt: the ability to serve others in health and through work which is both valuable and fulfilling. The Sixth House is ruled by the Sign Virgo and the Planet Mercury."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Seventh House House of Partnerships The Seventh House is commonly referred to as the House of Partnership. With this House, we see a shift away from the self toward another -- a partner. By cooperating with and relating to another we unite for the purpose of achieving something. Purpose is important to the Seventh House -- the act of accomplishing something great or small for the self, the partnership and even society as a whole. In uniting with another, we also become a more valuable member of our world: we make a contribution, one small cog in the wheel of life. We have purpose. Cooperation and partnership help to expedite our purpose in life. Through a partnership, we fill out our essential being. Suddenly, we see ourselves in context. Through a partnership in which we work, play, love and/or create, we are fully formed and completed. The other half helps to make us whole. Ultimately, how we relate to others will help to define the success we have as a human being and as a member of humankind. The Seventh House shows us that partnerships can take many forms: marriage, business relationships, contracts, legalities, negotiations and agreements. We will cooperate to a greater or lesser extent in these varied partnerships. The quality of that cooperation, in essence how we relate to the other, is key to the Seventh House. Why do we choose this partnership? Is it for love or money? Practical reasons? Social considerations? There are many reasons for uniting with another. We may choose to fill voids we see in ourselves. We may simply want the company and companionship of another. The partnerships we form say a great deal about ourselves and also serve to teach us much. This House wants us to know that the quality of our partnerships will enhance our lives, make them fuller, more special and better for everyone. Tensions within a partnership also serve to teach us lessons. For this reason, the Seventh House also focuses on the darker side of our unions. Divorce, lawsuits and treaties all fall within this House. At its worst, a partnership may create enemies -- and on a more global scale, these rifts can deteriorate into war. It is our reaction to this adversity which will shape the partnerships yet to come. The Seventh House is ruled by the Sign Libra and the Planet Venus."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Eighth House House of Sex The Eighth House is commonly referred to as the House of Sex. This House delves into relationships -- interactions with another and how certain aspects of those interactions can take on a more communal nature. It speaks to what our relationships will bring us and how we can get the most out of them. Returning to this House's emphasis on sex, it's important to note that the French refer to an orgasm as 'le petit mort' or 'the little death.' When we reach that exalted state of communion, we leave a little of ourselves behind -- die a small death. One can also choose to view this as growth, a new beginning, the rebirth of the soul or a gain for the partnership. The Eighth House is an equal-opportunity House, placing sex, death and rebirth on the same level playing field and acknowledging the viability and importance of all three. We will all experience death and rebirth as part of our lives: failed relationships leading to new ones, career changes, a new hairstyle. We are regenerated and reborn with each new phase and should welcome them. Shared resources also fall within the Eighth House: inheritance, alimony, taxes, insurance, support from another. Financial support as well as spiritual, emotional and physical support are addressed by this House. While our relationships share many of the aforementioned things, they also have their own dynamics and grow from within (we grow through our sexuality as well as through other more tangible means). That said, much as our relationships are expansive, they also have certain constraints, many which are placed on them by society. Again, taxes, alimony and the joint nature of assets come to mind. Yes, with every opportunity we have, we may face a restriction along with it. Once again, death and rebirth. In keeping with the transforming nature of this House, rituals are highlighted. Every group has its own way of peering in and looking deep into the soul and the past, if only to get a sense of what we truly are. What quality will our rituals take on? Exalted states or metamorphoses? What secrets do we keep and why? How we manage our interactions, relationships and rituals is important to the Eighth House -- will we be honest, effective and responsible? Will the riches generated by our relationships benefit the group (company, humankind) as a whole? Our legacies are key to this House: how we conduct ourselves now, and how that will play out for all time. The Eighth House is ruled by the Sign Scorpio and the Planets Mars and Pluto."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Ninth House House of Philosophy The Ninth House is commonly referred to as the House of Philosophy. In keeping with that theme, it's our search for meaning which is the focal point here. By virtue of exploring our world, we start to grasp everything that is available to us. It all boils down to understanding: understanding that which we see and feel and probing further in the hopes of realizing true meaning. Through higher education, we have the hope of understanding concepts and theories which will enhance our world. Whether it's philosophy or psychology, the Ninth House reminds us that we are on a voyage of discovery. Along that road, we will come face- to-face with our ideals and further shape the ethics by which we live. Another approach to clearer meaning and understanding of that which we see, and more importantly, that which we do not see, is through religion. Understanding and accepting that which is greater than us and our world is key to the Ninth House. Sadly, we might not always be humble in the face of what we have. A concrete understanding of the possibilities in life may well lead to ruthless ambition and greed and an over-expansion of the self. To face these demons most effectively in society, we institute laws. These laws provide for the orderly and positive growth of that society. In much the same way, philosophy and religion help add focus and purpose to a productive society. How members of a society relate, and knowing and respecting the laws by which they live, are core tenets of the Ninth House. The way in which we expand our inner and outer lives is also addressed by the Ninth House. Travel and interaction with other peoples and cultures are a means to this end. Our dreams, those which illustrate our past as well as those which speak to future events, also help to mold our being and our relationships. Taking this a step further, psychics as the bearers of relevant information also come into play. Additionally, the Ninth House addresses publishing and multinational ventures such as import/export businesses. This House also has a multigenerational view, taking into account grandchildren, as well as in-laws. At the end of the day, however, the Ninth House is best described as philosophically inclined in the search for meaning and truth. The Ninth House is ruled by the Sign Sagittarius and the Planet Jupiter."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Tenth House House of Social Status The Tenth House is commonly referred to as the House of Social Status. It is about the place we have attained in our social (or work/career) grouping and in society as a whole. Think status, the authority it conveys, and consequently, the role we take in our community. It also speaks to any promotions we receive, any fame we may have or will come to have and the types of business and social activities in which we partake. With respect to achievement, this House focuses on how we see ourselves and how the community as a whole sees us (and our efforts). Through this House, we work on manifesting ourselves. Vocation is important in the Tenth House. What role will we choose and how will we best fill it? How much do we want to achieve? Career, professional goals, ambition and motivation all come into play here. In a more practical context, employers and their rules are covered here, as are any other organizations (specifically the government) which have the ability to rule over us. Along with our life's work comes the challenge of ruling over others, although there will generally be someone who lords over us. The prestige and social status we accrue by virtue of our careers and vocations can be seen, intangibly, in the form of ego gratification. How we manage this is addressed by the Tenth House. It may be most difficult to tire of financial rewards in our consumerist society; surprisingly, ego massage may grow old more quickly. The question of how we will manage these gifts, and the status that comes along with them, is important to this House. Will we use our power to truly help society, or will we be willful and reckless? Not all of us are cut out for grand scale social success or equipped to help society significantly. It's also worth noting that many of our successes are achieved with the aid of society, not in a vacuum. The relationship of the individual to a group and to society is also highlighted in the Tenth House. To improve things and to make an impact, we must feel a real kinship to the cause; a fervent resolve to change things is necessary. In this way, we will achieve that social status which is truly worthwhile. Lastly, in keeping with its focus on rulers, the Tenth House addresses the father, who is generally the more authoritarian parent. The Tenth House is ruled by the Sign Capricorn and the Planet Saturn."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Eleventh House House of Friendships The Eleventh House is commonly referred to as the House of Friends. Through our friends, we find strength in numbers -- we see the power of the collective, the group. Groups addressed by this House include clubs, organizations, social groups, networking organizations and professional associations. The focus here is on the activities we undertake within these groups, how we make a difference and as a result, how we grow and actualize our true selves. Further, it's the group, by virtue of its collective strength, which helps to define what we as individuals will do. As we grow, we have more opportunities and possibilities available to us, and the Eleventh House addresses these. Our interactions and efforts are in keeping with our priorities in life; these interactions have the ability to enhance our lives. A labor of love? Yes, in many ways. Through our friends and group activities we add substance and meaning to our lives and to society. The Eleventh House also speaks to destiny -- in simple terms, our hopes and dreams, what we desire and what we want to achieve. Our creative vision is highlighted, the simple act of working toward our maximal selves. The power of collective creation, as well as the creative sparks generated by the group, are also important to this House. By banding together, we can create so much more. In joining with our friends, we not only accomplish a great deal, but we can also enjoy the fruits of our labor. The Eleventh House also addresses the kind of friend we are: what do we do for others? How do we view our friends? How do they view us? It is our basic character which, to a great extent, defines the friends and groups we choose. Oftentimes, we work with our friends toward a greater good and in the hope of improving society. This is our philanthropic side coming to the fore, the ability to selflessly and eagerly help others. It is also our humanity manifesting itself most effectively. At times, we may upset the proverbial apple cart, but the sum total of our efforts should be to look at the end result. If that's good, then the process of getting there, for better or for worse, is worthwhile. Lastly, the Eleventh House also governs stepchildren, foster children and adopted children. The Eleventh House is ruled by the Sign Aquarius and the Planets Saturn and Uranus."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Twelfth House House of Subconscious The Twelfth House is commonly referred to as the House of the Unconscious. The unconscious state can help engender our successes, as well as assist us in coping with our failures. Success vs. failure: do we consciously confront our lives or subconsciously sweep things under the proverbial rug? This House might more aptly be called the House of Reckoning, since it is in the Twelfth that we review what we have been (and done) and decide where we go from there. Along with these unconscious musings, we also deliberate on strengths and weaknesses which are hidden from public view. Our subconscious works hard on our behalf, trying to make sense of our lives. This shadow play is slow and long, and often fraught with fear and pain. It is in this context that we are confronted with our sorrows, suffering and the secrets we keep from ourselves and from others. Ultimately, we are also confronted with our fate: karma. Here we meet up with the results of everything we have done. This further puts the focus on repressed agendas and restraint. What have we wrought with in our lives? This is a key question of the Twelfth House, and we will deal with it both consciously and unconsciously. Will the answers compel us to be transformed or reborn? This is another cornerstone of the Twelfth House -- the manner in which we move forward. We can learn much from the unconscious. In its most noble manifestation, we will be prompted to be charitable. If we learn our lessons, both past and present, we are also better equipped to move forward. The Twelfth House compels us to seek closure in a spiritual way as an aid to positive growth. The last House of the zodiac also recognizes that we can feel bound in life -- stuck and confined. For this reason, this House rules jails, hospitals, institutions, asylums and any space that inhibits freedom. More gloominess in the Twelfth comes in the form of danger, secret enemies and clandestine affairs. Beware! While some may decry the Twelfth House as the garbage bin of the zodiac, it's really an unfair term. Ultimately, this House is the champion of positive transformations. It is here that we stand on the precipice and determine how we will proceed. By visiting the unconscious and meeting with the past, we begin to glean what the future will bring. The Twelfth House is ruled by the Sign Pisces and the Planets Jupiter and Neptune."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"March 21 to April 19 Aries is a Fire Sign Headwork is the chief factor of this sign. Persons born under Aries are keen, creative and highly adaptive but they are also impetuous and headstrong.

Their incessant drive gets them off to a good start on any project but they are apt to become diverted and scatter their further effort. Though quick to anger, Aries people often calm easily. They are naturally humorous and quick of wit. They enjoy music and entertainment. They say the right thing at the right time and as students, they are often keen and have the ability of applying whatever they learn to good advantage.

Diamond Scarlet Red Jasper Iron Mars Rose"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Aries is the first Sign of the Zodiac, and that's pretty much how those born under this Sign see themselves: first. Arians are the leaders of the pack, first in line to get things going. Whether or not everything gets done is another question altogether, for Arians far prefer to initiate than to complete. Do you have a project needing a kick- start? Call an Aries, by all means. The leadership displayed by Arians is most impressi ve, so don't be surprised if they can rally the troops against seemingly insurmountable odds -- they have that kind of personal magnetism. Arians don't shy away from new ground, either. Those born under this Sign are often called the pioneers of the Zodiac, and it's their fearless trek into the unknown which often wins the day. Arians are a bundle of energy and dynamism and the Pied Piper of their people. The dawning of a new day, and all its possibilities, is pure bliss to an Arian. It's the Ram which symbolizes Aries, and that's both good and bad news. Impulsive Arians (and there are more than a few) might be tempted to ram their ideas down someone else's throat. If things get done for the greater good, that might even be okay. It's those times when an idea is force-fed by an Arian for no apparent reason that we wish this Sign's symbol were a more subdued creature. No go, since these folks are blunt and to the point. Along with those qualities comes the Arian's sheer force of being which can accomplish a great deal. Much of this drive to the finish line has to do with the Cardinal Quality assigned to Arians. Cardinal Signs love to get things going, and Arians exemplify this better than the rest. Arians are ruled by the Planet Mars. Taking a peek at Roman mythology, we find that Mars was the God of War. Our man Mars was unafraid to do battle, and much the same can be said for Arians. These folks are bold, aggressive and courageous. They can summon up the inner strength required to take on most anyone, and they'll probably win. Arians do not lack energy or vitality, and they can stay in the game longer than most anyone else. Now that's a winning edge. Rams are also, for the most part, independent and well aware of their own interests in a given situation. This sometimes myopic view ma y not be for everyone, but it does help Arians get things going. Further, their competitive natures ensure that they will play the game with zeal and vigor. At times, their approach may be construed as arrogant and domineering, but it takes a lot of focus to be a leader (or so an Arian would say). Sadly, the Arian won't usually be around for the final victory (defeat? never). These fol ks will more than likely have bolted to the next project before the first one is done. The Element associated with Aries is Fire. Think action, enthusiasm and a burning desire to play the game. Arians love physicality, so they w on't sit on the sidelines for long, if at all. They'll jump into the fray full force and will contribute much in the process. Talk about eager beavers! Sure, some of their decisions may later prov e to have been hasty, but you'll never find an Arian who regretted taking a shot. Making things happen is what it's all about to these folks. Arians are also unafraid of stepping onto new terrain. The challenge inherent in taking on the unknown is heaven on Earth for Rams. Sure, they may appear arrogant when they take on the world, but they'll be quick to tell you it's the only way to go. While a common Arian refrain might well be 'me first,' there's no point in arguing with them since, in their minds, they are first. Is this unbridled ego? Maybe, but that might be what it takes to blaze a new trail. Oh, and on the subject of arguing, it's the Ram who will have the last word, so save your breath. Arians at play seem to toil as hard as they work. These folks are happiest playing a spirited game of soccer or engaging in the martial arts. In the game of love, the Ram's ardor is unquestioned, although Arians can also be playful and romantic with their mate. With Aries ruling the head, face and brain, those born under this Sign need to be on the lookout for headaches and are well-served to take the occasional deep breath. The Ram's color is bright red, a sure sign of the fire that breathes within. The great strength of the Aries-born is in their initiative, courage and determination. These folks love to get things going and are fearless along the way. Their dynamism and competitive spirit add considerably to the projects which they undertake.

Some would say he thrives on opposition, for it is when he is set against that he often does his best. Getting over or around obstacles is a challenge he generally enjoys. He likes to keep abreast of new things that are happening in the world. Ariens are often fond of speed.

They never say di e, no matter what the odds, They may have an occasional setback, but it is not long before they are back on their feet again. The Negative Side of Aries: Everybody has his less positive qualities-and Aries is no exception. Sometimes the Aries man or woman is not very tactful in communication with others; in his hurry to get things done he is apt to be a little callous or inconsiderate. Sensitive people are likely to find him somewhat sharp- tongued in some situations. Often in his eagerness to achieve his aims, he misses the mark altogether . At times the Arien is too impulsive. He can occasionally be stubborn and refuse to listen to reason. If things do not move quickly enough to suit the Aries man or woman, he is apt to become rather nervous or irritable. The uncultivated Arien is not unfamiliar with moments of doubt and fear. He is capable of being destructive if he does not get his way. He can overcome some of his emotional problems by steadily tryi ng to express himself as he really is, but this requires effort.

Ruled by the First House of Self, selfishness can sometimes take the upper hand when it's a choice between people and possessions. On the other hand, the Ram can be very warm toward their friends.

Cardinal Fire and Fixed Air cover all the bases: These chums can come up with an idea, plan how to make it happen, get it going, and st ick with it to make it succeed. This formula for success makes theirs a friendship of vision and action. Aries and Pisces When Aries and Pisces form a friendship, their rela tionship is often mutually beneficial. Aries is a strong Sign who follows impulses without worr ying about the consequences. Pisces is quieter, one of the dreamers of the Zodiac. In many wa ys, they contrast and on the surface may seem an unlikely alliance. When they combine in a clos e, friendly way, though, they are each able to balance each other. Aries is a leader and initiator, and in a friendship with Pisces often becomes the protector of their more gentle comrade. Pisces, in turn, gives Aries quiet understanding and relaxation from the pressures of Aries' hectic life. Pisces is a Sign t hat, like Water, fills whatever container it is poured into; they often understand Aries in a way that many other Signs don't. Aries' style of straight- shooting combines with Pisces' gentle understanding of other people to form a confidence and assertiveness that doesn 't pass into arrogance -- the way Aries alone might act -- and isn't overly accommodating, like Pisces alone may be. Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars, and Pisces is rule d by the Planet Jupiter. Pisces is also ruled by Neptune. Mars brings action and energy to the Ar ies-Pisces friendship. Neptune is about the big picture, ideas and illusions; but it's also invo lved with disillusion and fantasy. Aries can help Pisces bring dreams into reality. Jupiter work s through Pisces by putting a softer face on Aries' sometimes rash and brash style, toning it down. Aries is a Fire Sign, and Pisces is a Water Sign. Even though these two elements are opposite, they can combine to make a great team by using emotion and physical impetus to get things done. Pisces can help Aries relax a little and learn to be more passive in approach, while Aries teaches Pisces to go out into the world and begin to take the kinds of risks that make life more exciting. At times, Pisces can be emotionally draining for the Ram, too much Water dampening Aries' fiery enthusiasm. Conversely, too much Fire can boil the Water away and leave Pisces stressed-out. Aries and Pisces must cooperate to ensure their balance is maintained. Aries is a Cardinal Sign, and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Unlike Aries, Pisces doesn't need to be the leader or the boss; when they are asked to hel p out with any of their Aries friend's ideas or plans, they're more than happy to lend a hand, as charitable as they are. Pisces receive their greatest joy from helping others. Aries, on the other hand, is the one who comes up with the ideas in the first place and assigns the roles to everyone else. Different aptitudes and interests help Aries and Pisces work toward a shared goal and and achieve a positive end. The best aspect of the Aries-Pisces friendship is that they really have a lot to learn from each other. Pisces shows Aries how to empathize; Aries teaches Pisces how to make dreams happen rather than just thinking about them! The ab ility to each provide what the other needs makes theirs a truly reciprocal friendship."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Romantic Sun Sign Profiles Aries Introduction The sign of the Ram is graced by the element of Fire, and if you were to use one word to describe Aries, it could easily be heat. People born unde r this sign have a passion and red-hot energy, which often proves irresistible. It's certainly never boring! Aries likes to in itiate relationships, and the role of seducer comes to them easily. Th is sizzling romance dance will only work on those strong enough to stay in the game, because Ar ies wants a partner who can go toe-to-toe with them, whether it's over lunch or under the cove rs. Aries likes to get its way and often pits the wishes of self against what is best for the part nership, which can lead to conflict. These battles, though, are often foreplay, which can result in some sexy fireworks of their own. The Ram is possessed of a great physicality, a sense of adventure, is wildly flirtatious and loves to play. Aries and Romance Aries loves the hunt and will do whatever it takes to get the prize they want. The question in their mind will often be whether it's a prize worth k eeping. Aries will take risks during the chase and would love the object of their affections to do the same. That give-and-take can keep things more than interesting and going for quite some time. There is no doubt that Aries is seductive and will prove hard to resist. Sparks will fly in this competitive pas de deux, and it's all the better where the Ram is concerned. A mental attraction for im passioned Aries is often the first step and the indicator as to whether things will progress. If things work their way down -- watch out! Once hooked, Aries loves strokes and tender caresses and a lover who will tell them that they are the best. Aries in Relationship The demanding and passionate Ram needs an equally self-possessed lover to stimulate them and set them on fire. If not, what's the point? Aries can be fiercely loyal, yet self-centered at the same time, so their partner needs to exhibit confidence and a sense of when to give them the space they need. The occasional bouts of temper ex hibited by Aries are best dealt with if they are used as a prelude to a deeper understanding and the sizzle that comes with kissing and making up. Aries will stick with a relationship as long as it's hot (and fireworks are key to this Fire Sign), but if things start to cool down, it won't be long before they hit the road. The ideal Aries soul mate may be someone who is never, ever dull. Aries in Love Aries is a moving target where love is concerned, always looking, seeking and often finding. It can be very hard to resist the Ram's magnetic charms. The aura surrounding those born under this sign is one of intensity and intrigue, so many will be tempted to step up to the plate. This is exactly what Aries wants: many opportunities to play the game of love. Some things will work, and some won't, but the game is surely fun! The beauty of it all is that Aries flourishes in love, becoming a more sensuous, understanding and feeling soul. As long as Aries remembers how to share, and the beauty of an us, things can go far. Aries and Sex The Ram is more of a tiger where sex is concerned and, like many other sleek animals, loves the hunt -- that steady pursuit of the ultimate priz e. Aries is a physical and fearless lover and is blessed with the stamina to go all night long. They are not afraid to experiment sexually in their quest for pleasure, which means an open-minded lover is a must. The Mile-High Club must have been invented for these folks! It's safe to say that Aries' lover must be able to satisfy, or the Ram will move on. The dominant sexual partner will likely be the Ram, and while eroticism is important, a mental connection is also favored by this sign. As if Aries weren't passionate and demanding enough, they also want to be made to feel secure in a sexual relationship, lest jealousy rear its ugly head. What Aries Needs Aries doesn't generally need hearts and flowers to give them a warm and fuzzy glow. What's far more important to members of this sign is to find a partner who is equally strong and self- possessed and who will challenge them to greater heights, both mental and physical. The person who can draw them out and make them better is a keeper. It also helps if Aries' partner can handle the occasional fiery argument and master the art of making up. Sexual adventurers are also very attractive to the Ram, whether it's acrobatics between the sheet s or the art of touching. There's no shortage of libido here! The Aries lover is passionate, adventurous and energetic, loves romance and revels in the art of the chase. Those who can stand the heat will be rewarded with a loyal companion who will take them to greater heights. Life with Aries is neve r boring, so get ready for the ride of a lifetime!"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Love Match Aries and Aries When two Aries come together in a love affair, there's bound to be fireworks. These two are always competing, which can make for quite a chal lenging love match. An Aries-Aries relationship is like looking into a mirror: Aries understands their partner's need for independence because they're the same way. At times, however, they can be possessive and turn into two Rams butting heads. They have to learn not to compete with one another so much. If they can do so, their partnership can be extremely powerful. An Aries-Aries love match is a meeting of two st rong spirits; generally, the relationship is positive and enthusiastic. They love to try new things -- often extreme sports or some other intense activity. Solving the inevitable problems of a clos e relationship can be tough due to the two egos constantly clashing. They must learn to work together. Since both partners like things to go their way, they must make a conscious effort not to be selfish. Aries also has a natural generosity, however, so two Aries together can certainly learn to take turns indulging each other. Aries is very open with their feelings; totally straightforward, two Aries will never have problems with deceit or hypocrisy. Both partners will have trouble with temper outbursts that result from hasty judgments. Aries just wants to get on with it, already! Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars. Mars was the G od of War, and, like two soldiers in a battle, two Aries can either fight together or against each other -- but they will fight. Mars also represents passion, and Aries tends to have an active and exciting time with any lover. This energy is only heightened with another Aries. And, though arguments are inevitable for this pair, the best is yet to come -- first of all, Aries is too busy to hold a grudge for long, and besides, making up is so much fun! Aries is a Fire Sign. It's rare for one partner to get tired while the other still wants to continue; two Aries will play hard together and tire at the same ti me. Again, two Aries maintain a constant battle over who will be the le ader. Neither pa rtner likes to submit, so compromise is essential. If these two can keep their egos in check, the relati onship will be smooth. Aries is a Cardinal Sign. In an Aries-Aries comb ination, both partners are skilled at initiation. When they see what they want, they pursue it without a moment's thought. They never waste time feeling each other out before they jump into a relationship. What's the best aspect of the Aries-Aries relationship? That exciting spontaneity that always keeps things new and that's so hard to find with other Signs. Two Aries will never be bored! Their mutual energy and ability to make up after disagreements ma kes theirs a passionate and compatible relationship. Aries and Taurus When Aries and Taurus come together in a love a ffair, the partnership is a natural union of Love, represented by Taurus, and Passion, represented by Aries. This re lationship is all about balance. Aries wants to jump right in and get into it, while Taurus prefers to go much more slowly. This can create a problem; Taurus loves to be wooed and romanced -- two concepts that are basically foreign to straightforward, brash, totally unsub tle Aries. An Aries-Taurus partnership can be a great learning experience for both Signs. Taurus c an help Aries rein in some of the more foolish, impractical impulses, and Aries can help Ta urus be more spontaneous and adventurous. Taurus is sensual, patient and gentle. Aries is attr acted to these qualities; Aries sees Taurus as their rock, totally stable and loyal forever. Taurus sees Aries as possessing that quality they want more of -- knowing when and how to grab on to life's opportunities. These Signs are a good balance for each other. Aries might sometimes play games with Taurus, playing off that Bullish laziness, or try to push Taurus into making hast y decisions, but the Bull can usually convince the Ram to slow down a bit. Aries brings excitement to the relationship, while Taurus brings security and romance. When Aries wants instant gratificat ion, Taurus can show just how sexy and sensual slow, deliberate movement can be. Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars (passion), and Taurus is ruled by the Planet Venus (love). Venus and Mars go well together; they repr esent the two necessary halves of the same relationship coin. The symbols are universally recognized as masculine and feminine, so this relationship is a good balance of these energies."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Aries is a Cardinal Sign, and Taurus is a Fixed Si gn. In this relationship, Aries is not going to get their own way no matter how hard they try -- so it's a much better idea not to try at all. Taurus is a Fixed Sign that won't budge; Aries will get much further with finesse and charm (Taurus is a real sucker for both) than with argument, since Taurus never loses a debate. Both Signs want to be the leader in the relationship, so compromise is essential. What's the best aspect of the Aries-Taurus relationship? The passionate nature of the partnership. This is an excellent balance of en ergy between masculine and feminine, impulsive and deliberate. Their contrasting personalities and ability to learn from one another make theirs a mutually giving and satisfying relationship. Aries and Gemini When Aries and Gemini come together in a love affair, they connect on a physical as well as an intellectual level. These two Signs love activity and stay optimistic even in the most trying of times. Signs that are two apart in the Zodiac usually enjoy excellent communication and a deep understanding of one another. Aries's independent, pioneering spirit is attractive to Gemini, who also values independence. If Gemini feels that Aries is being too controlling or if Aries takes Gemini's flirtatious nature too seriously, arguments may set the tone of the relationship. They create a good balance together: Aries wants to experience things and Gemini wants to discuss them. Together they can make all kinds of new di scoveries that they might have missed alone. Aries is a Fire Sign and Taurus is an Earth Sign. Aries wants to take charge of their own destiny, while Taurus needs to be assured of security and stability. Sometimes Taurus can be possessive, which independent Aries won't tolerate. If Aries can assure Taurus that the relationship is strong and that Aries isn't going anywhere, Taurus can be as flexible and tolerant of independence as Aries needs them to be. Both Aries and Gemini have tons of energy as well as common goals. Gemini is a thinker and a talker, prizes intellectual stimulation and freedo m and loves to look at all sides of an argument. Aries loves to jump into new projects and get t heir hands dirty, and Gemini will definitely take the time to find out Aries's reasons for choosing the projects they support. While Gemini can be wishy-washy, Aries is straightforward and decisive; th is is a great combination, but it is essential that Aries allows Gemini intellectual space. Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars and Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury. These Planets represent Passion and Communication, respectively. Because of their different approaches, Aries and Gemini work great in tandem -- they get t heir points across in different ways, but they definitely get those points across . Fevered debates will either spice up this union -- or ruin it. Aries needs to understand that Gemini loves a good, fiery argument, not to insult or dominate their challenger but as a great brain workout. Aries is a Fire Sign and Gemini is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and makes it spread, making this a great combination. Gemini also helps Aries realize their full potential -- Gemini definitely has the energy to keep up with Aries's fast pace and wild ideas! The combination of true, driving passion and intellectual prowess makes just about anything possible for these two. Both Signs have wide- ranging interests, and the best part is, at the end of a long and active day, Aries can come home and tell chat-hungry Gemini all about it! Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Gemini is a Mutable Sign. Aries naturally initiates new plans -- travel, sports or just a really exciting date idea -- and Ge mini is always up for anything, as long as they aren't forced into it. Another great dynamic between these two Signs is their low level of competition. Aries loves the glory and Gemini is perfectly happy to be in the background, pulling the strings. Both Signs are better at starting things than ending them, so if one partner gets bored with the direction the relationship is taking, t he other won't resent moving on toward something new. What's the best aspect of the Aries-Gemini relationship? Their abilit y to work together as a single unit. Together they can learn much more than either Sign would alone"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Aries and Cancer When Aries and Cancer come together in a love affa ir, it's a case of opposites attracting. Aries is rash and brash while Cancer is sensitive and emotional. Aries can certainly be emotional -- in a fiery, impetuous way that can completely overwhelm Cancer. Even though Cancer usually likes to take time with relationships, Aries's whirlwind approach can be ex tremely stimulating. Aries, on the other hand, may find the Cancerian sensitivit y appealing; it's a good balance for the typical Aries bluntness. Troubles may arise if Cancer's mood swings or Aries's aggression becomes hurtful. Both Signs must take time to listen to their partner's needs and understand that they're coming from different directions to meet a common goal. Cancer is the Sign of Home while Aries is the Sign of Self. One great dynamic between these two is that both Signs are extremely protective of thos e they love. Cancer uses that Crab shell to draw around themselves and their family and mate when trouble is near, while the Ram uses their strength and bravery, like a knight in shining armor. Cancer also provides Aries with a happy domestic life and emotional security. Sometimes they might build an idealized image of their Aries partner or be overly possessive , which can really grate on independent Aries. However, Aries can help by reassuring their Cancer partner that they are loved and cherished. Aries really needs to learn to listen to Cancer: the Crab operates on an instinctive level and their advice can help Aries avoid making silly mistakes caused by that typical Aries lack of planning. Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars and Cancer is ruled by the emotional Moon. Mars was the God of War, and Aries is a soldier meeting every challenge head-on. Aries's open, passionate nature appeals to Cancer, who often internalizes emotions and feelings. Cancer can have intense, feminine energy and Aries can help them learn to release it. The Moon controls tides of the Earth, quietly affecting all life; similarly, Cancer works behind the scenes (while Aries rushes into battle). Cancer tends to be sentimental and can teach Ar ies to slow down and appreciate life instead of always rushing on to the next thing. Aries is a Fire Sign and Cancer is a Water Sign. These two elements can be a great combination if they work together, using both emotion and action to get things done. Cancer can help Aries slow down and learn to be gentle, while Aries teaches Cancer to come out of their shells. But Cancer can be emotionally manipulative -- some times there's just too much Water dampening Aries's enthusiasm. Conversely, too much Fire can cause Water to evaporate, leaving Cancer emotionally raw. Aries and Cancer must talk openly and freely to ensure their balance is maintained. Aries and Cancer are both Cardinal Signs. Both Signs are initiators, but they have to learn to cooperate. On the surface, Aries is the leader , always rushing out to meet a challenge, but Cancer is also indirectly in charge through emotio nal control and the ability to weigh the situation. Cancer tends to compromise more easily while Aries can be unwilling to yield, so the Crab may have to accept giving in. What's the best aspect of the Aries-Cancer rela tionship? Once they realize they're on the same team, the combination of Fire and Water works well together. Aries is out there getting attention and Cancer is quietly supporting the back end. Each partner's ability to provide what the other is lacking makes theirs an equal relationship. Aries and Leo When Aries and Leo come together in a love affa ir, the sparks will fly! Both are Fire Signs, passionate and dynamic, with a healthy love of sp ortsmanship and competition. There is a lot of action in this relationship. Both Signs want to be the boss and problems can arise when their equally-large egos get in the way. These partner s have genuine admiration and respect for each other, but they need to learn to take turns commanding and giving orders -- even when they're only choosing a movie at the video store! This partnership is all about fiery passion, domination and who's on top -- and when! Both Signs can be impatient and proud. Leo likes to be adore d and their egos to be stroked, services which easily-bored Aries may not want to provide. Aries may also be bothered by Leo's flirtatious nature -- but this relationship is always exciting. Despite their sometimes noisy differences, Aries often looks to Leo as a guide or counselor. Leo is the Lion and, with Leo, Aries can be the lamb. As in the myth (The Lion and the Lamb), any differe nces between these two can be overcome. Both Signs are usually respected by others and it's im portant that this respect exists within the relationship as well."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars and Leo is ruled by the Sun. Both are masculine energy archetypes, and together they make a good comb ination -- they understand each other because they're coming from the same place. The Sun is about the self and Mars is about aggressive energy, so they're highly compatible and can make a powerful team. Both Aries and Leo are Fire Signs. This tends to be a very heated and passionate relationship. When it's good it's very, very good, but when it 's bad it's all about loud arguments and damaged egos. In this partnership ther e's always competition as to who's in charge. Since a love relationship shouldn't be about power, this c an become a problem. Both of these Signs have boundless energy, so both will always be on the go. Although they may disagree often, their differences of opinion don't last long -- Aries is too busy moving on to the next challenge to hold a grudge. Leo needs to remember not to be resentful if their Aries lover doesn't show them enough respect. Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Leo is a Fixed Sign. Aries gives Leo the assertiveness to charge ahead and take chances, while Leo can help teach Aries to stabilize and follow things through. Aries may sometimes hurt Leo's feelings by saying something hurtful without thinking. Conversely, Aries may be irritated by Leo's bo ssy nature and tendency to sulk. But they're both loyal and care about each other deeply, and when they can understand t here doesn't have to be a boss, their relationship can be exciting bliss. What's the best aspect of the Aries-Leo relation ship? The mutual admiration both Signs share for one another. With Aries as the initiator and Leo as the one who follows through, they both have their integral niche within the partnership. Their mutual energy and passion makes theirs a dynamic relationship. Aries and Virgo When Aries and Virgo come together in a love ma tch, they may think at first that they have nothing in common and nothing to learn from one another. This relationship takes time to develop as each partner must learn to understand where the other is coming from. Aries and Virgo can seem like total opposites: While Aries is bras h, dominant and aggressive, always jumping into new things and almost always impatient, Virgo is detail-oriented and quiet, even shy, and works patiently toward long-term goals. Aries's energy is fiery and impetuous while Virgo's is much slower and more grounded. It's these very differences, however, that can teach Aries and Virgo so much, once they just look beneath one an other's surfaces to see what lies beneath. Early in the relationship, Aries and Virgo may see nothing but one another's faults. Virgo thinks Aries is way too brash, and Aries thinks Virgo is extremely fussy. But if they focus on one another's strengths instead, they'll discover a great deal. Aries teaches Virgo about fun and excitement, about the spontaneity that is oft en missing in Virgo's life. Virgo teaches Aries patience and attention to detail, the knowle dge that the little things -- and moments -- are important too. Aries can teach thei r Virgo lover to take things less seriously. Virgo can teach Aries to be polite and value hard work. Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars and Virgo is ru led by the Planet Mercury. Aries wants to rush out and fight without wasting time preplanning or strategizing. Conversely, Virgo wants to analyze everything and work out all the details before ac ting. These are such opposite approaches that strife can result. Both Signs must make a con scious effort to learn from one another's method rather than letting their partner's natural rh ythm bother to the point of distraction. Aries is a Fire Sign and Virgo is an Earth Sign. Where Aries is all fiery impetuosity, Virgo is grounded practicality. Virgo weighs all the option s before devoting any serious effort, while Aries simply sees what they want and dives in! This is true both in career and in personal relationships -- which can be something of a stumbling block. If Aries has decided it's Virgo they want, they might be frustrated for some time to come, wait ing for Virgo to make up their mind about whether the relationship is a good idea. Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Virgo is a Mutable Sign. Virgo doesn't need to be the leader or the boss; they're glad to follow another's suggestion once they decide it's a viable one. Aries, on the other hand, wants to make those suggestions -- every time. This is a beneficial dynamic if these two Signs are working as a team toward a common goal. What's the best aspect of the Aries-Virgo relati onship? Their great effectiveness as a team -- business or personal. Their personalities, opposite in so many ways, make for a highly complementary relationship."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Aries and Libra When Aries and Libra come together in a love affair , the inherent polarity of the Zodiac is invoked. Aries and Libra are directly opposite one another in the Zodiac -- 180 degrees apart. Each Sign possesses qualities that the other lacks; combined with Libra's natural yen for harmony, this can be a relationship that enjoys great balance. Aries is the Sign of Self while Libra is the Sign of Partnership, and the differences continue: Aries is impulsive, excitable and ready to jump right into something new and exciting, while Libra is indecisive, peace-loving and prefers a calm, smooth approach. Aries can learn from Libra that their own way isn't neces sarily the best way. These two Signs share the great sexual attraction common to all Signs opposite in polarity. At the same time, though this pair's connection is amazing when it's good, it can be extremely challenging when it's bad. All polarities have energi es that tend to tangle or knot if understandings can't be reached. As a combination, Aries and Libra are well-balanced. Charming, cultured Libra can teach brash Aries something about style. Libra prizes harmony in a relationship and will go to great lengths to maintain it. Aries is very decisive and can teach indecisive Libra about relying on intuition for answers. Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars and Libra is rul ed by the Planet Venus. This is a great match, as these are the Planets of Passion and Love, respectively. Venus and Mars go well together as they're the two sides of the love relationship coin. They're universally recognized as male and female and this relationship is a good balance of masculine and feminine energy. Venus is about the beauty of romance while Mars is about the passion of romance. What a good combination! Aries is a Fire Sign and Libra is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and helps it grow and spread. Aries can have a very positive effect on Libra's growth, idea s and progress; Aries can help Libra put their ideas into action. Working together can be challengi ng at times, however, due to their polarity. Aries's fast-paced, impetuous approach to projects may conflict with Libra's more balanced, intellectual approach. However, both Signs have wi de-ranging interests, and at the end of a long, active day, Aries can come home full of interesting stories to tell the more cerebral Libra! Aries and Libra are both Cardinal Signs. They both have a lot of initiative -- but lack in follow- through. They both tend to start things they're neve r going to finish, whether it's a job, a project, a relationship ... Aries will appear to be the leader because of their energy and forceful nature, but Libra leads from an intellectual standpoint. Both Si gns want to be in charge, but Aries uses force and sometimes intimidation to get what they want while Libra uses charm and sometimes manipulation. Compromise is essential to this re lationship's health. Diplomatic Libra has a much easier time with compromise than does Aries, who strongly dislikes yielding to another person, viewing it as submission. Libra may have to give in more often to Aries's wishes in order to keep the peace that they so cherish. What's the best aspect of the Aries-Libra relati onship? The harmony resulting from the union of Venus and Mars. The balance between self and ot her represented by this polarity is a great learning experience for both Signs. Each brings to the relationship what the other is missing, making for a wonderful balance. Aries and Scorpio When Aries and Scorpio come together in a love ma tch, it can be the kind of relationship where they both wonder how they ever managed apart. Both Signs love power and they can achieve just about anything -- as long as they learn to share the spotlight. Scorpio is very focused; once they set their sights on Aries, Aries is most lik ely powerless to resist! Scorpio has a deeper and more complex devotion to this relationship than does Aries. These two Signs tend to engage in heavy, heated arguments. Their connection is highly passionate and often argumentative, because both partners have jealous tendencies. Scorpio tends to be more patient, but is also more po ssessive than Aries -- and can lash out (with that Scorpion sting!) when their feelings get hurt. Despite their differences in emotional involvement, both partners love risk and taking chances; this is not a boring relationship! Aries and Scorpio can have lots of adventures together. They may have trouble understanding one another -- Aries is a true extrovert, totally up-front and open, while Scorpio is more inward, emotional and, at times, manipulative. Sometimes a truce is necessary to keep things running smoothly!"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Aries and Scorpio are both ruled by the Planet Mars (Passion), and Scorpio is also ruled by Pluto (Power). When two people with Mars's energy come together, it's like two soldiers on a battlefield -- they're either allies or deadly enemies. Mars also represents passion, so Aries and Scorpio tend to have an exciting time together (both in the bedroom and out of it!). Arguments are normal in such a challenge-oriented couple -- and making up is definitely something to look forward to! Pluto adds extra intensity to this dynamic. Aries is a Fire Sign and Scorpio is a Water Sign. These two elements can be a great combination if they work together, combining emotion and phys ical action to get things done. Scorpio is a strategist, and can help Aries slow down and learn how to plan battles before jumping into them. Aries teaches Scorpio to let go and move on when their efforts are thwarted. However, Water can also put out a Fire, and Scorpio's tendency toward emotional manipulation has that effect on Aries -- it's too much Water dampening Aries's enthusiasm. Conversely, too much Fire makes Water evaporate away; when under emotional stress, Scorpio can become vindictive. It's essential for Aries and Scorpio to work together, not against one another. Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Scorpio is a Fixed Sign. Aries can teach Scorpio about spontaneity -- doing things just for the experience, rather than always having an agenda in mind. Scorpio can help teach Aries to stabilize and finish things rather than always jumping into new projects without completing what's already on the table.

This relationship is torrid and exciting and both partners are always ready for a new adventure. They both crave life exper ience of their own and don't like to waste time just reading about it or listening to others tell about theirs. They do need to be careful, however: This could be an accident-prone relationship as Aries is always in a rush and Sagittarius tends to look at everything but the obvious. Also, as much as these two have in common, it may be difficult to maintain a long-term relationship when both parties have so much energy to start new things -- but not much interest in following through. Aries and Sagittarius make great friends as we ll as lovers. They truly understand one another's optimistic view of life. Problems are rare, but Sagittarius has an even greater need for independence than does Aries, who can sometimes be overly possessive. Aries is also a bit more sensitive than the fun and flirty Archer; Sagittarius can tend to put their foot in their mouth, so to speak, by speaking without thinking. The good th ing is, both Signs are able to forgive and forget fast. They don't have time to spend holding a grudge! Aries is ruled by Mars (Passion) and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter (Philosophy and Luck). Both of these Planets are masculine, so these Signs tend to look at the world in the same way.

Their common interests and similar pers onalities make them a very compatible couple."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Aries and Capricorn When Aries and Capricorn come together in a love ma tch, they must work hard to maintain their mutual energy. Their approaches can seem almost opposite to one another -- Aries is all about acting without bothering to consider where the action is directed or what it will attain, while Capricorn is all about judging whether (or how much ) it will benefit them before they take action. Aries moves fast and, to Capricorn, at least, s eems to risk it all. Capricorn abhors unnecessary risk. They move at a slower pace, working inexhaustibly toward well-defined goals (usually related to career or other forms of public advance ment). Both partners always get where they're going, only in different ways -- and usually wh ere they're going is totally different, too! Capricorn is generally rather quiet and unassuming while Aries is much louder and more flashy. They're both very stubborn and think their way is be st, so in order to work together, they have to agree to disagree. Their philosophies are very different: Aries looks for the shortcut while Capricorn wants to follow the rules, assuming t hey're a tried-and-true path to success. How does this manifest itself in a romantic relationship ? Aries is all about impetuous, passionate pursuit of the one they want, without stopping to think whether the one they've chosen is really the right one for them. Capricorn, on the other hand, likes to analyze how much a potential love partner will be able to help them advance in life, and will use that as the basis of their decision of whether or not to pursue the relationship. If these two can meet and get together, however, they can teach one another things they wouldn't learn on their own. Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars (Passion) and Ca pricorn is ruled by the Planet Saturn (Karma). These Planets often work against one another, ju st as Aries and Capricorn have to struggle to find common ground. These two can definitely help one another, however, especially on a project: Saturn has strong powers of perseverance, but Mars has the energy and drive it takes to get things done. These two Signs might make a better duo in the workplace than in the bedroom! Both partners tend to be resolute and neither gives up easily; if their energies are not channeled in positive ways, together these Planets may in flict cruelty, even violence on one another, or cause one another to repress their emotions. Aries must take care not to work against Capricorn, who, in turn, must try not to dampen Aries's fiery spirit. Aries is a Fire Sign and Capricorn is an Earth Sign. While Aries is dynamic, Capricorn is more grounded and practical. Capricorn's approach is to ask themselves, 'What good will this do as I work toward my main plan in life?' while Aries simp ly sees what is desirable at the moment and goes after it with no set plan in mind. Aries and Capricorn are both Cardinal Signs. Bo th partners are initiators, but they have such widely varying goals and interests that they work better when they each have a particular, well- defined role. Aries is the leader on the surface -- they rush out to get things going and knock down any barriers in the way. But Capricorn is indirectly in charge: They're always working steadily toward their goals. It's important for both partners to understand that compromise is their key to success. What's the best aspect of the Ar ies-Capricorn relationship? They each bring unique qualities to their union. Once they can learn to allow each other to be themselves they can blend well to make a whole. Theirs is a challenging relationship, but if they can learn from each other it's worth it! As with any relationship based in mutual love and respect, most obstacles can be overcome with sound communication and goodwill. Aries and Aquarius When Aries and Aquarius come together in a love match, the combination of Aquarius vision and Aries action makes them a highly creative pair. Thei r relationship is anything but static; they can be competitive, but life with these two is never du ll! Zodiac Signs that are two apart tend to have a special connection, and these are no exception. They are great friends as they communicate really well. They have a special understanding of one another's idealistic, enthusiastic outlook on life. They both crave excitement and new expe riences -- the wilder and stranger, the better. They're both into thrills and showing off."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Many Aries-Aquarius relationships are based on mutual admiration. Aries loves how unique Aquarius is, their inventive vision of the world; Aquarius loves Aries for their energy and initiative - - Aquarius gets new ideas all the time but sometimes finds it hard to carry them out. Since both Signs prize independence, Aries's tendency toward possessiveness can push Aquarius to become aloof or detached as a self-preservat ion tactic. Though they have that special connection, they do see the world in very diffe rent lights, which they both need to understand. Aries can be too involved for Aquarius's taste, and Aquarius in turn may be too unpredictable for Aries. As it turns out, Aquarius is the one Sign t hat has Aries beat when it comes to spontaneity! As long as both partners reassure each other that the relationship is important and secure, things will be just fine. Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars (Passion) and Aq uarius is ruled by the Planets Saturn (Karma) and Uranus (Rebellion). Aquarius gets its great, progressive vision from Uranus, and its social conscience and philanthropy from Saturn. Mars, then, can make a great addition to the mix -- it brings passionate, direct action to all these lofty thoughts and ideals. Aries is a Fire Sign and Aquarius is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and helps it spread; similarly, Aquarius can help Aries think up new schemes and then realize them. Aquarius stimulates Aries intellectually, something that most of the other Signs fail to do. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, so mentally active Aquarius is sure to provide physically active Aries with plenty of fodder for new adventures and crusades. Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. Aries gives Aquarius the confidence to charge ahead rather than just sitting in the labo ratory concocting new ideas. Aquarius can help Aries stabilize and complete projects rather than jumping into new plans without completing the old ones. They have a lot of respect and admi ration for one another, which helps smooth any obstacles in their relationship. What's the best aspect of the Ar ies-Aquarius relationship? Their ability to achieve so much when they work together. Cardinal Fire and Fixed Air cover all the bases. Theirs is a relationship of vision as well as practice. Aries and Pisces When Aries and Pisces come together in a love match, they can be very good for one another. Aries is a strong Sign; they are almost complete ly prey to their impulses, which they follow without a second thought to the outcome or possible consequences. Dreamy Pisces is much quieter and more internally-focused; they're the Poets of the Zodiac. On the surface an Aries and a Pisces may seem an unlikely pair, but when ther e's love involved, they can truly fulfill one another's needs. Pisces is very intuitive, both as a person and as a lover; Aries must take care to return this favor so Pisces won't begin to s ee their Aries partner as stingy and selfish. Aries is a leader with tons of initiative. When Aries finds someone attractive they'll launch the pursuit without a second thought. When the 'prey' is gentle Pisces, Aries tends to take on the role of protector. The funny thing is, Pisces is the re al protector, as the intuitive, deeply understanding partner who provides a relaxing sort of refuge for he ctic Aries. Pisces is a Water Sign; they can fill any container, so to speak. They are so givi ng and empathetic that sometimes they can become something of a doormat -- they give themselves co mpletely to their partners, and if their partner can't do the same, trouble may result. Pisces understands Aries in a deeper way than most other Signs do, so this can help alleviate this type of problem: Pisces knows how to keep Aries from becoming overly brash or rash. Together they fo rm a dynamic team when they combine Aries's directness with Pisces's intuitive understanding of other people. Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars (Passion) and Pisces is ruled by the Planets Jupiter (Luck) and Neptune (Illusions). Mars brings passionate ac tion to Neptune's dreamlife. Aries helps Pisces bring their fantasies into reality. Jupiter lets Pisces help Aries tone down their overt style of operation. Aries is a Fire Sign and Pisces is a Water Sign. Though these opposite elements can sometimes create trouble for one another (Fire makes Water evaporate, Water douses Fire). However, they can combine to make a great team: Pisces can he lp Aries relax a little and learn listen to others' feelings, while Aries teaches Pisces to get out into the world and take the kinds of risks that lead to real payoff. This is an effective lesson for Pi sces, who definitely has the brain power to figure out which risks are good ones to take and which are best left alone. Aries and Pisces must simply negotiate to ensure their balance is maintained."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Unlike Aries, Pisces doesn't need to be the leader or 'on top.' They enjoy lending a hand when they're needed, but certainly don't need to direct a project -- a good thing, since Aries n eeds that position for themselves. Together these two Signs can achieve a positive end to any project they decide to undertake. What's the best aspect of the Aries-Pisces relationship? They really have a lot to learn from each other.

With it, however, there is a stubborn, firm-set nature that is difficult to change. The governing planet, Venus, emotional and fraught with primitive urge, furthers these Taurian trends rather than repressing them. At the same time, it accounts for the sympathetic side of this strong willed nature. Taurus people are won over through emotion rather than by reason. Taurus persons are opportunists but they take what comes along rather than going after it. They absorb ideas and retain them, due to the remarkable memory so often found with persons of this sign. Being practical minded, they plan ahead and usually carry their purposes through to a finish. By then, they regard any ideas that they have borrowed as being something all their own. Their generosity is genuine and when they make money, they are liberal with it, particularly among friends.

Hey, this Sign has a Fixed Quality attached to it after all, so expect that thing s will o ccasionally grind to a halt. That said, Taurean s don't start out with the in tention of get ting stu ck.

The good news for Bulls is that on ce they get to the fin ish line, they'll swaddle t hemselves in material goods. A self-ind ulgent bea st? Perhaps, but if you toiled as laboriously as these fo lks do, you'd need some goodies, too. Taurus is rule d by the Planet Venus, a lovely gal who didn't deny herself many things. In ancient Rom an mythology, Venus was the Goddess of Love, Beauty and Pleasure, and Taureans have pretty much taken up where she left off. Bulls are fond of all things pretty, whether it's in their home, at a museum or on the stage. Life as one sweet pas de deux is how the Taurean-born like it. To onloo kers, this may look like so much materialism and blessed excess, but Bulls really aren't intere sted in living without beauty in their lives. Beauty to the Bull also comes in the way of a happy home life, one which includes a partner and a stable re lationsh ip. Taureans value har mony in their personal lives, so they'll work hard on keeping the ir mate happy. The Bull's penchant for sensua l pleasures, of co urse, can only help things alon g!

Probably not, although these folks do have to manage their tendency to latch on a bit tight. At the end of th e day, however, the Taurean-born are true romantics and loyal to the core. The Element associated with Taurus is Earth. No pie-in-the-sky for these pra ctica l folks, sin ce they'd much rather be on terra firma. Bulls ten d toward conservatism, and this is often seen in their day-to-day behavior. No far-out schemes (that's Air) or shrie king ult imatums (more like Fire) here. Taureans far prefer to take ea ch day slowly and steadily and work toward their ult imate goal. Along these lines, those born und er this Sign are happy to stick with their proje cts until they have reached a successfu l con clusion. They are also extremely patient and dependable along th e way. Does that sound earthy enough? The only kink in th is well-oiled cha in is the heckler in the ga llery that tries to u pbraid the Bull.

Seeing as how Bulls are genera lly strong and well-bui lt, it' s no surpr ise that the se folks enjoy testing their strength on the f ield of p lay.

Their sensual nature has a way of erasing any mistakes! Since Taurus rule s the neck and throat, Bulls would be wise to keep a silky scarf at hand, ideally in a warm (and soothing) earth tone.

All Tauruses have to learn to agree to disagree, and especially two Tauruses together; they need to recognize that their relationship is too good to jeopardize with minor arguments. Taureans are blessed with stro ng willpower and commitment. They love the wooing process of courting, so the beginning, building stages of their relationship may stretch out deliciously. Taureans rarely rush into a relationship, but onc e they're committed, it's solid -- maybe even for life. When two Taureans get together, both provide and expect to tal devotion.

Taurus may want too much for Gemini's taste early in the relationship, but Gemini can become dependable and steady -- Taurus must simply be patient. Taurus's sedate, practical approach to life differs greatly from Gemini's more light, intellectual approach. This can be a difficult dynamic, since Gemini may see Taurus as a bit dull while Taurus may see Gemini as flighty and lacking in substance.

Gemini makes decisions based on intellect (and whim), while Taurus is more practical. Taurus asks, \"How will this help me achieve my goals in life?\" while Gemini goes with the moment, never feeling too pressured to stick to a set plan.

The Taurus-Cancer partnership tends to be a ha ppy one due to this mutual enjoyment of the security and comfort of home. They love a solid home base, a strong relationship, nice possessions, good food: all the comforts of domesti c life. Theirs is often the ideal family that people of other Signs strive for, with strong ties between them and a relationship that is family- oriented rather than toward the outside world. Their only major problems arise when Taurus insists on having its own way and Cancer responds by sulking. Taurus must understand Cancer's emotional sensitivity, and Cancer needs rely on open, honest communication than on emotional blackmail. Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love) and Cancer is ruled by the Moon (Emotions). Both of these celestial bodies vibrate with feminine energy. Cancer often keeps emotions bottled up and simmering inside, which can lead to occasional boil- overs. Thus, Cancer is attracted to Taurus's open, honest, unafraid nature. As the Moon controls the tides of the Earth, quietly affecting all life, so does Cancer, manipulating behind the scene s. Cancer tends to be sentimental, and both partners prefer to enjoy each other rat her than socializing with large groups. Taurus is an Earth Sign and Cancer is a Water Sign. Water and Earth are compatible as tangible, physical entities. As a Water Sign, Cancer is bo rn to nurture an Earth Sign like Taurus the way rain nurtures Earth and helps crops grow. In turn, Taurus tends to have a more stable view of life than does Cancer and is less prone to emotional turmoil; therefore, Taurus can help Cancer stabilize their tumultuous feelings. Both Signs must be careful in this relationship, however: Taurus may tire of Cancer's mood swings, and Cancer may in turn feel that Taurus is insensitive to their needs. Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Cancer is a Cardi nal Sign. Taurus has Fixed habits; they won't change an opinion once it's formed. This can prov ide Cancer with an emotional rock, as Taurus is entirely dedicated to the relationship. In turn, Cancer can bring new inspiration to the relationship and start new projects that Taurus will enjoy taking over later."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"What's the best aspect of the Taurus-Cancer rela tionships? The steady, reliable team they make. Both Signs are dependable and nurturing, stro ngly oriented toward domestic life together. A mutual love of home and security makes theirs an ideal long-term, family relationship. Taurus and Leo When Taurus and Leo come together in a love affair, they can be a great couple because they know how to stroke one another's egos and love to have their own strok ed! They have similar needs: Taurus needs plenty of affection, to be loved and cherished, while Leo likes compliments and wants to be adored and admired. They're both extremely loyal and possessive lovers. Since they have such similar desires, they can gener ally provide for one another's needs quite well. These two Signs both love status and possession s. They prize physical comfort and luxury; Leo is often flamboyant about attentions and gift-givi ng, which will greatly please Taurus, who loves the most traditional forms of courtship. Though they can work together quite well, it's not all roses between these two; both Signs are very stubborn and must work hard to understand and accept one another. Taurus is ruled by the Planet Venus (Love and Money) and Leo is ruled by the Sun (Self). The Sun radiates warmth and light; Leo indeed radiates this kind of energy and enthusiasm. Venus is about love, beauty and luxury. This combination of masculine and feminine energy helps these two Signs admire and sustain one another. As a matter of fact, Venus is never more than 48 degrees from the Sun, so they belong close together! The Sun represents life and Venus represents love; as long as they are careful to understand each other, their combination is a positive one. Taurus is an Earth Sign and Leo is a Fire Sign. They are both ambitious but in quite different ways. Leo longs for fame and fortune, while Taurus strives for security and stability in life and love. Since both these Signs expect to be the boss, they may tend to battle for domination. During arguments, Taurus abhors conceding a point, seeing it as acceptance of domination -- unless they see that it's the practical course. Their battl es can be fierce and epic, but as long as both of them can be reassured that the relationship is important to t heir partner, th ings will go more smoothly. Taurus and Leo are both Fixed Signs. This means they're both stubborn; once they make up their minds about something, it takes a lot to get t hem to change it. That's why their arguments can get so intense -- both of them truly believe they're ri ght and that theirs is the only right way to look at an issue! They also both tend to shy away from change; they like to get things settled and then let them continue on as is indefinitely -- even if something could be improved. If they decide that they want their love relationship to stay, almost nothing will convince them to leave their partner. This is good for the stability of the relationship but can be bad if the relationship is destructive or inhibitive. What's the best aspect of the Taurus-Leo relationship? Their mutual admiration. Both Signs have very powerful personalities, so neither will dominate the other -- no matter how hard they try! Others see them as an excellent match as they share the commi tment to fulfilling their goals. Taurus and Virgo When Taurus and Virgo come together in a love affair, it's a union of innate practicality. Both of these Signs employ practicality in their daily lives as the most efficient means to most problems. They can be quite sincere and devoted to one an other; as people, both have a great deal of integrity. Virgo likes Taurus's strength and dedication while Taurus appreciates Virgo's quick mind. Due to Virgo's naturally cautious nature, this rela tionship can take awhile to develop, but once it's established that both partners are in it for the long haul, it's like a runaway locomotive, running on its own power and difficult to stop. These two Signs have much in common: They highly value common sense and practicality; they're both materi alistic but work hard for the creature comforts they so enjoy. Taurus is more sensual and indul gent than Virgo is; Virgo tends to be the inhibitive force in the relationship, tending not to get involv ed in the chaos of life in favor of analyzing all available options. Virgo's analysis leads to criticis m, which Taurus can tend to take too seriously. Conversely, Taurus's stubborn nature can get on Virgo's nerves, causing Virgo to criticize even more! This pair must take care not to take one another too seriously. The good thing is, they're similar enough that they can learn to be patient with one another, especially Virgo, who loves to indulge Taurus's penchant for fine treatment and good food."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love and Money) and Vi rgo is ruled by Mercury (Communication). Both of these Planets are close to the Sun, so they're closely related though they seem very different. Venus is physical; it's about romance and sens uality, both of which are important to Taurus. Mercury is about communication and it's androgynous -- Virgo will take on the form that it chooses. Virgo is very good at understanding other people and can easily learn to be the romantic and sensual partner that Taurus loves. Both partners are so devoted and romantic, their arguments surely won't focus on those issues. Taurus and Virgo are both Earth Signs. Earth Signs are steady and practical, concerned with possessions. Taurus and Virgo together love to surround themselves with beautiful things -- an opulent home, gorgeous artwork, classy cars. Their love of luxury and their desire to be financially secure ensure that this couple w ill work hard who never overspend. Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Virgo is a Mutable Sign. Taurus is stubborn and tends to make up their mind for good; more flexible Virgo can help teach Taurus the value in bending the mind a bit -- when it's practical, of course. What's the best aspect of the Taurus-Virgo relati onship? Their dedication to working toward the same goals. Both partners enjoy luxury and nice things, and Virgo likes helping Taurus achieve their goals. Their common interests and desires make theirs a highly compatible relationship. When Taurus and Libra come together in a love affair, it can be the unification of two halves of a whole. These two Signs are thought of as being karmically linked. They're both looking for security in a relationship and they share a love of art, poetry and culture. This relationship may start slowly as, on the surfac e, they might have few common interests. However, once they understand one another they may learn they have much more in common than was first apparent. Taurus and Libra both have a love for the arts. They appreciate fine dining and theater, collecting art and music. Pleasure -- physical, aesthetic -- is a premium for these two Signs. They both love to woo and be wooed; courtship is a necessary pa rt of any romantic relationship for them, and since they both have this need, they fit well together. Taurus appreciates Libra's charm; if stubborn Taurus doesn't get their way, diplomatic Libra is able to smooth things over and keep the peace. Libra appreciates the luxuries that sensual Taurus provides them. They also have much to teach one another: Libra can help Taurus see the different sides of a situation, and Taurus can help Libra overcome their notorious indecision. Both Taurus and Libra are ruled by the Planet Venus (Love and Money). These partners share a love of beauty, luxury, love and romance. Libra in particular is keen on balance; both partners have charming personalities and desire harmony in their personal relationships. Venus's influence can create problems as well, however; these two Signs can both tend toward laziness and snobbery, Taurus based on possessions and Libra based on intellect. Taurus is an Earth Sign and Libra is an Air Sign. Taurus gets through life relying on their innate practicality, while Libra relies on intellectual ex ploration. Taurus asks , \"How will this help me achieve my goals in life?\" Libra, on the other hand, focuses on intellectual stimuli, whether it's practical or not. Conflicts can arise in this relati onship if Taurus seems too possessive or Libra seems too flirtatious and social. Sometimes they just don't quite understand where the other is coming from. If they want theirs to be a long-last ing relationship, they must learn to accept that their views of the world are different in tone and focus. Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Libra is a Cardinal Sign. In general in this relati onship, Libra initiates it and Taurus keeps it going. A Fixed Sign won't budge, and Libra needs to understand the Bull's stubborn tendency. With some gentle persuasion, anything is possible -- and there is no Sign more gifted at gentle, subtle persuasion and charm than Libra. On the other hand, Libra's indecision may irritate direct, to-the-point Taurus. As long as Taurus tones down the tendency to declare that their way is the only acceptable way to do or see something, Libra can accept Taurus's decisions. What's the best aspect of the Taurus-Libra rela tionship? Their shared love of pleasure, beauty and culture. Aesthetics are integral to both pa rtners, and their similar tastes and loves make theirs a relationship of great romance and harmony."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Taurus and Scorpio When Taurus and Scorpio come together in a love affair, their union is nothing if not intense, whether that's in a positive or a negative way. They are opposite Signs in the Zodiac, giving them a special, complex connection. They can combi ne to make a whole, each partner's strengths balancing the other's weaknesses. Their sexual attr action is likely to be o ff the charts! Taurus and Scorpio have tons in common, but because their pe rsonalities are so powerful, they often swing between passionate love and passionate disagreement! Taurus and Scorpio both have deep desires, T aurus for possessions and Scorpio for power. They're both concerned with wealth and resour ces, and they're both intensely passionate about all sorts of things. Taurus is a bit more self -focused than Scorpio, who is more concerned with their lover and immediate family. Both of these Signs have a great, deep-rooted need for security in a relationship, but with slightly differ ent focuses. While Taurus prizes honesty and forthrightness and abhors infidelity, Scorpio love s to be mysterious. A Scorpio's need for security is more about the need to be constantly reassured that their emotional connection with their loved one is strong. The good thing is, Taurus needs this reassurance too -- and is also willing to provide it for their Scorpio lover. Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love and Money) and Scorpio is ruled by Mars (Passion) and Pluto (Power). This combination is ve ry intense, thanks to Pluto's influence, but it's an excellent balance of masculine and feminine energy. Scorpi o and Taurus together form the basis of all love relationships -- love and passion. Venus and Mars go well together; Venus is about the beauty of romance, and Mars is about the passion of ro mance. Scorpio is smoldering and intense (and intensely sexual), and Taurus, a sensual and tireless lo ver, is attracted to th is intensity. In turn, Scorpio enjoys the devotion inherent in Venus-ruled Taurus. Taurus is an Earth Sign and Scorpio is a Wate r Sign. Scorpio tends to be very deep -- like an ocean, too much upset will cause a tidal wave! Wh en Scorpio feels crossed by a lover, watch out for that Scorpion's tail, which can whip out and st ing their lover without warning! It's a good thing that these two Signs are so strongly loyal to each other. But while Taurus is open, with everything laid bare on the surface, Scorpio is more secretive and inscrutable. They can both teach one another about their opposite views of life (direc t versus complex). Another factor adding a tantalizing dimension to this union is the two Signs' mutual tendency toward jealousy. Taurus loves it when Scorpio displays their jealous -- it means Taurus is adored and appreciated! Taurus and Scorpio are both Fixed Signs. This means they're both pretty stubborn and resolute once their minds are made up. Let's hope their minds agree -- if not, they're prone to fights the likes of which neither experiences with any other Sign. Taurus seems to prevail as the dominant partner, but that's not always the case. Scorpi o can \"win\" through more devious means, such as employing emotional manipulation to get what they want. These partners must learn to discuss their views and needs openly and to reach a compromi se if they want their union to be lasting and happy. This largely depends on Scorpio's ability to l earn to trust Taurus. The relationship will only fail if the two partners truly cannot over come their opinionated, fixed stances. What's the best aspect of the Taurus-Scorpio re lationship? Their powerful connection that can shine when obstacles to intimacy are cleared away . When Scorpio realizes that Taurus is there for the long term and won't create the misery that some Scorpios attract to their lives, this relationship can blossom. Taurus and Sagittarius When Taurus and Sagittarius come together in a love affair, their connection can be incredibly passionate and steamy, but they mu st give themselves time to l earn about the particular energy this relationship generates. They both have much to gain from their union! While Sagittarius thrives when they're constantly experiencing ne w people, places, foods and more, Taurus can be quite content with routine as it affords them the security they so prize. Early in the relationship, Taurus might tend to demand more commitment and stability than Sagittarius is ready to give, but if Taurus can learn to be patient, Sagittarius c an definitely come to appreciate the comforts of hearth and home. These two Signs approach life quite differently. Ta urus tends to be sedate and practical, which offsets Sagittarius's restless demeanor. Sagittarius may have trouble with Taurus's seemingly dull complacency, and will try to rev Taurus up -- which is about as smart and works about as well as trying to spark a slow, steady Bull to action! (In other words, watch out for those horns!) Taurus actually has much to offer Sagittarius, though Sagittarius may have trouble admitting their need for a secure base. Sagittarius can bring lots of fun and adventure into Taurus's life."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love) and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter (Luck). The Venus influence lends Taurus their love of beauty, luxury and sensual pleasures. The Jupiter influence is what marks Sagittarius as the Teacher of the Zodiac -- Jupiter is concerned with philosophy, higher learning, expansion, optimism, luck and trav el. Together this combination of beauty and expansion, masculine and feminine energy is why these two Signs admire and sustain one another. Taurus is an Earth Sign and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. Sagittarius needs space to move around and flame brightly; Taurus, on the other hand, is down to earth and needs stability. Sagittarius relies on feeling and impulse to direct them thro ugh life, while Taurus is practical and concerned with efficiency. These approaches to life can either be complementary or sources of stress if the two Signs can't learn to understand and accept on e another. As long as they both take care to reassure the other that the relationship is sp ecial and important (Taurus, especially, needs this reassurance), thin gs will run smoothly between them. Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign. Taurus is stubborn; once their mind is made up, it takes a lot to convince them to chan ge it. Sagittarius craves variety. If this urge to experience something new strays into the realm of experiencing new partners, Sagittarius had best beware. Taurus does not tolerate infidelit y; if cheating occurs, Taurus will be deeply wounded and the relationship may not survive the stra in. In turn, Taurus must give Sagittarius the freedom to enjoy other experiences and people (on a platonic level, of course!). Taurus can teach Sagittarius the benefits of a secure relationship; Sagittarius can show Taurus that flexibility is sometimes better than following a set, well-worn path. What's the best aspect of the Taurus-Sagittarius relationship? The new perspectives they can give each other once each partner becomes familiar with the ways in which they differ. Theirs is a stable and happy relationship once they understand and accept these differences. Taurus and Capricorn When Taurus and Capricorn come together in a love match, it's a practical, sensible partnership. These two Signs share a certain down-to-earth logic and interest in efficiency. Taurus is not interested in risking more than is necessary in terms of emotional connection and involvement, and Capricorn is similarly disinterested in risk, but more in terms of money and career. Capricorn's career is one of the great focuses of their lives; they're interested in scaling the heights and tend to set very high standards for themselves to adhere to. Taurus has high standards as well, but regarding love, relationships and possessions. These two Signs admire one another's dedication and strength, but, while they have this in common as well as a dependable, realistic, some what conservative approach to life (Capricorn more than Taurus), a love relationship between them can go stale fast. The problem? They're actually rather different at their cores. Taurus may begin to find Capricorn too conservative and restrictive; Capricorn may start to think Taurus is too lazy and doesn't care enough about career and status. If Taurus can encourage Capricorn to relax a little and appreciate the fruits of labor, and if Capricorn can help motivate Taurus to ac hieve goals and make dreams a reality, their union can be smooth, happy and long-lasting. Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love) and Capricorn is ruled by Saturn (Karma). Venus is a warm, feminine energy while Saturn is a cold masculine energy. Venus is all about sensual pleasures, the aesthetics of love, the beauty of art. All of these stimulate Taurus and heighten their appreciation of life and love. Saturn, on the other hand, is about hard work and discipline to achieve goals. Taurus will show Capricorn how to enjoy a well-deserved break every so often and how to appreciate beauty and comfort. Capricorn can teach Taurus to be more disciplined and to keep reaching out for what one wants. Taurus and Capricorn are both Earth Signs. This couple loves to indulge in material possessions. They want to possess and be surrounded by beautif ul things -- a lovely home, designer clothing, luxurious cars, works of art. Since they're both su ch hard workers, they can usually attain all these things, and hardly ever need fight about impracticality or overindulgence. Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Capricorn is a Cardi nal Sign. Taureans won't change their minds once they're made up. They possess a quiet, steadfas t determination. Instead of finding this dull or restrictive, Capricorn regards it as a good, comf orting thing: Taurus is clearly dedicated to the relationship. What's the best aspect of the Taurus-Capricorn relationship? The similarity of their values and their dedication to the same goals. Both partner s enjoy luxury and nice things, and they share resources well. Their mutual interests make theirs a highly compatible relationship."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Taurus and Aquarius When Taurus and Aquarius come together, they can move mountains -- if they can figure out how to coordinate their efforts. Taurus's practical, down-to-earth approach to life is about as opposite as can be to Aquarius's unconventional, out-of-th is-world approach to just about everything! Taurus resists change and Aquarius is the most progressive of all 12 Signs of the Zodiac. How do these two get along, then? They may appear to have few common interests, but they share a very strong desire to succeed -- which means they may make better business partners than lovers. Since these two can both be extremely opinionated, they must take care not to get into arguments, especially because of their dissimilar reactions to tension: When Taurus gets angry they tend to charge like the Bulls that they are; when Aquarius feels pressure, they tend to pull away, using an aloof demeanor to put space betwe en themselves and their 'tormentor.' This can make Taurus push even harder, causing Aquarius to pull furthe r away ... and so on. They like to do things their way with as little fuss as po ssible. Modern, progressive Aquarius may find Taurus's dedication to routine a bit boring. Taurus will find Aquarius exciting yet may feel frustrated trying to keep up with this inventor's quick mind. Despite their differences, however, they do have something to offer one another. Though Aquarius will have a hard time admitting it (even to themselves), they'll find Taurus's so lid base to be comfortingly supportive, and Taurus will find Aquarius stimulating, if not altogether comfortable. Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love) and Aquarius is ruled by Saturn (Karma) and Uranus (Rebellion). Venus is a warm, feminine energy and Saturn a cold masculine energy. Uranus is about all things strange and unusual. Venus focuses on beauty, rom ance and sensual pleasures, all of which are important and pleasing to Taurus. Saturn causes Aquarius to focus on hard work and discipline to achieve goals; Uranus lends an Aquarius that revolutionary thinking. Taurus can show Aquarius that life is based on emotions and improved by beauty and comfort. Aquarius can show Taurus how to keep striving for betterment -- and how to move away from something if it isn't working, an important lesson for Taurus to learn. Taurus is an Earth Sign and Aquarius is an Air Sign. Aquarius focuses on intellectual connections and pursuits while Taurus focuses on more prac tical and sensual interests. Where Taurus asks, 'How will this help me achieve my goals in life?' Aquarius asks, 'What else?' These two can have trouble understanding one another; if Taurus clings too closely or if Aquarius seems too cold and aloof, trouble can erupt. If they operate from a base of mutual love and respect, however, these two can grow to understand how one another works. Taurus and Aquarius are both Fixed Signs. They'r e both stubborn and, once they make up their minds, don't like to change their viewpoint or opinion. This steadfastness extends to their personal life: Once they're committed to one another, almost nothing can make them decide to abandon the relationship. If the relationship is smooth and mutually beneficial, this is a good thing, but if the relationship is inhibitive for eith er or both partners, their refusal to admit it should end can seriously hamper both of their growth in life. If they realize that working together is more yielding than butting heads, they will remain product ive. Since Taurus tends to be more practical, they might be the first to back down in an argument -- if they deem it practical to do so. What's the best aspect of the Taurus-Aquarius relationship? Their unstoppable team power that is possible once they clear their path of obstacles. Both Signs have very powerful personalities, so neither will dominate the other -- no matter how hard they try! This relationship can be truly exciting and satisfying once these two Signs work out how it'll work between them. Taurus and Pisces When Taurus and Pisces come together in a love affair, it's generally a happy union. They are two positions apart within the Zodiac, and such Signs tend to have karmic ties and a deep empathy for one another. While Pisces is idealisti c, dreamy and impressionistic, Taurus is more down-to-earth and practical. They're both nurturers, however, and both prize harmony and stability in a relationship. These two Signs have much to offer one another. Taurus can provide the grounded approach Pisces needs to put all those dreams into action, and Pisces can offer the kindness, gentleness and sweet sympathy that Taurus so loves in a lover. At times, Taurus can't understand Pisces's seemingly simplistic life view; in reality, of course, Pisces isn't simple at a ll. Still waters truly run deep, in this case."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love) and Pisces is ruled by Jupiter (Luck) and Neptune (Illusions). When Venus and Neptune meet, a beautiful spiritual connection is made. Both of these celestial bodies vibrate with feminine energy. Together, t hey represent an idealistic relationship which borders on the divine. Jupiter adds its masculine energy to the combination; this Planet represents philosophy, expansion and excesses. These two Signs together can produce the kind of union both dream of; it may seem like heaven on Earth to both. The downside? This kind of heady, dreamy connection can be rooted in just that -- dreams, illusions, fantasy. Taurus is an Earth Sign and Pisces is a Water Sign. These two Elements are generally quite compatible, as both Water and Earth are tangible, physical entities. Taurus can help Pisces stabilize their sensitivity, and Pi sces can bring a touch of magic to Taurus's practical approach. They should take care, though -- too much of a good thing can turn Earth to mud. Taurus could tire of Pisces's emotional instability, and Pisces may in turn feel that Taurus is insensitive to their needs. The good thing is, it's generally easy for them to find a way to overcome their differences. Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Where Taurus is steady, stubborn, practical and focused, Pisces likes the feeling of moving from one thought to the next according to fancy. Taurus's rigidity can hamper Pisces's flexibility; Taurus will need to learn to let Pisces flow. As a gift in return, Pisces will be a very supportive and loving partner. Pisces can show Taurus that mutability is sometimes better than a fixed determination to do things one way, and one way only. What's the best aspect of the Taurus-Pisces relationship?

Duality of nature is a concomitant of the Twin sign and while cases of split personality are comparatively rare, the Gemini mind runs to contradictions. When they go to such extremes, they manage to make their policy sound plausible, at least to their own satisfaction. As well as being imaginative, they are generous and affectionate but their frequent desire for a change makes them dissatisfied with existing conditions. They are clever, witty and have an easy way of covering or excusing their faults, without ever intending to correct them. Alexandrine Yellow Mossagate Mercurium Mercury Camellia"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Gemini is the third Sign of the Zodiac, and those born under this Sign will be quick to tell you so. That's because they love to talk! It's not just idle chatter with these folks, either. The driving force behind a Gemini's conversation is their mind. The Gemini-born are intellectually inclined, forever probing people and places in search of information. The more information a Gemini collects, the better. Sharing that information later on with those they love is also a lot of fun, for Geminis are supremely interested in developing thei r relationships. Dalliances with these folks are always enjoyable, since Geminis are bright, quick-witted and the proverbial life of the party. Even though their intellectual minds can rationalize forever and a day, Geminis also have a surplus of imagination waiting to be tapped. Can a Gemini be boring? Never! Since Geminis are a mix of the yin and the yang, they are well represented by the Twins. The Gemini-born can easily see both sides of an issue, a wonderfully pr actical quality. Less practical is the fact that you're not sure which Twin will show up half the time. Geminis may not know who's showing up either, which can prompt others to consider them fickle and restless. They can be wishy-washy, too, changing their mood on a simple whim. It's this characteristic which readily suggests the Mutable Quality assigned to this Sign. Mutable folks are flexible and go with the flow. Further, the Twins are adaptable and dexterous and can tackle many things at once. It's a good thing, too, when you consider their myriad interests. The downside of such a curious mind, however, can be a lack of follow-through. How much can any one person do, anyway? Ruled as they are by the Planet Mercury, Geminis exhibit a delicious brand of mercurial energy. They are quick-thinking, quick-witted and fast on their feet, much like the messenger god of Roman mythology that rules their Sign. Geminis are both curious and clever, which is why they are such a hit at cocktail parties. Although they talk a great game, they also love to listen and learn. With any kind of luck, the Twins will find themselves in interesting company, because if they don't, they are likely to get bored and start fidgeting. Any social setting is a good one for a Gemini, however, since these folks are charming, congenial and love to share themselves with their friends. While their effusiveness may be misconstrued as scheming by some, Geminis generally have their hearts in the right place. It's that ample energy which can also paint them as scatterbrained and unfocused, but behind all that zipping around, the Twins are busily filing all that good data away. The Element associated with Gemini is Air. Air Signs are the thinking person's Sign, and the Twins don't disappoint. Those born under this Sign prize intellect and consider it the key to all things. At work, they are the clearest of thinkers, looking at a project from all (well, at least two) sides and putting forth some logical and well- thought-out ideas. This quality makes Geminis an asset to any team, and while these folks are not inclined to take the lead, they are a most valuable component. It's also the Gemini's literary bent which allows them to offer a useful perspective on most any situation. The Twins also enjoy bringing their objective reasoning and big-picture ability into their personal relationships. While some may perceive all this logical thought as cold and unemotional, it's simply how these folks tick. They want to connect, they just do it their own way. Luckily for Geminis (and their pals), their lightness of spirit and youthful exuberance help them to appear forever young. In keeping with that skip in their step, Geminis enjoy short road trips -- and their agile minds and nimble hands ensure that they could change a tire (if needed) in no time flat. Is all of this Twin- energy more than any one person can handle? Ah, maybe that's why they are two. When it comes to sports, Geminis would seem a natural for doubles tennis -- and they are. They love the camaraderie of games and play, which is wh y they excel at team events. Whether it's volleyball or a game of Charades, Geminis are always ready to play. A book club would certainly stimulate their literary minds. In the game of love, Geminis are playful, flirtatious and endless fun. Physically speaking, Gemini rules the nervous system, which is why Twins should practice yoga or deep breathing techniques. Layer ing themselves in soft yellows and blues will also calm their mood. The great strength of the Gemini-born is in their ability to communicate effectively and to think clearly. Adventures of the mind are what the Twins are all about. They also love to share themselves with their friends, and they make for charming companions.

The best aspect of the Gemini-Aquarius friendship is these comrades' ability to meld their energies together and use their innate gifts to ac complish whatever goals they set for themselves. Together they can provide a sounding board for each other's inspirations and flights of fancy. Their successful verbal interaction makes theirs a healthy friendship. Gemini and Pisces When Gemini and Pisces form a friendship, it can be a mutually empathetic relationship as both Signs are dual natured. Pisces flows within their dream-like surroundings, and Gemini's quicksilver wit adds an edge to each new shared experience. Both Signs are very open-minded and adaptable and, at times, inconsistent. The keyword to this relationship is flexibility. Gemini and Pisces make very good friends, as they understand the duality in each other. Pisces is more intuitive and sensitive; Gemini must be careful to think before they speak and say something that mind offend the emotional Pi sces. Even when they do have problems, these friends can forgive and forget easily. Both can get over their arguments quickly, and neither bear grudges. Gemini is ruled by Mercury, and Pisces is ruled by Jupiter and Neptune. Mercury's communicative ability and Neptune's spiritual depth make these Signs compatible when working together toward a common end. Jupiter is about teaching and understanding, which provides the empathy and ideals associated with the Piscean nat ure. Mercury is all about quick wit, innovation and invention. Whenever Gemini comes up with a new idea -- as happens all the time -- Pisces is eager to go along with their friend and under stand the concept from an intuitive level. Gemini is an Air Sign, and Pisces is a Water Sign. This partnership operates via intellectual and emotional channels. There is always a lot going on, and this tends to be a very flexible and progressive friendship. When it's good it's good, but when it's bad it's about misunderstandings, frustration and a break in effective communica tion. They both have a boundless imagination, so it's rare for one friend to get worn out while th e other still wants to explore new territory. Although they may disagree often, their differences of opi nion don't last long -- Gemini is too busy moving on to the next challenge to hold a grudge. Pisces may become pessimistic if their Gemini friend doesn't show them enough understanding. Gemini and Pisces are both Mutable Signs, thus compatible. Both Signs are adaptable, flexible and changeable. When these two spend time together, it will be a true team effort without one taking the lead. Although, if Gemini gets bored with something through lack of intellectual stimulation, Pisces will soon follow suit and move on. The best aspect of the Gemini-Pisces friendship is their mutual interest in cultivating their knowledge and utilizing their intellect. They are well-matched in their flexibility. Their shared interests and similar personalities makes theirs a very companionable friendship."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Romantic Sun Sign Profiles Gemini Introduction Describing the Twins as mercurial is right on the money, since Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury . Moving, restless, seeking, learning -- Gemini is constant motion, a torrent of wind which is in keeping with this sign's element of Air. The Twins are highly intellectual and won't hesitate to play mind games with a lover, mere child's play to them. They are also great communicators, so get ready to hear everything from pithy remarks to impassioned pleas. Inv entive, quick-witted and fun, the Twins will jump around from one lover to the next until they find one who is almost as smart as they are and able to keep up in this high-spirited race. The reward for those who can lasso a Gemini is a free-spirited lover who shines at parties but is also a devil in the bedroom. Many Geminis are also ambidextrous. Ooh. Gemini in Romance A love affair with a Gemini requires great stamina, so start doing those push-ups now! The Twins are both fun and funny and love to laugh, play and romp. They are possessed of a very active mind, which can sometimes lead to a short attention span. The best way to keep the Twins around, and aroused, is through mental stimulat ion. A razor-sharp and imaginative lover is a godsend to the terrific Twins. This sign also va lues adventure and travel, so a certain footloose and fancy free-ness will help this romance bloom. The duality of the Twins allows them to see both sides of an issue, so in times of stress, t hey are much likelier to be a lover than a fighter. They will also feel especially connected to th ose who can help them feel, since they spend so much of their time thinking. Gemini in Relationship A union with Gemini is many things, but it is ce rtainly never boring. The Twins, above all, seek a partner who is mentally stimulating, and once they've found them, sparks will definitely fly! The Twins' lover must be able to keep up in the fa st-paced gamed of life, lest they get bored and move on. Variety of expression, a certain openness and a searching quality are all things which will stimulate the Twins and keep them around. Th ose born under this sign love to dazzle with their intelligence and quick wit and are consequently the star of any party. Jealous lovers will find themselves tested by Gemini's magnetism, and oft en it's the Twins themselves who are giving the test, to see if a lover is really true. The love r who can keep the Twins feeling comfortable yet give them space will win themselves a lover beyond co mpare. At the end of the day, the ideal Gemini soul mate has a Ph.D., and is a world traveler with countless tales to tell. Gemini in Love The game of love is a real adventure for the Twins, since the chase can seem so much more fun. The real question for Gemini is, can they fi nd that one person who is a keeper and will keep them happy forever? If there are any doubts, the Twins will just keep on looking. When in love, Gemini can be a very caring and thoughtful partner, some one who will do somersaults to keep their lover happy. Often, though, the Twins find themselves adrift in the sea of love, feeling vulnerable and needing something, or someone, to fill a lonely vo id. For all the party chatter and intense brain waves, the Twins have a bit of a melancholy spot, and tenderness and affection can be the perfect antidote. Gemini and Sex The Twins aren't asking for much, just someone wh o will stimulate their mind for a great time. Of course, those mental hijinks need to have a bit of follow-through, so a lover with variety on their mind will score a perfect 10. That sa id, a quickie in the back seat of a fast car is just what the doctor ordered on some days. Face it, this sign is versatile! Most of all, though, sex is a mental sport for Gemini. The act begins in the head and works its way down and around. Gemini is always in search of the perfect lover and the perf ect sexual experience. Once they (hopefully) find it, they will want, and give, stimulation to a ll the senses, for sight, sound and touch are all important. Bottom line: The Twins want someth ing different and something complete. Not too much to ask, right? What Gemini Needs Someone who can roll with the punches and keep smiling in the face of a multi-faceted onslaught is priceless to the hyperactive Twins. It's an adde d plus if that person is smart, fun, a good friend and a great sport. Geminis need someone who can be attentive to them and who will naturally enjoy their sparkle and wit. They also prefer a st rong partner who is not necessarily as smart as they are but who can pick them up, emotiona lly, when necessary. If the Twins can make a marvelous mental match, life will be a dream. The Gemini lover is easygoing and caring, yet daring and a ball of fire at the right moments. Mental fireworks are high on their agenda, their ow n as well as those they can make with another. Only those with plenty of punch need apply for this celestial light show!"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Love Match Gemini and Aries When Aries and Gemini come together in a love affair, they connect on a physical as well as an intellectual level. These two Signs love activity and stay optimistic even in the most trying of times. Signs that are two apart in the Zodiac usually enjoy excellent communication and a deep understanding of one another. Aries's independent, pioneering spirit is attractive to Gemini, who also values independence. If Gemini feels that Aries is being too controlling or if Aries takes Gemini's flirtatious nature too seriously, arguments may set the tone of the relationship. They create a good balance together: Aries wants to experience things and Gemini wants to discuss them. Together they can make all kinds of new di scoveries that they might have missed alone. Both Aries and Gemini have tons of energy as well as common goals. Gemini is a thinker and a talker, prizes intellectual stimulation and freedo m and loves to look at all sides of an argument. Aries loves to jump into new projects and get t heir hands dirty, and Gemini will definitely take the time to find out Aries's reasons for choosing the projects they support. While Gemini can be wishy-washy, Aries is straightforward and decisive; th is is a great combination, but it is essential that Aries allows Gemini intellectual space. Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars and Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury. These Planets represent Passion and Communication, respectively. Because of their different approaches, Aries and Gemini work great in tandem -- they get t heir points across in different ways, but they definitely get those points across . Fevered debates will either spice up this union -- or ruin it. Aries needs to understand that Gemini loves a good, fiery argument, not to insult or dominate their challenger but as a great brain workout. Aries is a Fire Sign and Gemini is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and makes it spread, making this a great combination. Gemini also helps Aries realize their full potential -- Gemini definitely has the energy to keep up with Aries's fast pace and wild ideas! The combination of true, driving passion and intellectual prowess makes just about anything possible for these two. Both Signs have wide- ranging interests, and the best part is, at the end of a long and active day, Aries can come home and tell chat-hungry Gemini all about it! Aries is a Cardinal Sign and Gemini is a Mutable Sign. Aries naturally initiates new plans -- travel, sports or just a really exciting date idea -- and Ge mini is always up for anything, as long as they aren't forced into it. Another great dynamic between these two Signs is their low level of competition. Aries loves the glory and Gemini is perfectly happy to be in the background, pulling the strings. Both Signs are better at starting things than ending them, so if one partner gets bored with the direction the relationship is taking, t he other won't resent moving on toward something new. What's the best aspect of the Aries-Gemini relationship? Their abilit y to work together as a single unit. Together they can learn much more than either Sign would alone. Gemini and Taurus When Taurus and Gemini come together in a love affair, they must both take the time to learn what the dynamics of the relationship are and ho w they can best get al ong. They both have much to offer one another and much to learn in this rela tionship, but it will take a bit of adjustment and effort on both sides. Gemini's Symbol is the Tw ins; this Sign can often be of two minds about things. If possessive Taurus is able to let go and give one Twin the relationship security and intimacy it wants while allowing the other Twin its freedom, things will go well between these two. Taurus may want too much for Gemini's taste early in the relationship, but Gemini can become dependable and steady -- Taurus must simply be patient. Taurus's sedate, practical approach to life differs greatly from Gemini's more light, intellectual approach. This can be a difficult dynamic, since Gemini may see Taurus as a bit dull while Taurus may see Gemini as flighty and lacking in substance. They have much to teach one another, however: Taurus can help Gemini become more deeply involved in life; Gemini can help Taurus add variety, fun and excitement to their life."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Taurus is ruled by the Planet Venus (Love) and Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury (Communication). Since both of these Planets are close to the Sun, they're always in the same neighborhood even though they're very different. Venus is all about physical pleasures, romance and sensuality. Mercury has both masculine and feminine energy, and Gemini takes on whichever energy best serves at any given mo ment. Taurus is just looking for a dependable, sensual partner, so Gemini's brilliance may be lost on the Bull. This may be trouble, since Geminis often feel like their quick wits are t he most important thing about themselves. The good thing is, Gemini is smart enough to learn to be the romantic, sensual partner that Taurus craves. Taurus is an Earth Sign and Gemini is an Air Sign. Gemini makes decisions based on intellect (and whim), while Taurus is more practical. Taur us asks, \"How will this help me achieve my goals in life?\" while Gemini goes with the moment, never feeling too pressured to stick to a set plan. If Taurus gives in to those Bullish possessive fee lings, or if Gemini is aloof and detached (as they often are), this relationship may suffer. Both Signs must strive to stay open and flexible in order to make this union work. Though Gemini seems unpr edictable, Taurus can learn to understand that although Gemini may flirt, the relationship is st ill important to them. And though Taurus seems overly stubborn, Gemini must use their flexibility to bend to t heir partner's will on occasion. Taurus is a Fixed Sign and Gemini is a Mutable Sign. Taurus tends to focus on one thing, person, idea at a time, while Gemini moves from one thing (or person) to the next according to impulse. Taurus must provide Gemini with ample inde pendence and breathing space -- and try to learn Gemini's lesson, that versatility is sometimes better than a Fixed determination to do things one's own way. What's the best aspect of the Taurus-Gemini re lationship? The security the two can give each other once Taurus allows Gemini to offer t hat security freely. As long as both partners communicate with each other, theirs will be a stable and happy relationship. Gemini and Gemini When two Geminis partner off, it really is like four people coming togethe r (Gemini is represented by the Twins). This relationship can never be dull, which is a good thing -- these two can get bored easily! Since they have the same need fo r intellectual stimulation and nearly-constant chatter, they serve very well as one another's sounding boards off which to bounce new ideas and theories. Gemini is all about freedom and va riety of expression, and two Geminis together will enjoy this to the fullest. Other s enjoy two Geminis as a couple as well -- they're sure to be the life of every party with their sharp wit and well- honed entertainment routine. If they can avoid competition and cooperate instead, their love relationship can be extremely happy and mutually satisfying. The Twins love to toss back and forth tidbits of playful banter, sarcasm and occasional ironic cynicism. This is fun, to be sure, but may pr event one or both of the partners from taking the relationship seriously. In an intimate love relationship, there is certainly a place for seriousness, which Gemini would do well to learn. If both part ners can pay more attention to their feelings rather than being ruled solely by thoughts and intellect, they will greatly enhance their love experience. Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury (Communica tion). This couple could talk each other around in circles all night long. Mercury (or Hermes in Greek mythology) was a traveller; Gemini shares that love for variety in places and conversation topics. Be warned, two-headed Twins -- the gift of gab could be misinterpreted as gossip. Learning to use the gift of communication in a positive way is key. Gemini is an Air Sign, and thus responds to the world and to their romantic partner with a more rational than emotional focus. Their short attent ion spans cause them to burn out sometimes, but two Geminis together burn out at the same time! A nd, of course, that Gemini creativity will dream up a new scheme a moment later. Gemini is a Mutable Sign. Their flexible, easy -going natures make the four of them a perfect couple. These two have mastered the art of compromise; two Mutable signs together can easily form a conflict-free union. Just about the only th ing that may lead to a real argument is a discussion that has gone out of hand; luckily, Gemini quickly realizes the insignificance of proving a point -- and of fighting in general. What's the best aspect of the Gemini-Gemini relationship? The enormous amount of intellectual energy and stimulation they provi de one another. They are able to save one another from leading a mundane existence. Together they can entertain the world and accomplish more than either could alone."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Gemini and Cancer When Gemini and Cancer come together in a love affair, it may be a rather curious relationship. Sensitive, emotional Cancer has trouble commu nicating clearly, but clear communication is what defines Gemini. Gemini's chivalrous nature a nd silver tongue may encourage the Crab to come out of its shell more quickly than usual; Cancer, in turn, can teach Gemini to slow down and appreciate the world, which the frenetic Twins hard ly ever take time to do. If Gemini seems to ignore Cancer or doesn't provide them with as much reassurance and intimacy as Cancer needs, trouble may ensue. These two Signs approach the wo rld in such different manners that they must be able to understand and accept one another's differences. Cancer is the Sign of home and hearth, while Gemini is the thinker. Gemini can easily slip into the role of Cancer's knight in shining armor; Cancer returns that favor with their characteristic urge to protect the ones they love. Quality of home life is important to Cancer, and Gemini will be spoiled by their Cancer lover's hearty home cooking, soft bed and other creature comforts. Cancer is strongly intuitive and maintains an almost psychic connection with their loved ones, but can tend toward possessiveness and idealization of their Gemini partner. If Gemini just reassures Cancer that they're loved and cherished, a ll will go smoothly. Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury (Comm unication) and Cancer is ruled by the Moon (Emotions). Cancer tends to keep their emotions bottled up inside as they have trouble expressing themselves. They envy Geminis thei r gift of open, clear communication afforded by the influence of Mercury. Gemini, in turn, ca n benefit from Cancer's intuitive approach, so different from Gemini's bubbly, surface nature; Cancer can teach Gemini to slow down and appreciate life instead of passing by the good things in their rush to get to the next new thing. Gemini is an Air Sign and Cancer is a Water Sign. If these two Signs can work together they can be a great team; after all, the best decisions are made by incorporating the emotions and the intellect. The trouble for these two lies in learni ng to cooperate. They come from such opposite points of view that at times it can seem as if they simply have nothing in common. Deep, emotional Cancer can also sometimes dampen Gemi ni's airy enthusiasm, and light, fast-paced Gemini can leave Cancer feeling ruffled, even tattered. Balance can be achieved if they learn to talk openly with one another. Gemini is a Mutable Sign and Cancer is a Cardinal Signs. Gemini is flexible, willing to go with the flow and follow another's lead; Cancer is an initiato r and likes to provide that lead. Gemini may try to lead by being brave, even confr ontational; for it to run smoothl y between these two, they both need to learn when to back down and let the other lead the way. What's the best aspect of the Ge mini-Cancer relationsh ip? Once they realiz e they're allies, they can soar to great heights together. Gemini is always thinking ahead and Cancer is quietly supporting these ideas behind the scenes. Each partner's ability to provide what the other is lacking makes theirs a fulfilling relationship. Gemini and Leo When Gemini and Leo come together in a love affair, their relationship is playful and high-spirited, characterized by light activity and optimism. Gemini thrives on mental stimulation and is therefore very attracted to Leo's creative, dramatic spirit. There can be trouble between these two, however: If Leo takes Gemini's flirty, outgoing nature too seriously, or if Gemini thinks Leo wants to maintain total control of the relationship , arguments may break out. Though their approaches are different -- Gemini likes to analyze things fr om all sides in an intellectual conversation while Leo would rather not talk about it and just jump right in -- they are well-matched. Both Leo and Gemini have a lot of energy. Leo likes to be at the helm of any project, endeavor or outing; Gemini wants to be free to think as fast and as far as they please. Direct, decisive Leo can help Gemini make a decision if they start to vac illate due to their ability to see all the options -- but Leo must take care not to be too bossy, which will turn Gemini off. Leo is ruled by the Sun (Self) and Gemini by the Planet Mercury (Communication). Both of these Signs are skilled at communication as their planet ary influences are similar; they just have different approaches to self-expression. They may also have heated debates, but while Gemini finds it fun and mentally stimulating, Leo takes it quite seriously and can get their feelings very hurt."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"extreme.

Libra and Gemini work well together; they combine the forces of love and communication. As Libra prizes harmony with their lover almost abov e all else, Gemini won't be able to indulge their love of a good, hearty debate too often; Libra w ould rather do almost anything than argue. Both Libra and Gemini are Air Signs. Gemini loves Libra's energy and has no trouble keeping up when Libra is off and running with a new idea, art project or other pursuit. Both Signs have wide- ranging interests, giving them great ma terial for provocative discussion. Gemini is a Mutable Sign and Libra is a Cardinal Sign. Libra likes a position of leadership in a relationship. They most often come up with t he date ideas, for example, and flexible Gemini's happy to go along -- as long as it's okay to chan ge their minds at the last minute. Libra tends to initiate things but has trouble finishing them; Ge mini is so adaptable, they won't mind switching gears on a moment's notice and moving on to something else if Libra gets bored. What's the best aspect of the Ge mini-Libra relationship? Their ability to work together as an intellectual team. Together they can expose each other to new and different points of view and areas of interest, and help one another open up their worlds. Gemini and Scorpio When Gemini and Scorpio come together in a love affair, they'll need to learn to understand and accept one another's differences -- and if they can, they will be a nearly unbreakable couple. Where Gemini is adaptable, intellectual, outgoi ng and chatty, Scorpio tends to be secretive, focused, intense and determined. Gemini tends to take things lightly, including their lover; Scorpio, on the other hand, has a very deep need for emotional connection and intimacy. Scorpio is generally very loyal to their lover and very connected to the relationship. This relationship tends to be highly passionate and can often be characterized by arguments; Gemini loves a good debate, considering it the epitome of mental stimulation, and that characteristic Gemini flirtatiousness tends to grate on Scorpio's jealous, possessive nerves. Despite these differences, however, this is no du ll relationship. Both Signs love to take chances and spice it up! They have lots of adventures toget her, but if things get too tense and arguments start to turn negative, they must make the effort to reconcile if they value the relationship and want it to last. Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury (Communication) and Scorpio is dually ruled by the Planets Mars (Passion) and Pluto (Power). Scorpio is generally quite concerned with sexual and emotional intimacy; they need much reassurance that their lover values the relationship as much as they do. Thank goodness, then, for Gemini's excellent communicative abilities; the Twins should have no trouble communicating their dedication to the Scorpion -- if it's dedication they feel. Gemini can't and won't fake a commitment they don't feel, so intense Scorpio must learn to back off a bit. Gemini will certainly make a commitm ent to a love relationship, but only if they're free to do so on their own, not coerced into it. Gemini is an Air Sign and Scorpio is a Water Sign. These two elements can be a great combination; after all, the best decisions are made when they incorporat e the intellect (Air) and the emotions (Water) -- the mind and the heart. The trick, of course, is getting these two elements to work in tandem. Scorpio is a master strategi st; if there's a decision to be made or a project at hand, they can help flighty Gemini focus on the be st options. Gemini, in turn, teaches Scorpio to let go and move on when their efforts are thwarted. There is a downside to these two elements' union, however; Scorpio's emotional manipulations can prove to dampen Gemini's natural energy and enthusiasm. Also, airy Gemini can leave Sc orpio's deep waters feeling choppy, rough and disturbed. Gemini is a Mutable Sign and Scorpio is a Fixed Sign. Gemini tends to do things on a whim, just for the experience, contrary to Scorpio, who al most always has a plan (or an ulterior motive) in mind. Scorpio can use their focu s and determination to help teach Gemini the value in finishing things before jumping headlong into the next experience. Once these two begin to understand that they can enjoy a satisfying relationship -- Gemini providing the reasoning and brain power and Scorpio bringing their healthy dollop of sex appeal, emotionalism and passion -- they can enjoy a truly mutually satisfying relationship."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"What's the best aspect of the Gemini-Scorpio relationship?

Gemini and Sagittarius When Gemini and Sagittarius come together in a love affair, it can be a truly spectacular match! These two are extremely compatible; any rough s pots they encounter during the course of the relationship are sure to be smoothed over with a minimum of effort. Gemini is quite able to provide pioneering, adventurous Sagittarius with t he independence Sagittarius requires in a close relationship, because Gemini shares that same need. While Sagittarius needs physical independence, Gemini needs mental freedom, but the need is the same at base. These two both love new experiences, people and sensations, and are sure to have great adventures together. Both have attention spans that love to move quickly from one thing to the next in order to absorb as much experience as possible. Gemini and Sagittarius are great friends, besides being well-matched lovers. They share a deep understanding and a very similar life view, based on a general, refreshing optimism and enthusiasm. Sagittarius can sometimes be a bit too blunt, saying things without thinking beforehand about whether they'll hurt someone or not, but Gemini is a hardy sort and, like Sagittarius, can forgive and forget quickly. These two don't have time or the interest required to hold a grudge. Gemini is ruled by Mercury (Communication) and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter (Luck). Mercury lends Gemini their chatty, intellectual demeanor; Jupiter is about both luck and philosophy, and lends Sagittarius their constant questing for k nowledge and truth. This is a great match -- Gemini comes up with a new idea and Sagittarius jumps right on, ready to explore it to its limits. Gemini is an Air Sign and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. This is quite the active relationship! Air spreads Fire far and wide, helping it increase in power. Gemini and Sagittarius together have just this effect on one another. Theirs is a very fier y, passionate connection; there's always something going on. Sometimes what's going on escalates into a real argument and actually hurt feelings; these Signs are opposite one another in the Z odiac, which means they have quite a deep and complex connection. In other words, when it's good it's very, very good, but when it's bad it can be terrible. These two may fight most about who's in charge; they both hav e competitive streaks that can flare up at inopportune moments. The good thing is, although they may disagree often, their differences of opinion don't last long -- Gemini is too busy moving on to the next challenge to hold a grudge, and Sagittarius can forgive anything bu t a lack of respect from their Gemini lover. Gemini and Sagittarius are both Mutable Signs and are thus extremely compatible. They're both flexible in the extreme, quite willing and able to adapt to change. This is a good thing; when Gemini changes their mind mid-thought, Sagittarius has no problem taking a 180-degree turn and keeping right up with their high-flying partner. When Sagittarius suddenly gets the travel bug, Gemini is very amiable about hopping in the car and going right along. What's the best aspect of the Gemini-Sagittarius re lationship? Their mutual interest in cultivating knowledge, utilizing intellect and turning it into action. They are well-matched in their enthusiasm, energy and drive. Common interests and similar per sonalities make them a compatible couple. Gemini and Capricorn When Gemini and Capricorn come together in a love affair, it may be tough for them to remember why they're together at all, as the ways in which they approach the world couldn't be more opposite. If they're operating from a base of love and mutual respect, they'll be able to overcome most obstacles, but they must work hard. Gemi ni must have freedom to think outside the bounds; they rely on their quick wits, humor and intellect ual prowess to move through life at a fast pace. Capricorn is concerned with advancement and stat us; they rely on following the rules and finding set, tried-and-true paths to follow toward success, no matter how long it takes. Gemini likes to cut corners; Capricorn likes to be thorough. These two Signs' challenge as a couple is to learn to maintain a similar pace so they can arrive at the same place at the same time. Capricorn is very unassuming and quiet, which stands out even more against Gemini's outgoing, boisterous nature. Capricorn tends to be slow, steady and stubborn while Gemini is flexible and tends to change their mind a lot. Gemini has a quick brain that sees loopholes in an instant, while Capricorn is tough to convince that taking advant age of a shortcut is a better idea than following the well-mapped course that they know will ensure their success. However, if these two can learn to understand and then implement one another's app roaches, they can achieve far more than they could alone. These two Signs may make much better business partners than they do lovers."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury (Communica tion), Capricorn by the Planet Saturn (Power). These Planetary influences can oppose one another. Saturn has a cold, masculine energy; it's all about perseverence and helps Capricorn keep mo ving ahead through all kinds of difficulties. Mercury has an androgynous energy and lends Gemini their gift of intellect and communication. Neither of these Signs will give up easily, but together they may cause one another to repress their natural emotions. Gemini already tends to skim lightly on the surface of emotions, choosing to take their love life as lightly as they take most things in life. Capricorn may dampen Gemini's enthusiastic spirit if both Signs don't take care to maintain their boundaries and allow one another to do the same. Gemini is an Air Sign and Capricorn is an Earth Sign. Capricorn is practical, steady and efficient. They see no need to take risks if they aren't guaranteed to pay off. Gemini, on the other hand, is theoretical and analytical; they are all about risk-taking and following wherever their inventive ideas may lead. While Capricorn is buys asking, \"What good will this do as I work toward my main plan in life?\" Gemini simply moves with the flow according to no set plan. Gemini is a Mutable Sign and Capricorn is a Cardin al Sign. Capricorn initiates things; they like to be in control. Gemini is more flexible, generally happy to follow Capricorn's lead -- as long as they aren't forced into anything. They need to feel free to agree, disagree and choose at will, and if they begin to feel coerced, they will respond by becoming aloof and inaccessible.

Once they allow one another to be themselves -- rather than measuring one another against impossible standards -- they can blend well to make a whole. Theirs is a challenging relationship, but if they can learn from each other it's definitely worth it! Gemini and Aquarius When Gemini and Aquarius come together in a love affair, the pair can enjoy a wonderfully stimulating mental connection. Gemini is in love with ideas, and visionary Aquarius is full of them. Both of these Signs need their independence; they can easily provide this for one another since they understand the need so well. The only trouble that may arise is if Gemini begins to think Aquarius is too stubborn in their thinking, or if Ge mini dawdles a bit too much for Aquarius's fast- paced, forward-moving standards. This type of prob lem isn't likely to cause a major disturbance; in general they work very well together and understand one another on a very deep level. Both Gemini and Aquarius have a great deal of energy. Both their minds are so quick they can easily come up with newer and better ideas and, with Aquarius's determination at the helm, put their ideas to action. They both rely on their qui ck wits, especially Gemini, and both Signs abhor wasting time. Aquarius can help Gemini focus if they begin to waver, but must take care to allow Gemini plenty of mental space and freedom. Gemini doesn't like to feel crowded or pushed into anything. Aquarius is ruled by the Planets Saturn (Karma) and Uranus (Rebellion), and Gemini by the Planet Mercury (Communication). Saturn and Uranus combine their powers to lend Aquarius their progressive, original mind and the determination to put their ideas to good use. Aquarius is the great humanitarian of the Zodiac. Gemini is a great thinker and conversationalist, and can easily help out if Aquarius gets stuck on an idea and needs a little mental shove. Gemini's more flexible mind can greatly aid Aquarius in times of tension or rigidity. Both Aquarius and Gemini are Air Signs. Their intellectual bond is strong and true. They're both quite social by nature; Gemini is witty and chatty, in love with impressing people with that quick and agile brain, and Aquarius loves all sorts of people. The more different kinds of people Aquarius knows, the better Aquarius feels in lif e. Both Signs' interests are multiple and wide- ranging. Gemini's penchant for good talks and de bates is satisfied by the many experiences these two Signs are likely to share."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Gemini is a Mutable Sign and Aquarius is a Fi xed Sign.

Their ability to work together and provide one another with a sounding board for inspir ations and flights of fancy. Their successful verbal interaction makes theirs a healthy relationship. Gemini and Pisces When Gemini and Pisces come together in a love affair, they can make a very empathetic and mutually satisfying couple. Gemini is cerebral, quick-witted and silver-tongued, and can bring a dash of humor and intellectual direction to help focu s Pisces's dreamy view of the world. Pisces has the gift of intuitive empathy; they connect ve ry well with others on a rather subtle emotional level, and their dreamy nature makes them quit e open-minded -- in short, Pisces expects the unexpected. Gemini is open-minded as well; menta lly both agile and flexible, the Twins are gifted at seeing all sides of an issue and at communicating with other people. This relationship is all about flexibility and connection. Gemini and Pisces make great friends as well as lovers. Pisces is rather emotionally sensitive and can get their feelings hurt when brash Gemi ni speaks without thinking. But even when they do have problems, these partners can forgive and forget easily. Neither Sign sees any reason to hold a grudge, Pisces becaus e they understand their partner's true intentions, and Gemini because they simply don't have the time to dwell on past hurts. Gemini is ruled by Mercury (Communication) and Pisces is ruled by Jupiter (Luck) and Neptune (Illusion). Jupiter, about learning and philosophy as well as luck, lends Pisces their desire to know more deeply, and Neptune makes Pisces so dream y. Mercury is all about quick wit, innovation and invention -- Gemini's watch words. Pisces is able to understand Gemini's frequent new ideas on a deeply intuitive level. Gemini is an Air Sign and Pisces is a Water Sign. The combination of an intellectual focus with an emotional, intuitive grasp of the world makes de cisions much more solid; if these two can work together, they can achieve much. Their only trou ble is the communication breakdowns that can result if Pisces feels Gemini isn't understanding en ough, or if Gemini feels hampered by Pisces's emotional sensitivity.

Yet their moods and even their purposes may become as changeable as the sign's ruling planet, the Moon. This self-contradiction is understandable, when recognized as part of the individual's innate nature. These people are home loving, fond of family life and domestic tranquility but they also enjoy travel and adventure. They love the past and sometimes practically live in it, which accounts for the way they seek the new, yet always come back to the old. Persons born under this sign are very sensitive, though they frequently din not show it. Argument wears them down, criticism hurts them and crablike, they crawl into their shells. Though strongly conservative, they are fond of amusements and social life. These people are frequently vivacious and are humanitarians as well, devoting themselves to worthy causes. Ruby Silver Sodalith Silver Moon Lilly of the Valley"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Cancer, the fourth Sign of the Zodiac, is all about home. Those born under this Sign are 'roots' kinds of people and take great pleasure in the comforts of home and family. Cancers are maternal, domestic and love to nurture others. More than likely, their family will be large, too -- the more, the merrier! Cancers will certainly be merry if their home life is serene and harmonious. Traditions are upheld with great zest in a Cancer's household, since these folks prize family history and love communal activities . They also tend to be patriotic, waving the flag whenever possible. A Cancer's good memory is the basis for stories told around the dinner table, and don't be surprised if these folks get emotional about things to boot. Those born under this Sign wear their heart on their sleeve, which is just fine by them. The mascot of Cancerians is the Crab, and much like this shelled little critter, Cancerians are quick to retreat into their shells if it suits their mood. No wonder these folks are called crabby! For Cancer, it's not that big of a deal, though, since they consider this 'shell' a second home (and they do love home). The flip side of this hiding is that shell-bound Crabs are often quite moody. Further, in keeping with their difficulty in sharing their innermost feelings, it can become a Herculean task to pry a Crab out of its secret hiding place. What to do? Give the Crab time -- eventually these folks will come out to play again. When they do, they'll be the first to say so, in keeping with the Cardinal Quality attached to this Sign. It's said that Crabs are first to laugh and first to cry, so you can bet they'll fill you in. That shell, by the way, isn't the only tough thing about Crabs. These folks are tenacious and strong-willed and like to get their way. If their well-documented kindness and gentleness doesn't do the trick, however, they're not above using emotional manipulation to make things happen. If that still doesn't work, they'll just go back to their shell and sulk, or find a way to get back at the source of their pain, since Crabs can be rather vindictive. That said, any self-respecting Crab would tell you that they are ultimately motivated by protecting their home and loved ones, a most noble goal. Cancerians are ruled by the Moon, the Great Mother of the heavens in ancient times. Here on Earth, this is manifested in the Crab's maternal instincts and desire to protect home and hearth. This may appear smothering at times, but that's the Crab for you. The Moon is associated with fertility, too, a quality which is most pleasing to Cancerians. The Moon is also the ruler of moods, and Cancers have plenty of those. These folks can cry you a river if they're so in clined, and they usually are. They can be overly sensitive, easily hurt and prone to brooding. Even so, Crabs find it easy to be sympathetic to others and are quick to show their affection. Their intuition is also a great help to them, especially in times of stress. The Element associated with Cancer is Water. Like the rolling waves of the sea, the Crab's emotions can make quite a splash. These folks tend to pick up on things and bring them in, with the outward result ranging from sentimentality to possessiveness. Crabs need to resist the temptation to become selfish or to feel sorry for themselves, since this behavior won't help. On the bright side, Cancers are good with money (although some consider them too thrifty), probably because they value a sense of security. Crabs are also quick to help others and tend to avoid confrontation. In keeping with their nurturing bent, those born under this Sign are a whiz with food. A hearty picnic on the Fourth of July is heaven on earth to most Crabs. Cancers often find that a robust workout session is just the tonic for their touchy feelings. Team sports are always nice, since they offer a sense of community; water polo should be elemental to aquatic Crabs. What are their team colors? The Moon is silver and white. Since Cancerians have a tendency to be lazy, however , they may need someone to push them out the door. When it comes to the game of love, eager Crabs are devoted, romantic and able to get things going on their own. Crabs are wise to listen to their gut, since this Sign rules the stomach. The great strength of the Cancer-born is the tenacity with which they protect their loved ones. These folks don't ask for much, either: a comfortable home and sense of peace about sums it up. It's that nurturing instinct which makes Cancerians a pleasure to be with. Cancer June 2 1 st – July 22 nd"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Profile Cancer's element is Water . Symbolic of the emotions, water signs need to give and receive. They thrive on the exchange of feelings. They need security and love to be wrapped in an environment of love and comfort. Truly a wonderful example of Yin receptivity, Cancer seems to absorb memories, feelings and psychic messages. Of course, they send back their own good vibes in the process. The cardinal' motivation energizes their strong ability to provide for others. Few work as hard and as tenaciously as Cancer. Without the balance of Yang assertiveness, however, Cancer's confidence can be a bit wobbly. After all, the Crab is so very sensitive to everything. Just as the sign's ruler, the Moon , goes through phases, Cancer often experiences mood-swings. Sometimes the desire to love results in giving too much. In such cases, the Crab can become over-protective or dependent. Balanced, the Cancer adds personal independence to his or her priorities.

He is very sensitive to the moods of others. The Negative Side of Cancer: Sometimes the Cancerian finds it rather hard to face life. It becomes too much for him. He can be a little timid and tiring, when things don’t go too well. When unfortunate things happen, he is apt to just shrug and say, \"Whatever will be will be.\" He can be fatalistic to a fault. The uncultivated Cancerian is a bit lazy. He doesn’t have very much ambition. Anything that seems a bit difficult he’ll gladly leave to others. He may be lacking in initiative. Too sensitive, when he feels he’s been injured, he’ll crawl back into his shell and nurse his imaginary wounds. The Cancer woman often is gi ven to crying when the smallest thing goes wrong. Some Cancerians find it difficult to enjoy themselves in environments outside their homes. They make heavy demands on others, and need to be constantly reassured that they are loved.

Cancer and Cancer When two Cancerians form a friend ship, a nurturing relationship ruled by emotions is the result. A Cancer-Cancer friendship forms a deeply devoted pair who will remain loyal to one another's interest. Both will learn how to best heed and cool the flames of their confidante's outbursts, and both will feel comfort in their underlying commitment to getting things done. They are nurturing, helpful and sympathetic, that is, when they're not brooding, emotionally manipulating or self- pitying. If they learn to keep their emotions in check, the friendship will nurture both of them. Cancer's place is in the home. The moody Crab is not as concerned with the opinions of the world as they are with the condition and activities of the household. With fierceness, Cancer will not hesitate to attack when a loved one or their domestic security is being threatened. These devotional qualities are the Crab's greatest contri bution to their intimate combination: They will fight for each other's successes.

Beware of Cancer's fine art of emotional manipulation. Cancer is ruled by the Moon, and this Sign is mo st sensitive to the moods that ebb and flow with the Moon's monthly cycle.

Cancer's instinct and energy geared toward comfort and domesticity provide a cozy environment, perfect for a growing friendship between two Crabs. Cancer is a Water Sign. Their emotional response and instinct is the backbone of their connection. Since Cancer's emotions are trampled so easily, it is not unusual for them to hide within their Crabby shells. This tendency to draw within one's self makes Cancer a difficult companion at times, but two Crabs hanging out together should be able to recognize this need for personal space and respect temporary time-outs. Their Element of Water acts as a safe buffer zone separating themselves and their close friends and loved ones from the outside world. Cancer is a Cardinal Sign. The Crab is not shy about getting exactly what they want from their friends. The protective, feral beast within is the first emotional element to leap forward under stress or a threat to the pack. However, this emotional call to arms is exactly the kind of toe- trampling that will crush Cancer 's tender feelings. Fierce loyalty binds the Cancer-Cancer friendship, but can also threaten its very existence. These two must constantly try to perceive their emotions from the other's perspective. The best aspect of the Cancer-C ancer work friendship is their utter devotion to enriching each other's emotional and home lives, and the strong bond that develops through their shared experiences.

Additionally, Virgo enjoys indulging Cancer -- the Virgo's commitment to service combin es well with Cancer's love of nurturing, thus pleasing both. Cancer is ruled by the Moon, and Virgo is rul ed by Mercury. Both of these Planets are close to the Sun, so they're always in the same neighb orhood even though they are very different.

Cancer and Aquarius When Cancer and Aquarius form a friendship, it can be a case of a draw between two opposite ends of the spectrum. Cancer has an emotional approach to life. Aquarius has an offbeat, unconventional approach to nearly every situation. While Cancer may retreat into its shell, Aquarius is the gregarious host among the group of friends and excels in business and social situations.

Cancer asks, 'how does this feel?' while Aquarians simply focus on their interests and ask 'what else?' These friends may find it difficult to understand the other's origin of thought. Conflicts ca n arise in this friendship if Cancer is too demanding or if Aquarius seems too cool and deni es Cancer emotional reassurance. Both need to learn that they view the world in different ways, and they should celebrate differences rather than feeling threatened. Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. Both partners tend to persevere when working toward their goals. If they have a set path, they'll follow it to the end. Once they have made up their minds that spending time together is worthwhile, they will never be dissuaded from that knowledge. If they have differing ideas, they may find that the Cancer is the more tenacious, more dogmatic partner who is not beyond emotio nal manipulation. Aquarius may see Cancer as being too feeling-oriented. If they understand they're working together out of mutual respect and admiration, it's much easier for them to get along.

Cancer is ruled by the Moon, and Pisces is ru led by Jupiter and Neptune. When the Moon and Neptune come together, an almost spiritual connection can be made. Both of these celestial bodies vibrate with feminine energy. Together, they represent an idealistic friendship that borders on the divine. Pisces is also ruled by Jupiter.

This sign is ruled by the Moon, and t he Crab's emotions often swing with the cycle of that shimmering orb. Catch that mood on an up swing, and you are likely to encounter a caring and devoted soul who can easily take the lead in romance. The strong-willed, persistent Crab will usually get its way, but that's not a bad thing, since it usually means being drawn into a shell, which is rife with carnal pleasures. As is natural to a Water sign, Cancer's moods can flow like a meandering river or rage like the highest seas. Eit her way, the Crab rewards brave sailors with a seductive nest in which to test many moods, feelings and emotions. Scarlett O'Hara, that great protector of Tara, must've been a Crab! Cancer in Romance Where the romance dance is concerned, the Crab enjoys being the initiator in the game of love. Gentle, tender probing can soon turn to height ened passion, and few will be able to resist Cancer's charms, which is just fine. Romance here often involves a beautifully prepared meal, since those born under this sign have an innate f eel for the comforts of home and the joys they can bring. This love of physical and emotional well-being, which the Crab must have, is a duty which a partner must help to fulfill. If this isn't achieved, the Crab might retreat into its pesky shell. When Cancerians are in full flower, they can make their lover feel like the center of the universe, and might feel the same way themselves. Cancer in Relationship Call it a sixth sense, good gut or intuition, but whatever the name, the Crab has it. Members of this sign have an excellent instinct for which pa rtner will serve them well and, once they hone in, it's a laser beam shot. Cancer's charm and magnetism are qualities which will prove most alluring to a lover and, coupled with their nurturing need, will prove hard to resist. The Crab loves to feel secure, so a lover who remembers birthdays and other special days, or simply pops a bottle of champagne for no special reason, will be rewarded with tenderness and affection. If the Crab tests a lover with occasional bouts of jealousy, it's only because a stronger emotional response is craved. The ideal Cancer soul mate can spoon on the couch and watch TV all night long. Cancer in Love A slow, yet smoldering, courtship is what the Crab loves. What's the rush, anyway? The Crab is determined to win, so the prelims should go on for as long as possible. Once love is in the air, Cancerians prove themselves devoted lovers, protective of the object of their affections, and unusually helpful and sympathetic. The Crab is an emotional bag of tricks and will feel most things very strongly, so don't be the one to cross them.

The emotional firepower that can be aroused within Cancer usually manifests it self as a series of wonderful fantasies and less as sexual acrobatics. Either way, it's pure pl easure for both partners. The Crab is also quite intuitive and can generally sense what their love r wants, which makes an encounter between the sheets a finely-tuned union. Cancer's feminine side is often on display in the bedroom, which means the Crab enjoys being made love to. The goo d news is that the Crab is a very receptive student! With the Crab, sex often equals lo ve and its nurturing aspects (such as home and hearth), so anyone who can appeal to this sign's deep need for security is likely to unleash a volcanic eruption of sensual treats.

An exchange of emotions is also ideal for the Crab, whether it's through sex, spor ts or some passionately-penned correspondence. Cancerians are great one-on-one and love that type of interaction, but they are also good at parties and enjoy dazzling a crowd. Consequently, an understanding lover is key. A partner as intuitive as the Crab will also help to draw them out of their shell and keep them out. In the end, a strong partner who can set the table and be there for the Crab is heaven-sent, and if they know how to retreat when necessary, even better.

Love Match Cancer and Aries When Aries and Cancer come together in a love affa ir, it's a case of opposites attracting. Aries is rash and brash while Cancer is sensitive and emotional. Aries can certainly be emotional -- in a fiery, impetuous way that can completely overwhelm Cancer. Even though Cancer usually likes to take time with relationships, Aries's whirlwind approach can be ex tremely stimulating. Aries, on the other hand, may find the Cancerian sensitivit y appealing; it's a good balance for the typical Aries bluntness. Troubles may arise if Cancer's mood swings or Aries's aggression becomes hurtful. Both Signs must take time to listen to their partner's needs and understand that they're coming from different directions to meet a common goal. Cancer is the Sign of Home while Aries is the Sign of Self. One great dynamic between these two is that both Signs are extremely protective of thos e they love. Cancer uses that Crab shell to draw around themselves and their family and mate when trouble is near, while the Ram uses their strength and bravery, like a knight in shining armor. Cancer also provides Aries with a happy domestic life and emotional security. Sometimes they might build an idealized image of their Aries partner or be overly possessive , which can really grate on independent Aries. However, Aries can help by reassuring their Cancer partner that they are loved and cherished. Aries really needs to learn to listen to Cancer: the Crab operates on an instinctive level and their advice can help Aries avoid making silly mistakes caused by that typical Aries lack of planning. Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars and Cancer is ruled by the emotional Moon. Mars was the God of War, and Aries is a soldier meeting every challenge head-on. Aries's open, passionate nature appeals to Cancer, who often internalizes emotions and feelings. Cancer can have intense, feminine energy and Aries can help them learn to release it. The Moon controls tides of the Earth, quietly affecting all life; similarly, Cancer works behind the scenes (while Aries rushes into battle). Cancer tends to be sentimental and can teach Ar ies to slow down and appreciate life instead of always rushing on to the next thing. Aries is a Fire Sign and Cancer is a Water Sign. These two elements can be a great combination if they work together, using both emotion and action to get things done. Cancer can help Aries slow down and learn to be gentle, while Aries teaches Cancer to come out of their shells. But Cancer can be emotionally manipulative -- some times there's just too much Water dampening Aries's enthusiasm. Conversely, too much Fire can cause Water to evaporate, leaving Cancer emotionally raw. Aries and Cancer must talk openly and freely to ensure their balance is maintained. Aries and Cancer are both Cardinal Signs. Both Signs are initiators, but they have to learn to cooperate. On the surface, Aries is the leader , always rushing out to meet a challenge, but Cancer is also indirectly in charge through emotio nal control and the ability to weigh the situation. Cancer tends to compromise more easily while Aries can be unwilling to yield, so the Crab may have to accept giving in. What's the best aspect of the Aries-Cancer rela tionship? Once they realize they're on the same team, the combination of Fire and Water works well together. Aries is out there getting attention and Cancer is quietly supporting the back end.

The Taurus-Cancer partnership tends to be a ha ppy one due to this mutual enjoyment of the security and comfort of home. They love a solid home base, a strong relationship, nice possessions, good food: all the comforts of domesti c life.

Taurus must understand Cancer's emotional sensitivity, and Cancer needs rely on open, honest communication than on emotional blackmail. Taurus is ruled by Venus (Love) and Cancer is ruled by the Moon (Emotions). Both of these celestial bodies vibrate with feminine energy. Cancer often keeps emotions bottled up and simmering inside, which can lead to occasional boil-overs. Thus, Cancer is attracted to Taurus's open, honest, unafraid nature. As the Moon controls the tides of the Earth, quietly affecting all life, so does Cancer, manipulating behind the scene s. Cancer tends to be sentimental, and both partners prefer to enjoy each other rat her than socializing with large groups. Taurus is an Earth Sign and Cancer is a Water Sign. Water and Earth are compatible as tangible, physical entities. As a Water Sign, Cancer is bo rn to nurture an Earth Sign like Taurus the way rain nurtures Earth and helps crops grow.

This can prov ide Cancer with an emotional rock, as Taurus is entirely dedicated to the relationship.

The steady, reliable team they make. Both Signs are dependable and nurturing, stro ngly oriented toward domestic life together. A mutual love of home and security makes theirs an ideal long-term, family relationship. Cancer and Gemini When Gemini and Cancer come together in a love affair, it may be a rather curious relationship. Sensitive, emotional Cancer has trouble commu nicating clearly, but clear communication is what defines Gemini. Gemini's chivalrous nature a nd silver tongue may encourage the Crab to come out of its shell more quickly than usual; Cancer, in turn, can teach Gemini to slow down and appreciate the world, which the frenetic Twins hard ly ever take time to do. If Gemini seems to ignore Cancer or doesn't provide them with as much reassurance and intimacy as Cancer needs, trouble may ensue. These two Signs approach the wo rld in such different manners that they must be able to understand and accept one another's differences. Cancer is the Sign of home and hearth, while Gemini is the thinker. Gemini can easily slip into the role of Cancer's knight in shining armor; Cancer returns that favor with their characteristic urge to protect the ones they love. Quality of home life is important to Cancer, and Gemini will be spoiled by their Cancer lover's hearty home cooking, soft bed and other creature comforts. Cancer is strongly intuitive and maintains an almost psychic connection with their loved ones, but can tend toward possessiveness and idealization of their Gemini partner. If Gemini just reassures Cancer that they're loved and cherished, a ll will go smoothly. Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury (Comm unication) and Cancer is ruled by the Moon (Emotions). Cancer tends to keep their emotions bottled up inside as they have trouble expressing themselves. They envy Geminis thei r gift of open, clear communication afforded by the influence of Mercury. Gemini, in turn, ca n benefit from Cancer's intuitive approach, so different from Gemini's bubbly, surface nature; Cancer can teach Gemini to slow down and appreciate life instead of passing by the good things in their rush to get to the next new thing."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Gemini is an Air Sign and Cancer is a Water Sign. If these two Signs can work together they can be a great team; after all, the best decisions are made by incorporating the emotions and the intellect. The trouble for these two lies in learni ng to cooperate. They come from such opposite points of view that at times it can seem as if they simply have nothing in common. Deep, emotional Cancer can also sometimes dampen Gemi ni's airy enthusiasm, and light, fast-paced Gemini can leave Cancer feeling ruffled, even tattered. Balance can be achieved if they learn to talk openly with one another. Gemini is a Mutable Sign and Cancer is a Cardinal Signs. Gemini is flexible, willing to go with the flow and follow another's lead; Cancer is an initiato r and likes to provide that lead. Gemini may try to lead by being brave, even confr ontational; for it to run smoothl y between these two, they both need to learn when to back down and let the other lead the way. What's the best aspect of the Ge mini-Cancer relationsh ip? Once they realiz e they're allies, they can soar to great heights together. Gemini is always thinking ahead and Cancer is quietly supporting these ideas behind the scenes. Each partner's ability to provide what the other is lacking makes theirs a fulfilling relationship. Cancer and Cancer When two Cancerians come together in a love affair, a loving and yet very emotional domestic relationship ensues. A Cancer-Cancer match makes for a deeply devoted duo, endlessly loyal to one another. Both will learn the ins-and-outs of t heir partner, the best ways to heat each other up or, if necessary, to cool one another down. Bo th will also find great comfort and satisfaction in their underlying commitment to one another. This couple is faithful and caring, helpful and sympathetic of individual needs and very oriented toward making a home and creating a sense of family -- especially when they can get over t heir brooding, manipulative and self-pitying habits. If they can find a way to keep their fluid and moody emotions in check, this relationship will nurture both lovers. A Cancer's place is in the home. Once safely entrenched in their personal sanctuary, the moody Crab may forget about the world outside, not paying mind to the opinions of others, only concerned with what's going on behind their own closed doors. This attitude carries over into relationships: Like their cherished possessions and material comforts, Ca ncer never hesitates to defend a loved one if threatened. This devotion a nd willingness to fight and toil for the survival and success of their relationships are really a Cra b's greatest contributions to the game of love. It's no wonder Cancer's symbol is the 'crabby' scuttling Crab, for outbursts and flare-ups are common with this emotional crustacean. While their mood swings may injure each other's feelings, it's a Cancer's subtle mastery of t he fine art of emotional manipulation that one should watch out for. The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and this Sign is sensitive to the moods that ebb and flow with the Moon's monthly cycles. The Moon, the maternal orb of the heavens, is the celestial force behind Cancer's great maternal and care-giving nat ure. The energy of this instinct creates a warm, secure home environment, a perfect love nest for the growing and cultivation of a healthy relationship. Cancer is a Water Sign. Instinct and emotion drive this relationship. With these deep, intense intuitive powers comes a fragility, as Cancer's feelings are brittle and easily hurt. Hence, that Crabby shell in which they hide themselves when frightened or overwhelmed. So often retreating to their shells can put a strain on any relation ship with a Cancer, but two Crabs together will hopefully be perceptive of each other's needs fo r personal space and temporary time-outs. The key is realizing that it's not a personal slight if one of these Cancers wa nts some alone-time. This Watery element of their nature can protect them and their loved ones from the harsh realities of the outside world. Cancer is a Cardinal Sign. Though not the most physically active of the Signs, a Cancer's quick emotional reflexes and powers of perception offe r an alternate line of defense under stress. The Crab is not shy about getting exactly what they wa nt from their partner. The protecting feral beast within is the first emotional element to leap forw ard under stress or a threat to the pack. However, these bursts of emotion may overwhelm a Cancer and crush their tender feelings. Fierce loyalty binds this Cancer-Cancer love match, but it can also threaten its very existence. Both partners must always strive to see things from their lover's point of view as well as their own. What's the best thing about the Cancer-Cancer love match? Their utter devotion to enriching their commitment and the strong emotional bond between them. Together, this pair will protect one another and keep their love safe from the outside world, as well as work toward creating a happy domestic life and nurturing a loving family."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Both Leo and Cancer prefer comfort and security, and they prefer both on a grand scale. Cancer and Leo enjoy a lovely home and a close-knit fam ily. Leo provides the flair and the passion, and Cancer brings to the home a sensitive but intens e instinct to nurture. Leo is the bigger and bolder and more vivid of this couple, the picture of majesty and status. Because both Signs are so strong-minded, these two must always work a ttentively to understand and accept one another. The intense and emotional Moon (Emotion) rule s Cancer, while the bright, bold Sun (the Self) rules Leo. The Sun is about ego and self, radiating warmth and light, and vibrant Leo indeed radiates this kind of energy and enthusiasm. T he Moon concerns itself with nurturing, with creating and maintaining emotional connections. This combination of masculine and feminine energy is why the Sun and the Moon adore and sustain one another other as they do. The Sun represents life, and The Moon cultivation and growth; as long as they are mindful of their inherent differences, their combination can be a positive one. Cancer is a Water Sign, and Leo is a Fire Sign. Leo strives with an ardent energy toward praise and appreciation, while Cancer yearns more for security and stability. Both Signs like to take charge, but they come at a leadership role fr om very different directions. No small number of disputes can rise from this difference. As l ong as Cancer and Leo never take for granted their relationship, as long as they reassure one an other in practical and romantic ways that this relationship is important to both of them, they can usually find a happy medium. Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Leo is a Fixed Sign. Under stress, Leo becomes opinionated and stubborn, and Cancer can act as a subtle manipulat ive force. Cancer's the persistent initiator of shared plans, and Leo channels their energies and works doggedly to move plans to completion. If given the choice, the Crab would choose a ca lm and stable life, having no need for glamour or acclaim. Leo, on the other hand, loves to shake things up and embraces the unexpected and the novel. Though a Leo and a Cancer may commit emotionally to a relationship, each of them can continue to follow their natural instincts AND devote themselves thoroughly and completely to one another. If, however, they haven't made their love intentions clear to one another, they may find themselves on a never-ending emotional roller co aster ride. Cancer, hiding behind that innocent shell of theirs, can be the more quietly contro lling of this pair and might -- to a degree -- manipulate their Leo loved one when it seems practical to do so. What's the best aspect of the Cancer-Leo rela tionship? Their mutual commitment to a sincere relationship. Together this pair can share a supportive, positive and healthy vibe. People see them as a winning combination, and their mutual desire for a secure, loving relationship makes them strive for harmony. Cancer and Virgo When Cancer and Virgo make a love match, a st rong, down-to-earth rela tionship with staying power is the happy result. This is a relationship with great potential to get better and better over the passing years. Both Cancer and Virgo are goal-oriented and disciplined. They are sincere and devoted to one another and share a strong sense of purpose. No lightweight love here: These two were not really built for flings! Cancer and Virgo deeply admire one another: Virgo respects Cancer's quiet strength and dedication while Cancer appreciates Virgo's keen adaptability and intelligence. These lovers may get off to a slow start, but over time, bonds will only grow stronger. The Cancer-Virgo love match prides itself on common sense and strong principles over fluff and inconsequential or fleeting connections. They enjoy t he material comforts of life, but they will only feel good about their bounty if it has come as a result of honest hard work. There could be tiffs if Virgo becomes too critical for Cancer's easily bruised feelings; Cancer needs to understand that it's just Virgo's nature to point out what they observe, that it's not a personal attack. A Virgo may bristle at their Cancer mate's stubborn streak, but it's a trait that a patient and understanding love partner like Virgo could come to appreciate. Also, Virgo's urge to serve suits Cancer's affectionate, nurturing nature well. Cancer and Leo When Cancer and Leo make a love match, they understand and know how to satisfy basic emotional needs within one another. Both these Signs require dedication and tender, loving care, but while Cancer seeks stability and emotional harmony, Leo craves heartfelt compliments and sincere admiration. Both are strongly loyal, even to the point of possessiveness, Cancer for safety's sake, Leo for the sake of their self-confidence. They are also both committed to a enduring, rewarding connection. Since their desire s are similar, a Cancer and a Leo may fill very important voids in each other's lives."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and Mercury (Communication) rules Virgo. Though they're very different planets, they're both near t he Sun and therefore always in one another's neighborhoods. The Moon is a mothering influence; it's about cultivation and fostering growth, which are both central concerns for Cancer. Mercury is all about communication, and it's an androgynous energy -- Virgo will adapt and take on t he form that it chooses, the guise that best serves a situation. Virgo takes an intellectual approach to life (especially compared to the emotional Cancer), but still manages to be percept ive and intuitive enough to figure others out if they choose. Good thing for the Crab, then, that a Virgo mate can get a feel for devotion and domestic fulfillment if that's what their Cancer lover desires. These two won't argue about fulfilling one another's needs. They'll work at it and re lish the rewards of their conscientiousness. Cancer is a Water Sign, and Virgo is an Earth Sign. Earth Signs, true to their name, are down-to- earth, but they can also be materialistic and pr eoccupied with acquisition. The Cancer-Virgo love partners like to surround themselves with comfor table, well-crafted things. Water Signs rely on feeling and intuition, making Cancer the emotive fo rce behind this relationship, in a subtle Cancer way, of course. Along with their desire for pros perity, their love of a fancy home life ensures that this couple will work hard toward this shared goal. Also, they're practical pair, and losing control is never really an issue. Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Virgo is a Mutable Sign. While Cancer gets things going, Virgo thrives on a changing routine of responsibilities and challenges . Because they're so ubiquitous, Virgo will find a place in Cancer's plans if they really want to. Virgo w ill keep in mind Cancer's plans, and will eventually bring results even if Cancer has moved on. What's the best aspect of Canc er-Virgo relationship? Their dedication to working toward the same goals. Both partners in this love match enjoy a stable home life and nice things, and Virgo truly enjoys helping Cancer along the way to achieving their goals. Their shared goals and desires make theirs a highly compatible love match. Cancer and Libra When Cancer and Libra make a love match, they give to one another important things that each lacks. Both Signs seek a secure, assured relationship and will enjoy their shared appreciation for beauty and luxury -- especially when it comes to their domestic environment. These two can blend their energies harmoniously if they choose to work toward a common goal. Though this pairing may progress more slowly than some others , and at first they may fear that they have little else in common than their mutual needs for co mpanionship and love of beauty. However, the more they get to know one another, the better each individual in this Canc er-Libra love match will recognize and respect positive qualities in the other. Neither Cancer nor Libra shy away from combining the powers of their emot ion and their intellect, and both enjoy the occasional teary opera or sentimental heirloom. Expression of sentiment and happiness are important to both Signs, and Cancer and Libra can complement one another in many ways. Cancer appreciates Libra's charm and tact, and Libra's calm, cool diplomacy skills can tame even the wildest pouting fit a Cancer can muster up. Also, Libra, lover of aesthetic beauty and harmony, will appreciate their Cancer mat e's nurturing instinct for a comfortable home and the security that comes with it. Libra can offer the sometimes emotionally impetuous Cancer some perspective on situations. Cancer needs to s ee the different sides of an issue, or this Crab may be prone to making decisions without knowing all the facts. Conversely, Cancer can help Libra cure their notorious indecision. The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and the Planet Venus (Love) rules Libra. These planetary partners share a love of home, family and romance. While Libra is known for its balancing nature (the Balance is Libra's symbol, after all!), these love partners share nurturing personalities and desire harmony over conflict. More than any other match-up of Signs, this astrological pair brings a warmth and sense of stability to those around them. Despite all the harmony and homey happiness, though, Librans, whose life approach is based on intellect, can be a bit snobbish and superior, and Cancer, who looks at life through emotional lenses, still has those easily bruised feelings to contend with. Cancer is a Water Sign, and Libra is an Air Sign. Libra sees life as a pure mental exploration, while Cancer's experience is more tactile, more kinesthetic. Cancer is most satisfied when their emotional needs are met, while Libra simply focuses on what stimulates their mind. At times, these lovers may find it difficult to understand one another. Conflicts can arise in this relationship if Cancer seems too crabby or Libra seems too provocative. Both need to learn that they simply view the world in different ways."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Cancer and Libra are both Cardinal Signs. In this relationship, there could be struggles over who wears the pants, who's at the steering wheel, who's really in control here. If Libra's indecision irritates Cancer, Libra can turn on their subtle charm and sense of fairness and go along with Cancer's decision -- as long as Cancer doesn't get Crabby! Both are initiators, which can, when their ideas and approaches differ, be quite a struggle. What's the best thing about the Ca ncer-Libra love match? Their mutual appreciation of stability and domestic balance. Aesthetics matter to them, and they share a love of the comforts in life. Their similar tastes and loves make theirs a relationship of great dedication and harmony. Cancer and Scorpio When Cancer and Scorpio make a love match, the resulting relationship draws together the energies of two emotionally intense Signs. Si gns such as these often combine well, each partner's strengths balancing the other's w eaknesses. These Signs feel a strong sexual attraction, and when they are together the temper ature in the room tends to rise! Cancer and Scorpio have a great deal in common, and much potential to keep their relationship passionate and going strong. Cancer and Scorpio enjoy buying things together and creating a comfortable living space: Cancer craves security and Scorpio strives for power. Bo th occupy their minds with thoughts of domestic goods and resources, including stocks, bonds and inheritances. Since they are both concerned with the home and have fierce loyalties to the family group, Cancer and Scorpio complement each other well. They both see life as a passi onate and deeply emotionally exercise of human connection. The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, while Mars (Passion) and Pluto (Power) both rule Scorpio. Thanks to Pluto's powerful influence, this is an intense combination of Planets, but it's also a good balance of masculine and feminine energy. These two Signs coming together form the basic foundation of human relationships -- The Moon's nurturing love and Mars' ambition and passion. The Moon and Mars go well together; the Moon is about growth and rebirth, and Mars is about the passion of romance. Scorpio, influenced by that Martian energy, is smoldering and intense, and emotional Cancer is attracted to this intens ity. In turn, Scorpio enjoys the adoration inherent to Moon-ruled, nurturing Cancer. Cancer and Scorpio are both Water Signs. Both are very deep Signs and, like the ocean, you can never really see to the bottom of these two. Sc orpio and Cancer may draw further and further into themselves, then suddenly roar back with intimi dating force. Loyalty is strong with this love match, thanks to their mutual desire for emotional security. But while Cancer fixes their emotional energy on the family and home, Scorpio focuses more on life's nuances and undertones, the secrets behind other's intentions, the power they can wield over other's emotions. Scorpio can take Cancer on a journey beyond the literal surface of things, and Cancer's expansive heart can open Scorpio up to their own emotions, teaching their Scorpio mate that feeling is nothing to fear. Additionally, Scorpio appreciates their Cancer mate's practicality, and Cancer really enjoys Scorpio's jealousy -- it proves that Sc orpio really loves and cherishes them. Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Scorpio is a Fixed Sign. Once this couple have a common wish, it will come true. However, if their opinions clash, look out! Cancer will be t he first to instigate an argument and Scorpio the last to finish it. Cancer may seem to act as the dominant partner and manage to get their way more often, but that isn' t always the truth. Sometimes Scorpio won't even agree to disagree, they just might pretend to give in. Neither Cancer nor Scorpio are beyond using emotional manipulation to get revenge. Rather than letting disagreements and bad feelings boil over, these love partners must discuss what's truly important to them in order to reach an equitable compromise. Once Scorpio and Cancer learn to trust and believe in one another, they can achieve almost anything through sheer determination. This love relationship will only fail if the two partners truly cannot overcome t heir opinionated, stubborn sides. What's the best thing about the Cancer-Scorpio love match? Their powerful teamwork when they agree on their goals. When Cancer realizes that Scorpio is there for the long haul and that the partnership is emotionally productive, this rela tionship can blossom. Their mutual determination makes theirs a relationship of formidable strength."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"These two lovers, Cancer and Sagittarius, have different approaches to life; Cancer lives on emotion and tradition, and Sagittarius is the restle ss wanderer. Cancer's emotional tidal wave can be difficult and overwhelming for Sagittarius to accept. And Cancer might be resistant to accepting their Sagittarian mate's restlessness and craving for external activities. A Cancer partner can offer a Sagittarius a secure home base, a place where Sag can go to keep their dreams and ambitions in perspective. The Sagittarius free spirit can lend Cancer's daily life a little diversity and excitement. The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and Jupiter (Philosophy) rules Sagittarius. The Moon is about love, nurturing and the maternal instinct. Jupiter focuses on expansion, optimism, luck and travel. Together this is combination of growth and expan sion and of masculine and feminine energy; the two can sustain each other. When working toward a common goal, these two can combine their energies to great effect. Cancer is a Water Sign, and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. Sagittarius desires freedom, while Cancer longs for emotional security and stability, and thes e basic needs color their approach to life, to projects and to relationships. One lover may not always get where the other lover is coming from, but when they put their complementary energi es together, sparks can fly and dreams can come true. If they value their intimate connection and their friendship and respect one another's opinions, their conflicts can usually be resolved. Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign. Sagittarius moves from idea to idea and venture to venture as the feeling takes them, wh ile Cancer is the instigator of new plans. A Cancer mate must give their Sagittarius love r the freedom to explore their own space and interests external to the relationship. Cancer can bring Sagittarius' great ideas to life, even if Sagittarius has lost interest and moved on. S agittarius teaches Cancer the virtues of an open mind over constant and inflexible determination. What's the best part of the Cancer-Sagittarius love match? The security they can give one another (once Cancer gives Sagittarius the freedom to offer that security freely). They make a compatible couple once they open themselves up to one another and accept as valid each other's differing life philosophies. If the lines of communication remain open and clear, and as long as these two take time to apprecia te and celebrate their differences , theirs will be a stable and happy relationship. Cancer and Capricorn When Cancer and Capricorn make a love match, it's a celestial pairing of great tenacity and determination. Capricorn, the Sea Goat, is focu sed on logic, on being down-to-earth and real; Cancer brings a charge of emotional intensity to the relationship. Both hold one another to high standards tempered by an abiding mutual respect. In a Capricorn mate, Cancer finds dedication, and in return Capricorn comes to love Cancer's persistence. These two Signs from opposite sides of the Zodiac can come together to create a very successful and secure connection. This relationship builds and grows from a strong foundation of material and emotional security. Both Signs can be depended on to make frugal, conservative decisions. It doesn't have to be all solemnity, though, as Cancer can help their hard-wo rking Capricorn lover to relax a little at the end of the day, to take time to enjoy the reward s of all that labor. Cancer will also be the one to polish and preserve the fruits of their shared acco mplishments; Cancer is the keeper of nostalgia and cherished memories and possessions. Capr icorn moves Cancer toward achievement and keeps in check their Crab-like tendencies, enlightening Cancer to the more important matters of the world outside their own easily bruised heart. This relationship succeeds if there is an ironclad commitment and a stable, traditional home environment.

The Moon is a warm, feminine energy, and Saturn a cold, masculine e nergy. The Moon is emotional and nurturing; it is about maternal care giving and intuition, both of which become vital to Cancer. Saturn practices integrity and discipline to achieve goals. A Cancer love mate can show their serious Capricorn companion how to enjoy life and to appreciate beauty and comfort. Mothering Cancer truly enjoys smoothing over Capricorn's hard edges. Conversely, the Sea Goat can smooth Cancer's ruffled emotional feathers by providing the sort of solid foundation that Cancer desperately craves. Capricorn teaches Cancer to be more disciplined and to go out into the world and strive toward goals. Cancer is a Water Sign, and Capricorn is an Earth Sign. Earth Signs focus on possessions, Water Signs on emotion and intuition, but al so on beauty and nostalgia. The Cancer-Capricorn love mates like to surround themselves with beautiful things -- a stately home, gorgeous artwork, expensive cars. Their desire to be economically st able and their love of finery ensures that this couple will work hard toward this and other shar ed goals. This mutual love for fine things keeps them out of arguments about one partner trying to live ostentatiously or beyond their means. Cancer and Capricorn are Cardinal Signs. Both are initiatory, active and ardent. Though this can be a catalyst for some dynamite conflicts, it c an provide Capricorn with an emotional pillar, as Cancer is entirely dedicated to the relationship. Their differing emotional dispositions complement each other well -- Capricorn excels in getting t he nitty-gritty business done, and Cancer always steps in when emotional counseling is needed. Th ese Signs will get along well if Capricorn and Cancer allow one another to use their respective individual strengths. What's the best thing about the Cancer-Capricorn relationship? Their utter dedication to one another and their mutual commitments toward shared goals. Both are lovers of quality and of beautiful, luxurious things, and neither shirks at the idea of a little hard work if that's what it takes (in fact, Capricorn would rather be working than almost anything!). Thei r shared passions, sense of responsibility and morality make theirs a highly compatible relationship. Cancer and Aquarius When Cancer and Aquarius make a love match, it can be a case of opposites attracting. Cancer takes an emotional approach to life, Aquarius, an offbeat, unconventional approach. While Cancer often retreats into its shell, Aquarius takes every opportunity to be the extrovert, the organizer and party animal. They love to find t hemselves amongst friends; social settings are simply their thing! If a Cancer and an Aquarius can find a way to combine these qualities in a positive way, they can go anywhere together. Both Cancer and Aquarius can be ambitious and determined. They want to get their way, and neither likes to conflict. Cancer can be old-fash ioned, attached to tradition and routine, their morals more conservative than progressive. A quarius, on the other hand, is very modern and likely numbed by routine, yawning at the dull and the boring in which Cancer sometimes finds comfort. Cancer may be intrigued by their Aquarius lover's sense of excitement, but this traditional Crab could get frustrated trying to keep up with this revolutionary's mind. Though Aquarius won't appreciate the possessiveness of a pinching Crab, they could find great comfort in the solid base Cancer provides. Just try to get them to admit it! The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and Saturn (Karma) and Uranus (Rebellion) rules Aquarius. The Moon is a radiant, feminine energy and Saturn is a cool, contained masculine energy. Uranus is about all things abnormal and novel. The Moon is emotional and concerned with growth and domesticity, both of which become central them es in many Cancer's lives. Saturn deals with hard work and the discipline required for achievem ent, while Uranus symbolizes forward thought. This combination makes sense for an Aquarian, as they are futurists unafraid of getting their hands dirtied by labor. Cancer mates can teach social, intellectual Aquarius lovers the value of emotional impulses, and their feminine influe nce will bring beauty and comfort into the home. While Cancer teaches the valuable lesson of an open heart, Aquarius can come right back with the usefulness of a detached heart. Aquarians ar e blessed to be able to extricate themselves from uncontrollable situations and to reevaluate go als if they get off-course. Not necessarily cold, Aquarius could still benefit from Cancer's warm, feminine Moon-based influence."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Cancer is a Water Sign, and Aquarius is an Air Sign. Aquarius sees life as an intellectual exercise, a constant exploration and expansion of the mind. Cancer's more pragmatic. Cancer stops to ask, 'how does this feel?' while Aquari ans keep asking 'what else is there?' It may be tough for one to get where the other is coming from, and conflicts can arise if Aquarius gets a little too cool or Cancer too emotionally demanding. They may end up working at cross-purposes: Cancer asks for more and more, Aquarius may pull further and further away. By accepting that their worldviews are dissimilar, Cancer and Aquarius can move on and celebrate their diversity, learn to say 'vive la difference' rather than feeling threatened by it. Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. Both persevere when working toward goals. If they have a set path, they'll follow it to the end. With this sort of shared perseverance -- and if they both place a high value on their relati onship -- this couple will never be dissuaded from that knowledge and will constantly think of one another. If they run into snags, Aquarius will discover that Cancers, though they may seem shy and retire into their shells, can actually be very tenacious and dogmatic, not above using emoti onal manipulation on their loved ones. Also, Aquarius could be bothered by Cancer's over-emo tionality. If they agree to work toward a common goal, these two can get along. What's the best thing about the Cancer-Aquarius love match? When they decide to come together, they are an indomitable force! When t hey decide to combine their disparate energies, Cancer and Aquarius can find their own natural balance and have fun with their differences rather than letting them frighten them away from a chance to love. Cancer and Pisces A love match between a Cancer and a Pisces is a positive meeting of spirits. Both signs are basically tolerant and sympathetic, and Pisces is easily energized by Cancer's ideas. A Pisces mate can open a Cancer's eyes to the world of creativity and spirituality. In turn, Cancer's practicality can be a guide, leading Pisces to the fruition of their dreamy, utopian ideas. This celestial pairing benefits from an amazingl y strong and multifaceted emotional bond. Cancer loves material goods, they admire and they appreciate. Cancer desires comfort and a rich home, and at times might not underst and the simplistic, minimalist lifestyle of their Pisces mate. Though they may work toward different goals of acquisition and lifestyle, the shared emotional depth of Cancer and Pisces can make theirs a very rewarding relationship. The Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, and Jupiter (Philosophy) and Neptune (Illusion and Dreams) rules Pisces. When the Moon and Neptune come together, a beautiful spiritual connection is made. Both of these celestial bodies vibrate wi th warm, feminine energy. Together, they create an idealistic, almost divine relationship, one t hat puts much significance on dreams and illusions. Jupiter also rules Pisces. This Planet of Good Fortune adds a masculine energy to this planetary combination, representing philosophy, expansion and excesses. The nature of this combination offers a utopian relationship: It is drenched in emotional intrigue and is a true celestial bond. Emotion, depth, warmth, expansion -- it all so unds too good to be true, doesn't it. Though they both ask a lot of their love relationships, Cancer must be careful not to cramp the floating Fish, as Pisces will suffocate und er too many demands. Cancer and Pisces are both Water Signs. Since Water is a tangible, physical entity, Cancer and Pisces are generally very compatible. Pisces are in this world to create human connections, and when they come together with Cancerian intuit ion and nurturing, there is no stronger bond. So that this union does not wash out in a stream of romantic idealism, Cancer's stable view of life holds them afloat. And it's not a case of Cancer putting up with a dreamy Pisces mate: Cancer really understands emotional ambiguity and can he lp Pisces stabilize their ephemeral nature. Though Cancer could grow weary of their Pisces mate's faraway nature, and though Pisces could be bothered by Cancer's self-centeredness, it's easy for this pair to find a compromise. Cancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Though intuitive, in love, as in life, Cancer likes to get things moving with a good idea and a solid plan, and they'll write it all down to keep track. Pisces, on the other hand, is more about going on instinct; they'd lose that plan as soon as Cancer handed it to them! Cancer needs to give Pisces the freedom to enjoy their external interests and to occasionally follow a whim undeterred. Pisces can show Cancer that completion is sometimes better than initiation, and that compromise without struggle can pay off. Cancer and Pisces feed off of each other's energy well, and should be completely compatible in romance."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"What's the best thing about the Cancer-Pisces love match?

Both ambition and idealism are present under Leo, for the brilliance of this sign reflects the grandeur of the governing planet, the Sun. But Leo, as well as being high-minded, can be high-handed. When persons of this type fall victims to their own shortcomings, the result can prove disastrous. Worse, it is usually not noticeable until after the crash. There is little of the negative in Leo. That is what makes this sign deceptive and sometimes deceitful. Leo people are impulsive, generous, and brave, quick to follow their own intuition. Their success is furthered by their own marked influence upon all persons that they meet, often winning over those who oppose them by their sheer magnetic qualities. Leo people insist on charting their own course and do so with an inherent vigor. Peridot Gold Rock Crystal Gold Sun Sunflower"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Leo is the fifth Sign of the Zodiac. These folks are impossible to miss, since they love being center stage. Making an impression is Job O ne for Leos, and when you consider their personal magnetism, you see the job is quite easy. Leos are an ambitious lot, and their strength of purpose allows them to accomplish a great deal. The fact that these folks are also creative makes their endeavors fun for them and everyone else. It's quite common to see a Leo on stage or in Hollywood, since these folks never shy away from the limelight. They are also supremely talented and have a flair for the dramatic. Warmth and enthusiasm seems to seep from every Leo pore, making these folks a pleasure to be around. They do love pleasure! It's the Lion which symbolizes Leos, and the king (or queen) of the jungle is a most appropriate mascot, since these folks consider themselves the rulers of t heir universe (and the Zodiac at that). Like Lions, Leos tend to be dignified and strong, and it is this sense of their power which allows them to get things done. A Leo on your team is a good thing, since Lions are eager to see their projects through to completion. Putting these folks at the helm is a good thing, too, since the Leo-born are natural leaders. They may ruffle a few feathers along the way, however, since they can also be overbearing and somewhat autocratic. This may be in keeping with the Fixed Quality assigned to this Sign -- Lions are indeed opinionated and set in their ways. That said, they are well organized, idealistic and have a knack for inspiring others. Leo is ruled by the Sun, the center of the universe and the fuel for our being. In much the same way, Leos consider themselves indispensable and the center of the universe, and those who would tell them otherwise had better look out! Lions are outgoing, self-assured and have a tremendous zest for life. So what if the world revolves around them? There are worse role models, for sure. The Lion's enthusiasm is boundless, and along with that comes generosity of spirit and the determination to succeed. That focus may be construed as vanity and even bossiness at times, but Lions would say 'No way!' and continue along their regal path. Regardless of appearance, those born under this Sign can be counted on for their loyalty and sense of honor. They are also decisive, intensely proud and wonderfully romantic. The Element associated with Leo is Fire. Everything about the Lion's personality is hot, hot, hot. Those born under this Sign are fearless and strong, which may be why Lions plunge in head first and let the chips fall where they may. Thankfully, Leos are dignified enough not to commit too many pratfalls. It's the Lion's unswerving courage that wins so many folks over. If you need someone to lead the charge, call a Leo -- and the bigger the project, the better, since these folks love an expansive stage (and the audience that comes with it). While some would take to calling Lions status-conscious, these folks are truly warmhearted and want everyone to be happy. Hey, it's their kingdom, and happy campers make for a perfect peace. Further, it's the great gift of the Leo-born to be dynamic, forward-thinking and self-confident. These attributes certainly catch the attention of others, making Leos sought after by both friends and lovers. The Lion's charms extend to all, even to the children they dearly love. Yes, the pleasure principle is paramount to the Lion, and along those lines, Leos are great at spending money. Lions can't fathom an uncomfortable throne. Leos also enjoy trying their luck at the tables, so expect to find them living it up in Las Vegas. Come play time, Leos are at their best. Those born under this Sign enjoy fun and games both outdoors and in (and with a group), so expect to find them playing softball, hockey or a game of cards. Lions are al so a natural at the gym, where they can show their stuff to a crowd. When the lights are low, the essential Lion comes to the fore, since this beast is 90% fun and 100% romantic. The Leo lover is devoted, creative and almost too hot to handle! Since Leo rules the heart and back, however, overzealous Lions may have to take a deep breath and slow down a bit. You can bet that the Lion's home will be swaddled in royal purple and gold. The great strengths of the Leo-born are their creativity, idealism and leadership. Lions don't lack for ambition, either, so they're likely to accomplish a lot -- and have fun while they're at it. Their warmth and loyalty ensures that others will enjoy the ride as well.

The fixed motivation adds self-reliance, a characteristic that works well in leadership positions. Leo is a formative energy, with the ability to consolidate and stabilize. Fire can rage out of control, so it helps to balance self-confidence with humility! Leo needs to become a humble but lovable lion. The playfulness associated with Leo can regress to childish demands for attention, as opposed to healthy recognition and encouragement. Leo benefits by allowing peaceful receptivity to surface. The mature Leo exudes big, beautiful heart and sheds sunshine on all who care to enjoy this bold spirit. Personalities The Positive Side of Leo: Often Leos make good leaders. They seem to be good organizers and administrators. Usually they are quite popular with others. Whatever group it is that he belongs to, the Leo man is almost sure to be or become the leader. The Leo person is generous most of the time. It is his best characteristic. He or she likes to give gifts and presents. In making others happy, the Leo person becomes happy himself.

He does what he can for those who are deserving. He is a person others can rely upon at all times. He means what he says. An honest person, generally speaking, he is a friend that others value. The Negative Side of Leo: Leo, however, does have his faults. At times, he can be just a bit too arrogant. He thinks that no one deserves a leadership position except him. Only he is capable of doing things well. His opinion of himself is often much too high. Because of his conceit, he is sometimes rather unpopular with a good many people. Some Leos are too materialistic; they can only think in terms of money and profit. Some Leos enjoy lording it over others-at home or at their place of business. What is more, they feel they have the right to. Egocentric to an impossible degree, this sort if Leo cares little about how others think or feel. He can be rude and cutting.

Added to the keen Virgo mind, it produces good reasoners and convincing talkers, though they are apt to spend too much time over trifling details and also talk a subject dry.

Sapphire Grey Tiger's Eye Nickel Mercury Forget Me Not"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Virgo is the sixth Sign of the Zodiac, to be exact, and that's the way Virgos like it: exacting. Those born under this Sign are forever the butt of jokes for being so picky and critical (and they can be), but their 'attention to detail' is for a reason: to help others. Virgos, more than any other Sign, were born to serve, and it gives them great joy. They are also tailor-made for the job, since they are industrious, methodical and efficient. The sense of duty borne by these folks is considerable, and it ensures that they will always work for the greater good. Virgo is represented in modern Astrology by the Virgin, although this association should not be taken literally. Rather, Virgos tend to take on some of the qualities of a Virgin, things like modesty and humanity. Some might consider them repressed, although Virgins would argue that it's a noble quality, as opposed to a negative one. Most of all, Virgos enjoy indulging their practical and logical side and poring over their projects to the nth degree. To say these folks are good at fact- finding almost understates the case, since Virgos revel in their exacting (some would argue pedantic) behavior and are a whiz with minutiae. Virgins are an asset in the workplace as they can be counted on to get things right the first time, every time -- and no detail will be overlooked. They are also balanced and fair in their assessments in keeping with the Mutable Quality assigned to this Sign. Virgo is ruled by the Planet Mercury, and as portrayed in ancient Roman mythology, Mercury wasn't one to sit still for long. This swift-footed god was a bundle of energy , both physically and mentally, and that pretty much sums up the Virgin's makeup. A Virgo's brain is in overdrive most of the time, which is why these folks get so much done. Those born under this Sign are also able communicators and use their mental acuity to maximum advantage. All of this brainpower can make Virgins prone to skepticism, and can even lead to the kind of overthink which surely leads to overkill. Thankfully, though, Virgos are also a studious lot and can temper their worst impulses with a bit of careful analysis. Virgos enjoy studying a situation in great detail, whether it's a work project or a friendship. Virgins are truly interested in understanding things. The bane of many Virgos is the perfectionism which can get in the way of their usual clear thinking. 'I'm not a perfectionist; I'm discriminating!' a Virgo would say, happy in the knowledge that their taste is unparalleled. Along those lines, Virgos are also neat and clean, save for the occasional sloppy Virgin (they do exist). Virgins are also reliable and practical and oh-so-useful to have around. The Element associated with Virgo is Earth, and in keeping with that, most Virgos are grounded, salt-of-the-earth types. The flash and dash can go to others, since Virgos would much rather be humble and easy-going. That said, Virgins do enjoy material possessions and are (dare we say?) picky about what they bring into their lives. Some might even go as far as calling them self-centered, but it's really more of a desire to surround themselves with what's right -- for them. This knack for discernment also serves Virg ins well in business, where their decisions are usually dead-on. Those born under this Sign are eminently sensible and use their critical eye well. While Virgins can be worrywarts, they do their best to temper these impulses. However, if this nervousness goes unchecked, it can lead to hypochondria, that ugly skeleton in the Virgo's closet. For that reason, Virgos are extremely health conscious, to the point of being storehouses of information on diet and hygiene. Many Virgos even choose a health or medical career so they won't miss a beat. Working out is elemental for Virg ins, if only so they know intellectually that they're helping themselves physically. See, the benefits of exercise are far more important to Virgos than the process itself. That's why Virgos are likely to time themselves on their runs and get in those 300 sit-ups every day. When it comes to the game of love, Virgos are able to loosen up somewhat and are devoted to their lovers, even if they can be a bit jealous. Since Virgo rules the intestines, worried Virgins need to be wary of bowel upsets. Soothing relief often comes in the way of earth tones, which is why Virgins like to be surrounded by shades of tan and a warm yellow. The great strength of the Virgo-born is in their practicality, sharp mind and attention to detail. When merged with their willingness to se rve, Virgos become essential helpmates.

A good educational background is important to the Virgo. Mutable' motivation surfaces in the form of helping, teamwork and cooperation. Humbleness and the ability to work behind the scenes, without complaining, often cause Virgos to miss more opportunities than they should. A dose of self-confidence helps Virgo promote what he or she has to offer. Virgo gets stuck if he or she expresses too much earthy energy. He or she may try too hard. When frustrated, Virgo can get trapped in that notorious perfectionism. Because of the desire for security, Virgo may worry constantly about work: \"What if they don't need me anymore?\" \"What if I make a mistake?\" Balance comes with trusting that he or she will be OK and that imperfection is only human! The person born under the sign of Virgo is generally a busy person. He knows how to arrange and organize things. He is a good planner. Above all, he is practical and is not afraid of hard work. The person born under this sign, Virgo, knows how to attain what he desires. He sticks with something until it is finished. He never shirks his duties, and can always be depended upon. The Virgo person can be thoroughly trusted at all times. The man or woman born under this sign tries to do everything to perfection. He doesn’t believe in doing anything half-way. He always aims for the top. He is the sort of a person who is constantly striving to better himself-not because he wants more money or glory, but because it gives him a feeling of accomplishment. The Virgo man or woman is a very observant per son. He is sensitive to how others feel, and can see things below the surface of a situation. He usually puts this talent to constructive use. It is not difficult for the Virgoan to be open and earnest. He believes in pitting his cards on the table. He is never secretive or under-handed. He’s as good as his word. The Virgo person is generally plain-spoken and down-to-earth. He has no trouble in expressing himself. The Virgo person likes to keep up to date on new developments in his particular field. Well- informed, generally, he sometimes has a keen interest in the arts of literature. What he knows, he knows well. His ability to use his critical faculties is well-developed and sometimes startles others because of its accuracy. The Virgoan adheres to a moderate way of life; he avoids excesses. He is a responsible person and enjoys being of service. The Negative Side of Virgo: Sometimes a Virgo person is too critical. He thinks that only he can do something the way it should be done. Whatever anyone else does is inferior. He can be rather annoying in the way he quibbles over insignificant details. In telling others how things should be done,, he can be rather tactless and mean.

Where Virgo will be logical and analytical, Aries will become impatient. There are many relationships between these two that do work out ve ry well, it is a constant challenge. Virgos want a well ordered existence and won't be happy under Arien dictatorship. The prissy Virgo will not condone a bossy Aries. If the Arien allows Virgo space, and acknowledges and uses the virtues of Virgo, (ie. intellect, precision and logic) the two can make for a dynamic relationship. The very things that make this team bad, could make it good! Also, if the Virgoean allows Aries the leadership that they are so capable of, you may end up in a relationship where one is \"the brains\" as the other is \"the brawn\". Unfortunately this works out great for friendships, it is difficult with intimate relationships. But it CAN work. with Taurus Taurus should avoid the attrwedeness of the Virgoan if a love at first sight is to be avoided. Taurus will not get his way here. The Taurean does not like to be critiqued , the sharpest weapon of the Virgo. If you don't like allot of nagging , don't take a Virgo mate. with Gemini For constant bliss this in not a good combination. With Mercury ruling both signs, this may prove to much over the long pull. In Gemini , Mercury is calculatin g and logical; in Virgo it is critical and demanding. Gemini's ever-present desire for change would be much for the realistic Virgo. One point for the two to be compatible would be the desire for good clothes, cleanliness, mutual desire for friends and associates who are engaged in intellectual and artistic purs uits. Through these channels many Gemini-Virgo combinations are formed. You wouldn't expect anything in common here but both signs are ruled by mercury, so there is an equal nature in mental stimulation, social drive and business. If virgo can put up with the seemingly hair-brained schemes of gemini, and if gemini can deal with virgo's critical eye, well, this could work. with Cancer Virgo's demands may be a bit much for Cancer's desire for peace and quiet. The full, affectionate libido of cancer will not be completely satisfied by virgo's dire ct approach to the practical matters at hand. Cancer is sentimental , reticent, and even shy about sex matters, and this can be very frustrating to the virgo temperament. Once cancer goes into his shell, all the tongue lashing and nagging of virgo will not bring him out. This could drive the virgo mate into a state of hysteria. However, there are good possiblitiies, with a few common aspe cts thrown in. Canc er will appreciate virgo's care and attention to detail, although they ma y not appreciate the critical eye of virgo, especially when that criticism is aimed at canc er who takes things to heart as a rule. Virgo will appreciate the loyalty and sincerity of cancer, but will need to be a little more demonstrative and affectionate with cancer. Love Compatibility with Aries with Leo Here is a good chance for a happy partnership. Magnanimous Leo will overlook Virgo's tendency to be critical, while virgo will take pride in Leo's ac complishments, good humor, and lovable nature. Leo will respect virgo's clever and alert mentality. If virgo will permit Leo to hog the limelight and refrain from being too critical of Leo's star predicted desire to hold the c entral place in the family circle, they should have no real barriers to a happy and successful partnership. This may be hard. This is one of those relationships that depends on the type of relationship it is. If it's love the dominant leo will overwhelm virgo, whose criticism will erk leo.

They are never deaf to an appeal from family or friends and they will often side with total strangers if they seem to represent a deserving cause. The Libra person tends to champion the underdog, even against their sounder judgement. Again this seems due to their urge to equalize matters and produce harmony. Intuition is a guiding force with Libra and often enables them to ferret out deceit and insincerity, no matter how much it is glossed over. Though imitative in conduct, they are original in ideas and often quite farsighted because of their intuitive qualities.

While the first six Signs of the Zodiac focus on the individual, the last six focus on the individual's contact with others and with the world. Librans are first and foremost focused on others and how they relate to them. We can call this the Sign of partnership with a capital 'P' because these folks do not want to be alone! For a Libran, everything is better if it's done as a pair. Librans are good when paired up, too, since they epitomize balance, harmony and a sense of fair play. While they are true team players at work, their favorite partnership is at home: marriage. Librans feel most complete when they are coupled up with their lover, forever. It's the Scales which symbolize Libra, and just like that balancing mechanism wants to stay even, Librans want to be on an even keel. Think of the Scales of Justice and how they work at striking the right balance. Likewise, Librans are objective, just and want to do what's best for everyone. It's possible, though, that this penchant for fairness is for a different reason: Librans abhor conflict. The Scales study every possible angle in t he hopes of achieving peace and harmony, so much so that others may see them as fickle and indecisive. If that's what it takes to avoid a confrontation, that's fine with the Scales. The Libra-born are keen strategists, organizing groups with poise and getting the job done (in keeping with the Cardinal Quality assigned to this Sign). Further, you can expect the Scales to be compani onable, sociable folks. Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus. In ancient Roman mythology, V enus was a smooth seductress who was at her best amid pleasurable excess. Well, Librans are certainly carrying the torch for her today. The Scales are cultured, refined and love beautiful things. Most of all, they love beautiful people, which is why Librans do so well at cocktail parties or at the theater, opera or ballet. Those born under this Sign always have the right thing to say and know how to make others feel comfortable. Suave? You bet. Librans are so adept at charming conversation that they need to be mindful of overstepping their boundaries and appearing vain or gossipy (the Scales do love intrigue). When these folks are on their game, how ever, they are a pleasure to be with. Librans are artistic, stylish and enjoy creating a beautifu l world. The converse of this is that bored Librans can become apathetic and lazy -- but they'll smile anyway. The Element associated with Libra is Air, and that means reaching higher, specifically to the higher mind. Librans like to put their mind to good use, and enjoy communicating their thoughts to others. They like to use their smarts (and talk) to get to know others better -- yes, knowledge about people is where it's at for Librans. You can expect the Scales to make a fair argument, too, since they live by the principles of diplomacy and compromise. When this approach doesn't work, however, Librans are not above using their persuasive charms to get their way. Manipulative? Nah, Librans really are too nice for that. Plus, any end-runs that these folks use are usually to build themselves up, since the Scales can be easily deterred. Librans are polite and don't like to fight, far preferring to talk things through. Remember, these folks know how to communicate (they're Air) so they're bound to make their point. Librans don't get in a huff when faced with an opposing viewpoint. Rather, they take a deep breath and consider all the options in the spirit of cooperation. Librans at play may not be as energized as at work, if you call socializing work (and the Scales do). That's why exercise for Librans needs to have a social component to it, such as that found at a gym. Alternatively, Librans love the outdoors, so riding and biking can also prove fun. They also love the colors of the sunset sky, that melding of ivory, pink and light blue. In the game of love, Librans are a bundle of energy, romantic and loyal to the core. The Scales need to be on the lookout for their lower backs, though, which tend to shoulder any burdens they may be carrying. The great strength of the Libra-born is their quest for fairness, peace and harmony. That the Scales are the great diplomats of the Zodiac further helps their case. A beautiful journey this will be, thanks to the Libran's inimitable sense of style.

Even with this need for calm, Libra remains a very active, outwardly radiating personality. Libra is the cheerleader we all need to work together and build a team! With all of these positives here, how can the sign of The Scales be unbalanced? Sometimes loving Libra can need others too much and fall into the trap of dependency. The need for partnership leads this sign to falsely believe that there is no personhood with a partner. The temptation is to give away too much to others and reserve too little for oneself. Then life reels out of control. Trying to be too fair undermines decision-making abilities. Libra may fear making the wrong choice or upsetting others. Inward-focused energy restores balance. Libras thrive when they give themselves permissi on to take care of themselves. Personalities The Positive Side of Libra: Librans love harmony. It is one of their most outstanding character traits. They are interesting in achieving balance; they admire beauty ad grace in things as well as in people. Generally speaking, they are kind and considerate people. Librans are usually very sympathetic. They go out of their way not to hurt another person’s feelings. They are outgoing and do what they can to help those in need. People born under the sign of Libra almost always make good friends.

In most of their social dealings, they try to be tactful and kind. They dislike discord and bickering, and most Libras strive for peace and harmony in all their relationships. The Libra man or woman has a keen sense of beauty. They appreciate handsome furnishings and clothes. Many of them are ar tistically inclined. Their taste is usually impeccable. They know how to use color. Their homes are almost always attractively arranged and inviting. They enjoy entertaining people and see to it that their guests always feel at home and welcome. The Libran gets along with almost everyone. He is well-liked and socially much in demand. The Negative Side of Libra: Some people born under this sign tend to be rather insincere. So eager are they to achieve harmony in all relationships that they will even go as far as to lie. Many of them are escapists. They find facing the truth an ordeal and prefer living in a world of make-believe. In a serious argument, some Librans give in rather easily even when they know they are right. Arguing, even about something they believe in, is too unsettling for some of them. Librans sometimes care too much for material things. They enjoy possessions and luxuries.

There's no fluff or chatter for Scorpios, either: these folks will zero in on the essential questions, gleaning the secrets that lie within. Scorpios concern themselves with beginnings and endings, and are unafraid of either; they also travel in a world which is black and white and has little use for gray. The curiosity of Scorpios is immeasurable, which may be why they are such adept investigators. These folks love to probe and know how to get to the bottom of things. The fact that they have a keen sense of intuition certainly helps. It's the Scorpion which symbolizes Scorpios, and it's no accident.

It is life on the Scorpion's terms, too, since these folks promote their agenda (they are quite the executives) and see to it that things go forward. Others may find this overbearing (it can be) and even self-destructive, but that's the beauty of the Scorpion: these folks have tremendous regenerative powers, much like the literal Scorpion can lose its tail and promptly grow a new one. Fearless Scorpions rarely lose, per se, they just keep on going, since they are stubborn and determined to succeed (this Scorpio trait is in keeping with the Fixed Quality assigned to this Sign).

Mars was the God of War in ancient Roman mythology and is the first (and most ancient) ruler of Scorpio. When Pluto was discovered in the 20th century, it was also assigned to this Sign.

This planetary combo makes for people who are motivated, penetrating and aware. Scorpions don't miss much, since they are highly attuned to the vibrations of others. They are intuitive, probing and very focused on knowing who's who and what's what. Scorpions can lose their temper (and even become vengeful) when someone gets in their way, so it's best to give them plenty of room.

As opposed to the 'roiling seas' seen in other Water Signs, a better motto for Scorpions would be 'still waters run deep.' Those born under this Sign are as emotional as their waterborne brethren, it's just that they're not as likely to show it. The Scorpio's emotions are repressed, kept under cover. Again, secrets to be used another day. That said, be aware that these folks are clever, perceptive and always in the mix. Their ability to see into things can sometimes be a curse for Scorpions, however, since they can take an insignificant matter and turn it into a huge slight. Beware the Scorpion who feels crossed! These folks can turn vindictive in no time flat. Luckily, once Scorpions catch their breath, they will return to their usual determined and loyal (albeit strong-willed) ways. Finally, while Scorpions aren't above some subtle manipulation to get what they want, they'd much rather take a scientific, even mystical path. The Scorpio-born are powerful and passionate, qualities which serve them well, as long as they don't let them deteriorate into self-indulgence or compulsion. Scorpios love competition in both work and play, which is why they'll air it out in sports and games. Extreme sports are right up the Scorpion's alley, as is most anything which will test their mettle. They've got to have an adversary, since it makes the game that much more fun. The Scorpion's colors? Powerful red and serious black. When it comes to love, though, Scorpions soften up a bit and are caring and devoted with their lovers, even if they do hold on a bit tight. Scorpions are also lusty in the extreme (how else?), so they need to be mindful of their reproductive organs. The great strength of the Scorpio-born is in their determination, passion and motivation. Scorpions don't know the word quit, which is why they usually get the job done. A powerhouse? Like no other.

Water is more receptive and introverted, but Scorpio is a Pluto nian-power force. Perhaps that is why Scorpio is the sign capable of the greatest metamorphosis and renewal. If we think about it, we may look at a lake and see the interplay of light and shadows. Unless we explore further, we cannot tell just how deep it is -- or what is going on within. You'll find great love, feeling, desire and sensitivity when we probe the depths of mysterious Scorpio. A fixed nature makes Scorpio favor stability. Without some positive energy, Scorpio can go to extremes. The Scorpion may use his or her the strength to exert power over ot hers. Love can become a stronger passion than even the Scorpio can handle, and possessiveness or jealousy can surface. Independence brings balance. The Scorpio with inner security can let partners explore and remain receptive to their needs Personalities The Positive Side of Scorpio: The Scorpio man or woman generally knows what he or she wants out of life. He is a determined person. He sees something through to the end. The Scorpion is quite sincere, and seldom says anything he doesn’t mean. When he sets a goal for himself he tries to go about achieving it in a very direct way. The Scorpion is bracer and courageous. They are not afraid of hard work. Obstacles do not frighten them. They forge ahead until they acheive what they set out for. The Scorpio man or woman has a strong will. Although the Scorpion may seem rather fixed and determined, inside he is often quite tender and loving. He can care very much for others. He believes in sincerity in all relationships. His feelings about someone tend to last; they are profound and not superficial. The Scorpio person is someone who adheres to his principles no matter what happens. He will not be deterred from a path he believes to be right. Because of his many positive strengths, t he Scorpion can often achieve happiness for himself and for those that he loves. He is a constructive person by nature. He often has a deep understanding of people and of life, in general. He is perceptive and unafraid. Obstacles often seem to spur him on. He is a positive person who enjoys winning. He has many strengths and resources; challenge of any sort often brings out the best in him. The Negative Side of Scorpio: The Scorpio person is sometimes hypersensitiv e. Often he imagines injury when there is none. He feels that others do not bother to recognize him for his true worth. Sometimes he is given to excessive boasting in order to compensate for what he feels is neglect. The Scorpio person ca be rather proud and arrogant. They can be rather sly when they put their minds to it and they enjoy outwitting person or institutions noted for their cleverness. Their tactics for getting what they want are sometimes devious and ruthless. They don’t care too much about what others may think. If they feel others have done them an injustice, they will do their best to seek revenge. The Scorpion often has a sudden, violent temper; and this person’s interest in sex is sometimes quite unbalanced or excessive.

Like the bowmen, they aim for their target and are apt to score a hit. Add to that a cheerful, happy disposition, stemming from the governing planet, Jupiter, and Sagittarius has the makings of an excellent sign. However, there are pitfalls. Their natural energy which gains such good results can be wasted through over zeal or the feverish excitement that too often accompanies their work. Sagittarians wear themselves out in their anxiety to get things done therefore they should seek projects worthy of their efforts, offering rewarding prospects. Being workers, not seekers, these people can accomplish twice as much as others and will apply themselves to charitable or helpful causes with the same energy that they devote to their own aims. Zircon Royal Purple Lapis Lazuli Tin Jupiter Climbing Flowers"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Sagittarius, the ninth Sign of the Zodiac, is the home of the wanderers of the Zodiac. It's not a mindless ramble for these folks, either. Sagittarians are truth-seekers, and the best way for them to do this is to hit the road, talk to others and get some answers. Knowledge is key to these folks, since it fuels their broad-minded approach to life. The Sagittarian-born are keenly interested in philosophy and religion, and they find that these disciplines aid their internal quest. At the end of the day, what Sagittarians want most is to know the meaning of life, and if they accomplish this while feeling free and easy, all the better. It's the Archer which represents Sagittarians, although in this case it's a Centaur (half man, half beast) which is flinging the arrows. Centaurs were the intellectuals of ancient Roman mythology, and Sagittarians are quick to consider themselves their modern-day counterparts. Those born under this Sign are clear thinkers and choose to look at the big picture most of the time. They also like it when others agree with their well-thought-out point of view. The alternative to this, for better or for worse, is a Sag who can become argumentative and blunt. That's not to say that these folks are intransigent -- Archers will listen to what others have to say, in keeping with the Mutable Quality assigned to this Sign. Indeed, Sagittarians are enthusiastic consumers of information (and enthusiastic in general), the better to get the answers they need. It's also a good idea to give Sags lots of room to explore their world. Once these folks start to feel hemmed in, they'll become impatient and difficult. Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter. In ancient Roman times, Jupiter was the King of the Gods, and most Sagittarians would say that the royal pedigree has been passed on to them. The Sag-born are generous and just, much like a noble leader. These folks are also expansive in their thoughts, as well as in their approach. Sags are forever reaching -- for knowledge, understanding and answers. They are outspoken in their beliefs, at times to the point of exaggeration. This may be due to their unflinching optimism. Sags are also a lucky bunch, thanks to Jupiter's golden glow. They're quick to take a gamble on things, feeling both lucky and smart. While the process of exploration is what fuels Sagittarians (and translating that to others as a teacher and philosopher), they need to be aware of their tendency to procrastinate. Those born under this Sign can be quite self-indulgent since things come so easily to them (thanks to their charming and sociable natures). Smart Archers, however, will catch themselves in time, the better to continue their good work. The Element associated with Sagittarius is Fire. Just as a fire can move quickly and uncontrollably, so can Sagittarians as they flit from one thing to the next, never looking back. For the Sag-born, it's all about action and advent ure (and, hopefully, conclusions). These folks love their physicality and are often athletic, and certainly full of stamina. Life for these folks is played full-on, which is why it's chock-full of experiences. Archers are outgoing, enthusiastic and tend to overstep their bounds as a result, falling pr ey to the likes of foot-in-mouth disease. They can talk so fast (and so much) that they don't process the full weight of what they're saying, leading to the occasional hurt feeling. Often, however, their words serve to inspire others and to get things going. Yes, Sagittarians are straight-ahead folks who are curious, spiritual and true believers. The fact that they attract others with ease should be no surprise, since they have a great sense of fun and enjoy a good time. They don't lack for confidence, either, not a whit! High-spirited Sags love to socialize -- with an ever-changing crew. The athleticism of Sags lends itself to challenging sports, and they definitely know they're up to the task. That's why you're likely to find them in an around-the-world solo boat race or climbing up the highest peaks (where they should be mindful of their legs and hips). No stretch is too big for a Sag, if only because these folks know they're ready (and lucky to boot). Mental games such as chess or debate also fuel the Sag's mood. Moody colors they'll w ear, since they favor rich maroon and navy hues. When it comes to love games, the Archer is playful, flirtatious and always on top. The great strength of the Sagittarius-born is their philosophical, wide-open and curious nature. These folks seek both knowledge and truth, and they are eager to share their explorations with others. Their optimistic and generous spirit makes them a pleasure to have around.

Mutable motivation brings compelling powers of attraction. Change and variety are important. Sag won't hesitate to initiate either. Without balance energy, Sagittarius can become too changeable; he or she may bend to every force or influence. Restlessness can diffuse energy, and finding a secure position in life isn't as easy as we would think. Quiet contemplation can temper the fire' and heighten the intuition. Receptivity can slow the impatient desire to move way too fast at times. What a wonderful balanced energy this is!

He is seldom critical, and is almost always generous. The Negative Side of Sagittarius: Some Sagittarians are restless. They take foolish risks and seldom learn from the mistakes they make. They don’t have heads for money and are often mismanaging their finances. Some of them devote much of their time to gambling. Some are too outspoken and tactless, always putting their feet in their mouths. They hurt others carelessly by being honest at the wrong time. Sometimes they make promises which they don’t keep. They don’t stick close enough to their plans and go from one failure to another. They are undisciplined and waste a lot of energy.

The Capricorn-born are extremely dedicated to their goals, almost to the point of stubbornness. Boy, those victories sure smell sweet, though, and that thought alone will keep Capricorns going. It's the Goat which symbolizes Capricorns, and an apt mascot it is. G oats love to climb to the top of the mountain, where the air is clear and fresh. In much the same way, Capricorns want to get to the top of their chosen field so that they can reap the benefits of success; namely fame, prestige and money. Getting to the top isn't always a walk in t he park, however, so it's likely that Goats will ruffle a few feathers along the way. These folks can indeed be domineering, even egotistical, on their route to the top. They'll tell you it's part of being a leader with bright new ideas (in keeping with the Cardinal Quality assigned to this Sign). Capricorns are industrious, efficient, organized and won't make a lot of waves. They are scrupulous with details and adopt a rather conventional posture in business and in life. These folks feel best playing it safe, since this is a fail-safe way to get to the top -- eventually. Thankfully, Capricorns are patient, too, and are happy to wait for their ship to come in. The flip side to this staid behavior is that Goats can become quite unforgiving of those who aren't as diligent or ambitious as they are. Capricorns need to remember that they do need allies along the way, ambitious or otherwise. In any case, once Capricorns receive the recognition and social status they so fervently crave, it's likely that all will be forgiven. Capricorn is ruled by the Planet Saturn. In ancient Roman mythology, Saturn was the father of many of the gods. Consider him top dog, if you will, and then you'll see a parallel to Capricorns. Those born under this Sign also want to be the top dog, and they're smart enough to know that the title won't simply be handed to them. Caps are happy to work for it, and luckily they possess enough discipline and sense of responsibility to get them there. Capricorns tend to be mature and are amply blessed with common sense, two more qualities which help their success-driven endeavors. With any kind of luck (make that considerable work ), Caps will find themselves on that top step, but they should also remember those who have helped them on their quest. They are traditional (but not quite the button-down stiffs some would suggest) and somewhat inhibited, prompting others to wonder if they can ever enjoy success and its rarefied air. Rest assured, these folks will be smiling inside. The Element associated wi th Capricorn is Earth. There's no surprise there! Caps aren't interested in wild ideas or round-the-world dreams. They would much rather stay put and get to work. Remember, these are the businesspeople of the Zodiac, so in their sensible and economical way, they'll get up every morning and see to it that their job is well done. While Caps can occasionally get a bit materialistic and greedy (hey, everyone needs a few perks), they are far too dignified and practical to get carried away. Plus, they love tradition and reserve and want to appear polite and friendly. Capricorns at rest (yes, there is such a thing) enjoy leisurely sports such as golf and croquet -- so long as they have a chance to win! Playing with a crew is also nice, since it brings to mind their beloved workplace. Team colors for a Capricorn are likely to be earthy brown and khaki, much like the relaxed slacks they like to wear. Sports-bound Caps also need to watch their teeth and knees, and they shouldn't be too daring, lest they break some bones. When it comes to love, Capricorns are ever devoted and never emotive.

Members of this sign find a great deal more confidence what they do than in who they are. Earth hangs tough when it comes to stabilization, so achievement provides that stability and structure. Capricorn is one very high-achiever! Without balance, however, Capricorn can become too rigid -- as in the tall palm tree, falling to the ground, under heavy wind-gusts. To be able to move with the winds of change, the Mountain Goat must bend and flex a little bit! That makes life much easier. Capricorn can also focus too much on achievement. Then they forget the little joys in life. When the Goat finally relaxes and enjoys life, his or her most deligh tful secrets emerge. No one has a better sense of humor than the Capricorn.

He does not take his duties lightly. He is a practical person and believes in keeping his feet on the ground. Quite often the person born under this sign is ambitious and knows how to get what he wants out of life. He forges ahead and never gives up his goal.

He is not a spendthrift and knows how to put something away for a rainy day; he dislikes waste and unnecessary loss. The Capricornian knows how to make use of his self-control. He can apply himself to almost anything once he puts his mind to it. His ability to concentrate sometimes astounds others. He is diligent and does well when involved in detail work. The Capricorn man or woman is charitable, gener ally speaking, and will do what is possible to help others less fortunate. As friend, he is loyal and trustworthy. He never shirks his duties or responsibilities. He is self-reliant and never expects too much of the other fellow. He does what he can on his own. If someone does him a good turn, then he will do his best to return the favor. The Negative Side of Capricorn: Like everyone, the Capricornian, too, has his faults. At times, he can be over-critical of others. He expects others to live up to his own high standards. He thinks highly of himself and tends to look down on others. His interest in material things may be exaggerated. The Capricorn man or woman thinks too much about getting on in the world and having something to show for it. He may even be a little greedy.

Those born under this Sign have the social conscience needed to carry us into the new millennium. These folks are humanitarian, philanthropic and keenly interested in making the world a better place. Along those lines, they'd like to make the world work better, which is why they focus much of their energy on our social institutions and how they work (or don't work). Aquarians are visionaries, progressive souls who love to spend time thinking about how things can be better. They are also quick to engage others in this process, which is why they have so many friends and acquaintances. Making the world a better place is a collaborative effort for Aquarians. The Sign of Aquarius is symbolized by the Water Bearer. In much the same way that the Water Bearer brings that precious liquid as a gift, Aquarians shower the world with their thoughts and new ideas. Luckily for Aquarians (and the rest of us), they are at a near- genius level, so their minds churn out some amazing things. Their thought process is also inventive and original. While Aquarians are happy to bestow these ideas as a gift with no strings attached, they are much happier when the rest of the world agrees with them. Naysayers will quickly find out that Aquarians can be impatient, even temperamental, with those who disagree. Yes, these folks can be quite fixed in their opinions, in keeping with the Fixed Quality assigned to this Sign. Even though Aquarians are happy to give, and they do, it's often on their terms and within their comfort level. Generally, that means ample space, since these folks are freedom-loving and individualistic and need to roam (and yes, they do enjoy travel). While Aquarians are generally sympathetic and compassionate, they like it w hen things go their own quirky way. Some might call their behavior eccentric (and they would be right), but when you consider that the Aquarian's heart is truly in the right place, a few oddities should be overlooked. In their own way, Aquarians treasure their many friends and acquaintances and want to give back as much as they can. Aquarius is ruled by the Planets Saturn and Uranus. Powerful Saturn was considered the father of many gods in ancient Roman times, and was the original ruler of Aquarius. Uranus is the oldest of the gods in Roman mythology; this Planet was discovered much later than Saturn and was only more recently assigned to this Sign. The combination of these planetary energies is strong and vibrant. Saturn's force field is that of the stern taskmaster, which is one reason why Aquarians love to think and put their ideas out to the world. They also love to think they're right! It's Uranus which instills Aquarians with their visionary spirit. If it's new, radical and rebellious, Aquarians are all over it. The fact that these folks can think so creatively and inventively is one of their greatest assets. Water Bearers are all about progress and technology -- they love the latest gadgets, gewgaws, computers and next-generation technologies. Thanks to a genius which borders on insanity (!), those born under this Sign have the unique ability to present ideas which will revolutionize the world. Their approach in doing so may be unpredictable, impersonal and at times cold, but that's a mad scientist for you! The Element associated with Aquarius is Air, and that means the rarefied air of the intellectual. Aquarians will accomplish much with their broad and logical minds, entertaining complex and scientific ideas for the betterment of all. That said , they are also artistic and inventive. It's all in the spirit of creating a better world, hopefully one in keeping with their broad-minded beliefs. Aquarians believe that their offbeat, original approach will win the day, and that new thought is what is needed to change the world. Those born under this Sign are altruistic, humane people who are determined to make a difference. At play, Aquarians like to surround themselves with lots of people, preferably family and friends. That sa id, if they don't know the 'players,' they soon will! Baseball and tennis are fun for these folks (though they should be wary of weak ankles), although a spirited match of water polo would also be nice. It's watery colors which Aquarians favor, a shiny silver or an aqua blue. When it comes to love, Aquarians will also be playful, even flirtatious. While they play for keeps, it won't nece ssarily feel that way, since these folks are the antithesis of jealous. The great strengths of the Aquarius-born are their vision, intellect and humanity.

He respects other people’s beliefs and feels that everyone is entitles to his own approach to life. He would never do anything to injure another’s feelings. He is never unkind or cruel. Always considerate of others, the Aquarian is always willing to help a person in need. He feels a very strong tie between himself and all the other members of mankind.

The problems of the world concern him greatly. He is interested in helping others no matter what part of the globe they live in. He is truly a humanitarian sort. He likes to be of service to others. Giving, considerate, and without prejudice, Aquarians have no trouble getting along with others. The Negative Side of Aquarius: The Aquarian may be too much of a dreamer. He makes plans but seldom carries them out. He is rather unrealistic. His imagination has a tendency to run away with him. Because many of his plans are impractical, he is always in some sort of a dither. Others may not approve of him at all times because of his unconventional behavior. He may be a bit eccentric. Sometimes he is so busy with his own thoughts, that he loses touch with the realities of existence. Some Aquarians feel they are more clever and intelligent than others. They seldom admit to their own faults, even when they are quite apparent. Some become rather fanatic in their views. Their criticism of others is sometimes destructive and negative.

Pisces people acquire knowledge, then fail to show it, often regarding it of little consequence and believing that other people who brag about their ability must actually know more than they do. Their governing planet, Jupiter, has much to do with this, for it endows these Pisces people with a nature so generous that it becomes overly trusting. Because of their unselfish dispositions, persons of this sign fail to realize their own possibilities. The greater their honesty, the more doubtful they become as to their own ability. This produces fear of the future, which in turn causes them immediate worry. Hence, Pisces people are perhaps the most cautious of all, where their own efforts are concerned. But, thanks to their jovial dispositions, people of this sign ride over deep troubles almost as trifles. Aquamarine Turquoise Amethyst Platinum Neptune Lotus"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Pisces is the twelfth Sign of the Zodiac, and it is also the final Sign in the Zodiacal cycle. Hence, this Sign brings together many of the characteristics of the eleven Signs that have come before it. Pisceans, however, are happiest keeping many of these qualities under wraps. These folks are selfless, spiritual and very focused on their inner journey. They also place great weight on what they are feeling. Yes, feelings define Pisceans, and it's not uncommon for them to feel their own burdens (and joys) as well as those of others. The intuition of the Pisces-born is highly-evolved. Many people associate Pisceans with dreams and secrets, and it's a fair association, since those born under this Sign feel comfortable in an illusory world. It's a pair of Fish that represents Pisceans, a symbol which prompts others to suggest that these people 'go with the flow' and 'don't make waves.' Both of these labels are true, since Pisceans are fluid and easy-going, in keeping with the Mutable Quality assigned to this Sign. The fact that two fish (as opposed to one) represent the members of this Sign also speaks to the duality of Pisceans, their yin and yang sensibility. Pisceans alternate between reality and non-reality in keeping with their introspective natures; their voyage between consciousness and an unconscious dream state says much about their intuitive, almost psychic natures. For this reason, Pisceans can be hard to pin down, prompting some to call them the chameleons of the Zodiac. The Fish are happy to be considered hazy, since there's a certain sense of safety in that self-proclaimed netherworld. That said, they won't stay away for long, since one of their primary goals is to help others. Pisceans are compassionate, charitable and will quickly put the needs of others ahead of their own. It's this kind of self-sacrifice which keeps these folks going. The flip side to their giving natures is that oft-timid Fish are likely to be taken advantage of by less well-meaning souls. Pisces is ruled by the Planets Jupiter and Neptune. In ancient Roman mythology, Jupiter (the original ruler of Pisces) was the king of the gods, while Neptune was the ruler of the seas. When Neptune was discovered in recent times, it was attached to this Sign. The pairing of these two heavenly bodies results in some unique energies being directed toward Pisceans here on Earth. Those born under this Sign are spiritually oriented and charitable. They are compassionate, easily feeling another's pain. At times, however, Pisceans can have difficulty distinguishing fact from fantasy: they tend to get caught up in their dreams and views of how things should be. To say they wear rose-colored glasses isn't much of a stretch. Pisceans who fear that their pleas aren't being heard tend to lapse into melancholy and, worse, the kind of pessimism which leads to procrastination and lethargy. At times like this, Pisceans are well-served to take some time for themselves, the better to find their center once again. Many Pisceans also immerse themselves in the arts and other creative pursu its as a centering mechanism, and they are quite talented in these areas. The Element associated with Pisces is Water. Those born under this Sign easily relate to the emotional and unpredictabl e nature of this liquid gold. Pisceans feel a great deal, and they also feel misunderstood much of the time. They're not quite pushovers, but they're certainly sensitive. Yes, they could cry you a river if the circumstances were right. Even so, they revel in their compassionate and imaginative natures and love to cater to others. They can also be quite romantic, dreaming up delicious treats for their lover. Hopefully, any kindness will be reciprocated, because the Fish can certainly turn blue if they're not. Pisceans are generally gentle, easy-going folk, who are on the shy and reticent side. They are modest to the point of impracticality, often stepping up only to show their talents in painting or music. Easiest for the Fish (and still great fun) is living in their lush dream world. More relaxation for the Fish comes in the way of sports, specifically water sports. Pisceans love to swim, and it's this easy glide in a pool or the sea which serves to alleviate much of their stress. Once their mind is at ease, the Fish are well-advised to focus on their feet, a frequent source of discomfort. Soothing comfort does come in a world colored in purple and soft white. When it comes to the game of love, Pisceans are caring and romantic and a most creative mate. The great strength of the Pisces-born is their compassionate and charitable nature. These folks love to help others and do so in the most imaginative of ways. It's their feeling sensibility that wins people over.

This sign is extremely receptive, nurturing, compassionate, and other-directed. As with Scorpio, we have to explore and probe to find out the depths of this water. Pisces feelings run very, very deep. A mutable nature endows Pisces with adaptable and unifying energy. These sens itive people are like the water that flows gently downstream, around the rocks and obstacles in its path. Pisces receptivity can translate into psychic energy. Pisces knows all and sees all but probably won't tell' all. The Fishes keep the secrets of the universe within and to themselves. Without balance, Pisces can sink into the whirlpool of emotion. This can bring out hidden fears and insecurities. Lack of ego-strength can make Pisces feel dependent and helpless. Then they can fall into the martyr trap. Pisces benefit by truthfully sharing their own difficulties, feelings, and need. They need to remember that they too have the right to receive all the help and support they are so used to giving! A happy, confident Pisces brightens the world and all our lives. Personalities The Positive Side of Pisces: The Piscean can often understand the problems of others quite easily.
