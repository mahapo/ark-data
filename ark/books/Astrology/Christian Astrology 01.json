In the first place, consider and admire thy Creator, and be thankful unto him, be thou humble, and let no natural knowledge, how profound and transcendent soever it be, elate thy minde to neglect that divine Providence, by whose all-seeing order and appointment, all thing s heavenly and earthly, have their constant motion, but the more thy knowledge is enlarg ed, the more do thou magnifie the power and wisdom of Almighty God, and strive to preseve t hy self in his favour; being confident, the more holy thou art; and more neer to God, the purer Judgm ent thou shalt give. Beware of pride and self-conceit, and remember how that long a go, no irrational Creature obey him, so long as he was Master of his own Reason and Pa ssions, or until he subjected his Will to the unreasonable part. But alas! when iniquity abounded, and man gave the reins to his own affection, and deserted reason, then every Beast, Creature and outward harmful thing, became rebellious and unserviceable to his command. Stand fast, oh man! to thy God, and assured Principles, then consider thy own nobleness, how all cre ated things, both present and to come, were for thy sake created; nay, for thy sake G od became Man: thou art that Creature, who being conversant with Christ, liveth and reignest a bove the heavens, and sits above all power and authority. How many Pre-eminences, Privile dges, Advantages hath God bestowed on thee? thou rangest above the heavens by Contemplation, conceive st the motion and magnitude of the stars; thou talkest with Angels, yea wit h God himself; thou has all Creatures within thy Dominion, and keepest the Devils in subjecti on: Do not then, for shame, deface thy Nature, or make thy self unworthy of such Gifts, or deprive thy self of that great Power, Glory and Blessedness God hath alotted thee, by casting from thee his fear, for possession of a few imperfect pleasures. Having considered thy God, a nd what thy self art, during they being Gods servant; now receive instruction how in thy practi ce I would have thee carry thy self. As thou daily conversest with the heavens, so instr uct and form thy minde according to the image of Divinity; learn all the ornaments of Ve rtue, be sufficiently instructed therein; be humane, curteous, familiar to all, easie of access, af flict not the Miserable with terror of a harsh Judgment; in such cases, let them know their hard f ate by degrees; direct them to call on God to divert his Judgments impending over them; be modest, conver sant with the Learned, Civil, Sober man, covet not an cilate; give freely to the poor , both money and judgment: let no worldly wealth procure an Erroneous Judgment from thee , or such as may dishonour the Art, or this divine Science: Love good men, cherish those honest men that cordially Study this Art: Be sparing in delivering Judgment agai nst the Common-wealth thou livest in. Give not judgment of the death of thy Prince; yet I know e xperimentally, that Reges Subjucent Legibus Stellarum marry a wife of thy own; rejoyce in the number of they friends, avoid law and controversie: in they Study, be Totus in Illis that thou ma ist be Singulus in Art; be not extravagant or desrious to learn every Science, be not Aliquid i n Omnibus; be faithful, tenacious, betray on ones secrets, no no I charge thee never divulge eit her friend or enemies"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ trust committed to thy faith.

Or in page therof 108, as in the Epistle of Aglicus 1645, where you shall finde these words: I have run over more days then si xteen thousand five hundred fifty and nine, before I am sixteen thousand four hundred twenty two days old, I shall be in great hazard of my life, but that year which afflic ts me will stagger a Monarch and Kingdom, &c.. What concerns my self, hath almost in full measure proved true, in 1647. Having in this untoward year been molested with palpitation of the Hea rt, with Hypoconary melancholy, a disaffected Spleen, the Scurvy, etc. and now at this pre sent viz. August 1647, when I had almost concluded this Treatise, I am shut up of the Plague, having the 4 th of August buried one Servant thereof, and on the 28. Of the same moneth another, my sel f and remainder of my Family enforces to leave my present seat, and betake myse lf to change of ayre; so that if either my present Epistles, or the latter part of the Book it fe lt be anything defective, as well they may, being written when my family and self were in such abunde nt sorrow and perplexity; I desire the Reader to be civill, as to pass over thos e slight imperfections (if any be) with a candid censure. I thank Almighty God, who hath prolonged my life this present, and hath, be en so gracious unto me as to spare me a long whereby have been enabled now at length to perfect my introduction so oft by me promised, so earnestly desired by many we ll-wishers unto this learning."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ The latter part of my predictions concerning Monarchy,is now upon the sta ge and the eyes of millions attending what shall become of it: let me lea ve the event hereof unto God, who is hastening to require a strict account of some people entrusted in the Kingdomes affairs; fiat Justicia; vivat Rex; floreat Parlimentum. The Citizens of London make small reckoning of Astrology; there are in one of those Epistles of mine, words significant, and of which time will make t hem sensible (that they were not wrote in vain but now too late, actum est. To the work in hand,viz.. the book e nsuing, which is divided into three Treatises, the first whereof doth with m uch facility, and after a new method, instruct the Student how to begin his work, viz., viz, it teacheth him the use of an Ephemeris, of the Table of Houses, &c. it aquaints him how to erect a figure of heaven, how therein to place the Planets, how to rectifie their motions to the hour of his Figure; it unfolds the nature of the Houses, of the Planets, of the Signs of the Zodiack, t heir division, and subdivision, their severall properties, terms of Art, and whatever els e is fit for Learner to know before he enter upon judgment; unto whom and everyone that will be studious thi s way, I give these cautions. First, that he be very exact in knowing the use of his Ephemeris, and in setting a Scheam of Heaven for all the house of the day or night, and in reducing the motions of the Planets to the hour thereof when need requireth, and to know their characters distinctly and readily. Secondly, I would have the Student very perfect in knowing the nature of the Houses, that he may the better discover from what house to require judgment upon the quest ion propounded, left for want of true understanding he mistake one thing for another. Thirdly, I would have him ready in, and well to understand the Debilities and Fortitudes of every Planet, both Essentiall and Accidentall. Fourthly, he must be well versed in discovering the Nature of the Sig nificator, what he signifies naturally, what accidentally, and how to vary signification, as necess ity shall require. Fifthly, let him well understand the nature of the Signs, their proper ties and qualities, and what form, shape and conclusions they give of themselves naturally, and w hat by the personall existence of a Planet in any of them."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ Sixthly, that he be ready in the, shape and description which every Pla net designes, and how to vary their shape as they are posited in Sign and house, or aspect ed of the MOON or any other Planet. Seventhly, he must of t read the termes of Art, and have them fresh in his memory, and especially the twentieth and one and twentieth Chapters of the first Book. If God Almighty shall preserve my life, I may therefore adde m any things, and much light unto this Art, and therefore I desire the Students herein, that If they meet with any extraordinary casualty in their practice, they would communicate it unto me. I have with all uprightness and sincerity of heart, plainly and honestl y delivered the Art, and have omitted nothing willingly, which I esteemed convenient or f it, or what might any thing assist the young Students herein; I have refused the Methods of a ll former Authors, and framed this DE NOVO, which I have ever found so easie and successful , that as yet I never undertook the instruction of any, whom I have not abundantly satisfied, and made very capable of the Art, in less time than any could expect; for although I am not yet six and forty years of age compleat, and have studied this Science but since 1632. and have lived si x years since that in the Country, yet I know I have made more Schollers in this Profess ion, than all that professe this Art in England. It remalnes, that I give every Author his due, a nd deale plainly, unto which of them I am engaged for such matter as they have assiste d me with in the Introductory part: verily the Method is my own, itâs no translation; yet I have conferred my own notes with Darion, Bonatus, Ptolomey, Haly, Etzler, Dietericus, Naibod, Hasfurtus, Zael, Tanstettor, Agrippa, Ferriers, Duret, Maginius, Origanus, Argol. The second part of this Treatise judging of horary Questions, is very large, and far beyond my first intentions, hath exceeded its just proportion: In building t his Work I advised with Bonatus, Haly, Dariot, Leupoldus, Pontarius, Avenezra, Zael: I examined the Manuscripts of Ancient and Reverend Professors in this Art, who lived more remote from these corrupt Times, (for unto the vulgar Prof essors now residing in this City, am I noways engaged;) and though it was not small trouble unto me, to see the discrepency of judgment amongst "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ them and the more ancient printed Authors, yet I have with some trouble reconciled their disagreements, and reformed and corrected what might have led the Re ader into an errour: for indeed the Writings of our Foreâfathers in the Language they did delive r their minds in, was sound and solid, but the simplicity of such as undertook their translations w as much and did beget mistakes, whilest they endeavouring to translate the Authors i nto Latin, or any other Language they thought fit; did not understand the Art or the Termes the reof; so that of those their Labours; they rendered an ill accompt unto Posterity, as any m ay see in the translation of that we call the âJudiciumâ in Novem Judiclis.,&c. and In other pieces of Alkindus, one whereof lately a learned Gentleman gave me, guilty of the same deficiency In t he translation. In this second Book I have omitted nothing which I could devise to be helpful, a nd if my own may of judicature please any, it being somewhat different from tha t of the Ancients, he may in many Chapters make use of it. I have illustrated every house with one or more figures, and therein shewed the method of judgment, which I held very convenient for Lea rners, it being my whole intention to advance this Art, and make even a slender wit capable hereof. You may in the third Book behold the entire Art of Nativities, I have m ade it plain and significant: part of the Method, and much of the matter I had from Le ovitius, who was the first that methodized the Art of Nativities, before his time extremea ly defective in that point; where he was not copious, I supplyed my self, or enlarged from Origanus; Junct ine, Pezelius, Naibod, Cardan, Garceus, Schonerus, Albubatur, Montulmo, Judeus, Ptolomey, Lindhold: Perhaps some will accuse me for dissenting from Ptolomey; I confesse I have done so, and that I am not the first, or shall I have done so, be the last; for I an more le d by reason and experience, then by the single authority of any one man, &c. I have inserted many j udgments of my own, I could have added many more: but who am I? being all errour, that I could ha ve contradict the sayings of so many wise men, whose learnings and pains I so much esteem and reverence."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ Little did I think this Work of Nativities would have swollen to so g reat a bulk; I assure you it exceeds my first intentions: the pains however hath be en mine, and notwithstanding the importunities of some, and they not a few, who desired I should not deli ver the Art in so plain and easie a method; yet I professe, their words rather invited me to discover all I knew, then to conceale one sillable material. Had I respected my own private lucre, I need not have wrote at all ; who could have compelled me? my own fortune is competent: but this thing we call t he publick good, was ever, and shall be my maxime to guide me in such like actions: how shall I myself expect truth in any Author, if I myself, being an Author, play the knave in the same kind: Quod non vis tibi, ne facias alteri. This Art of Astrology hath many more parts in it then at this pre sent time I have handled, or indeed as yet have liesure to do; yet I know l.t will be expected I should have wrote of Elections, of the Effects of the greater and lesser Conjunctions of the Plane ts, of Eclipses, Comets, prodigious Apparitions, the variation and inclination of the Weather, Degene ralibus Accidentibus Mundi, and by the ingresse of the Sun into Aries, of every years parti cular Fate, of Monethly Observations, &c. Verily such things as these may justly be requir ed at my hands; for unto God be the glory, they are all in a large measure known unto me, and I c an perform them all, blessed be his name therefore: But as for Elections, me thinks he can be no i ngenious Astrologian, that having studied or well entred into this my book shall not be able (ad libi tum) to frame his own Figure of Elections, let the quere be what It will. He that shall read my Discourse upon the Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupit er, may make himself capable to write of the Major and Minor Conjunctions; I had no president for that, but wrought it out of the fire, at what time I had great leasure. I do write Annually of Eclipses, as they happen in the year, of prodigious Appearances twice I have Astrolog ically wrote, both times to good purpose, so did never any before that I read of. Of Commets I have had no occasion as yet, but somewhat I began in that Tract of the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, wherein I a little treated of the C ommet in 1618. Posterity may know by that little, what Method I hold fittest to be followed, in that kind of judgment. Of Weather, the knowledge thereof is so vulgar, yet withall the true K ey so different, it requires a longtime of experience; and besides, Master Booker"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ hath promised to undertake that burthen; and indeed, he is onely able of all the English Nation I know to perform it: I have great hopes of Master Vincent Wing, but he is yet more Mathematicall then Astrologicall; there may be many private men of great judgm ent therein, but its my unhappinesse I know them not. Annuall and Monthly Judgments I have not yet digested into a Method, I hope to live and perform it; I am the first of men that ever adventured upon Monthely Observations in such plain language, yet it is my harty desire to communicate hereaf ter what ever I know unto Posterity. Having been of late traduced by some halfwitted fools, I deliver myself to Posterity who I am, and of what profession; I was born at Diseworth in Leicest ershire May 1602. in an obscure Village, and bred a Grammer Scholler at Ashby, and intended for Cambridge, &c. 1618 and 1619: my Father decayed his Estate so much, that he was not capable of sending me thither; those two years I lived in some penury and discontent; in 1620. an Atturney sent me up unto London to wait on a Gentleman, one Gilbert Wright, who lived and dyed In the House I now live In; he never was of any profession, but had sometimes attended the Lord C hancellour Egerton, and then lived privately. 1624, his wife dyed of a Cancer In her left bre st, 1625. I lived in London where I now do, during all that great sicknesse, God be praised I had i t not. February 1626, my Master married again, he dyed May 22, 1627, having before settled twenty pounds per annum of me during my life, which to this day I thank God I enjoy; nor did I ever live so freely as when I was his servant. Ere the year 1627, was quite run out, my Mistris wa s pleased to accept of me for her husband. During some years of her life I passed my time private ly and with much obscurity, yet we lived exceeding loving together; but In 1632, I was strangely affected to Astrology, and desirous to Study it, onely to see if there were any verity in it , there being at that time some Impostors, that set out Bils publiquely what they could do. I met with a Master I confesse, but such a one, as of all was the verriest Knave: This gave me small encouragem ent; after six weeks I cast him off, nor to this day do we converse together. I was then forced to study hard, for rather then to intangle  "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ myself with another coxcombe, I was resolved to lay all aside; but by diligence and hard study, and many times conference with some as ignorant as myself, I at last became capable of knowing truth from falshood, and perceived the vulgar Astrologer that meerly l ived of the Art, was a Knave. In September 1633, my wife dyed, not knowing anyone in the world that had aff inity unto her; she left me a competent fortune; and this I shall aquaint P osterity with, that having some Lands to dispose of, rather then she would suffer me to be at twe nty Nobles charges to convey It unto me, she gave me the whole money, and sold it for 200 pounds. In November 1634, I married again. In 1635, I was oppressed with the Hypocondryack Melancholly so sorely, that I was enforced to leave London, a nd removed into Surrey 1636, where until September 1641, I lived amongst such whom I may nam e the most rurall of all men living. I then came for London, staggering In my j udgment in point of Church- government; and knowing that it Is necessary, I ever loved Monarchy, but s till thought without a Parliment preserved in their just rights, it would vanish to nothing. I was nothing known then, or taken notice of by any; time produced me acquaintance, and amongst these a good Lady in 1643, about February, desired I would give judgment upon a most noble Gentlemans U rine a Councellor at Law, who then was not well; I consented, the Urine was brought, my judgment returned; I visited him, whom I no sooner beheld, but I knew there was aboundanc e of gallantry in the man; for indeed he is all Gentleman and a friend in very gre at earnest; my visit of him was the happiest day I ever saw in my whole life; for by his alone ge nerosity and countenance, I am what I am, and Astrology is in despight of her enemies restored, and must call him her Restaurator. Being by his goodness admitted to visit him, I presented him with a s mall Manuscript of my Astrologicall Judgment of the yeer 1644, wherein I was free in deli vering my opinion modestly of that yeers affaires: it pleased him to communicate it, copie s were obtained and dispersed; so that by his alone commendation of that poor Manuscript unto his private fri ends, this noble Art at first had respect amongst our Worthies in the Parliment; since w hich time, the Judicious of the whole Kingdom had it in a better esteem; therefore let his name live unto "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ Posterity In an honorable esteem, that upon so slender acquaintance with the Author, with the Art, hath been so advantagious unto both. The Errataes perhaps are many, I desire the Student to correct t hem before he enter upon the Discourse; I wish they were lesse; but in a work of this nature, itâs Impossible. All the Curtesies which either the Authors precedent to this Age, or at present living, have afforded me, I verily believe I have mentioned: I am heartily sorr y if I have committed any errours, or ommitted any corrections.

The Number of Planets, Signes, Aspects, with their Several 1 Names and Characters. In the first place you must know that there are seven planets, so called and charactere d. Saturn W , Jupiter V , Mars U , Sol Q , Venus T , Mercury S , Luna R : There is also the Head of the Dragon, this noted: < ; and the Tayle > and are not Planets but Nodes. There be also twelve Signes: Aries A , Taurus B , Gemini C , Cancers D , Leo E , Virgo F , Libra G , Scorpio H , Sagittarius I , Capricornus J , Aquarius K , Pisces L : Through these twelve sires the Planets continually move, and can perfectly distinguish the character of every Pla net and signe, before you proceed to any part of this study; and also the characters of these Aspects tha t follow, viz. Sextile * , Square # , Trine $ , Opposition ,Conjunction ! . D   "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 25 An Introduction to Astrologie. You must know, every Signe containes in longitude thirty degrees, and ever y degree sixty minutes, &c. the beginning is from Aries, and so in order one Signe aft er another: so the whole Zodiack containes 360 degrees, the second degree of Taurus is the two and thirtieth degree of the Zodiack, the tenth of Taurus is the fortieth, and so in order all throughout the twelve signes; yet you must ever account the Aspects from the degree of the Zodiack wher ein the Planet is, as if Saturn be in ten degrees of Gemini, and I would know to what degree of t he Ecliptick he casteth his sinister Sextile Aspect; reckoning from Aries to the 10th deg ree of Gemini, I find Saturn to be in the 70th degree of the Zodiack, according to his longitude; if I adde 60 degrees more to 70, they make 130, which answers to the 10th degree of the Signe Leo, to whic h Saturn casteth his Sextile Apsect, or to any Planet in that degree. When two Planets are equally distant one from each other, 60 degrees, we say they are in Sextile Apsect, and note it with this character * . When two Planets are 90 degrees distant one from another, we call t hat Aspect a Quartill (Square) Aspect, and write it thus, # When two Planets are 120 degrees distant, we say they are in Tri ne Aspect, and we write it thus $ . When two Planets are 180 degrees distant, we call that Aspect Oppos ition, and character the Aspect thus [SYMBOL], When two planets are in one and the same degree and minute of any sig ne, we say they are in Conjunction, and write it thus ! . So then if you find Saturn in the 1st degree of Aries, and Moon or any othe r Planet in the 1st degree of Gemini, you shall say they are in a Sextile Aspect, for they are distant one from another 60 degrees, and this Aspect is indifferent good. If Saturn or any other Planet be in the 1st degree of Aries, and anot her Planet in the 1st degree of Cancer, you must say they are in a Square Aspect, because there i s 90 degrees of the Zodiack betwixt them: this Aspect is of enmity and not good. If Saturn be in the 1st degree of Aries, and any Planet in the 26"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. 1st degree of Leo, there being now the distance of 120 degrees, they behold each other with a Trine Aspect; and this doth denote Unity, Concord and Friendship. If you find Saturn in the 1st degree of Aries, and any Planet In the 1st degree of Libra, they being now 180 degrees each from other, are said to be in Opposition: A bad Aspect: and you must be mindfull to know what signes are opposite each to other, for without it you cannot erect the Figure. When Saturn is in the 1st degree of Aries, and any Planet is in the same degree, they ar e then said to be in Conjunction: And this Aspect is good or ill, according to the nature of the question demanded. Signes Opposite to one another are Aries âââ Libra Taurus âââ Scorpio Gemini âââ Sagittarius  Cancer âââ Capricorn Leo âââ Aquarius  Virgo âââ Pisces That is Aries is opposite to Libra, and Libra to Aries; Taurus to Scorpio, Scorpio to Taurus : and so in order as they stand. Ephemeris, what, and its use. I would have all men well and readily apprehend what precedes, and then they will most easi ly understand the Ephemeris; which is no other thing, then a book containing the true places of the Planets, in degrees and minutes, in every of the 12 signes both in longitude and latitude, every day of the yeer at noon, and every hour of the day, by correction and equation. I have inserted an Ephemeris of the moneth of January 1646, and after it a Table of Houses for the latitude of 52 degrees, which will serve in a manner, all the Kingdom of England on this si de of Newark upon Trent, without sensible errour; and this I have done of purpose to teach by them, the use of an Ephemeris, and the manner and means of erecting a Figure of Heaven, without which nothing can be known or made use of in Astrology. CHAP. 11. Of the Use of the Ephemeris. The first line on the leftâhand page, tels you, January hath 31: dayes. "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 27 An Introduction to Astrologie. In the second line you find, The daily motions of the Planets and the Dragons head. In the third line and over the character of Saturn you have M.D.M. signif ying Meridlonall, D. Descending; that is, Saturn hath Meridionall latitude, and is Descending. In the next column you find M.D. and underneath Jupiter; that is, Jupiter hat h South or Meridionall latitude, and is descending. In the third column you find M.A. and under those letters Mars; that is, Mars hath Meridionall latitude, and is ascending. The Sun hath never any latitude. In the next column to the Sun you find Venus and then Mercury, with the tit le of their Latitude: Now if over any of the Planets you find S.A. or D. it tels you that P lanet hath Septentrionall or North latitude, and is either ascending or descending, as the letters A. or D. do manifest . In the fourth line you see Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Mercury, Moon, North N ode; now you must observe ever, the South Node is in the opposite signe and degree to the Nor th Node, though he is never placed in the Ephemeris. In the Fifth line you have Aries, Gemini, Capricorn, Capricorn, Pisces , Aquarius, Scorpio, Leo: Over Aries you have Saturn, that is to acquaint you, that Saturn is in the signe of Aries: And so over Capricorn stands Mars: And so of all rest one after another. In the Sixth line you have figure 1, telling of you itâs the first day of January, and so underneath it to the lower end, you have the day of the moneth. Next to the Figure 1, you have the letter A, which Is the letter of the day of the week; and if you run down under that column; you see the great letter to be D, which is the Sunday or Dominicall letter of the yeer 1646. Over against the first day of January under the character of Sat urn you find 27.48, over those figures you see Aries; the meaning is, Saturn is the first day of January in 27 degrees and S minutes of Aries: now you must observe, 60 minutes make one degree, and tha t when any Planet hath passed 30 degrees in a signe, he goeth orderly into the next; as out of Aries into Taurus, out of Taurus into Gemini, &c. "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 28"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. In the fourth column, over against the first of the moneth, you find 28R12, over them Gemini, and over it Jupiter; that us; Jupiter the first of January is in 28 degrees of Gemini and 12 minutes: The letter R tels you that he is Retrograde; had you found Di. or D. it had told you he was then come to be Direct in motion. Of all these termes hereafter by themselves. In the fifth column you find 10,5, over those figures Capricorn, Mars, viz. Ma rs is the first of January in the 10th degree and 5 minutes of Capricorn. And so by this order you find the Sun to be in 21 degrees, and 34 minutes of Ca pricorn; and Venus in 5 degrees 7 minutes of Pisces; Mercury in 5 degrees and 29 minutes of Aquarius; the Moon in 21 degrees and 23 minutes of Scorpio, North Node In 12 degrees and 34 minut es of Leo. So that you see on the left-hand page, there are ten severall columns ; the first containing the day of the moneth; the second, the weekâday letter; the third, the degree a nd minutes of Saturn; the fourth containes the degrees and minutes Jupiter is in; and so every c olumn the like for the rest of the Planets. Over against the tenth of January, under the column of the Sun, you find 0 Aqua rius 44 minutes, which onely sheweth you the Sun to be that day at Noon, in 0 degrees and 44 m inutes of Aquarius, &c. In the lower end of the left-side page, after the 31 of January you f ind Lat. of Pla. that is, the Latitude of the Planets. Under the letter c you find 1 10 20. Under the column of Saturn over against 1, you find 2. 31. then continuing your eye , you have upder Jupiter 0, 5: under Mars 0,47; under Venus 1,13; under Mercury 1,45. The meaning her e is, that the first day of January Saturn hath 2 degr: and 31 min: of lati tude; Jupiter 0 degr: 5 min: Mars 0 degr:47 min: Venus I degr: 13 min: Mercury 1 degr:45 min: of l atitude. To know whether It is North or South, cast your eye to the upper column, and you may see over the character of Saturn stands M.D. that is, Meridionall Descending, or South latitude; w here you find 5, it tels you the latitude is North; if you find A, the planet is Ascending in hi s latitude; if D. then Descending.  "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 29 An Introduction to Astrologie. CHAP. III. The rightâhand page of the Ephemeris unfolded. There are eight columns: the first contains the days of the moneth; the six next containes the manner, quality and name of those Aspects the Moon hath to the Planets; as also, the hour of the day or night when they perfectly meet in Aspect; the eighth column hath onely those Aspects which Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury make to each other, and the time of the day or night when. In the fourth line under Saturn you find Occid. that is, Saturn is Occide ntall of the Sun, or sets after him; and so of Jupiter, or where you find Occid. it noteth as much. Under Mars you find Orient. that is, Mars is Orientall, or riset h before the Sun. And so at any time. For better understanding the true time when the Moon comes to the Aspec t of any Planet, you are to observe, that all those that write Ephemerides, compute the motion of the Planets for the noon time, or just at twelve: And you must know, we and they ever begin our da y at Noon, and so reckon 24 hours from the noon of one day to the noon of the next, and after this m anner you must reckon in the Aspects. As for example: Over against the first day of January 1646. which is Thursday, and under t he column appropriate to the Sun, you find * o. The meaning whereof is, that the Moon is in Sexti le aspect with the Sun that first day of January at noon, or no hours P.M. or Post Men diem. Over against Friday the second of January, you find under the column of Ve nus [] 6. and on the right hand side over against the same day, under Mercury * 9. which is no more than this, viz, the second day of January at 6 a clock after noon, the Moon comes to the Square or Quartill aspect of Venus; and at 9 of clock she meets with the sextile of Mercury. Over against the sixt day of January, being Tuesday, under Saturn you f ind [] 14. that Is, fourteen hours after noon of that day, the Moon comes to the [] of Saturn: now you may easily find, that  "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 30"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. the fourteenth hour after noon on Tuesday, is two of clock in the morning on Wednesday. Again, over against the 6 day, under the column of the Sun you find Conjunction 11 48 which is no more but this, the Moon comes to Conjunction with the Sun at 48 minutes aft er eleven of clock at night: Now you must know the Moon her Conjunction with the Sun is her change, her next [] after Conjunction with the Sun is the first quarter, her Oppos ition with the Sun is full Moon, her [] after Opposition is her last quarter. If you understand but this, that thirteen hours Is one of clock the day subse quent, fourteen hours two of clock, fifteen hours three of clock in the morning, sixteen is f our of clock, seventeen hours is five in the morning, eighteen is six of clock, nineteen hours is se ven of clock, twenty hours is eight in the morning, twenty one hours is nine of clock, twenty two hours a fter noon is ten of clock the next day, twenty three hours after noon is eleven of clock, &c . Now we never say twenty four hours after noon, for then itâs just noon, and if we say 00.00. aft er noon that is just at noon, or then itâs full-twelve of clock: Understanding this and you cannot erre. In that column under the Planets mutuall Aspects, over against the thi rd of January being Saturday, you find * Saturn Jupiter 21 that is Saturn and Jupiter are in aspect 21 hours after noon of the Saturday; and that is, at nine of clock on the Sunday morning following. Over against the fourth day you find Moon Apogaum, that is, she is then re motest from the earth over against the eighteenth day in the outmost column you find Moon Periga on, that is, the Moon is then nearest unto the earth. Over against the twelfth day, in the same outmost column, you find Mer cury in Elong. Max. it should be Mercury in Maxima Elongatione, or that day Mercury is in hi s greatest elongation or distance from the Sun. Over against the sixt of January, you find in the outside column Vc Sun Jupiter SS Mars Mercury; that is the Sun and Jupiter are in Quincunx aspect that day; now that aspect consisteth of five Signes, or 150 degrees. SS is a Semisextil, and tels you, that day Mars and Mercury ar e in Semisextil to each other: this aspect consisteth of 30 degrees.

Over against the 25 of January, you find in the outmost column [] Saturn M ars 11, and Q Sun Saturn: The meaning is, that at eleven of clock after noon, Saturn and M ars are in Quartill aspect; and that Q Sun Saturn tels you, the Sun and Saturn have a Quintill aspect to each other that day: A Quintill consists of two Signes twelve degrees, or when Planets are distant 72 degrees from each other: we seldom use more aspects then Conjunction, Sextile, Squar e, Trine, Opposition: to these of late one Kepler, a learned man, hath added some new ones, as follow, viz. A Semisextill, charactered SS, consisting of 30 degrees. A Quintil Q consisting of 72 degrees. A Tredecile Td consisting of 108 degrees. A Biquintill Bq consisting of 144 degrees. A Quincunx Vc consisting of 150 degrees. I only acquaint you with these, that finding them any where you may apprehend their meaning. After those two sides of an Ephemeris, followeth in order, A Table of Houses; for without a present Ephemeris and Table of Houses, itâs impossible to instruct you to set a Figure, without which we can give no judgment, or perform anything In this art. The use of the Table of Houses. As there are twelve Signes in the Zodiack, through which the Sun and al l the Planets make their daily motion, so are thers as you may see twelve severall grea t pages; and as Aries is the first Signe of the Zodiack, so in the first line of the first great pag e doe you find Sun in Aries; in the second grand page and first line you will find Sun in Taurus; In the thi rd page and first line Sun in Gemini; and so in order according to the succession of Signes one af ter another through the twelve pages: By help of these Tables we frame a Figure, as I shall now acquaint you.

CHAP. IV. How to Erect a Figure of Heaven by the Ephemeris and Table of Houses, aforesaid. See Figure 1. In the first place you are to draw the Figure thus; and to know that those twelve empty spaces are by us called the twelve houses of Heaven, that square in the middl e is to write the day, yeer, and hour of the day when we set a figure: the first house begins ever upon that line where you see the figure 1 placed, the second house where you see the figure 2 stand, t he third house where you see the figure 3, the fourth house begins where you find the figure 4, the fifth house where you see the figure 5, the sixth where you see the figure 6, the seventh house where you find the figure 7, the eighth house where you find the figure 8, the ninth house where you find the figure 9, the tenth house where you find the figure 10, the eleventh house where you find the figure 11, the tewlfth house where you find the figure 12: what space is contained bet ween the figure 1 to the figure 2, is of the first house, or what Planet you shall find to be i n that space, you shall say he is in the first house; yet if he be within 5 degrees of the Cusp of any house, his vertue shall be assigned to that house whose Cusp he is neerest, &c. but of this hereaf ter. The Cusp or very entrance of any house, or first beginning, is upon the line where you see the figures placed; upon which line you must ever place the Signe and degree of the Zodiack, as you find it in the Table of Houses, as if you find 10 degrees of Aries for  33"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. the tenth house, you must place the number 10 and Signe of Aries upon the line of the tenth house, and that same tenth degree is the Cusp or beginning of that house, and so in the rest. In erecting or setting your Figure, whether of a Question or Nativi ty, you are to consider these three things. First, the yeer, moneth, day of the week, hour or part of the hour of that day. Second, to observe in the Ephemeris of that yeer and day the true place of the Sun in Signe, degree and minute at noon. Thirdly, what hours and minutes In the Table of houses doe answer or stand on the left hand against the degree of that Signe the Sun is In the day of the Ques tion; for by adding the hour of the day, and hours and minutes answering to the place of the Sun, your Figur e is made, and this Signe where the Sun is you must always look for In the great column under the title of the tenth house, where you find the Sun and that Signe together; as if upon any day of the yeer when I set my Figure, the Sun is in Aries, then the first great page or si de serveth, for there you find Sun in Aries; if the Sun be in Taurus, then the second page serveth, and so in or der: and as in the uppermost line you find Sun In Aries Taurus Gemini, &c. so underneath those characters, and under the tenth house, you see 0 1 2 3 4 5 6, and so all along to 30 degrees; so that let the Sun be In what degree he will, you have it exactly to degrees in the se cond lesse column, under the title of the tenth house, If any minutes adhere to the place of the Sun as al ways there doth, If those minutes exceeds thirty, take the hours and minutes, adhering to the next greater degree the Sun Is in; if lesse minutes then thirty belong to the Sun, take the same y ou find him with, for you must know it breeds no error in an Horary Question. Examples by the Figure following. I would erect a Figure of Heaven the sixt of January, being Tuesday , 1646. one hour thirty minutes afternoon, or P.M. that is, Post Meridiem. First, I look in the Ephemeris over against the sixth of January, for the true place of the Sun, and I find it to be 26 39 Capricorn; then I look in the Table of Houses untill I find the Sun in Capricorn 10, which signifie th the tenth house, I find Capricorn; I enter with the degrees of the Sun  34"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ FIGURE 2. "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. See Figure 2. which being 26 39 I look for 27, and on the left hand against it, I find 19h 56m; I n the head of the Table over them H. H. signifying Hours and Minutes: These hours and minut es viz. 19,56, I adde to the time of day in my Question, vIz. 1, 30 (and so I must always in every Question adde both numbers together, and if they make more then 24 hours, I must cast away 24 hours, and enter the Table of Houses, under the title of time from noon, seeking for the rem ainder, or the neerest number to it, and on the right hand over against It, under the severall col umns, you shall have the Cusps of the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, first, second, third, fourth houses: but to my former purpose: I add 19,56 to 1,30 and they produce 21 hours, 26 minutes; which number I seek for in that column, entitled Time from noon, or Hours, minutes, and which number I fi nd precisely In the eleventh great page, under the Sun in Aquarius; and over against 21,26 on t he right hand under the column of the tenth house, I find 19,(tenth house] and over its head upwar d, the Signe of Aquarius, so then I put the 19 degrees of Aquarius upon the Cusp of the tenth house. [Eleventh house.] In the third column, over against 21,26 I find 17,6, over It the S igne of Pisces, above Pisces the number 11, which appoints you 17 degrees, and 6 minute s of Pisces for the Cusp of the eleventh house. [Twelfth house.] In the 4th column you find over against the former number 11,37, over that the character of Taurus, at the upper end 12, which tels you, that 11,37 degre es of Taurus must be placed on the Cusp of the twelfth house.  "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 35 An Introduction to Astrologie. [First house.] In the fifth column over against the former number, you have 25,31, over It Gemini, over GeminI 1 House, and directs you to place the 25 degrees and 31 minutes of Gemini upon the line of Cusp of the first house. [Second house.] In the sixth column you find 17,10, over that Cancer, 2 House, which tels you 17, 10 degrees of the Signe Cancer must be placed on the Cusp or line of the second house. [Third house.] In the seventh little column over against the former numbe r you have 2,22, over it the Signe Leo, and in the upper line 3 House; so you are directed to put t he 2 deg. and 22 minutes of Leo upon the Cusp of the third house. Having now perfected the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, first, second, and third House, I must direct you how to perform the rest. You must for understanding hereof know, that the first six Signes of the Zodiack are opposite to the six last, as formerly I told you. Ariesâââ Libra Taurusâââ Scorpio Geminiâââ Sagittarius Cancerâââ Capricorn Leo âââ Aquarius Virgoâââ Pisces Viz. Aries is opposite to Libra, and Libra to Aries; to Taurus to Scorpio, and Scorpio to Taurus , and so all the rest in order. The twelve Houses also are opposite each to other: as thus 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 So that the tenth house is opposite to the fourth, the fourth to the tenth; the eleventh to the fifth, the fifth to the eleventh, and so all the rest as you find placed: The use you are to make of it i s this, That if on the Cusp of the tenth house you find the Signe Aries, then on the Cusp of the fourth the Signe Libra; and look what degree and minute of possesseth the Signe of the tenth house, the same degree and minute of the opposite Signe must be placed on the Cusp of the fourth house, and so of all the other Signes and Cusps of houses; and this is generall, and ever holdeth true; without which rule observed, you cannot erect the Figure aright. In our former Figure you see 19 Aquarius on the Cusp of the tenth "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 36 An Introduction to Astrologie. house, Leo is opposite to Aquarius, and the fourth house to the tenth; so then I place the 19 degree of Leo upon the Cuspe of that house. Upon the line or cusp of the eleventh house you see Pisces 17,6,Virgo is the Signe opposite to Pisces, and the fifth house to the eleventh; so that I placed the 17 deg ree and 6 minutes of Virgo upon the Cusp of the fifth house. The Cusp of the twelfth house is the 11,37 of Taurus, I see Scorpio is opposi te to Taurus, and the sixth house to the twelfth; I therefore put the 11 degree and 37 minutes of Scorpio on the Cusp of the sixth house. I doe so in the rest of the houses, and by this means I have framed the twelve houses, and placed the severall Signs of the Zodiack upon the Cusps as they ought to be. Having finished your twelve houses by the Method preceding, you must now lea rn to place the Planets therein; which you must doe by observing in the Ephemeris, the e xact place of the Planet in Sign and Degree at noon the day of the Figure, and in what house you sha ll finde the Sign wherein the House is, in that House must you place the Planet, within the House if the Planet be in more Degrees then the Cuspe of the House; without the House, if his Degrees be lesse then those of the Cusp of the Houses. Over against the sixt day of January aforesaid, I find Saturn to be in 27.58. of Aries: I look for Aries in the Figure, but find it not; I find Pisces on the Cuspe of t he eleventh, and Taurus on the Cuspe of the twelfth House; so I conclude that the Signe Aries is intercepted; for so we say when a Signe Is not upon any of the Cuspes of Houses, but included betwixt one Hous e and another: I therefore place Saturn in the 11 House, as you may see. In the next place I finde the place of Jupiter to be 27.40. Gemini. I fi nd 25.31. Gemini to be on the Cuspe of the first House, because the Degrees adhering to Jupite r are greater then the Cuspe, I place Jupiter within the House. And because he Is noted Retrograde I pl ace the Letter R, the better to informe my judgment. In the fifth column of the Ephemeris I find Mars the sixth of Januar y to be in the 13.55. Capricorn; which Signe in the figure is .the Cusp of the eighth House: I therefore place Mars as neer  "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 37 An Introduction to Astrologie. the Cusp as I can, but his Degrees in the Signe being lesse then t he Cuspe of the House, I place him without the House. I find the Sun the sixth day of January to be In 26.39 Capricorn whom I place beyond the Cuspe of the eighth House, because the Degrees of the Sun in Capricorn are more then the Cuspe of the House. In the same line, and over against the sixt of January, I finde Venus to be in 10 Degrees, and 53 minutes of Pisces. I finde the Signe of Pisces on the Cuspe of the eleventh House, and ther e I put Venus in the tenth House, neer the Cuspe of the eleventh House, but not in the House, because the Degrees of the Signe she is in are not equivalent to the Degrees of the Cuspe of t he eleventh House, but are short of them. In the eigth Column I finde under the character of Mercury 13.18. above it Aquarius. I therefore place Mercury neer the Cuspe of the tenth House, but not in the House; f or you may see he is neerer In Degrees to the Cuspe of the tenth house then the ninth; for by how much neerer he is in Degrees to the Cuspe of any House, having the same Signe, by so much t he neerer he ought to be p1aced to the Cuspe of that House. In the ninth Column, under the Column of the Moon I finde over against the six th of January 20.54. and over the Figures Capricorn: so then I place the Moon very neer the Sun in the eighth House, and betwixt the Cupse of the house and the Sun; for you may see the Moon hath not so many Degrees as may put her beyond the Sun; nor hath she so few to be without the eighth House. How to reduce the motion of the Moon an other Planets to any house of the day, you shall be instructed hereafter. In the tenth column I find over against my said day, 10.10.over against it Leo and North Node: so you see the North Node is in 11 deg. 10 mm. of Leo; which I place in the middle of the third house, because ten degrees are very neer as nigh the Cuspe of the thi rd house as fourth; the South Node being always in the opposite Signe and degree at the North Node, I place in the ninth house, viz. In 11 degrees 10 minutes of Aquarius, This being done, I must observe how the Moon Seperates and applies the same day; I find the sixt of January on the right-hand page of the book, that the Moon did last seperate from a Conjunction of Mars and now is a pplying to a Conjunction of Sun at 11,48, that is at eleven of clock and 48 minutes after at night, then to a Square "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 38"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. of Saturn at fourteen hours after noon, or at two of clock the next morning. Thus have you one Figure of Heaven erected, and the Planets therein plac ed, though not rectif led to the hour of the day, for how to reduce their motion to any hour I shall s hew hereafter: But because I have by experience found, that many Learners have been much st umbled for want of sufficient directions in former Introductions to set a Scheame of H eaven, I shall be a little more copious, and shew an example or two more. I would erect a Figure on Saturday the 17 of January 1646. for eleven of c lock and twenty after noon: the Sun that day at noon Is In 7 degrees and 52 of Aquarius: In the ele venth page of the Table of Houses I find Sun In Aquarius, under the column of the tenth house I look for the eighth degree of Aquarius, because 52 minutes want but little of a degree; over against the eighth degree on the leftâhand, under the title of Time From Noon, I find 20 42, viz. 20 hours 42 m inutes; so then I work thus, Time of the day is 11 20. 20 42 hours and minutes answering to the eighth degree of Aquarius, there being 62 min. viz, two min. more than one hour, I take that hour and adde both numbers together, they make ........... 32 02. From 32 hours and 2 min. I subtract 24 hours, as I must ever doe, if there be more then 24 hours, and then there remaines as you see, 8 hours and 32 02 2 min. which I find not  24 subtracted. precisely in the Table of Houses, but I find 8,0,  8 02 remaines. which is neer my number, and which serves very well; over against 8h and 0m I find 28,0, and in the upper part I find Cancer, and over it the tenth house, so then I have 28 de grees, 0 min. of Cancer for the Cuspe of my tenth house: in the same line, on the right hand to the 28 degr. of Cancer, you shall find 4 36, over it Virgo, In the upper part of the elevent h house: so then 4 degr. 36 mm. of Virgo are the Cuspe of the eleventh house; then have you over aga inst the said number of S hours 0 min. in  "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 39"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. the fourth column, 0 Libra 4, over its head the twelfth house, this tels y ou the Cusp of the twelfth house is 0 degr. 4 min. of Libra: in the fifth column over against the s aid former number, you have 21.3, over them figures at the top of the page, Libra, and then the fir st house; which signifies, that you must place the 21 deg.and 3 min. of Libra on the cusp of the first house: adjoyning to the 21.degr. and 3 min of Libra in the sixth column, I find 13,57, over it the sign Scorpio, in the upper part of the second house, by which I know, that 13 degr. and 57 min of Scorpio must be placed on the cusp of the second house. In the seventh and utmost column over against my foresaid number of 8 hours and 0 min. I find 15.46, over them the si gn Sagittarius, in the upper column over their head the third house, pointing out 15 degr. 46 min of Sa gittarius for the Cusp of the third house; so then your Cusps of Houses stand thus: Tenth house 28 Cancer. Eleventh house 4.36 Virgo. Twelfth house 0.4 Libra. First house 21.3 Libra. Second House 13.57 Scorpio. Third house 15.46 Sagittarius. The Cusps of the other houses are found out by the opposite Signes and houses, a s I formerly directed, viz, the fourth house being opposite ever to the tenth, and the Signe Capricorn to Cancer. I place the 28 degr. of Capricorn on the Cusp of the fourth house: t he fifth is opposite to the eleventh, and Pisces is the opposite Signe to Virgo, I therefore place the 4 degr. and 36 min. of Pisces for the Cusp of the fifth: the twelfth house is opposite t o the sixth, so is Aries opposite to Libra, therefore I place the 21 degr. and 3 min. of Aries, the opposite Signe to Libra, on the Cusp of the seventh house: the eighth house is opposite to the second, and Taurus to Scorpio, I therefore place the 13 degr. and 57 min. of Taurus on the Cusp of the eighth house: the ninth house is opposite to the third, and Gemini to Sagittarius, I therefore make the 15 degr. and 46 min. of Gemini the Cusp of the ninth house: The Planets are to be placed in the  "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 40"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. Figure as formerly directed; nor let it trouble you, if you find som etimes two signs in one house, or almost three, or sometimes one sign to be on the Cusps of three house s, ever place your Planets orderly as neer the degree of the house, as the number of deg rees your Planet is in will permit. You must ever remember that if your hour of the day be in the morning, or as we say Ante Meridiem, or before noon, you must reckon the time, as from the noon of the da y preceding: As for example. I would erect a Figure the 26. day of January 1646. being Monday, for 9. of the clock and 45 min. before noon. My time stands thus: 9 ho. 45 min. To this I adde 12 hours, because it is properly in our account, the 21 hour and 45 minutes after noon of the Sunday preceding: so then you may say thus; the Figure is set for 9. hours and 45 minutes Ante Meridiem, or before noon of the Monday. Or else 25 of January, being Sunday, 21 hours and 45 min. Post Meridiem, or af ter noon, which is all one with the former time. I find the Sun at noon the same 26 day, to be in 16 degr. and 59 min. of Aquarius; I look in the Table of Houses what hours and min. correspond to the 17 degrees of Aquarius in the tenth house; in the eleventh page I find Sun Aquarius, and along in the column of the tenth 17 degr. 0 min. on the left hand I find over against them, 31 hours 18 min. to these I a dd the hours and min. of the day, viz. 21.45; added together, they make  43h 03m. from which in regard they are more then 24 hours, I subtract 24.     43 03  24      Rests 19 03 With my 12 hours and a min. Ienter the Table of Houses, and under the titl e of hours and minutes, or Time from noon, I seek my number, In the tenth page I find 19 hour s and 1 min. which is the next number unto my desire, over against it I see 14.0, and in the upper part of Capricorn and tenth house, signifying the 14 degr. of the Sign Capricorn is to be placed on the Cusp of the "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 41 "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction To Astrologie. tenth house, the rest of the houses are found out in order as they stand in the Table of Houses over against my number of 19 hours and 1 min. I hope these examples will be sufficient for all young Learners; but that they may presently consider whether they have set their Fi gure right yea or no, let them take this general rule, that if the Figure be erected from noon to Sunset, the Sun will be in the ninth, eighth or seventh house; if it be erected from Sunset till midnight, he s hal find the Sun in the sixth, fifth or fourth house; if it be set from midnight till Sunrise, he sha ll find the Sun in the third, second or first house; if the Figure be set from Sunrise till noon, then he shall find the Sun in the twelfth, eleventh or tenth house, &c.  CHAP. V. Of the daily motion of the Planets, and how to reduce their motion to any house of the day, and to the Meridian of London. We have seldom occasion to erect a scheam of Heaven just at noon, to which time the motions of the Planets are exactly calculated, and need not any rectification; but usually a ll Questions are made either some hours before, or after noon; therefore it is needfull you know how to take their diurnall or daily motion, or how many degrees or min. they move in 24 hours, that thereby you may have a proportion to adde to the place of your Planets according to the hour of the day or night when you set your Figure: And although in horary questions, it occasioneth no error (except in the motion of the Moon) yet I thought fit to instruct the Learner herewith, that so he may know how to doe his work handsomely. Example. You must set down the place of your Planet in Signe, degree and minute as you find him at noon; and if your Planet be direct, you must subtract him in degree and minute from the place he is in the day susbequent: but when a Planet is retrograde, you must doe the contrary, viz, subtract t he motion of your Planet the day subsequent from the day going before.

How to find the quantity of the hourly motion of any Planet by the Table following. In every Figure you set, the place of the Planets ought to be recti fied to the hour of the setting the Figure, especially the place of the Moon, because of her swift moti on; in the Planets you need not be scrupulous, but take whole degrees without sensible error, or indeed any at all: this I mean in Questions; but in Nativities, you are to have the places of them exa ctly to degrees and minutes; and above all, the motion of the Sun to minutes and seconds, because by his mot ion we set the yearly revolutions of Nativities.

The daily motion of Mars is 46 min. in the Figure abovenamed. "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 45 An Introduction to Astrologie. I enter down the first column, and find 46, against it I find 1 min. 55 sec onds to be one hours motion of Mars, when in 24 hours he moves 46 min. You must note, if you enter with minutes, you must have minutes, if with seconds, seconds; and so in the rest: This in the motion of Saturn Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, M ercury; with the Moon otherwayes. If the motion of your Planet be above 61 min. viz. 70 or 75 or 80 min. then enter the Table twice: as for example. The motion of Mercury is, as you perceive, 1 degr. and 27 min. I would know wha t his hourly motion is, I enter first with 60 min. against which I find 2,30, viz. 2 min. 30 seconds, then I enter with 27, against which I find 1,7,30, viz. 1 min. 7 seconds, thirty thirds, which I cast away, and adde the two former summes together thus, 2 30  1 7  3 37 added together they make 3 min. 37 seconds, and so much is the hourly motion of Mercury, when his diurnall motion is 87 minutes. The daily motion of the Moon you see is 12 degrees and 7 minutes. I enter down the first column with 12, against it I find 0,30,0, viz. 0 degr, 30 min. 0 seconds. I enter with 7, over against it I find 0 17 30 I adde the number to it 30 0 0 they produce 30 minutes 17 seconds, and 30 thirds for the hourly motion of the Moon i n our figure: you may in her operation reject the seconds and thirds. By this rule I would know where the true place of the Sun is at that hour when we erected the Figure. The hour of the day is 1:30, the time admitted by Eichstadius for reduci ng his Ephemeris to the Meridian of London, is 50 min. of an hour in motion, for they being more East t hen we, the Sun comes sooner to them at their noon, then to us that are more West-war d, by so much time: I adde 50 min. to my former time, viz. 1.30, the whole is then 2 hours and 20 min. now if the motion of the Sun in one hour be 2 min. 32 seconds then in two hours it will be 2 min. 32 seconds more. added together they are 5 min. 04 seconds. "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 46"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. Which being added to the place of the Sun at noon, make the true place of t he Sun at time of erection of the Figure, 26 deg. 44 min. and 4 sec. of Capricorn; there is 20 min. of one hour more; but because they produce nothing of consequence, I omit further herein. The place of the Moon the same day at noon is 20 54; if you adde her motion in two hours, you shall see it will be twice 30 min.. viz, one whole degr. and then her t rue place will be 21 54 Capricorn. We that say many Figures, never care for this exactnesse, but us e this generall rule; In the motion of the Sun, Venus and Mercury, if the figure be for six or seven hours a fter noon, we adde about 15 min. to their places at noon, and so allowing for every six hours 15 min. motion. Because the Moon goeth 12,13 or 14 degr. in an day, we constantly adde to her pl ace at noon 3 degr. for every six hours, and some mm. over; doe so with the other Plane ts according to their diurne motion. He that would doe them more exact, may work them by multi plication and division, or procure some old Ephemeris, wherein there is usually large proportionall Tables concerning this business. Now as I have acquainted you, that in motion of the Planets you must in a Nativity or Question, if you please, allow the Planets so much to be added unto their place a t noon as can be got in 50 min. of an hour, so you must observe the contrary in the Aspects. As for e xample: The sixt of January you find Moon Square Saturn 14 P.M. viz, the Moon comes to the square a spect of Saturn at 14 hours after the noon of the sixth day of January, or at two of the clock the next morning on the seventh day: now you must subduct 50 min. of an hour from 14 hours, and t hen the true time of the Moon her perfect square to Saturn with us at L ondon, is at 13 hours and 10 min. after noon: doe so in all the aspects &c. CHAP. VI. Of the twelve Houses of Heaven, and some Names or Termes of Astrologie. The whole spheare of Heaven is divided into four equal parts by the Meri dian and Horizon, and again into four quadrants,  "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 47"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. and every Quadrant again into three parts, according to other Circles drawn by points of Sections of the aforesaid Meridian and Horizon; so the whole Heaven is divided int o twelve equall parts, which the Astrologers call Houses or Mansions, taking their beginning from the East. The first Quadrant is described from the East to the Midheaven, or f rom the line of the first house to the line of the tenth house, and contains the twelfth, eleventh and tenth houses, itâs called the Orientiall, Vernall, Masculine, Sanguine, Infant quarter. The second Quadrant is from the Cusp of the Mid-heaven to the cusp of the seventh house, containing the ninth, eighth and seventh houses, and is called the Meridian, E stivall, Feminine, Youthfull, Cholerick quarter. The third Quadrant is from the cusp of the seventh house to the cusp of the fourth house, and contains the sixth, fifth and fourth houses, is called the Occidentall, Autumnall, Masculine, Melanchollique, Manhood, cold and dry. The fourth Quadrant is from the cusp of the fourth to the cusp of the fir st house, and contains the third, second and first house, is Northern, Feminine, Old Age, of the nature of Winter, Phlegmatique. The first, tenth, seventh and fourth houses hereof are called Angles, the eleventh, second, eighth & fifth are called Succedants, the third, twelfth, ninth and sixth, are termed Cadents. The Angles are most powerfull, the Succedants are next in vertue, the Cadents poor, and of little efficacy: the Succedant houses follow the Angles, the Cadents come next the Succedants; in force and vertue they stand so in order: 1 10 7 4 11 5 9 3 2 8 6 12 The meaning whereof is this, that two Planets equally dignified, the one in the Ascendant, the other in the tenth house, you shall judge the Planet in the Ascendant some what of more power to effect what he is Significator of, then he that is in the tenth: doe so in the rest as they stand in order, remembering that Planets in Angles doe more forcibly shew their effects. When we name the Lord of the Ascendant, or Significator of the  "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 48 An Introduction to Astrologie. Querent, or thing quesited; we mean no other thing then that Planet who i s Lord of that Sign which ascends, or Lord of that Sign from which house the thing demanded is required; as if from the seventh house, the Lord of that sign descending on the cusp is Signific ator, and so in the rest: but of this in the ensuing Judgments. Cosignificator is when you find another Planet in aspect or conjunction w ith that Planet who is the principall significator; this said Planet shall have signifi cation more or lesse, and either, assist or not, in effecting the same thing desired; and so hath something to doe in the judgment, and ought to be considered: if a friendly Planet, he notes good; if an infort une the contrary, viz, either the destruction of the thing, or disturbance in it. Almuten, of any house is that Planet who hath most dignities in the si gn ascending or descending upon the Cusp of any house, whereon, or from whence, you require your judgment. Almuten of a Figure, is that Planet who in Essentiall and Accident all dignities, is most powerfull in the whole Scheam of Heaven. The Dragons Head we sometimes call Anabibazon. The Dragons Taile Catabibazon. The Longitude of a Planet is his distance from the beginning of Arie s, numbered according to the succession of signs, unto the place of the Planet. Latitude is the distance of a Planet from the Ecliptick, either towards the North or South, by which means we come to say, a Planet hath either Septentrionall or Meridionall Latitude, when either he recedes from the Ecliptick towards the North or South. Onely the Sun continually moveth in the Ecliptick, and never hath any latitude. Declination of a Planet is his distance from the Equator, and as he declines from thence either Northward or Southward, so is his declination nominated either North or South.

Of the twelve Houses, their Nature and Signification. As before we have said there are twelve signs, and also twelve H ouses of Heaven, so now we are come to relate the nature of these twelve Houses; the exact knowl edge whereof is so requisite, that he who shall learn the nature of the Planets and Signs without e xact judgment of the Houses, is like an impovident man, that furnisheth with variety of householdstuffe, having no place wherein to bestow them. There is nothing appertaining to the life of man in this world, which i n one way or other hath not relation to one of the twelve Houses of Heaven, and as the twelve sig ns are appropriate to the particular members of mans body; so also doe the twelve houses repres ent not onely the severall parts of man, but his actions, quality of life and living, and the curiosi ty and judgment of our Fore-fathers in Astrology, was such, as they have alotted to every house a particular signification, and so distinguished humane accidents throughout the twelve houses, as he that understands the Questions appertaining to each of them, shall not want sufficient grounds whereon to judge or give a rationall answer upon any contingent accident, and successe thereof. Of the first House and its Signification. The first house, which containeth all that part of Heaven from the li ne where the figure one standeth, until the figure two, where the second house beginneth. It hath signification of the life of man, of the stature, colour, compl exion, form and shape of him that propounds the Question, or is born; in Eclipses and great Conjunctions, and upon the Sun his annuall ingresse into Aries; it signifieth the common people, or gene rall State of that Kingdom where the Figure is erected. And as it is the first house, it represents the head and face of man, so that i f either Saturn, Mars or South Node be in this House, either at the time of the Question, or at the time of birth, you shall observe some blemish in the face, or in that  "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 50"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. member appropriate to the signe that then is upon the cusp of the house; a s if Aries be in the Ascendant, the mark, mole, or scarre is without faile in the head or face; and if few degrees of the signe ascend, the mark is in the upper part of the head; if the middle of the sign be on the cusp, the mole, mark or scar is in the middle of the face, or neer it; if the later degrees ascend, the face is blemished neer the chin, towards the neck: This I have found true in hundreds of examples. Of colors, it hath the White; that is, if a Planets be in this hous e that hath signification of white, the complexion of the Party is more pale, white and wan; or if you e nquire after the colour of the cloathe of any man, if his significator be in the first house, and in a sign corresponding, the parties apparell is white or gray, or somewhat neer that colour, s o also if the Question be for cattle, when their significators are found in this house, it denotes t hem to be of that colour or neer it: The house is Masculine. The Cosignificators of this house are Aries and Saturn; for as thi s house is the first house, so is Aries the first signe, and Saturn the first of the Planets, and t herefore when Saturn is but moderately well fortified, in this house, and in any benevolent aspect of Jupiter, Venus, Sun or Moon, it promiseth a good sober constitution of body, and usually long life: Me rcury doth also joy in this house, because it represents the Head, and he the Tongue, Fanc y and Memory: when he is well dignified and posited in this house, he produceth good Orators: i t is called the Ascendant, because when the Sun commeth to the cusp of this house, he ascends , or then ariseth, and is visible in our Horizon. Questions concerning the Second House. From this house is required judgment concerning the estate or fortune of him that asks the question, or his Wealth or Poverty, of all removeable Goods, Money lent, of Profit or game, losse or damage; in suits of Law, it signifies a mans Friends or Ass istants; in private Duels, the Querents second; in an Eclipse or Great Conjunction, the poverty or Wealth of the people; the  "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 51"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. Sun his entrance into Aries, it represents the Ammunition, Allies a nd Support the Common- wealth shall have; it imports their Magazines. It represents in man the neck, and hinder parts of it towards the shoulders, of colours, the gree n. So that if one make demand concerning any thing specified above in this hous e, you must look for signification from hence: Itâs a feminine house and Succedant, ca lled in some Latin Authors Anaphora. It hath Cosignificators Jupiter and Taurus; for is Jupiter be place d in this house, or be Lord hereof, itâs an argument of an estate or fortune; Sun and Mars are never well placed in this house, either of them shew dispersion of substance, according to the capacity and quality of him that is either born or asks the questions. The Third House. Hath signification of Brethren, Sisters, Cozens and Kindred, Neighbours, small Journeys, or inland-Journeys, oft removing from one place to another, Epistles, Letter s, Rumours, Messengers: It doth rule the Shoulders, Armes, Hands and Fingers. Of Colours, it governeth the Red and Yellow, or Croceall, or Sorrell c olour: It hath Cosignificators, of the Signe Gemini, of the Planet Mars; which i s one reason why Mars in this house, unlesse joyned with Saturn is not very unfortunate, it is a Cadent house, and is the joy of the Moon; for if she be posited therein, especially in a moveable sing , itâs an argument of much travell, trotting and trudging, or of being seldom quiet: The house is Masculine. The Fourth House. Giveth Judgment of Fathers in generall & ever of his Father that enquires, or that is born; of Lands, Houses, Tenements, Inheritances, Tillage of the earth, Treasur es hidden, the determination or end of any thing; Towns, Cities or Castles, besiege d or not besieged; all ancient Dwellings, Gardens, Fields, Pastures, Orchards; the quality and nature of the grounds one  "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 52"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. purchaseth, whether Vineyards, Cornfielfd, &c. whether the ground be Woody, Stony or barren. The Sign of the fourth denoteth the Town, the Lord thereof, the Governour: It ruleth the Brest, Lungs. Of Colours, the Red: Itâs Cosignificator is Cancer, and of Planets the Sun; we call it the Angle of the Earth, or Imum Coeli; it is feminine, and the North Angle: In N ativities or Questions, this fourth house represents Fathers, so doth the Sun by day and Saturn by night; yet if the Sun be herein placed, he is not ill, but rather shews the Father to be of a noble disposition, &c. The Fifth House. By this house we judge of Children, of Embassadours, of the state of a Woman with child, of Banquets, of Ale-houses, Tavernes, Playes, Messengers or Agents for Republick; of the wealth of the Father, the Ammunition of a Town beseiged; if the Woman with chil d shall bring forth male or female; of the health or sicknesse of his Son or Daughter that asks the Question. It ruleth the Stomack, Liver, Heart, Sides and Back, and is masculine. Of Colours, Black and White, or Honeyâcolour, and is a Succedant house; Itâs Cosignificators are Leo and Venus, who doth joy in this house, in regard itâs the house of P leasure, Delight and Merriment; itâs wholly unfortunate by Mars or Saturn, and they there in shew disobedient children and untoward. The Sixth House. It concerneth Men and Mid-servants, Gallislaves, Hogges, Sheep, Goats, Hares, Connies, all manner of lesser Cattle, and profit and losse got thereby; Sickness e, itâs quality and cause, principall humour offending, curable or not curable, whether the disease be short or long; Dayâ labourers, Tenants, Farmers, Shepherds, Hogheards, Neatherds, Warriners; and it signifieth Unkles, or the Fathers Brothers and Sisters. It ruleth the inferiour part of the Belly, and intestines even to  "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 53"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. The Arse: this house is a Feminine and Cadent house, unfortunate, as having no aspect to the Ascendant. Of Colours, black colour, Mars rejoyceth in this house, but his Cosignific ator is of the Signes Virgo, of Planets Mercury; we usually find that Mars and Venus in Conjunction in this house, are arguments of a good Physitian. The Seventh House. It giveth judgment of Marriage, and describes the person inquired afte r, whether it be Man or Woman, all manner of Love questions, our publique enemies; the Defendant in a Lawâsuit, in Warre the opposing party; all quarrels, Duels, Lawâsuits; in Astrol ogy the Artist himself; in Physick the Physitian; Theeves and Thefts; the person stealing, whet her Man or Woman, Wives, Sweetharts; their shape, description, condition, Nobly or ignobly born: in an Annuall ingresse, whether Warre or Peace may be expected: of Victory, who over-come s, and who worsted; Fugitives or runawayes; Banished and Outâlawedâmen. It hath cosignificator Libra and Moon, Saturn or Mars unfortunate herein, shew ill in Marr iage. Of Colour, a dark Blacke colour. It ruleth the Haunches, and the Navill to the Buttocks; and is called the Angle of the West : and is Masculine. The Eighth House. The Estate of Men deceased, Death, its quality and nature; the Wil ls, Legacies and Testaments of Men deceased; Dowry of the Wife, Portion of the Maid, whether much or little, easie to be btained or with difficulty. In Duels it represents the Adversaries Second; in Lawsuits the Defendants friends. What kinde of Death a Man shall dye., it signifies fear and anguish of Minde. Who shall enjoy or be heir to the Deceased. It rules the Privy-Parts. Of colours, the green and Black. Of Signes it hath Scorpio for Cosignificator, and Saturn, the Hemoroids , the Stone, Strangury, Poysons, and Bladder are ruled by this house; and is a succedant House, and Feminine.  "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 54"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. The Ninth House. By this House we give judgment of Voyages or long journies beyond Seas of Religiousmen, or Clergy of any kinde, whether Bishops or inferiour Ministers; Dreams , Visions, forraign Countries, of Books, Learning, Church Livings, or Benef ices, Advowsions; of t he kindred of ones Wife, & sic e contrario. Of colours it hath the Green and White. Of mans body it ruleth the Fundament, the Hippes and Thighes, Sagittari us and Jupiter are cosignificators of this House; for if Jupiter be herein placed, it naturally signifies a devout man in his Religion, or one modestly given; I have oft observed when the Dragons tayle, or Mars or Saturn have been infortunately placed in this House; the Querent hath ei ther been little better then a Atheist or a desperate Sectarist: the Sun rejoyceth to be in this House, which is Masculine, and Cadent. The Tenth House. Commonly it personateth Kings, Princes, Dukes, Earles, Judges, prime O fficers, Commanders in chief, whether in Armies or Towns; all sorts of Magistracy and Officers in Authority, Mothers, Honour, Preferment, Dignity, Office, Lawyers; the profession or Tra de any one useth; it signifies Kingdoms, Empires, Dukedoms, Countries. It hath of colours Red and White, and ruleth the knees and Hammes. Its called the Medium coeli, or Mid-heaven, and is Feminine. Its cosi gnificators are Capricorn and Mars; either Jupiter or the Sun doe much Fortunate this House when t hey are posited therein, Saturn or South Node usually deny Honor, as to persons of quality, or but litt le esteem in the world to a vulgar person, not much joy in his Profession, Trade or Mystery, is a Mechanick.  55"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. The Eleventh House. It doth naturally represent Friends and Friendship, Hope, Trust, Confidence, the Praise, or Dispraise of any one; the Fidelity or falsenesse of Friends; as to Kings it personates their Favourites, Councellours, Servants, their Associates or Allyes, their Money, Exchequer or Treasure; in Warre their Ammunition and Souldiery; it represents Courtiers, &c. in a Commonâ wealth governed by a few of the Nobles and Commons, it personates their assistance in Councell: as in London the tenth House represents the Lord Major; the eleventh the Common-councell; the Ascendant the generality of the Commoners of the said City. Of members it ruleth the Legs to the Ancles. Of colours, it ruleth the Saffron or Yel low. It hath of the Signs Aquarius, and Sun of the Planets, for cosignificat ors Jupiter doth especially rejoyce in this House; itâs a succedant House, and masculine, and in ve rtue is equivalent either to the seventh or fourth Houses. The Twelfth House. It hath signification of private Enemies, of Witches, great Catt le, as Horses, Oxen, Elephants, &c. Sorrow, Tribulation, Imprisonments, all manner of affliction, selfâundoing, & c. and of such men as maliciously undermine their neighbours, or inform secretly against them. It hath cosignificators Pisces and Venus; Saturn doth joy in that Hous e, For naturally Saturn is Author of mischief; and it ruleth in Mans body the Feet. In Colour it presents the Green. Its a Cadent House, Feminine, and vulgarly sometimes called Cataphor a, as all Cadent Houses may be. This is the true Character of the severall Houses, accor ding to the Ptolomeian Doctrine, and the experience my self have had for some yeers: I must confes se the Arabians have made severall other divisions of the Houses, but I could never in my practise finde any verity in them, wherefore I say nothing of them.

The Head of the Dragon is Masculine, of the nature of Jupiter and Venus , and of himself a Fortune; yet the Ancients doe say, that being in Conjunction with the good he is good, and in conjunction with the evil Planets they account him evil. The Tayle of the Dragon is Feminine by Nature, and clean contrary to the Head; for he is evil when joyned with good Planets, and good when in conjunction with the malignant P lanets. This is the constant opinion of all the Ancients, but upon what reason grounded I know not; I ever found the North Node equivalent to either of the Fortunes, and when joyned with the evil Planets to lessen their malevolent signification; when joyned with the good to increase the good promised by them: For the Tayle of the Dragon, I always in my pra ctise found when he was joyned with the evil Planets; their malice or the evil intended the reby was doubled and trebled, or extreamly augmented, &c. and when he chanced to be conjunction with any of the Fortunes who were significators in the question, though the matter by the principal significator was fairely promised, and likely to be perfected in a smal time; yet did there ever fal out many rubs and disturbances, much wrangling and great controversie, that the businesse was many times given over for desperate ere a perfect conclusion could be had; and unlesse the principal significators were Angular and wel fortified with essential dignities, many t imes unexpectedly the whole matter came to nothing.

Another brief Description of the Shapes and formes of the Planets. SATURN - Signifieth one of a swart colour, palish like lead, or of a black earthly brown; one of rough shin, thick and very hairy on the body, not great eyes, many times hi s complexion is betwixt black and yellow, or as if he had a spice of the black or ye llow Jaundies: he is lean, crooked, or beetleâbrowed, a thin whay Beard, great lips, like the black-M oores; he lookes to the ground, is slow in motion, either is bow-leged, or hits one leg or knee against another; most part a stinking breath, seldom free from a Cough: {this is where he is peregrine or unfortunate.} he is crafty for his own ends, seducing people to his opinion, full of reveng e and malice, little caring for the Church or Religion; its a foule nasty, slovenly knave, or a whore; a great eater. or one of a large stomack, a brawling fellow, big great shoulders, covetous, and yet seldom ri ch, &c. JUPITER - We must describe Jupiter and a Jovialist, to be one of a comely stature, full faced, full eyed, a sanguine complexion, or mixed with white and red, a large spac e betwixt his eyebrowes, usually his Beard is of a flaxen or sandy-flaxen colour: sometim es also when Jupiter is combust very sad or black, his hair thick, his eyes not black, his teeth well set, good broad teeth, but usually for some mark of difference in the two fore-teeth, either by their standing awry, or some blacknesse or impersection in them; his hair gently curls (if he be in a fiery Sign.) A man well spoken, religious, or at least a good morall honest man; a person comely and somewhat fat (if Jupiter be in moyst Signs) fleshy; if in Aery Signs, bigge and s trong; if in earthly Signs, a man usually well descended; but if he be significator, of an ordinary clow n, as sometimes he may be, then is he of more humanity then usually in such kinde of men. MARS - A Martiall Man, is many times full faced with a li vely high colour like Sunâburnt, or like raw tannedâLeather, a fierce  84"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. countenance, his eyes being sparkling or sharp and darting, and a yellow c olour; his hair both of head and beard being reddish (but herein you must vary according to the Sig n, in fiery signs and aery where Mars fals to be with fixed stars of his own nature, there he shews a deep sandy red colour, but in watery signs, being with fixed Starres of his own natur e, he is of a flaxenish or whitish bright hair; if in earthly Signs, the hair is like a sa d brown, or of a sad Chestnut colour.) He hath a marke or scar in his face, is broadâshouldered, a sturdy str ong body, being bold and proud, given to mocke, scorn, quarrell, drink, game, and wench: which you may eas ily know by the Sign he is in; if in the house of Venus he wencheth, if he Mercury he steals, but if he be in his own house he quarrels, in Saturnes, is dogged; in the Sunnes, is lordly; in the Moones, is a drunkard. SUN - The Sun dete generally denote one of an obscure white colour mix ed with red; a round face, and short chin, a fair stature, and one of comely body; his colour s ometimes betwixt yellow and black, but for the mod parts more sanguin then otherwayes: a bold man a nd resolute, his hair curling; he hath a white and tender skin, one desirous of praise, fame a nd estimation amongst men; he hath a deer voyce and great head, his teeth somewhat distort or obliquely set, of slow speech but of a composed judgment; using outwardly a great decorum in his actions, but privately he is lascivious and inclinable to many vices. VENUS - Who is signified by Venus, whether Man or Woman, hath a goodly and fair round visage, a full eye, usually we say goggle-eyed, red ruddy lips, the neither more thick or bigger then the upper, the eyeâlids black, however lovely and gracefull, the hair of lovely colour (but most part according to the Sign as before repeated) in some its c ole-black, in others a light brown, a soft smooth hair, and the body extream well shaped, ever rather inclining to shortnesse than talnesse. MERCURY - We describe Mercury, to be a man neither white or black  85"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. but betwixt both, of a sad brown or dark yellowish colour, long visaged, high-f orehead, black or gray eyes, a thin long sharp nose, a thin spare beard (many times non e at all) of an aburn sad colour next to black, slender of body, smal legs, a pratling busie fell ow, and in walking he goes nimbly, and aiwayes would be thought to be ful of action. MOON â She by reason of her swiftnesse, varieth her shape very oft, but in the general, she personates one having a round visage and ful faced, in whose complexion you ma y perceive a mixture of white and red, but palenesse overcomes; if she be in fier y signs, the Man or Woman speeks hastily; in watery signs, he or she hath some freckles in his or her face, or is blub cheecked; no very handsome body, but a mudling creature, and unlesse very wel dignified, she ever signifies an ordinary vulgar person. The colours of the Planets and Signs.

CHAP. XVI. Of the twelve Signs of the Zodiack, and their manifold Divisions. The whole Zodiack is divided into twelve equal parts, which we call Si gns, and give them the names of living Creatures, either 86"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. for their properties they hold with living Creatures, or by reason of the situation of the S tarres in those places which somewhat resemble that effigies and similitude of living cr eatures: Their names and characters follow. 1 2 3 4 5 6 ARIES TAURUS GEMINI CANCER LEO VIRGO 7 8  9 10 11 12 LIBRA SCORPIO SAGITTARIUS CAPRICORN AQUARIUS PISCES Every one of these Signs contains thirty degrees or parts in longit ude: Hence it comes to passe that the whole Zodiack doth contain 360 degrees, every degree containes 60 m inutes, which we also call scruples, every minute containes 60 seconds, and fo further if you please, &c. but in Astrology we onely make use of degrees, and minutes and second. These Signs are again divided many wayes; as first, into four quadrants or quarters, answering to the four quarters of the year. The Vernal or Spring quarter, is sa nguine, Hot and Moyst, and containes the first three Signs, viz. Aries, Taurus, Gemini. The Es tival or Summer quarter is Hot, Dry and Cholerick, and containes the fourth, fifth and sixth Signs, viz. Cancer, Leo, Virgo. The Autumnal or Harvest quarter is Cold, Dry and Melancholly, and contai nes the seventh, eighth and ninth Signs, viz. Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius. The Hyemnal, Br umal or Winter quarter is Cold, Moyst and Phiegmatique, and containes the tenth, eleventh and twel fth Signs, viz. Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces. They are again divided in division of the Elements, for some Signs in nature are Fiery, Hot and Dry, viz. Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, and these three Signs constitute the Fiery Tr iplicity. Others are Dry, Cold and Earthly, viz. Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, and make the Earthly Triplicity. Others are Aiery, Hot and Moyst, viz. Gemini, Libra, Aquarius, which m ake the Aiery Triplicity. Others are Watry, Cold and Moyst, viz. Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces, and ar e called the Watry Triplicity. 87 "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. Again, some Signs are Masculine, Diurnal, and therefore Hot, as Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, Aquarius. Some are Femini ne, Nocturnal, therefore Cold, viz. Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, Pisces. The use whereof is this, That if you have a Masculine Planet in a Masculine Sign, it imports him or her more manly; and so if a Masculine Planet be in a Feminine Sign, the man or woman is lesse couragious, &c. Some Signs again are called Boreal, Septentrional or Northern, beca use they decline from the Equinoctial Northward, and these are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Vi rgo; and these six Signs contain half the Zodiack, or the first semiâcircle thereof. Some Signes are called Austral, Meridional or Southern, for that the y decline Southward from the Equinoctial, and these are Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisce s. [MOVEABLE.] The Signs again are divided into Moveable, Fixed and Comm on, Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn are called moveable and Cardinal: moveable, because w hen the Sun enters into Aries and Libra, the Weather and Season of the Year quickly varies and changes; they are called Cardinal, because when the Sun enters into any of those Signs from that time we denominate the Quarters of the yeer. For from the Sun entering into Aries and Libra the Equinoctial or the Spring and Autumne arise; from the Sun his entrance into Cancer and Capricorn ariseth the Solstice of Summer and W inter. [FIXED SIGNS.] The Fixed Signs doe in order follow the Equinoctial and Tropicks; and they are called fixed, for that when Sun enters into them, the season of the ye er is fixed, and we doe more evidently perceive either Heat or Cold, Moysture or Drinesse. The f ixed Signes are these, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquari us. [COMMON.] Signes are constitutes between moveable and fixed, and re tain a property or nature, pertaking both with the preceding and consequent Sign: and they are Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces. They are called Byâcorporeal or double bodied, because they represent tw o Bodies: as Gemini two Twinnes, Pisces two Fishes. 88 "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. The right knowledge of these in Astrology is much, and you must understand it thus; In the Question or Figure of Heaven, if the Planet who is Lord of the Ascenda nt be in a moveable Sign, and the Sign ascending be also one, it denotes the person to be unstable, and of no resolution, easily mutable, perverted, a wavering unconstant man. Let us admit the Ascendant to be fixed, and the Lord of that Sign als o in a fixed Sign, you may judge the party to be of firm resolution, no changling; or as we say, one that will stand to maintaine what he hath said or done, be it good or ill. If the Sign ascending be common, and the Lord of that Sign also in a Com mon Sign, you may judge the man or woman to be neither very wilful or easily variable but between both. The Signs also are divided into; * Bestail or Quadrupediall, in viz. Aries, Taurus, Leo, Sagittarius, C apricorn; these have representation of Four-footed Creatures. * Fruitful or prolifical, viz. Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces. * Barren Signs, Gemini, Leo, Virgo. * Manly or humane, curteous Signs, Gemini, Virgo, Libra, Aquarius. * Ferall Signs are Leo and last part of Sagittarius. * Mute Signs or of slow Voice, Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces; the more if Mercury be in any of them, in Conjunction, Square, or Opposition of Saturn. The use hereof is, that if your Significator or Lord of the Ascendant be in Aries, Taurus, Leo, Sagittarius, Capricorn, thereâs in the condition of that party somethi ng of the nature of that Beast which represents that Sign he is in; as if he be in Aries, the m an is rash, hardy and lascivious; if in Taurus, steadfast and resolved, and somewhat of a muddy condition, vitiate d, with some private imperfection, &c. and so of the rest. Let us admit, one propounds his Question, if he shall have children, then if t he Moon and principall Significator be in Prolificall Signs, and strong, thereâ s no question but he shall the same doe, if the Question concern Barrennesse, viz, if the Ascendant or fifth house be of those Signs we call barren Signs, it generally represents few or no children. In Questions, if Gemini, Virgo, Libra or Aquarius ascend, or the Lord of the Ascendant be in humane Signs, then we may judge the  89 "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. man to be of civill carriage, very affable and easie to be spoken withall, &c. [ANTISCION OF THE PLANETS.] Besides these and many other divi sions of the Signs, I thought good to be plain in setting down the Antiscions of the Planets. [PTOL. APHO. STELLAE IRRATIO.] The Antiscion Signs are those, which are of the same vertue and are equally distant from the first degree of the two T ropick Signs, Cancer, Capricorn, and in which degrees whilest the Sun is, the dayes and nights are of equall length; by example it will be plain; when the Sun is in the tenth degree of Taurus, he is a s far distant from the first degree of Cancer as when in the twentieth degree of Leo; therefor e when the Sun is in the tenth of Taurus, he hath his Antiscion to the twentieth of Leo; that is, he g iveth vertue or influence to any Star or Planet that at that time either is in the same degree by Conjunction, or casteth any Aspect unto it. But that you may more fully and perfectly know where your Antiscion f als in degrees and minutes, behold this following Table. A generall Table of Antiscions in Signs. GEMINI CANCER LEO TAURUS VIRGO ARIES LIBRA PISCES SCORPIO AQUARIUS SAGITTARIUS CAPRICORN Any Planet in Gemini sends his Antiscion into Cancer, or being in Leo into Taurus. If you would know the exact degrees and minutes, you must work as followeth. Let us suppose Saturn in twenty degrees and thirty five minutes of L eo, I would know in what part of the Zodiack he hath his Antiscion. Over against Leo I find Taurus, so then I conclude his Antiscion is in Taurus. To know the degree and minutes the Planet is in, subtract that from 30 degrees, and the remainder tels you both the degree and minute 90"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. As Saturn being in 20 degrees and 35 minutes of Leo, I subtracted from 30â 0â 20â 35â 9â 25â Subtracted. Here I subtract 25 min. from one whole degr. or from 60 min. which I borrow , and there rests 25 min. one degr. I borrowed, taken from 10, and there rest 9 degr. one that I bor rowed and two are three, taken from three, then nothing remains, so then I find my Antisci on of Saturn fals to be in 9 degr. & 25 min. of Taurus, which Signs as you see is over against Le o; but this Table expresseth the work more quickly. The Antiscion in Degrees. Antiscion of the Planets in Minutes. 1 29 1 59 16 44 2 28 2 58 17 43 3 27 3 57 18 42 4 26 4 56 19 41 5 25 5 55 20 40 6 24 6 54 21 39 7 23 7 53 22 38 8 22 8 52 23 37 9 in 21 9 in 51 24 in 36 10 20 10 50 25 35 11 19 11 49 26 34 12 18 12 48 27 33 13 17 13 47 28 32 14 16 14 46 29 31 15 15 15 45 30 30 The use is easie if you enter with the whole degrees of your Pla net, the two first columns serve you, as Mars, supposed to be 14 degr. of a Sign, look for 14 in the first colum n, over against it is 16, to that degree he sends his Antiscion. If you have minutes, enter the four last columns; as if you enter wi th 17 mm., in the first column, over against it you find 43. or first look the Sign where the Antiscion fals, then suctract the number of degr. and minutes the Planet is in, from 30, what remaines is the degree and minute where the Antiscion is; and as 91"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. there are Antiscions, which of the good Planets we think are equall t o a Sextile , Trine; so are there Contrantiscions, which we find to be of the nature of a Square of Opposition: and to know where it is, you doe more then observe in what Sign and degree the Anti scion is, in the Sign and degree opposite to that place the Contrantiscion: as in the former e xamples, the Antiscion of Saturn is in nine degr. and 25 min. of Taurus, his Contrantiscion must then be in 9 degr. and 25 min. of Scorpio. There are also many other divisions of the Signs: as into Signs c ommanding, viz. ARIES TAURUS GEMINI CANCER LEO VIRGO And Signs obeying; LIBRA SCORPIO SAGITTARIUS CAPRICORN AQUARIUS PISCES. An into Signs of right or long ascention, viz. CANCER LEO VIRGO LIBRA AQUARIUS SAGITTARIUS. An into Signs of shorter oblique ascention, viz. CAPRICORN AQUAIRIUS PISCES ARIES TAURUS GEMINI. The Signs of long ascention continue two hours and more in the Ascendant: a nd Signs of short ascentions, doe arise in little more then an houre, and some in lesse, as you may experiment by the table of Houses: I would like to know how many houres Sign continues in Ascendant Horizon? In the first column of the Table of Houses, I look for the Sign Leo, under the title of the first House, and in the fourth line, I finde S Leo 21, viz, no degree, 21 min. of Leo. Over against that number on the left hand, under the title of houses and m in. or time from noon, I finde 00. 18 min. or no houres, 18 min. I then continue with my sign Leo in the sa me column until I find 29.40. by which I perceive that the sign Leo is removed out of the Ascendant; I seek under the title of houres and minutes from noon over against the said 29.40 of Leo: on the left hand, what houres and min. stand there. I find the number of 3.h. 6.m. I subtract m y former number of 00. 18 min. from 3 hours and 6 min. 3.h. 6.m. 00 18 2 48. there remaines two houres and 48 min. of an houre, which is all the space of time that Leo continues in the Ascendant, and in this regard it is called a sign of long as centions. You shall see the difference now in a sign of short Ascentions. 92"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. I would know how long the sign of Aquarius continues in the Ascendant. See in the ninth column, and under the title of the first house: in the third line I finde 00 aquarius 57, viz. 0 degree, 57 min. of aquarius, over against it under houres and min. I find 16, 4 m in. in the tenth line under the first house I find 29.28. against it on the left hand 17.8 viz. 17 houres, 8 min. I subtract my former houres and min. from the latter 17 8 16 4 1 4. the difference is one houre and 4 min. and so long time the sign of Aquari us rests in the Ascendant: without exact knowledge hereof, one cannot attain to any exac tnesse in naturall Magick, viz. in gathering Hearbs, or perfecting many other rarities.

CHAP. XVII. Teaching what use may be made of the former Discourse of the twelve Signs. If one demand of the Artist, of what condition, quality or stature the pe rson quesited, or enquired of is, then observe the Sign of that house whereby he is signifi ed, the sign wherein the Lord of that house is, and wherein the Moon is, mix one with another, and by t he greater testimonies judge; for if the Sign be humane, aerial, that ascends or descends, and the Lord of that Sign or the Moon in any Sign of the same triplicity or nature, you may judge the Body to be handsome, and the conditions of the party to be sociable, or he very courteous, &c. If the Quere be concerning a Disease, and Aries be either on the c usp of the Ascendant, or descending in the sixt, you may judge he hath something in his Disease of the nature of Aries, but what it is, you must know by the concurrence of the other significators. If a Country man or Citizen hath lost or misseth and Cattle, or any materiall thing in his house, let him observe in what Sign the Significator of the thing is in; if in Aries, and it be a Beast strayed, or the like, let him see what manner of places that Sig n directs unto, and let him repair thither to search, considering the quarter of the heaven the Sign signi fies: if it be an unmoveable piece of Goods, that without man or woman cannot be removed, then let him look into such parts of his house, or about his house as Aries signifies. If one aske concerning Travell, whether such a Country, City or Kingdom will be healthfull or prosperous unto him, yea or no; see in the Figure in what Sign the Lord of the Ascendant is in, if the significator be fortunate in Aries, or if Jupiter or Venus be t herein, he may safely travell or sojourn in such Cities or Countries as the Sign of Aries represents , which you may easily discern in the abovenamed Catalogue: Those countries subject to the Sign wherei n the Infortunes are posited, unlesse themselves  100"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. be significators, are even unfortunate: where remember, that a Gent leman enquires usually, if he shall have his health and live jocundly in such or such a Country or City; the merchant by wholly aimes at Trade, and the encrease of his Stock, therefore in the Me rchants Figure you must consider the Country or City subject to the Sign of the second house, or w here the Part of Fortune is, or Lord of the second is, and which is most fortified, and thither let him Trade.  CHAP. XVIII. Of the Essentiall Dignities of the Planets. The exact way of judicature in Astrology is, first, by being perf ect in the nature of the Planets and Signs. Secondly, by knowing the strength, fortitude or debility of the Planets, S ignificators, and a well poysing of them and their aspects and severall mixtures, in your judgment. Thirdly, by rightly applying the influence of the positure of Heaven er ected, and the Planets aspects to one another at the time of the Question, according to natura ll (and not enforced) maximes of Art; for by how much you endeavour to strain a judgment beyond nature, by so much the more you augment your Errour. A Planet is then said to be really strong when he hath many Essent ial dignities, which are known, by his being either in his House, Exaltation, Triplicity, Terme or Face, at time of the erecting the Figure. As Example: [ESSENTIAL DIGNITY, HOUSE.] In an scheam of Heaven, if you find a Planet in any of those Signs we call his house or houses, he is then essentially strong, and we allow for that five dignities; as Saturn in Capricorn, Jupiter in Sagittarius, &c. In Judgment, when a Planet or Significator is in his own house, it repr esents a man in such a condition, as that he is Lord of his own house, estate and fortune; or a ma n wanting very little of the Goods of this world, or it tels you the man is in a very happy sta te or condition: this will be true, unlesse the 101"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. significator be retrograde, or combust, or afflicted by any other malevolent Planet or aspect. [EXALTATION.] If he be in that Sign wherein he is exalted, you m ay allow him four dignities essentiall, whether he be neer the very degree of his exaltation, yea or not; as Mars in Capricorn or Jupiter in Cancer. If the Significator be in his exaltation, and no wayes impedited, but Angular; it presents a person of haughty condition arrogant, aaffirming more unto him then his due; for i tâs observed, the Planets in some part of the Zodiack doe more evidently declare their effects then in others; and I conceive this to be in those Signs and degrees where fixed Starres of the same nature with the Planet, are more in number, and neerer the Ecliptick. [TRIPLICITY.] If he be in any of those Signs which are alotted hi m for Triplicity, he hath allowed him three dignities; but herein you must be cautious; as for example: In a Question, Nativity, or the like, if you find the Sun in Aries, and the Question, or Nativity, or Scheam erected be by night, and you would examine the Sun his fortitudes, he shall have four dignities for being in his exaltation, which continues through the Sign; but shall not be allowed any dignity, as being in his triplicity; for by night the Sun ruleth not t he fiery Triplicity, but Jupiter; who had he been in place of the Sun, and by night, must have had allowed him thr ee dignities: and this doe generally in all the Planets, Mars excepted, who night and day ruleth the watry Triplicity. A Planets in his triplicity, shews a man modestly indued with the Goods and Fortune of this world, one prettily descended, and the condition of his life at present ti me of the Question, to be good; but not so, as if in either of the two former dignities. [TERMS.] If any Planet be in those degrees we assign for his T erms, we allow him two dignities; as whether day or night, if Jupiter be in one, two, three or four, &c. deg rees of Aries, he is then in his oen Terms, and must have two dignities therefore, and so Venus in any of the first eight degrees of Taurus, &c. A Planet fortified, onely as being in his own Terms, rather shews a man more of the corporature and temper of the Planet, then any  "},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 102"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. extraordinary abundance in fortune, or of eminency in the Commenwealth. [FACE.] If any Planet be in his Decanate, Decurie or Face, as Mars in the first ten degrees of Aries, or in Mercury in the first ten degrees of Ta urus, he is then allowed one essentiall dignity; for being in his own Decanate or Face, cannot then be called Pere grin. A Planet having little or no dignity, but by being in his Decanate or Face, is almost like a man ready to be turned out of doors, having much adoe to maintaine himself i n credit and reputation: and in Genealogies it represents a Family at the la st gasp, even as good as quite decayed, barely able to support it self. The Planets may be strong another manner of way, viz. Accidentally; as when Direct, swift in Motion, Angular, in Trine or Sextile aspect with Jupiter or Venus, &c. or in Conjuction with certain notable fixed Stars, as shall hereafter be related; Here followeth a Table of Essentiall Dignities, by which onely casting your eye t hereon, you may perceive that essential dignity or imbeciltiy any Planet hath. There hath been much difference between Arabians, Greeks and Indians conc erning the Essential Dignities of the Planets; I mean how to dispose the se verall degrees of the Sign fitly to every Planet; after many Ages had passed, and until the time of Ptolorney, the Astrologians were not wel resolved hereof; but since Potolemy his t ime, the Grecians unanimously followed the method he left, and which ever since the other Chr istians of Europe to this day retain as most rationall; but the Moores of Barba ry at present and those Astrologians of their Nation who lived in Spain doe so somewhat at this day vary from us; however I present thee with a Table according to Ptolomey.  103"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ A TABLE OF THE ESSENTIAL DIGNITIES OF THE PLANETS A CCORDING TO PTOLOMY SIG NS HOUSES OF THE PLANETS EXALTA TION.

See Figure 4. The Use of the Table. Every Planet hath two signs for his House, except Sol and Luna, they but one apiece: Saturn hath Capricorn and Aquarius; Jupiter Sagittarius and Pisces; Mars- Ar ies, Scorpio; Sunâ Leo; Venusâ Taurus, Libra; Mercury- Gemini, Virgo; Moon- Cancer. The one of these Houses is called Diurnall, noted in the second Column by the Letter D. The other i s Nocturnall, noted by the Letter N. In these Signs the Planets have their Exaltations , which the third Column points out; as the Sun in 19 Aries; Moon in 3 Taurus, North Node in 3 degr. Gemini, &c. are exalted. These twelve Signs are divided into Four Triplicities: The fourth Column tels you which Planet or Planets both night and day govern each Triplicity: As over against Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, you find Sun, Jupiter, viz. Sun governeth by day in that tripli city, and Jupiter by night: Over against Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, you find Venus and Moon; viz, t hat Venus hath domination by day, and Moon by night in that Triplicity: Over against Ge mini, Libra, Aquarius, you find Saturn, Mercury; which rule as aforesaid: Over against Ca ncer, Scorpio, Pisces, you find Mars, who, according to Ptolomey and Naibod, ruleth onely that Triplicity both day and night.

Over against Aries, in the tenth, rlrvrnth and twelfth columns, you find Mars 10. Sun 20. Venus 30. viz, the first 10 degrees of Aries are the Face of Mars; fr om ten to twenty the Face of Sun; from twenty to thirty the Face of Venus, &c. In the thirteenth column, over against Aries, you find Venus Detrirnent; viz. Venus being in Aries, is in a Sign opposite to one of her own Houses, and so is said to be in her Detriment. In the fourteenth column, over against Aries, you find Saturn, over his head Fall; that is, Saturn when he is in Aries is opposite to Libra his Exaltation, and so is I nfortunate, &c. Though these things are expressed in the nature of the Planets already, yet t his Table makes it appear more evidently to the eye. CHAP. XIX. Of Several Terms, Aspects, words of Art, Accidents, and other materiall things happening amongst he Planets; with other necessary Rules to be well known and understood before any Judgment can be given upon a Question. The most forcible or strongest Rayes, Configurations or Aspects, ar e onely these (nominated before) the Sextil, Quadrate, Trine, Opposition, we use to call the C onjunction, an Aspect, but very improperly. A Sextile aspect is the distance of one Planet from another by t he sixt part of the Zodiack or Circle; for six times sixty degr. doe make 360. degr. this aspect you shall find called sometimes a Sexangular aspect, or an Hexagon. A Quadrate aspect, or Quadranglar, or Tetragonall, is the distance of two Points, or two Planets by a fourth part of the Circle, for four times ninety doe contain three hundred and sixty degre es.  "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 105"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. The Trine aspect consists of 120 degrees, or by a third part of the C ircle, for three times an humdred and twenty degrees make the whole Circle, or 360 degrees: Itâ s called a Triangular aspect, or Trigonall, and if you find sometimes the word Trigonocraton, i t is as much as a Planet ruling or having domination in such a Triplicity or Trygon; for three S igns make one Trygon or Triplicity. An Opposition or Diametrall Radiation is, when two Planets are equal ly distant 180 degrees, or half the Circle from each other. A Conjunction, Coition, Synod or Congresse (for some use all these words) is, when two Planets are in one and the same degree and minute of a Sign: Other new Aspe cts I have formerly mentioned in the beginning of this Discourse. You must understand amongst the se Aspects, the Quadrate Aspect is a sign of imperfect emnity; and that the Oppos ition is an aspect or argument of perfect hatred; which is to be understood thus: A Question is propounded, Whe ther two persons at variance may be reconciled? Admit I find the two Signif icators representing the two Adversaries, in Square aspect; I may then judge because the aspect is of imperfect hatred, that the matter is not yet so far gone, but there may be hopes of reconcilia tion betwixt them, the other Significators or Planets a little helping. But if I find the ma in significators in opposition, itâs then in nature impossible to expect a peace betwixt them till the sui t is ended, if it be a suit of Law; untill they have fought, if it be a Challenge. The Sextile and Trine aspects are arguments of Love, Unity and Fr iendship; but the Trine is more forcible, (viz.) if the two Significators are in Sextile or Tr ine, no doubt but peace may be easily concluded. Conjunctions are good or bad, as the Planets in Conjunction are friends or e nemies to one another. There is also a Partill or Platick aspect: Partill aspect is when two Planets are exactly so many degrees from each other as make a perfect aspect: as if Mer cury be in nine degrees of Aries, and Jupiter in nine degrees of Leo, this is a Partill Trine aspect: So Sun in one degree of Taurus, and Moon in one degree of Cancer, make a Partill Sextile, and this is a strong sign or argument for performance of anything, or that the matter  "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 106"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. is neer hand concluded when the aspect is so partill, and signifies good; and itâs as much a sign of present evill when mischief is threatened. A Platick Aspect is that which admits of the Orbs or Rayes of two Planets that signifie any matter: As if Venus be in the tenth degree of Taurus, and Satur n in eighteen degrees of Virgo, here Venus hath a Platick Trine, or is in a Platick Tri ne of Saturn, because she is within the Moity of both their Orbs; for the Moity of Saturn his Rayes or Orbs is five, and of Venus 4, and the distance betwixt them and their perfect aspect is eight degrees; and here I will again insert the Table of the quality of their O rbs, although I have in the Planets severall discriptions mentioned them; they stand that as I have found by the best Authors and my own Experience. d. m. d. m. SATURN 10 0 according to others 9 0 JUPITER 12 0 as some have wrote 9 0 MARS 7 30 all consent 7 0 SUN 17 0 most say 15 0 VENUS 8 0 many write but 7 0 MERCURY 7 0 all consent onely 7 0 MOON 12 30 generally but 12 0 I sometimes use the one, and sometimes the other, as my Memory bes t Remembereth them, and this without error. [APPLICATION.] Application of Planets is three severall wayes: First, when a Planet of more swift motion applies to one more slow and ponderous, they being both direct; as Mars in 10 degrees of Aries, Mercury 5: here Mercury applies to Conjunction of Mars. Secondly, when both Planets are retrograde, as Mercury in 10 degrees of Aries, and Mars in 9 of Aries; Mercury being not direct untill he hath made Conjunction with Mars; this is an ill Application and an argument either suddenly perfecting, or breaki ng off the business, according as the two Planets have signification. Thirdly, when a Planet is direct, and in fewer degrees, and a retr ograde Planet being in more degrees of the Sign, as Mars being direct in 15 Aries; and M ercury retrograde in 17 Aries; this is an ill application, and in the Air shews great c hange; in a Question on sudden alteration: but more particularly I expresse Application as followeth. 107"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ * # $ \" * # $ \" * # $ \" DEXTER K J I DEXTER C B A DEXTER G F E A G E K I C SINISTER C D E SINISTER G H I SINISTER K L A  DEXTER L K J DEXTER D C B DEXTER H G F B H F L J D SINISTER D E F SINISTER H I J SINISTER L A B  DEXTER A L K DEXTER E D C DEXTER I H G C I G A K E SINISTER E F G SINISTER I J K SINISTER A B C  DEXTER B A L DEXTER F E D DEXTER J I H D J H B L F SINISTER F G H SINISTER J K L SINISTER B C D A TABLE OF THE ASPECTS OF THE SIGNES AMONGST ONE ANOTHER."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie.

[SEPERATION.] Seperation, it is, in the first place, when two Pl anets are departed but six minutes distance from each other, as let Saturn be in 10 degr. a nd 25 min. of Aries and Jupiter in 10 degr. and 25 min. of Aries: now in these degrees and minut es they are in perfect Conjunction; but when Jupiter shall get into 10 degr. and 31 or 32 minut es of Aries, he shall be said to be seperating from Saturn; yet because Saturn hath 9 degr. allowed him for his rayes, and Jupiter hath also the same number all owed him, Jupiter cannot be said to be totally seperated or cleer from the rayes of Saturn, untill he hath got 9. degrees distant from him, for the half of Jupiter his orbe is 4 deg r. 30 min. and the half of Saturn his orbe is 4 degr. 30 min. added together they make 9. whole degr ees; for every Planet that applies is allowed half his own orbs and half the orbs of that Planet from whom he seperates: As if Sun and Moon be in any aspect, the Moon sha ll then be seperated from the Sun, when she is fully distant from the Sun 7.degr. a nd 30.min. viz, half the orbs of the Sun, and 6.degr. the moity of her own orbs; in all 13 deg r. and 30 mi flutes. The exact knowledge hereof is various and excellent: For admit two Planets significators in Marriage at the time of the question, are lately seperated but a few minutes; I would then judge there had been a few days before great probability of eff ecting the Marriage, but now it hung in suspence, and there seemed some dislike or rupture in it ; and as the significators doe seperate, so will the matter and affection of the parties more alienate and vary, and according to the number of degrees that the swifter Planet wanteth ere he can be wholly seperated from the more ponderous, so will it be so many wee ks, dayes, moneths or yeers ere the two Lovers will wholly desist or see t he matter quite broke off: The two Significators in moveable Signs, Angular and swift in motion, doth hasten the times; in common signs, the time will be more long; in fixed, a l onger space of time will be required. [PROHIBITION.] Prohibition is when two Planets that signifie the effecting or bringing to conclusion any thing demanded, are applying to an Aspect; and before they can come to a true Aspect, another Planet interposeth either his body or aspect , to that thereby the matter propounded is hindered and retarded; this is  110"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. called Prohibition. For example, Mars is in 7. degr. of Aries, and Saturn is in t he 12. Mars signifies the effecting my business when he comes to the body of Sa turn, who promises the conclusion, the Sun is at the same time in 6. degr. of Aries. Now in regard that the Sun is swifter in motion then Mars, he will overtake Mars, and come to Conjunction with Saturn before Mars, whereby whatever Mars or Saturn did formerly s ignifie, is now prohibited by the Sun his first impediting Mars and then Saturn, before t hey can come to a true Conjunction. This manner of prohibition is called a Conjunctionall or Bodily prohibition; and you must know that the combustion of any Planet is the grea test misfortune that can be. [2.] The second manner of Prohibition is by Aspect, either Sextile, Squa re, Trifle , Opposition, viz. when two Planets are going to Conjunction; as Mars in 7 de gr. of Aries, Saturn in 15 of Aries; let us admit the Sun in 5. degr. of Gemini; he then being more s wift than Mars in his diurnall motion, doth quickly overtake and passe by the Sex tile dexter of Mars ( and comes before Mars can come to Conjunction) to a Sextile dexter of Saturn: This is called Prohibition by Aspect, in the same nature judg e if the Aspect be Square, Trine, Opposition. [REFRENATION.] Thereâs another manner of Prohibition; by some more properly called Refrenation; as thus, Saturn in 12 degr. of Aries, Mars in 7 degr. here Mars hastens to a Conjunction of Saturn, but before he comes to the tenth or eleventh degree of Aries he becomes Retrograde, and by that meanes refrains to come to a Conjunct ion of Saturn, who still moves forward in the Sign, nothing signifies by the former Conjunction will ever be effected. [TRANSLATION.] Translation of light and nature is, when a light P lanet seperates from a more weighty one, and presently joyns to another more heavy; and its in this manner, Let Saturn be in 20. degr. of Aries: Mars in 15 of Aries, and Mercury in 16 of Aries; here Mercury being a swift Planet seperates from Mars, and transla tes the vertue of Mars unto Saturn. Its done also as well by any Aspect as by Conjunction. And the m eaning hereof in judgment, is no more then thus; That if the matter or thing were prom ised by Saturn, then such a man as is signified by Mercury shall procure all the ass istance a Mars man can doe unto Saturn, whereby the businesse may be the better effected; in Ma rriages, Lawsuits, and indeed in all vulgar questions Translation, is of great use, and ought well to be considered.  111"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. [RECEPTION.] Reception is when two Planets that are significa tors in any Question or matter, are in each others dignity; as Sun in Aries, and Mars in Leo; here is reception of these two Planets by Houses; and certainly this is the strongest and best of all receptions. It may be by Triplicity, term or face, or any essentiall digni ty; as Venus in Aries, and Sun in Taurus; here is reception by triplicity, if the Question or Nat ivity by day: so Venus in the 24 of Aries, and Mars in the 16 of Gemini; here is reception by t erm, Mars being in the terms of Venus, and she in his terms. The use of this is much; so many times when as the effecting of the matter is denyed by the Aspects, or when the significators have no aspect to each other, or when it seems very doubtfull what its promised by Square or Opposition of the significators, yet if mutuall Reception happen betwixt the principall significators, the thing is br ought to passe, and that without any great trouble, and suddenly to the content of both parties. [PEREGRINE.] A Planet is then said to be Peregrine, when he is in the degrees of any Sign wherein he hath no essentiall dignity: As Saturn in the tenth degree of Aries, that Sign being not his House , Exaltation, or of his Triplicity, or he having in that degree either Term or Faces, he is then said to be Peregrine; had he been in 27, 28 &c. of Aries, he could not be termed Pere grine, because then he is in his own Term. So the Sun in any part of Cancer is Peregrine, having no manner of dignity in that Sign. This is very much materiall in all Questions, to know the Peregri ne Planet, especially in questions of Theft; for ever almost the significator of the Theef is known by the Peregrine Planet posited in an Angle, or the second House. [VOID OF COURSE.] A Planet is void of course, when he is seperat ed from a Planet, nor doth forthwith, during his being in that Sign, apply to any other: This i s most usually in the Moon; in judgments doe you carefully observe whether she be void of c ourse yea or no; you shall seldom see a businesse goe handsomely forward when she is so. [FRUSTRATION.] Frustration is, when a swift Planet would corporal ly joyn with a more ponderous, but before they can come to a Conjunction, the more weighty Planet is joyned to another, and so the Conjunction of the first is frustrated, as Mercury in  112"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. ten degrees of Aries, Mars twelve, Jupiter in thirteen of Aries ; here Mercury strives to come to Conjunction with Mars, but Mars first gets to conjunction with Jupiter; whereby Mercury is frustrated of the Conjunction of Mars: in Questions is s ignifies as much as our common Proverb, The Dogges quarrell, a third gets the Bone. [HAYZ.] HAYZ is when a Masculine and Diurnall Planet is in the day time above the earth, and in a Masculine Sign, and so when a Feminine, Nocturnall Plane t in the night is in a Feminine Sign and under the earth: In Questions it usually shews the content of the Question at time of the Question, when his significator is so found. [SUPERIOUR & INFERIOUR PLANETS.] Saturn, Jupiter and Mars be ing placed above the Orbe of the Sun, are called the superiour, ponderous and more weighty P lanets; Venus, Mercury and Luna are called the inferiour Planets, being under t he Orbe of the Sun. [COMBUSTION.] A Planet is said to be Combust of the Sun, when in the same Sign where the Sun is in, he is not distant from the Sun eight degrees and thirty minutes, either before or after the Sun; as Jupiter in the tenth degree of Aries, and Sun in the eighteenth of Aries; here Jupiter is Combust: or let the Sun be in eighteen of Aries, and Jupiter in twenty eight degrees of Aries, here Jupiter is Combust: and you mus t observe a Planet is more afflicted when the Sun hastens to conjunction of him, then when the Sun receds from him; in regard itâs the body of the Sun that doth afflict. I al low the moyity of his own Orbs to shew the time of Combustion, and not of Jupiter; for by that r ule Jupiter should not be combust before he is within four degrees and a half of the S un. I know many are against this opinion. Use which you find most verity in: the significator of the Querent Combust, shews him or her in great fear, and over powred by some great person. [UNDER THE SUN BEAMS.] A Planet is said to be under the Sunbeam s, untill he is fully elongated or distant from his body 17 degr. either before or after him. [CAZIMI, OR IN THE HEART OF THE SUN.] A Planet is in the heart of the Sun, or in Cazimi, when he is not removed from him 17 min. or is within 17 min. forwa rd or backward, as Sun in 15.30 Taurus, Mercury 15.25. of Taurus: here Mercury is in Cazimi, and all Authors doe hold a Planet in Cazimi to be fortified thereby; you must observe all Planets may be in Combustion of the Sun, but he  113"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. with none, and that Combustion can onely be by personall conjunction in one Sign, not by any aspect, either Sextile, Square, Trine or Opposition, his Square or Opposite aspects are afflicting, but doe not Combure or cause the Planet to be in Combustion. [ORIENTALL, OCCIDENTALL.] Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, are Orient all of the Sun, from the time of their conjunction with him, untill they come to his O pposition: from Whence untill again they come to conjunction, they are said to be Occi dentall; to be Orientall is no other thing then to rise before the Sun: to be Occi dentall is to be seen above the Horizon, or to set after the Sun is down: Mercury and Venus ca n make no Sextile , Square, Trine or Opposition to the Sun: their Orientality is when they are in fewer degrees of the Sign the Sun is, or in the Sign preceding; the ir Occidentality, when they are in more degrees of the Sign the Sun is in , or next subseque nt: for you must know Mercury cannot be more degrees removed from the Sun then 28. nor Venus m ore then 48. though some allow a few more. The Moon is Orientall of the Sun f rom the time of her opposition to he conjunction, and Occidentall from the time of her Conj unction to Opposition; and the reason hereof is, because she far exceeds the Sun i n swiftnesse of motion, and so presently gets further into the Sign, &c. [BESIEGING.] Besieging is, when any Planet is places betwixt the bodies of the two Malevolent Planets Saturn and Mars: as Saturn in 15. Aries, Mars i n 10. of Aries, Venus in 13. Aries: here Venus is besieged by the two infortunes, and it repr esents in questions, a Man going out of Gods blessing into the warm Sun; I mean is Venus be a Significatrix that time in time in the figure. There are other accidents belonging to the Planets one amongst another mentioned by the Ancients, but of so little purpose in Judgment, that I have cleerly omitted them. [DIRECTIONS IS.] When a Planet moveth forward in the Sign, as goi ng out of 13 degr. into 14. and so along. [RETROGRADE IS.] When a Planet goeth backward, as out of 10 degr. into 9, 8, 7, &c. [STATIONARY IS.] When he moves not at all, as the superiours doe not 2, 3, or 4 dayes before Retrogradation.  114"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ A READY TABLE WHEREBY TO EXAMINE THE FORTITUDES AND DEBILITIES OF THE PLANETS.

The Use of the Table. Many times it happens, that it is of great concernment to the Quer ent to know, whether a Woman be with childe of a Male or Female; or whether the Theef be Man or Woman, &c. When it shall so chance that neither the Angles, or the sex of the Planet, or the Si gnes doe discover it, but that the testimonies are equall; then if you consider the degrees of the Si gn wherein the Moon is, and wherein the Planet significator of the thing or party quesited is, and the degree of the Cuspe of the House signifying the person quesited after; and see by the second Colum n whether they be in Masculine or Feminine Degrees, you may pose your judgment, by concluding a Masculine party, if they be posited in Masculine degrees; or Feminine, if they be in Fe minine degrees. You see the first eight degrees of Aries are Masculine, the ninth degree is Femi nine, from nine to fifteen is Masculine, from fifteen to two and twenty is Feminine, from two and twenty to thirty is Masculine; and so as they stand directed in all the signs. The third Column tels you there are in every Sign certain Degree s, some called Light, Dark, Smoakie, Void, &c. the use hereof is thus: Let a Sign ascend in a Nativity or Question, if the Ascendant be i n those Degrees you see are called Light, the Childe or Querent shall be more fair; if the degree a scending be of those we call Dark, his Complexion shall be nothing so fair, but more obscure and dark; and if he be born deformed, the deformity shall be more and greater; but if he be deformed when the light degrees of a Sign ascend, the imperfection shall be more tolerable. And if the Moon or the Degree ascending be in those degrees we call Void, be the Native or Querent fair or foul, his understanding will be small, and his judgment lesse then the world supposeth, and the more then conferrest with him, the greater defect s halt thou finde in him. If the Ascendant, the Moon or either of them be in those degrees we call Sm oakie, the person inquiring or Native, shall neither be very fair nor very  "},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ 117"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. foule, but of a mixt Complexion, Stature or condition, betwixt fair and f oule. betwixt tall and of little Stature, and so in condition neither very judicious or a very Asse. You see the three first Degrees of Aries are Dark, from thre e to eight are light, from eight to sixteen are Dark, from sixteen to twenty are Light, from twent y to four and twenty are Voyd, from four and twenty to nine and twenty are Light, the last Degree is Voyd. [DEGREES, DEEP OR PITTED.] Degrees deep or pitted presented i n the fourth Column have this signification, that if either the Moon or the degree ascending or Lord of the Ascendant be in any of them, it shews the Man at a stand in the question he asks. nit knowing which way to turn himself and that he had need of help to bring him into a better condition; for as a man cast into a Ditch doth not easily get out without help, so no more can this querent in the case he is without assistance. [CALLED BY SOME AZIMENE DEGREES.] Degrees lame and defi cient are those mentioned in the fifth Column; the meaning whereof is thus, If in any question you finde him that demands the question, or in a Nativity, if you finde the Native defective in a ny member, or infected with an inseperable disease, halting, blindnesse, deafnesse &c. you may then suppos e the native hath either one of these Azimene degr. ascending at his birth, or the Lord of the Ascendant, or the Moon in one of them: in a Question or Nativity, if you see the Querent lame naturally, crooked, or vitiated in some member, and on the sudden you can in the figure give no present satisfaction to your self, doe you then consider the Degree ascending, or Degree whe rein the Moon is in, or the Lord of the Ascendant, or principall Lord of the Nativity or Questi on, and these is no doubt that you shall finde one or more of them in Azimene degrees. [DEGREES INCREASING FORTUNE.] These Degrees are relat ed in the fifth Column, and tend to this understanding, that if the Cuspe of the second House, or if the Lor d of the second house, or Jupiter, or the Part of Fortune be in, any of those degrees, itâs a nd argument of much wealth, and that the Native or Querent will be rich.  118"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie A TABLE shweing what members in Mans Body every Planet Signifieth in any of the twelve SIGNES W V U Q T S R A Brest, Arm Neck, Throat, Heart, Belly Belly, Head Thighs.

It was well neer four yeers after I had studied Astrology, befor e I could finde any reason, why the Planets in every of the Signs should signifie the members as ment ioned in the Table: at last, reading the 88. Aphorisms of Hermes, I understood the meaning of it, viz. E rit im-pedimentum circa 111am partem corporis quam significat signum, quod fuerit nativit atis tempore impeditum. There will be some impediment in or neer that part of the body, which it signified by the Sign that shall be afflicted at the time of the Birth The use of all comes to thus much: That if you would know where any Disease is, I mean in what member of the body, see in what Sign the significator of the sick Party is, and what part of mans body that Planet signifies in that Sign, which you may doe by the former Table, in that member or part of the body shall you say the sick party is grieved or diseased. As if Saturn be Significator of the sick party, and at time of y our question in Gemini; have recourse to your Table, and you see  120"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. Saturn in Gemini a Disease in the Belly or heart &c. Do so in the rest. Now the reason of this signification of every Planet in such or such a Sign is this. Every Planet in his own House or Sign, governeth the Head; in the second Sign from his House, the neck; in the third Sign from his house, the Arms and Shoulders; and so successively through the twelve Signs: as Saturn in Capricorn ruleth the Head, in Aquarius the Neck, in Pisces Arms and Shoulders; so Jupiter in Sagittarius ruleth the Head, in Capricorn the Neck, in Aquarius the Arms and Shoulders. The Moon observes the same order as the rest; yet the Arabians, fr om whom this learning is, doe allow her in Aries the Head as well as the Knees: The Head, because Aries signi fies so much: The Knees, because Aries is the ninth Sign from Cancer. You may observe this in the marks of mans Body, and many other judgments, and make singular use of it; ever remembering this, the more the Sign is vitiated, the greater mole or scarre; or the neerer to an Azimene, Pitted or Dificient degree of the Sign, the stronger is the deformity, sicknesse, &c, CONSIDERATIONS before Judgment . All the Ancients that have wrote of questions, doe give warning to the Astrologer, that before he deliver judgment he well consider whether the Figure is radicall and capable of judgment; the Question then shall be taken for radicall, or fit to be judged, when as the Lord of the hour at the time of proposing the Question, and erecting the Figure, and the Lord of t he Ascendant or first House, are of one Triplicity, or be one, or of the same nature. As for example; let the Lord of the hour be Mars, let the Sign of Scorpio, Cancer or Pisces ascend, this Question is then radicall, because Mars is Lord of the Hour, and of the Watry Triplicity, or of those Signs Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces. Again, let the Lord of the hour be Mars, and Aries ascend, the Question shall be radicall, because Mars is both Lord of the hour and Sign ascending.  121"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologle. Let the Lord of the hour be Mars, and let the Sign Leo ascend, here, al though the Sun is one of the Lords of the Fiery Triplicity, and the Lord of the Sign Leo, yet shall the Question be judged; because the Sun, who is Lord of the Ascendant, and Mars who is Lord of the hour, are both of one nature, viz. Hot and Dry. When either 00. degrees, or the first or second degrees of a Sign as cend (especially in Signs of short ascentions, viz. Capricorn, Aquarius, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, you may not adventure judgment, unlesse the Querent be very young, and his corporature, complexion a nd moles or scarres of his body agree with the quality of the Sign ascending. If 27, 28, 29 degrees ascend of any Sign, itâs no wayes safe to give j udgment, except the Querent be in yeers corresponding to the number of degrees ascending; or unlesse the Figure be set upon a certain time, viz, a man went away or fled at such a time prec ise; hope you may judge, because itâs no propounded question. Itâs not safe to judge when the Moon is in the later degrees of a Sign, especially in Gemini, Scorpio or Capricorn; or as some say, when she is in Via Combusta, whi ch is, when she is in the last 15 degrees of Libra, or the first fifteen degrees of Scorpio. All manner of matters goe hardly on (except the principall signif icators be very strong) when the Moon is void of course; yet somewhat she performs if void of course, and be either in Taurus, Cancer, Sagittarius or Pisces. You must also be wary, when in any question propounded you find the Cusp of the se venth house afflicted, or the Lord of that house Retrograde, or impedited, and the ma tter at that time not concerning the seventh house, but belonging to any other house, itâs an argument the judgment of the Astrologerâs will give small content, or any thing please the Querent; for the seventh house generally hath signification of the Artist. The Arabians, as Alkindus and others, doe deliver these following rules, a s very fit to be considered before a Question be judged. Viz. if Saturn be in the Ascendant, especially Retrograde, the mat ter of that Question seldom or never comes to good.  122"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. Saturn in the seventh either corrupts the judgment of the Astrologer, or is a Sign the matter propounded will come from one misfortune to another. If the Lord of the Ascendant be Combust, neither question propounded will take, or Querent be regulated. The Lord of the 7th unfortunate, or in his fall, or Terms of the Infortunes , the Artist shall scarce give a solid judgment.

The Querent is he or she that propounds the question, and desires resolution: the Quesited is he or she, or the thing sought and enquired after. The Significator is no more then that Planet which ruleth the house t hat signifies the thing demanded: as if Aries is ascending, Mars being the Lord of Aries, shal be significator of the Querent, viz, the Sign ascending shall in part signifie his corporatur e, body or stature, the Lord of the Ascendant, the Moon and Planet in the Ascendant, or that the Moon or Lord of the Ascendant are in aspect with, shall shew his quality or conditions equally mix ed together; so that let any Sign ascend, what Planet is Lord of that Sign, shall be called Lord of the House, or Significator of the person enquiring, &c. So that in the first place therefore, When any Question is propounded, the Sign ascending and his Lord are always given unto him or her that asks the question. 2. You must then consider the matter propounded, & see to which of the twelve houses it doth properly belong: when you have found the house, consider the Sign and Lord of that Sign, how, 123"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. and in what Sign and what part he is placed, how dignified, what aspect he hath to the Lord of the Ascendant, who impedites your Significator, who is friend unto him, viz, wha t Planet it is, and what house he is Lord of, or in what house posited; from such a man or woma n signified by that Planet, shall you be furthered or hindered; or of such relation unto you as that Planet signifies; if Lord of such a house, such an enemy, if Lord of such a house as signifieth enemies, then an enemy verily; if of a friendly house, a friend: The whole naturall key to all Astrology reflect in the words preceding rightly understood: By the Examples following I s hall make all things more plain; for I doe not desire, or will reserve anything whereby the Le arner may be kept in suspence of right understanding what is useful for him, and most fit to be known. In every question we doe give the Moon as the CO-SIGNIFICATOR wit h the querent or Lord of the Ascendant (some have also allowed the Planet from whom the Moon se perated as a Significator; which I no way approve of, or in my practice could ever find any Verity ther ein.) In like manner they joyned in judgment the Planet to whom the Moon applyed at time of the question, as Co-Significator with the Lord of the house of the thing quesited, or thing demanded. Having well considered the severall applications and seperations of t he Lords of those houses signifying your question, as also the Moon, the Scite of Heaven and qualit y of the aspect the Moon, and each significator hath to other, you may begin to judge and consider whether the thing demanded will come to pass yea or no; by what, or whose means, the tim e when, and whether it will be good for the Querent to proceed further in his demands yea or no.  CHAP. XXI. To know whether a thing demanded will be brought to perfection yea or nay. The Ancients have delivered unto us, that there are four wayes or mea ns, which discover whether one question or the thing demanded shall be accomplished yea or not.  124"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. [CONJUNCTION.] First, by Conjunction; when as therefore you find the Lord of the Ascendant, and Lord of that house which signifies the thing demanded, hastening to a C onjunction, and in the first house, or in any Angle, and the significators meet with no Prohibition or Refrenation, before they come to perfect Conjunction; you may then judge, that the thi ng sought after, shall be brought to passe without any manner of let or impediment, the sooner, if t he Significators be in swift motion, and Essentially or Accidentally strong; but if this Conjunction of the Significators be in a Succedant house, it will be perfected, but not as soon: if in Ca dent houses, with infinite losse of time, some difficulty, and much strugling. [ASPECT OF SEXTILE OR TRINE.] Things are also brought to pass e, when as the principall signifiers apply by Sextile or Trine aspect out of good Houses and pl aces where they are essentially well dignified ( and meet with no malevolent Aspect to intervene are they come to be in perfect Sextile or Trifle; I mean to the partill Sextill or Tryne.) [ASPECTS OF SQUARE AND OPPOSITION.] Things are also produce d to perfection, when the Significators apply by Square aspect, provided each Planet have dig nity in the Degrees wherein they are, and apply out of proper and good Houses, otherwise not. Somet imes it happens, that a matter is brought to passe when the Significators have apply ed by Opposition, but it hath been, when there hath been mutuall reception by House, and out of friendly Hous es, and the Moon seperating from the Significator of the thing demanded; I have ra rely seen any thing brought to perfection by this way of opposition; but the Querent had been bett er the thing had been undone; for if the Question was concerning Marriage, the parties seldom agreed, but were ever wrangling and jangling, each party repining at his evill choice , laying the blame upon their covetous Parents, as having no minde to it themselves: and if the Quest ion was about Portion or Monies, the Querent did, its true, recover his Money or Portion promised, but it cost him more to procure it in suit of Law, then the debt was worth, &c. and so have I se en it happen in many other things, &c. [TRANSLATION.] Things are brought to perfection by Translation of L ight and Nature, in this manner.  125"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. When the Significators both of Querent and Quesited are seperated fr om Conjunction or Sextile or Trine aspect of each other, and some one Planet or other doth seperat e himself from one of the Significators, of whom he is received either by House, Triplicity, or Term, and then this Planet doth apply to the other Significator by Conjunction or aspect, before he me eteth, with the Conjunction or aspect of any other Planet, he then translates the force , influence and virtue of the first Significaotr to the other, and then this intervening Planet (or such a man or woman as is signifies by that Planet) shall bring the matter in hand to perfection. Consider what house the Planet interposing or translating the nature a nd light of the two Planets is Lord of , and describe him or her, and say to the party, that such a party shall doe good in the business of, &c. viz, if Lord of the second, a good Purse affects the ma tter; if Lord of the third, a Kinsman or Neighbor; and so of all the rest of the Houses: of which m ore shall be said in the following Judgments. [COLLECTION.] Matters are also brought to perfection, when as the two principall Significators doe not behold one another, but both cast their severall Aspects to a more weighty Planet then themselves, and they both receive him in some of their essentiall di gnities; then shall that Planet who thus collects both their Lights, bring the thing demanded to perfecti on: which signifies no more in Art then this, that a Person somewhat interested in both part ies and described and signified by that Planet, shall perform, effect and conclude the thing which otherwayes could not be perfected: As many times you see two fall at variance, and of themselves cannot think of any way of accommodation, when suddenly a Neighbour or friend accidently reconc iles all differences, to the content of both parties: And this is called Collection. Lastly, things are sometimes perfected by the dwelling of Plane ts in houses, viz, when the Significator of the thing demanded is casually posited in the Ascenda nt; as if one demand if he shall obtain Ã©uch a Place or Dignity, if then the Lord of the tenth be placed in the Ascendant, he shall obtain the Benefit, Office, Place or Honour desired: This rule of the Ancients holds not true, or is consentanious to reason: except they will admit,  126"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. that when the Moon, besided this dwelling in house, doth transferre the light of the Significator of the thing desired, to the Lord of the Ascendant; for it was well obse rved that the application of the Significators shew inclination of the parties, but seperation usua lly privation; that is, in more plain terms, when you see the principall Significators of the Quere nt, and thing or party quesited after seperated, thereâs then little hops of the effecting or per fecting what is desired, (notwithstanding this dwelling in houses) but if there be application, the parties seem willing, and the matter is yet kept on foot, and there is great probability of pe rfecting it, or that things will come to a further treaty. In all Questions you are generally to observe this Method following. As the Ascendant represents the person of the Querent, and the second his Estate, the third his Kindred, the fourth his Father, the fifth his Children, the sixth his Se rvant or Sicknesse, the seventh his Wife, the eighth the manner of his Death, the ninth his Rel igion or journeys, the tenth his Estimation or honour, the eleventh his Friends, the twelfth his secret Enemies. So you must also understand, that when one asks concerning a Woman or any par ty signified by the seventh House and the Lord thereof, that then the 7th House shall be her Ascendant and signifie her person, the eight House shall signifie her Estate a nd be her second, the ninth House shall signifie her Brethern and Kindred, the tenth shall represent he r Father, the eleventh her Children or whether apt to have Children, the twelfth her Sicknesse and Servants, the first House her Sweetheart, the second House her Death, the third her Journey, the f ourth her Mother, the fifth her Friends, the sixth her sorrow, care and private Enemies. Let the Question be of or concerning Churchman, Minister, or the Brother of the wife or sweet- heart, the ninth House shall represent each of these, but the tenth House shall be Significator of his Substance, the eleventh House of his Brethern, and so in order: and so in all manner of Questions the House signifying the party shall be his Ascendant or first house,  127"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" http://mithras93.tripod.com/ An Introduction to Astrologie. the next his second House, and so continuing round about tne whole Heavens or twe lve Houses. If a question be made of a King, the tenth is his first house, the el eventh his second, and so orderly: but in Nativities, the Ascendant ever signifieth the par ty born, weather King or Beggar: These things preceding being well understood, you may procee d to judgment; not that it is necessary you have all that is wrote, in your memor y exactly, but that you be able to know when you are in an errour, when not; when to judge a question, when not: I should also have shewed how to take the Part of Fortune, but that I will doe in the first Example, the use of the Part of Fortune being divers, but hardly understood rightly by any author I ever met with: However note, if a King propound an Astrologi call Question, the Ascendant is for him, as well as for any meaner party; and a ll the houses in order, as for any vulgar person: For Kings are earth, and no more then men; and the time is comming &c. when.
