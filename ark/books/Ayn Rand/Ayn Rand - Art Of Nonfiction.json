Goodwriting, it is believed, is the product of some inborn ability, which can beneither objectively defined nor systematically learned. Like ardent religionistswho insist that the road to truth is open only to those who are visited bydivine revelation, many teachers of writing claim that the path to effectiveprose can be traversed only if one is struck by the inexplicable thunderbolt ofinspiration.Ayn Rand rejects this idea. She maintains that writing is a rational sphere,governed by rationally identifiable principles.“Writing is no more difficult a skill than any other, such as engineering,” shesays. “Like every human activity, it requires practice and knowledge. But thereis nothing mystical to it.” Since writing is essentially the act ofcommunicating your thoughts clearly, it can be done competently by virtuallyeveryone: “Any person who can speak English grammatically can learn to writenonfiction.... What you need for nonfiction writing is what you need for life ingeneral: an orderly method of thinking.”In analyzing the process of writing, her starting point—unlike that of othertheorists—is not the content of the writer’s mind, but the source of suchcontent: the facts of reality. On this philosophic issue, Ayn Rand was anunyielding advocate of the Aristotelian view, which she described as the primacyof existence—the view that the universe exists independent of anyone’s awarenessof it, that the function of consciousness is to grasp, not to create, reality,and that the absolutism of existence is what ought to shape one’s thoughts (andactions).This is the premise that underlies her approach to writing. Repudiating thestandard, subjectivist perspective, she holds that writing is to be treated asan objective science: “Whenever you have a problem, whether you are writing anarticle or building a doghouse, do not look inside for the solution. Do not ask:‘How do I do it? Why don’t I know it?’ Look outside and ask: ‘What is the natureof the thing I want to do?’ ” From this, she proceeds to discuss the nature ofwriting and its consequent requirements, such as the strict need to delimitone’s subject and theme, or the indispensability of an outline. She providesclear, perceptive principles about the psychological process of writing (such asthe different roles played by the conscious mind and the subconscious), alongwith methodical advice to guide you through the process (from getting ideas, tochoosing your subject and theme, to polishing your draft).The primacy of extrospection over introspection leads to another importantprinciple of writing. Ayn Rand urges writers to direct their attention solely totheir work—to what is needed to do it well, to how to solve problems thatarise—but not to its supposed meaning for one’s worth as a person: “If you havedifficulty with writing, do not conclude that there is something wrong with you.Writing should never be a test of self-esteem.”Of course, according to the mystical viewpoint, the writer’s self-esteem willalways be at issue. If writing is a matter of being zapped with inspiration by agracious muse, the absence of such inspiration must indicate unworthiness on thewriter’s part.One of the worst consequences of that viewpoint is the mental torture itinflicts upon writers. If the content of your consciousness arises causelessly,independent of reality, then writing is a journey not into the unknown, but intothe unknowable. If there are no firm rules by which to proceed—if one must starepassively at an empty page or empty screen, with mind idling, waitingdesperately for the muse to hit the accelerator—then writing must be laden withanxiety and guilt. It is tantamount to trying to design a computer with noprinciples of electronics or mechanics, only the hope of somehow being moved bythe right “spirit.”Since writing should be regarded as a science, Ayn Rand says, the job of thewriter is at root no different from that of the scientist. “It would never occurto a scientist to focus partly on his experiment and partly on his self-esteemor future fame. (If it does, he is a neurotic and will probably not be heardfrom.) He has to focus exclusively on his experiment. Nothing else is relevant.The same applies to writing, only it is harder because it is a purely mentaljob—there is nothing in reality yet except a blank sheet of paper. This is whyso many people fail at it. It is harder to focus on the reality of what you haveto produce when there is nothing before you but a blank page.... In practice,you must be more reality-oriented than a scientist, who has the help of thephysical problem and the physical objects he is working with.”This is not just the de-mysticizing, but the de-agonizing of writing. Ayn Rand’smethodology will not make writing problem-free, but something much better:problem-solvable. The conviction that one’s work can be guided by rationalprinciples rescues writers from a sense of helplessness. It saves them from thestate of pre-science savages, who felt they were at the mercy ofincomprehensible forces. Such a feeling is paralyzing to a writer, who has toknow that, in principle, he is in control of his work—that his success depends,not on some inscrutable emanations from his gut, but on identifiable ideas fromhis brain.Those who are serious about writing should find this approach enormouslyrewarding. I know that after reading an early transcript of this material yearsago, I found the process of writing much easier and more enjoyable. The approachpresented in this book makes writing a definable—and thus readilydoable—activity, rather than a debilitating battle. I use much of this materialin a writing class I teach at the Objectivist Graduate Center of the Ayn RandInstitute. And the response I typically get from students is something along thelines of: “So there is a definite method by which to write—and it works!”The transcript I originally saw was merely a verbatim account of Ayn Rand’sextemporaneous remarks. In this book, by contrast, her presentation has beenimpressively reorganized, with material taken painstakingly from one comer ofthe transcript and moved to another, where it logically belongs. Robert Mayhewdeserves abundant praise for his editing, which has resulted in a much moreintegrated and readable product.Those who experience the process of writing as overwhelming and traumatic will,I expect, find this book liberating. During the Renaissance, scientists—armedwith the revived Aristotelian confidence in the power of reason—came to realizethat the world was theirs to conquer. Writers, armed with Ayn Rand’sde-mysticizing approach to writing, can be similarly unleashed, with the worldof words theirs to master. —Peter SchwartzDanbury, ConnecticutJuly 1999"},{"pageContent":"EDITOR’S PREFACEIn 1969, Ayn Rand gave a course on nonfiction writing to well over a dozenfriends and associates. At the time, she was editor of The Objectivist magazine(Objectivism is the philosophy she originated); she gave the course to helpthose who were, or planned to be, contributors.She did not deliver prepared lectures. Instead, she spoke on a topic (someevenings for over three hours) guided solely by a brief outline. These“lectures” were interspersed with: general discussion; requests forclarification, with her replies; discussion of homework assignments; andquestion-and-answer periods.The course was privately recorded. My task was to convert the recording into abook. Let me describe the kinds of editing I did. Cutting. A great deal of material had to be cut, though I am confident thatnothing of importance pertaining to nonfiction writing was omitted. (Prompted bystudent questions, Ayn Rand occasionally went off on fascinating tangents intophilosophy, politics, and art. Much of what she said is of great interest, andsuch material will no doubt be published in some form eventually; but it doesnot belong in this book.) In regard to nonfiction writing, I assumed that everypassage of hers was worthy of inclusion unless I could make a case for itsomission. If, for example, while she was lecturing, a student interjected aquestion, and her brief reply added nothing to the discussion (because it wasrepetitive or dealt with a narrow problem of no general interest), I omitted it.Or if the students spent two hours discussing their outlines or writing sampleswith her, I did not include the entire discussion. However, I always tried toincorporate into the book any important insights or principles that shementioned during these discussions. Reorganizing. Ayn Rand did not present this course as a series of lecturescorresponding exactly to the chapters of this book. How, then, was her courseorganized?When it began, she did not have a complete picture of what material would becovered, or even how many times the class would meet. Nor did she have in mindan exact order of presentation. On the first night, she told the class:As late as this afternoon, I wasn’t yet sure whether I would be giving a seriesof classes. Originally, I thought we might cover everything in one evening.Well, that’s where I’m not omniscient: Since then, I made a brief outline of themain topics that I know of (which does not yet include any questions you mayhave). If we finish everything in ten lectures, we will be doing very well.In fact, it took them sixteen evenings, meeting usually every other week, to“finish everything.”Whatever was undecided at the outset, the basic logical structure of the core ofthe course was clear to Ayn Rand from the start. This core is found in chapters1—8; this is where she covers the central aspects of nonfiction writing. Hereshe had a definite structure in mind, and I followed it. No major reorganizationwas required.The material in the remaining chapters (9-12) is not part of what she consideredthe “main topics” of the course. These chapters instead consist of her extensiveanswers to questions on miscellaneous topics in regard to nonfiction writing—alltoo good to omit. With one exception, Ayn Rand answered these questions in theorder in which they were asked, and so I had to determine the proper order ofpresentation in a book. I did place “Acquiring Ideas for Writing” (chapter 12)last because she indicated that this issue could best be covered at the end.Since there was no formal conclusion, I ended with the story she herself used toend the course.Given the extemporaneous nature of her presentation, and the extent of studentparticipation, there were numerous digressions—for example, she would oftenreturn to points discussed earlier, or respond to questions or comments on lateror tangential issues. Part of my job was to integrate this material into alogical presentation. Thus, within every chapter it was necessary to some extentto shift material around. Line editing. My aim here was to ensure that the writing was clear and readable.This involved transforming Ayn Rand’s oral presentation into written form, i.e.,condensing what she said, eliminating repetitions, and, where necessary,correcting grammar.Notwithstanding the amount of editing required, it is remarkable how lucid herextemporaneous material is. But there are occasions when the recording isunclear or contains gaps. In most of these cases, no educated guess at a meaningwas possible, and so the passage was omitted. In rare cases, it was almost, butnot absolutely, certain what her meaning was; here the wording necessary to makethe passage fully clear was supplied.Because of the number of editorial changes I made, it would have distracted thereader had I used the apparatus of brackets and ellipses. Therefore, I usebrackets only for text that could not have come from Ayn Rand. For example, ifshe referred to something she had said three months earlier, I would change itto, say, “as I discussed in [chapter 1].”My purpose was not to turn Ayn Rand’s remarks into a smooth, finished piece ofwriting. Rather, it was merely to help in making the course clearer and morereadable. I believe I have fulfilled this task, and I am pleased with theresults. But this book, I stress, still retains the quality of an extemporaneouspresentation. Ayn Rand never intended her unprepared remarks in 1969 to betransformed into a book. In fact, in answer to a student’s question about thenature of a first draft, she said: “When I give these lectures, I speak from anoutline, and my subconscious fills in the concretes. If you transcribed arecording of them, that would be like a very rough first draft. But it would notbe good enough to publish.” In my judgment, however, it is eminently “goodenough” now to read.If you wish to see or judge the merits of Ayn Rand’s own writing, please consultthe works that she did intend for publication. I wish to thank, most of all, Leonard Peikoff for allowing me to undertake thisproject, for his superb and extensive editorial guidance during its firststages, and for giving the entire manuscript a final editing. The principles ofediting he taught me will continue to be useful well beyond my work on thisbook. Many thanks to Peter Schwartz as well, for writing the introduction, andfor his excellent editorial advice in the last stages of the project. His workon this book has improved every page. I also want to thank the Ayn RandInstitute for its help, which took many forms. Finally, and as always, I wish tothank my wife, Estelle, for solving the many computer problems I encounteredwhile working on this book, and for her many other forms of support."},{"pageContent":"1Preliminary RemarksThe first precondition of this course, and of any type of writing, is: do notget a sense of unearned guilt. If you have difficulty with writing, do notconclude that there is something wrong with you. Writing should never be a testof self-esteem. If things are not going as you want, do not see it as proof ofan unknowable flaw in your subconscious.Never take the blame for something you do not know. Be sure, however, to takethe blame for writing errors you do know about. That much is open to yourconscious mind, and pertains to how carefully you edit.If you tell yourself you are guilty for not writing brilliant sentences withinfive minutes, that stops your subconscious and leads to a host of writingproblems. Writing is not an index of psychological health.(Overconscientiousness is one reason a person might aspire to something tooambitious, and then blame himself if it does not come easily.) If you do haveany guilt, earned or unearned, that is between you and your psychologist. Whenyou sit down to write, however, you must regard yourself as perfect, omniscient,and omnipotent.Of course, you are not omniscient and omnipotent; no human skill, if at allinteresting, can be perfect every time. Properly, therefore, you should feelthat you have the capacity to write well, but that it is difficult. And youshould not want an easy job—you do not want to be a hack—and therefore youshould take all the trouble, and have all the patience, that writing requires.Do not conclude, at the first difficulty, that you are hopeless. This is thesense in which you must feel omniscient and omnipotent: not that everything youwrite will automatically be perfect, but that you have the capacity to make yourwork what you want to make it.This leads to a second point. Contrary to all schools of art and esthetics,writing is something one can learn. There is no mystery about it.In literature, as in all the fine arts, complex premises must be set early in aperson’s mind, so that a beginning adult may not have enough time to set themand thus cannot learn to write. Even these premises can be learned,theoretically, but the person would have to acquire them on his own. So I aminclined to say that fiction writing—and the fine arts in general—cannot betaught. Much of the technical skill involved can be, but not the essence.However, any person who can speak English grammatically can learn to writenonfiction. Nonfiction writing is not difficult, though it is a technical skill.Its only difficulty pertains to a person’s method of thinking orpsycho-epistemology.1 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-1] What you needfor nonfiction writing is what you need for life in general: an orderly methodof thinking. If you have problems in this regard, they will slow you down (inboth realms). But writing is literally only the skill of putting down on paper aclear thought, in clear terms. Everything else, such as drama and “jazziness,”is merely the trimmings.I once said that the three most important elements of fiction are plot, plot,and plot. The equivalent in nonfiction is: clarity, clarity, and clarity.Harold Fleming, the author of Ten Thousand Commandments, once showed me aquotation he carried with him, from The Education of Henry Adams: “The result ofa year’s work depends more on what is struck out than on what is left in, on thesequence of the main lines of thought, than on their play and variety.”Incidentally, there is not one extra word in this quotation. It is pruned downto the minimum necessary to express the thought. This is a fine way of makingthe point that clarity comes above all else. The first absolute is: be clear.Drama, jazziness, color—which can be added later—are never as important asclarity.Nobody can learn to write without practicing, because there are so manysubconscious integrations to be automatized. Nobody can write strictly byconscious effort. No matter how much theory you know, you will not be a goodwriter until you practice. Therefore, do not expect your first articles to beeasy. They will be difficult, and as you develop they will become even moredifficult, because you will attempt more ambitious themes. But in a differentsense writing becomes easier: with each article you write you learn something,so that at the end of the article you are better than you were at the beginning.How good you become depends on your premises and interests, and on how much timeyou devote to writing. But the skill can be learned. It is not mysterious anddoes not have to be torture.Remember this point, particularly when you feel you will never write again orknow what writing is. That sense of helplessness is inherent in struggling witha new thought. But any particular writing problem you might have is solvable(though, as in any introspection, it is not always easy to identify yourproblem). Writing is no more difficult a skill than any other, such asengineering. Like every human activity, it requires practice and knowledge. Butthere is nothing mystical to it.The secret of writing is to be professional about it.You can be professional before you publish anything—if you approach writing as ajob. If you apply to writing the same standards and methods that peopleregularly apply to other professions, you will take a lot of weight off yoursubconscious and increase your productive capacity.If you do not regard writing as a job, self-doubt will necessarily enter yourmind, and you will be paralyzed. You will be putting yourself on trial everytime you attempt to write. Instead of being an expression of your self-esteem,writing becomes its test. If so, it will be a miracle if you ever connect twosentences.What does a person do in other professions when he feels self-doubt? If hisapproach is professional, he retains his knowledge of his own intelligence. Hedoes not doubt his professional abilities, even though he may have difficultiesto solve. He also understands that if he wants to advance, he has to expand hisknowledge. The “If I don’t get a raise there’s something wrong with me” type ofself-doubt is not relevant and does not enter his mind.This same hard-headed, reality orientation is what you have to assume in regardto writing. I regard the piece of paper as my employer. I have to fill thatpiece of paper. How I feel—whether it is difficult or not, whether I am stuck ornot—is irrelevant. It is as irrelevant as it would be if I were an employee ofHank Rearden [an industrialist in Atlas Shrugged]. He would not tolerate it if Itold him, “I can’t work today because I have self-doubt” or “I have aself-esteem crisis.” Yet that is what most people do, in effect, when it comesto writing. I have always taken the professional approach. Of course, I cannever guarantee how long some piece will take me, but my assignment is always tofill that page. I know a certain subject has to be stated, and I have thecapacity to state it. What the difficulties are is irrelevant. They are myproblem, and I will solve it.My focus in this course is on writing articles, though much of what I sayapplies to books as well. Among articles, my focus is on the “middle range.”Nonfiction writing covers a wide range, from theoretical works that deal withbroad, abstract principles, to concrete journalistic reporting. Theoreticalarticles discuss new fundamentals or present a new approach to issues on afundamental level. (See, for example, Leonard Peikoff’s “The Analytic-SyntheticDichotomy.”2 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-2]) The proper medium forthese articles is academic journals (except in the case of Objectivist articles,since no academic journal would publish them). Journalistic articles, on theother hand, consist not of theorizing, but of reporting on a given phenomenon orevent—describing some concrete event or situation. (See, for example, HenryKamm’s “For Three Minutes I Felt Free.”3[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-3])The articles I most enjoy writing are in the middle range.Middle-range articles fall somewhere between theoretical and journalisticarticles. They consist of the application of abstractions to concretes, which iswhat most intellectual magazines contain. Such articles deal neither withphilosophical theory nor with concrete reporting. They accept a theoreticalproposition and analyze some current event or some aspect of the culture fromthat viewpoint.Two examples are Pope Paul VI’s encyclical Humanae Vitae, and my reply to it,“On Living Death.”4 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-4] The Pope’sencyclical is middle-range—actually, high middle-range—because he applies basicprinciples of Catholic philosophy and religion (concerning the sanctity of life,God’s will, and a woman’s duty) to narrower issues, namely love, marriage, andbirth control. The idea of God’s will, or the view that man may not interferewith natural processes, is a theoretical subject; but it is applied here to suchissues as what man should do in marriage. In my reply, I do not state any newObjectivist theory; I discuss why the Pope’s theories are wrong from theObjectivist viewpoint. I apply my view of human rights, the nature of love, andthe nature of marriage to the issues raised in this encyclical. That is writingin the middle range.If I wrote a critique of Kant, and in the process I defined some new theory,5[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-5] that would be a theoretical article.But if I simply took an aspect of his philosophy and showed why it is wrongaccording to Objectivism, that would be middle range.Theoretical articles, written to present something fundamental and new, are themost valuable. But you should not aim for them. You should not wait to discoversomething new in order to write.No matter what you write, however, a knowledge of the principles of writing isinvaluable. But what you do not know consciously is not really knowledge. If youdo not know certain principles of thinking and writing explicitly, you arehelpless to use them. You may practice these principles without knowing it (likethe man in Molière’s comedy who did not know he was talking prose); but they arenot in your control if you have never conceptualized them.The present course should help you immensely with this task. This does not meanthat inspiration will come to you automatically. But it does mean that you willknow how to make it come when you need it."},{"pageContent":"2Choosing a Subject and ThemeWhenever you have a problem, whether you are writing an article or building adoghouse, do not look inside for the solution. Do not ask: “How do I do it? Whydon’t I know it?” Look outside and ask: “What is the nature of the thing I wantto do?”What is the nature of an article? First observe that you cannot do everything atonce. Whatever you are writing—a theoretical work on a revolutionary idea or asmall piece about a narrow concrete—you cannot say everything you know about thesubject. You must accept this premise fully, so that it becomes part of yoursubconscious and operates automatically. You can do this by asking yourselfwhether you always knew everything you know today. Obviously you did not.Knowledge is acquired in steps.Good teachers recognize that you cannot teach everything at once, which is why afour-year course of study must be divided into semesters, and semesters intoindividual lectures. But when it comes to writing, people forget this principleand attempt to cram everything they know about the subject into one article. Yetthis cannot be done even in a series of books. Since every item of knowledge isconnected to every other, and since there is only one reality, if you wanted topresent an exhaustive case on any one subject, you would have to write the workof a universal scholar. For example, you would start with an article on the NewYork theater, and would end up covering science, epistemology, metaphysics,psychology, etc.All writing is selective in every aspect—not only in its style, but in its mostbasic content, because you cannot communicate everything.(However, I prefer the person who tries to write everything in one article—whichat least reveals a good intention—to the concrete-bound writer who discussesonly the toes of a statue, or to the linguistic analyst who can write only aboutthe ten uses of the word “but.” So if you are overambitious, I sympathize withyou; nevertheless, this approach is disastrous.)You must delimit your subject and theme.Some people commit the error of trying to present all they know by writing anunanswerable article. This is a mistake on at least two counts. First, it isimpossible, because if the theme is important, it would take a book to prove it.In an article, you do not prove your theme, you demonstrate it. These are almostsynonymous, but here is the distinction. “Proof” applies mainly to theoreticalsubjects. But when you write about merely an aspect of a subject, such as acultural or philosophical issue that is part of a cluster of issues, you do nottry to prove some point. That would require a much broader and longer piece.Instead, you demonstrate your point, i.e., present it and indicate its proof(which is not the same as giving the proof). For example, in my article “The‘Inexplicable Personal Alchemy,’ ”6 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-6] Ido not prove that we should treat the men of reason better—I merely provide thematerial for such a proof. I demonstrate that the policy of destroying the youngbecause of their virtues is disastrous, and I show its results in two extremecases: Russia and America. But to actually prove this, I would have to prove thevalidity and importance of reason. Here, for an Objectivist audience, I takethat premise as axiomatic. (The article is still of value to a non-Objectivist.It will not prove the point to him, but if he is interested, it will jolt himinto investigating further the issue of reason versus irrationality. And Ipresent my point in such a way that the worst irrationalist would not dare sayopenly that he is opposed to those Russian protesters and is in favor of thehippies.)The second reason why trying to write an unanswerable article is a mistake isthat the author is assuming his readers do not possess free will. He is assuminghe must present, by some undefined means, a case that no one could resist. Butclearly such an assumption is false. People can evade the most obvious logicalconnections. Therefore, if you try to write such an article, you are defeated atthe outset, because you are asking the impossible of yourself. As a result,either you will be unable to write (and will not know why), or you will writeendlessly, following sidelines, each of which leads to further sidelines.Instead of being unanswerable, you will raise more questions than you answer.(This is an eloquent illustration of the fact that acting on a wrong premiseachieves the opposite of your intention.)If the unanswerable or exhaustive article is impossible, what kind is possible?An article, by its nature, must treat a severely delimited aspect of a subject,not a whole subject.The standard of measurement here is relative, but I mean a “whole subject” inits most basic sense. For instance, if your subject is political, then the wholesubject is politics, with all its key aspects. That would be a proper subjectfor a book, but not for an article. Even in writing a book, you would have todelimit what politics is: you cannot include too much metaphysics, epistemology,or ethics, even though each is relevant. In a book, you indicate your framework,delimit your subject, and stick to essentials. So, obviously, any large-scalesubject cannot be the focus of an article. (Actually, my Introduction toObjectivist Epistemology7 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-7] does notqualify as an article. It is really a monograph, which is why I had to write itin the form of eight installments—much too long even for a theoretical article.It should have been published originally as a book. This is a good illustrationof the form an article should not take.)Consider my article “On Living Death,”8[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-8] which deals with birth control. I donot treat the whole issue, only the Objectivist critique of the Catholicposition. Further, I do not cover all the relevant Catholic literature, only onepapal encyclical. Even though I deal with fundamentals, my subject is only oneaspect of a broad issue.A useful exercise is to look at some good articles and name the broader subjectand the particular aspect each treats. You will find that the subject alwaysdeals with a partial aspect examined from some viewpoint; it is never a crammedcondensation of the whole.Once you recognize the nature of an article, the next step is to decide on anarticle of your own. Observe that there are two essential elements of anarticle: subject and theme. The subject is what the article is about: the issue,event, or person it deals with. (Again, an article must cover only an aspect ofa whole.) The theme is what the author wants to say about the subject—what hebrings to the subject. If the article is in the middle range, he brings hisevaluation of the subject; if it is theoretical, he brings his new idea.Consider a middle-range approach to the subject of modem theater. You couldwrite many articles on this, and thus write on the same subject but withdifferent themes. For example, one person could write on modem theater as anindication of cultural disintegration, while some modernist might try to showwhy he thinks it is good, or what its social significance is. There are manypotential approaches to the same subject.As for theoretical works, consider my Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology.The subject is epistemology (and more narrowly the nature of concepts), and thetheme is my theory of concepts. Or: the subject of my article “ThePsycho-epistemology of Art”9 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-9] is art,and the theme is my definition of the nature, purpose, and source of art. Intheoretical articles, the theme is the abstract point the author wants to make.It does not include an evaluation.The easiest way to identify your subject and theme is to ask yourself why youwant to write the article. The more clearly you state your answer, the easier itwill be to create your outline and write your article.The question “Why do I want to write this article?” involves two sub-questions:“What subject do I want to write about?” and “What do I want to say about thesubject—i.e., what is my theme?” In answering these questions, you may discoverthat your reasons are inappropriate. For example, you find that you want towrite an article because you are angry at the president. That is not yet a goodreason. Writing is not occupational therapy. The next question should be: “Isthere a wider reason I feel so angry?” If you have a valid reason, and nobodyhas yet taken your particular approach to the president, then your article turnsfrom a vague, subjective emotion into a potentially valuable piece.As an example of selecting a subject and theme, consider again my 1969 article“The ‘Inexplicable Personal Alchemy.’ ”10[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-10] I felt a strong emotion when I readKamm’s piece about the young Russian rebels. I asked my husband whether he hadread it, and he had. His reaction was the same, but without the personaldetails. He thought it was beautiful and possessed grandeur, and that there wassomething very tragic about it. That was the first clue that my reaction was nottotally subjective, i.e., based on mere personal history.My next questions were: “Is there a wider meaning to this feeling? Why do I feelsuch pain?” Immediately I knew the reason: Kamm’s article portrays thedestruction of the best of the young. What is so tragic here is that they areidealists in a hopeless situation, and yet they are still trying to fight theirdestroyers. The next questions I asked were: “Why are they still fighting? Whydo I feel their situation is tragic?” I saw that they are fighting on the basisof their virtues, which they are too young to identify. They are doomed, yet itis the best within them that makes them act as they do, without their evenknowing fully why.This was my reaction to the destruction of young people in Russia. So far, it isa narrow subject, of interest in a specialized study of Russia, but not yetappropriate for an American article. But the next connection in my mind was thatthis phenomenon is not exclusive to Russia. Young people are being destroyed fortheir virtues and for their devotion to ideas in this country too—in ourcolleges.My next thought was that the American hippies are the exact opposite of thoseyoung Russians. In Russia, they are fighting and dying for freedom of the mind;here they are parading naked in theaters and destroying universities in the nameof freedom from the mind. At this point, I knew I had an article.I have described this process in slow motion; in reality, it did not take memore than five minutes. The connections fell into place because my subconsciousholds a standing order to be on the lookout for article themes.The subject of my article, therefore, is the destruction of the best among theyoung. The theme is that this is a terrible crime, and that American hippies andtheir admiring educators are even guiltier than the brutes in Russia. Note thatthe form of the article and the amount of commentary were determined by thesubject. I had to analyze the meaning of a certain event in Russia—thedestruction of young idealists—on the basis of a brief, journalistic descriptionprovided in the Times article. Then I had to present the American hippies in thesame terms, i.e., by concrete dramatizations. In contrast to my article on thestudent rebellion,11 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-11] this is not atheoretical discussion of what is wrong with the so-called vanguard of Americanyouth. It is a concretized presentation, through highly selective attributes, ofthe contrast between the Russian and American rebels. Once my subject and themewere clear, everything else fell into place. Had I not defined the theme, butmerely started by saying “I feel strongly about Russia, let me write something,”I would have been in trouble.Now, I could have written a different article on the same Kamm piece, e.g., anarticle on the evil of communism. Here the subject is the same, but the theme isa denunciation of Russia’s treatment of the young. Or the theme could be adenunciation of Russian censorship. Or the evil of cultural exchanges, and otherforms of American cooperation with Russia. I could name many aspects from whichgood articles could be written, all based on Kamm’s report. There are as manypossibilities as there are professions: a historian could focus on the subjectfrom one perspective, a philosopher from another, an economist from yet another.There are no rules for selecting a theme, provided it is of broad interest. Forexample, if upon reading Kamm’s piece someone decided to focus his theme onRussian streets (which Kamm mentions) and how unsanitary they are, that wouldnot be valid. It is too narrow. When you see a crime like the destruction ofyoung idealists because of their virtues, you should not focus on puny details.That destroys the significance of the subject by undermining its seriousness,and by not featuring it. Such a theme is irrelevant to, and thus clashes with,the subject. Your subject and theme must be commensurate.Noteworthy here is a cover from an early issue of The New Yorker. It picturedthe wall of a museum, upon which hung a large painting of a very savage caveman.He is running through the jungle carrying a naked woman, who is screaming. He isleering ferociously, and obviously intends to rape her. As he runs through thejungle, he is breaking the branches he encounters, and doves fly off to avoidhim. In the museum, in front of this painting, sits a little old lady with aneasel, copying the painting. But out of all of this violent subject matter, shechooses to copy only the flight of doves. This is a good visual example ofselecting a theme too small for the subject.You should not select a theme which is too big, either. If you choose aminuscule event and try to build a broad theme around it, you will end up withfloating abstractions [i.e., abstractions not connected to reality], since yoursubject gives you insufficient material for that broad an approach.Of course, you must first select your subject and then your theme, becauseanything you choose to write must be about something, and you must establishwhat that is before you can determine what you want to say about it. In writingfiction, where the equivalent of the subject is the plot, you can start bythinking about the theme—or any other aspect of the novel. But with nonfiction,you must start with the subject. (When you are experienced, the process isautomatized, so that you get your subject and theme virtually together and atonce. But there are actually two selections.)Incidentally, there is no such thing as the best theme. It is disastrous towrite with the idea that you must make your article “the best possible” on agiven subject. Since you are treating only one aspect of a subject, there are asmany other aspects—giving rise to as many themes—as there are, say, professions.Just as you cannot say one valid profession is better than another, so youcannot say one aspect of a subject is objectively superior to another.You can establish a certain hierarchy of fundamentality. For instance, to treatan enduring, philosophical aspect of a subject is more fundamental than to treata transient, journalistic aspect. But this is a very loose hierarchy, becausethere can be a bad article with too broad a theme, and a valuable one with anenlightening, albeit narrower, theme.Your only concern should be rationally justifying your approach, i.e.,explaining to yourself, and to anyone who asks, why what you have to say isvaluable to the reader. One practical consequence of this principle is that youdo not start with a Kantian, or mystical, idea of value—by which you seek the“best” approach in a metaphysical vacuum.The decisive element here is your own hierarchy of intellectual values: whatsubject interests you and what you want to say about it. Your standard should bethe best approach that you want to take. As long as your value premises arerational, the hierarchy is established by what you find important. Thus, thedirective you give yourself should be: do not choose a lesser aspect than thedeepest one that interests you and that you can do. For instance, in response tothe Kamm piece, it would be improper to decide that while you could write a goodarticle on the Soviet educational system—which interests you—you will insteadwrite an easy article about Soviet mothers, because it requires less time forresearch. That is not a valid reason. The latter article would not be good,because it would bore you, and therefore would not be interesting or convincingto your readers.I do not mean that if a theme of interest to you requires a lot of research, youshould do it even though you cannot afford the time. If your article requiresthat much research, then the theme is somewhat outside your present knowledgeand interest. It would be too broad a theme for your hierarchy. The point is:take the widest theme you can handle, given your knowledge and interests.If you find you have nothing new to say about your subject, do not write thatarticle. This is a crucial point that many people, especially beginners, fail torecognize. A young man once showed me an article he had written on capitalism,which was an utter rehash. When I asked him whether this had been said before,he replied that it had. And that was the problem. He wanted to say something infavor of capitalism—but he had nothing new to say about it.If you have nothing new to say, no matter how brilliantly you can say it, do notdo it. An article stands or falls on its subject and theme. Those “brilliant”essays that say nothing (which The New Yorker is full of) are mere fingerexercises and a waste of developed style.“New” here does not mean totally unprecedented. It does not require afundamental philosophical principle never heard of before. Since an articledeals with partial aspects of a subject, the novelty of your theme need not beworld-shaking. But your idea must be new in the context of that subject. Forexample, The Objectivist recently published a good article on government controlof the arts. Government controls are not new; but, to my knowledge, nobody hadpreviously demonstrated how wrong it is for the government to go into the arts,and how it succeeded by default. This idea is not new from the point of view ofthe relationship between government and the economy; but it is with regard tothe history of a particular aspect of the American economy, namely the arts.On a related point, some people think an article, to be new, must do more than“simply” apply some basic principle to a new situation. On this view, since Ihave written on the student rebellion at Berkeley, 12[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-12] for example, anything I might writeon the rebellion at Cornell would be a rehash. But if that were true, you couldnot write middle-range articles, only theoretical ones. In fact, you canlegitimately apply the same principles to different concretes and stressdifferent aspects, and thereby write a hundred articles, none of them a rehash.There is no limit to how many aspects of a subject you can handle withoutrepeating yourself. You could apply the same principles I used in my article onBerkeley to the situation at Comell, and stress, say, the attitude of themoderates or the degree to which force has escalated since Berkeley. These wouldbe original articles. (I would not write such articles, because once I havewritten on a subject it usually bores me to return to it; but that does not meanit is not a valid article for someone else.) Applying philosophy to reality isnot automatic. To show how certain ideas apply to current events takes a newmental effort each time, and is therefore a value to your audience.In a sense, I have said nothing new since We the Living.13[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-13] Of course, there are many new ideasin Atlas Shrugged, but you could say, broadly speaking, that the ideas were allimplicit in We the Living; after all, I was for selfishness and individualrights in both books. If your standard of the new is too broad, ultimately youwould have to say: “Nobody has stated anything new since Aristotle said A is A,because you cannot go beneath the Law of Identity, nor say anything without it.We are all only elaborating on it.” But that is not the proper standard ofnovelty. (On the other hand, paraphrase is not enough. If someone says, “Thegovernment should not impose so many controls,” and in the name of novelty youwrite, “The government should not impose that great a number of controls,”obviously that would not constitute novelty.)Judge the novelty of your theme by asking yourself whether you have seen thisview expressed before. If you know the subject and have not come across thisapproach (and you need not know everything written on the subject), then whatyou have to say is new.In sum, there are three questions to ask yourself before you write an article:“What do I want to write about?” “What do I want to say about that subject?” and“What is the element of novelty in my theme?”You should write down these questions and your answers. This is especiallyimportant in the beginning, before you have automatized the process of selectinga subject and theme. In writing out your answers, make them objective. If youcannot write something down clearly and objectively, then you do not really knowit. Any vagueness or indecision on any fundamental aspect of your article willbe disastrous. That which you cannot name you know only approximately.The great majority of writing problems come from approximations in one’s mind.The subconscious does not work through approximations. It is more absolutistthan your conscious mind—though it is a good idea to try to make that absolutistas well, in the sense of being very precise in your conscious decisions."},{"pageContent":"3Judging One’s AudienceOnce you decide on a subject and theme and determine that your idea is new, askyourself why someone else should be interested in your article. This will lendobjectivity to your selection of a theme. I illustrated this process when Idiscussed “The ‘Inexplicable Personal Alchemy’ ” (see pp. 11-13). So long as Iregarded Kamm’s piece as being of special interest only to me (given myhistory), that interest was subjective, and I would not be justified in writingan article about it. But once I concluded that every educated layman should beinterested in how the best of the young are being destroyed because of theirloyalty to reason, my theme became objectively valid.Judging your audience is a subdivision of the topic covered [in chapter 2]. Itapplies, however, not only to choosing a subject and theme, but also to makingan outline and to your actual writing. I will now cover the relevant principleswhich you need to understand and automatize.Judging your audience is a complicated issue. But its very complexity eliminatesthe need for detailed rules. You cannot estimate your audience with precision,because there are as many different audiences as there are individuals. No tworeaders will be exactly alike or have the same psycho-epistemology. But you needto know the general category of person involved. Just as there must be novagueness in your mind about your subject, theme, or outline, so too withrespect to your readers. You have to identify, on paper and in objective terms,what type of audience you are addressing.Actually, you make this kind of judgment constantly in talking to people. Forinstance, you do not speak to children the way you do to your peers, and youtalk to your boss or people more knowledgeable than you in yet another way. Youdo not change your ideas, or talk up or down, but you are aware of their stateof knowledge in comparison with yours. In writing, what you must primarily judgeis your readers’ knowledge, because that determines how much you need toexplain.For example, if an Objectivist writes for an Objectivist audience, he need notprove every Objectivist principle he refers to. And if he writes for a generalaudience, he cannot prove the whole of Objectivism in one article. But in thelatter case, he would need to clarify certain principles more than he would inthe former.Consider my one-page article on the Apollo 8 astronauts reading the Bible fromspace.14 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-14] I could not, in a page,tell the reader why reason is superior to faith, and why I object to the Bible.I took such knowledge for granted. I could do that in an Objectivistpublication, and (conceivably) in a liberal publication like The New York Times.But it would have been improper to write it that way for a small-town newspaperin the Bible Belt. Even with the best intentions, the majority of those readerscould not understand the article. Their intellectual framework is totallydifferent.This is how you project the reader’s frame of reference, without which youcannot start an article. You assume some level of knowledge—some context—whichyou cannot teach your readers, but must take as the base from which you write.That is a requirement of objectivity.Incidentally, if you write for a young audience, never write down. The onlydifference your estimate of an audience should make is in how much complexityand abstraction you can convey and how much explanation is necessary.How do you judge an audience’s knowledge? Assume you are writing forObjectivists. (The principles are the same for any audience.) First identify thenecessary context. Say you are writing an article on government interference inthe arts. You know that if you start explaining what art and government are, youwill never get to the subject. You have to assume the audience knows what theyare. What you are telling them about is, say, how the government entered thefield of art, the arguments offered in favor of this interference, and theincorrectness of these arguments. You must ask yourself at each step—in statingthe theme, making the outline, and writing—what you needed to know to write thisarticle. At one time you did not know by what steps the government entered thisfield. How did you learn it? You read a great deal about it, for instance, whichconvinced you that the government entered the field by default, and that itsproponents used false arguments. Well, this is what you want to communicate toyour audience. If you assume that your readers already know the whole history,then you have not chosen a proper subject and theme. But if they do not know it,then your choice is appropriate.To be interested in this subject, an Objectivist reader needs to know thegeneral impropriety of government interference. You need not prove this to him.You can assume it as your context, though you must refer to that knowledge whennecessary.Many writers make the mistake of being neutral about their audience’s context.For example, an author knows that his audience holds a certain viewpoint, yet hewrites as if the audience were neutral. He ignores the prior context ofknowledge he needed in order to begin to write the article and falsely concludesthat his audience lacks it too. This can create confusion in the reader’s mind.On the other hand, suppose that because you know Hubert Humphrey was a proponentof government interference in the arts, you decide this fact is self-evident andrefer to his bad influence without ever citing his views. That too would beignoring the nature of your audience’s knowledge. To denounce Humphrey, you mustinform your readers of his involvement, since you are enlightening them aboutthe history of this kind of government interference. Do not assume they know hisrole in it.For every part of your article, know what your context is and whether yourreaders have it too. Ask yourself what you can omit and of what you must informthem. This is how you reach an accurate judgment of what you need to tell yourreaders. Incidentally, it is always safer (at least on the first draft) tooverexplain than to under-explain. When in doubt, include the information,because in editing you can always shorten or eliminate the passage.An important principle here is that man is born tabula rasa. Writers oftenassume something is self-evident, since they themselves now take it for granted,when in fact it is complex. Nothing is self-evident except the evidence of yoursenses. Therefore, when you write, assume nothing is self-evident but logic.(Logic is actually not self-evident. but in order to communicate, you mustassume a person knows how to make logical connections.) For the rest, since noknowledge exists at birth, you must judge what acquired knowledge is necessaryto make your point understandable—and then you must communicate it.A corollary issue is that when your subject is controversial, you must takecognizance of any prevalent errors. This is not an issue of whether people agreewith you or not, but of recognizing that if certain errors are widespread in aculture, your best readers may not know how your views apply to those issues.For example, in Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, at the end of eachchapter I refer to some current error to indicate how my position applies. Inchapter 4, for instance, when I finish my discussion of measurement, I mentionpsychologists who measure kneejerks rather than deal with psychologicalprinciples, and mystics who object to anything important being measurable. Neverassume your readers will make such connections automatically, particularly ifyou are presenting something new. Of course, you cannot cover every implication,but you can indicate the leading ones.But make sure, in touching on these errors, that you are not misunderstood. Indealing with an issue on which your position is different from the commonly heldview, you must have enough space to make your point fully clear. If you do not,it is better to omit the topic entirely. The mistake beginners often make, inwriting about a subject which they can present very clearly, is to bring in somecontroversial issue in passing, perhaps as an example. This only createsconfusion. I do not mean that you should not raise such issues—only that youshould not do so as a sideline, when you are unable to present your fullviewpoint clearly.Whether you write for an Objectivist publication or for TV Guide, you must judgehow much your audience knows. But always address yourself to the best of thataudience.A “type of audience” is an abstraction. Concretely, you will find evaders andpeople with dreadful psycho-epistemologies in any audience (including anObjectivist one). The cognitive level of your readers does not determine theirpsycho-epistemology. Children can make a more intelligent, better focusedaudience than professors. Therefore, do not give any consideration whatever tothe possibility of bad psycho-epistemologies. Once you have projected youraudience’s level of knowledge, address yourself to the best, most focused mindthat you can imagine in that cognitive group.It is improper to address yourself to a faulty psycho-epistemology. Devising arational method to address the irrational is a contradiction. If some of yourreaders are irrational, there are no principles by which to decide what theywill choose to hear, what they will not, and what connections they will make.Neither you nor the evader can predict what he will miss and what he willintegrate. That is in the nature of irrationality.So do not psychologize. Do not make allowances for readers’ mental weaknesses.For example, do not tell yourself: “I’m saying something new or antagonistic—howcan I prevent their minds from closing? How can I soften the blow?” If you asksuch questions, you will only paralyze your own mind by attempting theimpossible. You cannot reach a mind that chooses to be closed or is soincapacitated that even if, momentarily, it wanted to integrate properly, itcould not. Such a mind lacks the capacity of full focus, and is the properconcern only of a psychotherapist. In all dealings with people, you have to dealwith their conscious minds.In writing, assume full rationality. Assume your audience is at its best andthat you have to live up to it. That is, establish your general view of theaudience, and then proceed as if you were writing to yourself as a member ofthat audience—at your best, most perceptive potential. You must project the mostcognitively severe mind—and the only mind that you can project completely isyour own at its most consistent, clearest level of functioning. In that sense,write as if you are trying to convince yourself.To achieve objectivity and clarity, ask yourself how you would make somethingclear to a person as severe as you are. Project the process by which you wouldconvince yourself. Assume you do not know your material and must discover itfrom the article alone. Be as rigorous as if your article were written by astranger. If you are not—if there are faults in your thinking—it will bereflected in your writing. (This is one way writing helps yourpsycho-epistemology, and vice versa. The better your psycho-epistemology, theeasier writing will be.)This process is the opposite of subjectivism; and it is a difficultresponsibility, because you might easily think: “If I write for myself, I knowwhat I want to say, and therefore anything I write will be clear to me even froma few shorthand notes.” But what is required in writing is strict objectivity.That is why I said you must write to yourself as if you did not know thesubject.Use your own psychology as a reader to guide yourself as a writer. Whenquestions occur to you, your best reference, if you are objective, is yourself.The ability to switch perspective between that of the writer and that of thereader (of the finished product), is the best training in objectivity. It isalso good training in editing—whether your own work or that of others. Switchingperspective helps, because there are so many problems in writing, and you may beso overwhelmed by the number of considerations, that you can lose your abilityto judge your work. It is helpful in this situation to step back and ask: “Howwould I judge it if I were reading it?” This clears your mental circuits of allthe unresolved complexities of writing, and gives you a fresh perspective as areader.For example, if you hesitate about whether to include a particular detail, theultimate judge should be you as a reader, because there are no absolute rules insuch a case applicable to every article. Switch perspective, pretend not to knowthe subject, and ask yourself whether you would find the detail clarifying. Takeyour own answer, if it is objective, as your standard. By “objective” I meanthat you can give yourself at least one good reason why you prefer to keep thedetail or omit it. (“I don’t know why, but I feel like keeping it” does notqualify.) After all, your article is written within the context of your ownpsycho-epistemology and your own knowledge. Appealing to yourself as a readerproduces a consistent, reliable standard of judgment for the whole article. Ifyour article is to be well-integrated, the ultimate judge of what is appropriateand why has to be you.Connected to the issue of judging an audience is the issue of knowing what youwant your audience to do with your article. Or to put it another way: do nothave several purposes—and several audiences—in mind simultaneously. Be clear onthis issue, because subconsciously it will affect your whole article.Every general-interest article is written for one purpose: to communicateknowledge to the intelligent layman. You might have a different purpose—say,urging your audience to take some action; but if so, the entire article must bewritten differently, as a professional article addressed to your colleagues. Butyou cannot write for your colleagues and for a general lay audience at the sametime. If you try to combine the two types of audiences and purposes, you will begiving information to laymen and simultaneously telling your colleagues how toput this information into practice. Your article will contain contradictions inpractically every paragraph and will fall apart.For instance, if you write a general article about the methodology of education,you do it differently than if you were addressing teachers. A lay audience hascomparatively little knowledge of the subject, and has merely a general interestin those principles it can apply to its own dealings with education. Members ofa general audience would be interested in knowing, for example, how theObjectivist method differs from Dewey’s. Thus you would show that according tothe Objectivist method, teachers need to appeal to principles and concretizethem with examples, whereas Dewey’s method is concrete-bound and avoidsprinciples and integration. But teachers have a different level of motivationand interest, as well as a higher level of technicality. If you were writing forthem, you would have to provide technical details concerning how to achievecertain effects. You would discuss what type of exercises to give the class,what kinds of errors to look for, in what way the remnants of Deweyite educationwill interfere with the class’s understanding, what to do as an antidote, etc.The “how-to” approach is appropriate for the professional. But that is of nointerest to the layman. It is almost the difference between theoretical sciencefor the layman—and applied technology for the professional. The purpose forwhich you write depends on your audience.In most of my articles I do have an action-conclusion, but only in verygeneralized terms. For instance, the purpose of “America’s Persecuted Minority:Big Business”15 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-15] was to inform theaudience about the nature of our antitrust laws. It is a general enlightenmentarticle. So I give some examples, describe their history, and show why they arewrong. In the conclusion I say we should advocate the revision, and eventualrepeal, of antitrust—especially the imprisonment provision. But I am notteaching the audience how to fight antitrust; I am merely indicating a positivedirection, after having exposed a dreadful negative. Since this is a negativetrend which is becoming worse, it is appropriate to indicate (without going intodetails) that some kind of action is possible. But if I expanded my conclusionand said the reader should gather the members of his community opposed toantitrust and should communicate with me, because I am forming a committee, thatwould be improper; it would belong in an action-article. If my purpose is theorganization of such a committee, then I must write the article differently. Imust briefly summarize what is wrong with antitrust (assuming a greater level ofknowledge in my audience) and concentrate, not on the history, but on rousingpeople to action and indicating what they can do. This type of action-article iscalled a manifesto. Nothing is wrong with a manifesto per se, though you mustknow when it is appropriate. But do not confuse a manifesto with ageneral-information article.General articles are of interest to all readers because they are usually writtenon a graded principle. A specialist will get much more from such an article thana general reader, but the general reader should get something worthwhile. Toeach according to his ability—or rather, according to his knowledge. If anarticle is clear, then each person gets out of it what he objectively brings toit, namely, that which he already understands. And if the article is good, andthe reader has an active mind, it might stimulate him to inquire further aboutthe aspects he does not understand or know about. That is not the article’spurpose, but it is a fringe benefit of a good article.Since many subjects can be treated in more than one way, if you do not clearlyidentify your audience, you may be strongly tempted to write more than one kindof article simultaneously. Whatever type of article you choose to write, youmust decide—at the stage of selecting the subject and theme—who your readers areand thus what you intend to communicate to them."},{"pageContent":"4Applying Philosophy Without Preaching ItA problem many young writers suffer from, in various degrees, is the belief thatan article should be propaganda—that it should preach one’s philosophy. This isnot merely a writing problem, so I will start with the broader philosophicalissue involved in this error.First, you need to grasp that there is no such thing as Objectivism or any otherphilosophy. Philosophy is the study of the fundamental nature of reality.“Fundamental” refers to a principle or truth which is present in a vast numberof concretes. To say something is fundamental means that many other truthsdepend on it. To say philosophy studies the fundamentals of reality means itstudies those facts present in, and those principles applicable to, everythingthat exists.Every abstraction, and thus every principle, is manifested in an incalculablenumber of concretes. It is what the concretes have in common—but it does notexist apart from them. An abstraction is a form of human classification by whichman integrates the evidence provided by his senses. Man rises above theperceptual level by integrating his percepts into concepts, his concepts intoprinciples, his principles into sciences, and all of his sciences into aphilosophy. Abstractions are objective, i.e., based on reality. Butabstractions, including simple concepts of concretes, do not exist as such. Whatexists is only the material from which a concept is drawn.16[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-16]I have often said that the whole history of philosophy is a duel between Platoand Aristotle, and that this conflict is present in every issue.17[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-17] If you think principles, andtherefore philosophy, exist apart from concretes, then you are a Platonist.Plato believed abstractions are archetypes or universals that exist in someother realm, in the form of nonmaterial, supernatural entities. Now the deepestthing Objectivism has in common with Aristotle—and it has many things incommon—is this: Aristotle was the first to grasp what most people still do not,namely, that everything that exists is a specific, concrete entity, or an aspectof one, such as an action of an entity, an attribute of an entity, arelationship it bears, etc. But the base of everything is an entity—not an ideaor abstraction. An abstraction is the form in which we organize these entitiesin order to understand them.To be an Aristotelian all the way down, you must grasp that only concreteevents, concrete relationships, concrete problems exist. (If you are notAristotelian all the way down, it is no moral crime; but it will cause problems,so train yourself to be one.) For example, the same abstract problem may existin different parts of the world, and involve different people. But in each case,it is a concrete problem. Just as the abstraction “table” involves all thetables that exist—past, present, and future—so the abstract problem “man versusthe state” has occurred in practically every society in history. It is the majorpolitical problem in the world today, but it is not a floating abstraction. Itis an abstraction of relationships between man and a political system, and thoserelationships exist only in concrete forms. They exist in Russia, in Germany, inthe United States—there is man against the state in Russia, in Germany, inAmerica. But the mere fact that they are covered by the same abstraction doesnot change the fact that they are separate concretes. The abstraction involvesparticular men, in particular situations, facing particular governments. Thereis no such thing as “man versus the state” in another, Platonic dimension.When you are clear on this subject, you will be at home with abstractions. Ifyou are not, the immediate danger is that you will be concrete-bound in youractual life, and indulge in floating abstractions in your philosophicalconvictions. Until men become fully Aristotelian, they cannot apply theirphilosophical principles to their own lives and actions. So on the one hand,they may have a complex, ivory-tower philosophy, and on the other, neverthelessact like savages.Objectivists would not make such a crude mistake, but every mistake can becommitted across a continuum of degrees. So although an Objectivist would notprofess Objectivism and join the Communist Party, he might nevertheless acceptthe idea that his professed philosophical convictions exist in one department,and his daily life, judgments, and views in quite another.The root of this mistake is that often, when a person accepts certainconvictions, he does not integrate them thoroughly to the concretes heencounters. One need not think an entire issue over again each time it comes up.A thorough integration permits a person to recognize quickly when certainconvictions of his apply to some concrete fact; only in complex situations doeshe have to do fresh thinking. Nevertheless, no matter how complex or simple itis, you must deal with every issue in your life according to your philosophy,and you cannot hold your philosophy “somewhere,” apart from your daily actions.If men could live by the range of the moment—by a concrete-bound method—we wouldnot need philosophy. The purpose of philosophy is to guide a man in the courseof his life. Unfortunately, many Objectivists have not fully accepted,concretized, and integrated this principle. For example, in the presence of agiven event, work of art, person, etc., too many Objectivists ask themselves,“What do I have to feel?” instead of, “What do I feel?” And if they need tojudge a situation which I have not discussed before, their approach is, “Whatshould I think?” instead of, “What do I think?” This is the childhood remnant ofanyone who to some extent was influenced either by the religion of the cultureor, later in college, by Platonism. Both give the impression that the good, theimportant, the philosophical are like church on Sunday: you use them on specialoccasions, but they have nothing to do with daily life. If any part of thisattitude remains in you, it is important to eliminate it.Philosophy does not tell you concretely what to feel or think; it tells you whatis true and right. If you have to judge something (e.g., a work of art, agovernment policy, a personal relationship), your philosophy gives you the rightprinciples by which to judge it (if your philosophy is rational). Philosophyprovides you with a criterion—but cannot apply it for you. In judging anythingor anyone, you must decide whether it or he is good or bad.Philosophy cannot give you a set of dogmas to be applied automatically. Religiondoes that—and unsuccessfully. The dogmatic Objectivist desperately tries toreduce principles to concrete rules that can be applied automatically, like aritual, so as to bypass the responsibility of thinking and of moral analysis.These are “Objectivist” ritualists. They want Objectivism to give them what areligion promises, namely, ten or one hundred commandments, which they can applywithout having to think about or judge anything.Which philosophy is right is a separate inquiry. To discover the right one isthe purpose of studying philosophy. But once you have convinced yourself that agiven philosophy is right—that it corresponds to reality—you are armed only witha key, which will tell you by what criteria to judge a given event or person orchoice—or article. But the concretes must be judged, evaluated, and organized byyou.Now, how does what I have said apply to writing? (I am here concerned primarilywith middle-range articles, which apply philosophy to concretes.) Until a writeris fully Aristotelian, he will be unable properly to apply his philosophicalprinciples to writing. When you write a middle-range article, the properapproach is to ask: “What do I think of this subject?” “What do I want to say?”If you doubt whether what you want to say is correct, that is a separate issueand has nothing to do with your article. If you have such doubts, put yourarticle aside and do some additional thinking. But do not approach an articlewithout a clear idea of your own evaluation of the subject. Do not try to muddlethrough in a state that is partly your own evaluation and partly a ritualisticapplication of Objectivist “bromides.”I next want to discuss two errors that tend to be committed by those who are notfully Aristotelian. The first is the idea that the writer should always includepropaganda for his philosophy.Under censorship, writers have always been ingenious about smuggling inpropaganda between the lines, so that the authorities miss it. That isappropriate in a dictatorship (though somewhat foolish), but it is wrong in yourown articles, particularly if you are an Objectivist. And certainly, when youwrite for a magazine whose philosophy you share, there is no reason to smugglein your philosophy or preach it.For example, someone submitted to The Objectivist a movie review that was chaos.I could not tell whether the author was reviewing a movie or preachingObjectivist morality. The two aspects were totally unintegrated. He would saysomething about the movie, and then start into a diatribe on the evil ofpresenting such immoral people. (It was a gangster movie.) The diatribe was notintegrated with what he was saying about the movie. The author thought you couldnot review a movie of that sort without making it a platform for Objectivism. Ofcourse, it was unconvincing in regard to the Objectivist slogans he used, and itwas unconvincing as a review. He had two intentions: to say what he wanted aboutthe movie, and to fulfill his “duty” to Objectivism. Well, that was the attitudeat the height of the Middle Ages, when nothing was permitted except what led tothe greater glory of the Church.Let the Objectivism in your article come naturally out of your material and yourpresentation of it. Never make the communication of your philosophy a specialassignment—that belongs in theoretical articles only. When you write onphilosophical theory, you are preaching Objectivism in the sense that you aredemonstrating a new aspect of the philosophy. But in a middle-range article, donot attempt to sell or prove Objectivism. Do not “stick in” your philosophy.Simply use it as your implicit framework. If, for example, an Objectivist werewriting on modern art, he would not tell you why reason is good andirrationality bad, nor would he prove that reason is man’s means of survival.His condemnation of modem art would be based on the fact that he expects reasonin the arts. For the purpose of the article, he would take this as an axiom,though it certainly is not; it would take a long development to prove thatreason is important. But the article, in presenting the irrationality of modemart, would imply in every line that irrationality is evil and ridiculous, andthat reason is important and good. The author would apply those aspects ofObjectivism that are relevant to art. Such an article is not a propaganda piece.It is written from a philosophical frame of reference which gives it unity andcoherence. But its purpose is only to tell you the state of modem art.In preparation for this topic, I went over some of my articles to find anexample of not bringing in Objectivism. I did not find one: I propagandize forObjectivism constantly, in various degrees. But I bring it in, not by provingit, but by tying a given subject to its wider implications. That is because I ama theoretician—and it is something you should not yet emulate. After you havewritten many articles, it is all right to try tricky integrations; but not untilthen, because you would get lost in the theme and the side implications.For example, in my “Brief Comment” on Apollo 8, I could have confined thearticle to the impropriety of reading the Bible from the spaceship. But I choseto bring in, at the end, a broader cultural issue, i.e., the breach betweenscience and ethics. I knew how to do it, and the article remained integrated.But I could not have done it twenty years ago. Only after finishing AtlasShrugged did I feel so at home in abstract issues that I could do trickyintegrations without confusing the reader. So do not attempt it until you haveenough experience.It is not the duty of an Objectivist writer to smuggle in something to the gloryof Objectivism, along the lines of waving the flag or a cross. When you write anarticle in which you evaluate cultural phenomena rationally, you do more forObjectivism than you could in any other form—even if you never mention reason,man, his means of survival, or any other Objectivist bromides which ritualistic“Objectivists” too often use inappropriately.The second error sometimes committed by those who are not fully Aristotelian isto believe that writing will somehow reveal evils in the writer’s ownsubconscious. But this is not so. If, for example, you are an advocate ofindividualism, and you suddenly observe that you write like a collectivist, thatis all right. That has taught you something; you have material you can correct.But to sit in fear, thinking: “I believe in Objectivism with all my soul, butwhat if the printed page shows me to be a monster?”—is to take a mysticalapproach, which indicates that you do not understand free will. There is nothingwrong in having “demons.” What is wrong is evading them and doing nothing aboutthem.Some people think that when they write, they must practice Objectivist “companymanners.” Such a person guards his subconscious, because he worries that if helet himself go he might write improperly. Nothing could be better calculated tostop you from writing. In fact, the exact opposite premise is necessary. Whenyou write, you must trust your subconscious, and more: you must allow yoursubconscious to be the sole authority in the universe. Otherwise you cannotwrite. This does not mean that man is only the subconscious and that theconscious mind does not count. It is the mind that uses the subconscious. Butyour subconscious is a programmed computer, and if it is programmed incorrectly,there is no way for you to write if you repress your machine.In fact, if you have written some bad sentences, or expressed some wrong ideas,the conclusion should be not that your subconscious has demons, but that you didnot think through the subject carefully and that your subconscious is fallible.But you are there to correct the mistake. Again, there is nothing wrong inmaking mistakes. What is wrong is not correcting them. For a practical illustration and a good exercise, here is an article by JamesReston on the present college situation. Try to identify the author’s philosophyand the means by which you know it. You will thereby see how he introduces hisphilosophy (which is not mine) without preaching it. His method is, for the mostpart, correct.“The Politics of Fear and Hope” by James Reston, The New York Times, May 6, 1969The campus war never seemed more alarming than it does now, but it may bedeceptive. It has gone so far and raised so many fears on all sides that, likethe Vietnam war, it may have reached its peak and started the process ofreappraisal and accommodation.The experiment with coercion and physical force has been a disappointment toalmost everybody who has tried it. The blacks used it at Cornell and made someprogress at the start, but are still in deep trouble. The S.D.S. and theadministration at Harvard tried to solve their differences by force and it was astand-off. The resort to violence by both blacks and whites at City College inNew York produced a bloody battle and startled everybody with the prospect of aracial massacre. And while the crisis continues, at least many of the leaders onall sides are beginning to wonder.This includes the President [Nixon], the Attorney General and the morethoughtful legislators, faculty members and student leaders. They have all gonethrough a new experience. They have all now seen the dangers of confrontationpolitics, and most of them now seem to be calling for a pause andreconsideration of the current violent trend.The presidents of Harvard and Cornell, for example, have been off-campus thisweek trying to deal with the public reaction to their recent crisis. NathanPusey of Harvard has been in Washington pleading with the Congress to give theuniversities another chance to deal with their problems without politicalinterference. President James Perkins of Cornell has been in New York arguingfor patience so that he and his faculty and students can try to find new ways ofsettling their differences, and both think that they now have a good chance, notfor a solution, but for a livable compromise.The case for giving them more time to work out their difficulties withoutpolitical interference or punitive laws is strong. The university presidents,faculty members and students have learned a lot about themselves and theirproblems and need time for reflection.The Cornell situation illustrates the point. The power of disciplining studentsthere rested with the faculty, but in the public mind the responsibility fordiscipline lay with President Perkins, and this created a fundamental problem.No matter what the Negro students did at Cornell, neither the faculty nor thestudents could agree to expel the black militants or their militant whiteallies, for this would mean not only making the rebels vulnerable to legalpenalties, but leaving them vulnerable to the draft and service in Vietnam.This is what has confused the issue of authority on many campuses. Moderatestudents, faculty members and administrators clearly do not approve the violenttactics of the white and black militants, but when condemning them and expellingthem raises the question of drafting them into a war in Vietnam they oppose,they simply cannot do it.What the crisis of the last few weeks has done, paradoxically, is to make allthe adversaries in the struggle feel trapped in a wholly new and alarmingsituation which threatens them all. Most students have never been involved insuch problems before. A great many faculty members, though they were responsiblefor student discipline, had never attended a single meeting on such problems oreven heard a Negro speak on the issues. But now they have been compelled to puttheir minds to the problem for the first time. In this sense, the crisis of thelast few weeks has been important, and university administrators, faculty andstudents are just now beginning to think seriously about how to get out of thethicket.In short, Pusey of Harvard and Perkins of Cornell—to mention only twosymbols—are beginning to think about their problems in a different way. Both areobviously in deep trouble. Both are confessing that they should have anticipatedtheir problems better than they did; both have clearly been changed by thestruggles of recent days, and both are asking for time.It is a fair request. Every adversity has its uses and everybody has beenthrough the fire at Harvard, Cornell and City College in the last month, and hasbegun to think of the consequences of violence for everybody. The militant Negroand S.D.S. students, of course, disagree; they have argued that violence is theanswer, but even they are beginning to question and doubt. The crisis, as usual,has produced not only danger but opportunity, and if the reaction of Pusey andPerkins is any guide, we may be turning back toward common sense. What is Reston’s philosophy, and how do we know that?Reston believes there are no absolutes. In fact, he does not raise the issue ofright and wrong at all. For example, he treats force as merely one method mencan resort to. He is neither for nor against violence; he is neutral aboutit—and everything else. This is strong evidence that his philosophy ispragmatism. He does not pass judgment on either side—he simply says force doesnot work, and therefore we should return to common sense. The words “commonsense” are the mystical talisman of the pragmatist.According to pragmatism, principles cannot be discovered in advance. The only“principle” is that human beings have to act. But anything is permissible,because we cannot know in advance what is right. So Reston would never say, asan absolute, “Force is wrong and respect for individual rights is right.” Hewould say, “If force does not work, one should not use it. If rights create apeaceful, prosperous society, then we should protect them—if that is what wewant.” That is pragmatism.Reston says the request for time is fair—that until they came to actualviolence, neither the students, nor the faculty members, nor the administratorscould know what to do. He does not ask why the administrators needed bloodshedand destruction before they realized they had to face the problem. He sayssimply that after this experience they are different and will think in adifferent way. That is pure pragmatism. (As Leonard Peikoff pointed out to me,this is straight from the pragmatist philosopher John Dewey, who held thatthinking is a “disease.” On Dewey’s view, a person does not have to think unlesshe has a problem; it is normal and proper not to think, but to functionhabitually. But when something happens unexpectedly, which he cannot react tonormally, he lacks ease. Thus, thinking is a disease caused by a new situation,in which one’s habitual reactions do not “work.”)The reliance on emotions as a primary is another sign that Reston’s philosophyis pragmatism. He says most students, faculty members, and administrators do notapprove of violence; but when it comes to the government drafting the violentdemonstrators into war, the students et al. simply cannot allow it. This is notan issue of right or wrong—of principles. Rather, he believes that if they feelthey cannot send men to be drafted, that is an irreducible primary to which theymust adjust.Note that all of these points are good examples of how, properly, to introducean idea as an axiom. Reston never questions the idea that a person cannot knowin advance the consequences of his actions—that one must first act, then observethe consequences, and then think. That is his absolute. When you read hisarticle, you know what he is saying, though he never states it explicitly. Thatis the proper way to present a philosophy, without propagandizing, in amiddle-range article.Nevertheless, Reston’s article is somewhat dishonest (this is inherent inpragmatism) in that he does not state explicitly the conclusion impliedthroughout his article, and which he names only once, indirectly: “a livablecompromise.” My own conclusion would be that the students’ initiation of forceis the major evil, which has primacy over every other consideration. I can saythat openly. But as a pragmatist, Reston cannot say openly what he implies,namely, that the solution to every problem is compromise. If he said that, as afirm absolute, he would be contradicting pragmatism, which claims there are noabsolutes. Furthermore, he and everyone else would see that what he isadvocating is immoral.If you want to know how a pragmatist would properly propagandize, read the worksof William James and John Dewey. They wrote theoretical works devoted to provingthat you cannot know anything, that abstract principles are not valid, and thatwe must judge solely according to what “works.” To propagandize improperly, in amiddle-range article, a dogmatic pragmatist would out of nowhere bring in theoryand start preaching that you cannot know anything. He would explicitly say thatsince neither the activists nor the administrators can know anything in advance,they could not have avoided their situation, and so should be given more time.Reston’s article, though, is not propaganda. He is a commentator, writing aboutcurrent events and merely suggesting a certain viewpoint. Yet notice all that wewere able to conclude about his philosophy. So if you wrote a similar articlefrom an Objectivist viewpoint, you would not have to announce: “Because such andsuch is man’s nature, we must respect individual rights, which can be violatedonly by force; therefore I am against force.” If you tried to squeeze all ofthat in, your article would be very ineffective. In a sense, Reston is preachingpragmatism more effectively than James and Dewey—though he could not have doneit without them—because the average person reading James and Dewey takes them tomean only that you ought to be practical; he never grasps what pragmatism reallypreaches.Now, how would I write on this issue, applying my philosophy properly? In whatfollows, I do not rewrite the article; I present only a sketch of what I wouldwrite if I accepted the same structure and facts as Reston, but not the sameinterpretation of those facts.In the first paragraph, Reston says that the situation on campus is alarming,but that there may be hope. I would start by saying the situation is morealarming than ever, because the universities are now giving in to physicalforce. Then I would discuss Comell, Harvard, and CCNY. But instead of sayingthere was disappointment on both sides, though some progress was made atCornell, I would say that at Cornell the activists used force—including guns oncampus—and have so far achieved their objective. I would say that at Harvardthey used force, and the faculty gave in (on Black Studies and other demands);and, when the university made an attempt at self-defense by calling the police,the moderate students—the majority—suddenly supported the activists. I wouldthen comment that the moderates did not mind the initiation of force, only theretaliation against it. Next I would mention that at CCNY, the violenceapproached racial warfare, which is significant because the student demands weremade in the name of antiracism, and yet led to racial violence. Then I would saythat the President, Attorney General, legislators, faculty members, and studentleaders seem to object, but it is interesting that they do not know what to do.At this point I would say Pusey and Perkins, who are both in trouble, are askingfor more time. I would point out that they had warnings, and that as thepresidents of major universities they should have had some kind of programworked out. Why do they believe that if they could not solve their problems sofar, time will help them? Nothing new has happened. Therefore, their behaviorindicates that their main purpose is to pretend that the situation is not as badas it is. They are afraid of the situation, and of political interference or“repression.” So they take no sides, not even the side of self-protection. (Ifthe police offered them protection, they would not accept it.) They would rathergo on as they were, pretending they had authority and pretending they werenegotiating something. But they do not know what to negotiate, and have no meansof arriving at the answer.Then I would bring in Vietnam. Some of the reluctance on the part of themoderates is due to their opposition to the war in Vietnam, and thus theysympathize with the dissenters, who, if expelled, would be drafted. I wouldreply that quite apart from whether the draft is moral—and it is not—the realquestions are: Does such sympathy justify the use of violence by the students?Shouldn’t the objection to force be placed above sympathy for victims of thedraft law? Which is more important?Next I would say that everyone involved feels trapped—except for the activists,who are getting what they want. Why do all the others feel trapped? Here I canobserve what Reston does, but apply it in a different context. They feel trappedbecause they have no principles to tell them how to get out of this situation.They are being attacked by force, yet they have no knowledge of the appropriatemeans of dealing with force. They do not know what is right or wrong. They neverhad to think about this before because the issue never came up, but now realityis forcing them to think. Then I would ask: Does reality force men to think? IfPusey and Perkins feel they are changed, what changed them? Obviously, nothingnew has come up. They say that now they will act differently—they are beginningto think of the consequences. But by what means will they judge these?At this point I would come out in the open: Since we know their philosophy ispragmatism, it is clear that pragmatism does not work. What they need areprinciples. And I would add that in social issues, the first such principle isthe noninitiation of force.Observe that I do not bring in Objectivist propaganda, I merely raise certainquestions and evaluate certain events. Only at the end, when the events havedemonstrated it, do I say pragmatism does not work.If you did write about the same subject in the way Reston does, i.e., evaluatingthe events, ascribing motives, and prescribing policies, it would be a strongarticle. And it would sell Objectivism, but only by indirection—which is all amiddle-range article should do. Just give your audience the facts from theObjectivist viewpoint, and let their minds do the rest. A rational reader whohas never heard of Objectivism will think: “Yes, force should not be used. Infact, no social issue is more important than that. If you resort to force, therecan be no discussion, no rights, no principles.” If he draws only thatconclusion, his mind will do the rest if he is mentally active. You have givenhim a lead to further thinking.To sum up: the purpose of a middle-range article is to evaluate a given concretefrom the point of view of your philosophy—i.e., holding your philosophy as aframe of reference and taking it as a given—but not to preach it or prove thatit is right. Never try to prove your philosophy as a side issue in an articledealing with some narrow subject. If you feel that there is some aspect of yourphilosophy which requires proof, then write a theoretical article on it."},{"pageContent":"5Creating an OutlineNo beginner should write without an outline. If I could enforce this as anabsolute, I would. Most writing problems—the psychological barriers, setbacks,discouragements—come from the absence of a proper outline. One reason for thedreadful articles in our media is that they are written without outlines, andthus fall apart structurally.Good articles (regardless of whether you agree with them) are done from writtenoutlines. Experienced professionals can work from mental outlines (if thearticle is brief enough), but that is a stage few writers ever reach, andbeginners should not try it. If you do, you will only discourage yourself andend up wondering why you cannot write.If you properly delimit your subject and theme, you have the base for youroutline.An outline is a plan of mental action. All human action requires a plan—anabstract projection. People tend to be aware of this in the physical realm. Butbecause they believe that writing is an innate talent, they think it does notrequire an objective plan. They think writing is inspirational. Yet trying towrite without an outline is even more difficult than attempting some physicalaction without a plan.You would be surprised how often you make the equivalent of an outline in yourmind for daily activities. You select a goal and the key steps that will takeyou there, and then you determine the details for each step.For example, assume you have decided to make a dress and have determined whatkind of dress it will be. That is the equivalent of selecting your subject andtheme. You then take the measurements and devise a pattern, which is youroutline. Then you cut the material, you sew it, and, finally, you embroider it.Now suppose a beginner started cutting and embroidering at the same time,without having chosen the type of dress or the material to be used. He wouldsurely get into trouble. In principle, the process is exactly the same forwriting (and for any other job).The basic pattern of an outline is that of a theorem of Euclidean geometry:state what you are going to demonstrate, demonstrate it, and then announce theconclusion. An outline, however, involves more steps and details. Also, sincethis basic pattern does not yet tell you how to organize the concretes of yourparticular subject, there are many options. (For example, you do not have tostart an article by announcing, “I am going to prove that...”) But broadlyspeaking, you should, in your outline, state your subject, set up the logicalprogression of arguments, and in conclusion state the climax.In the beginning of an article, but not necessarily in the first paragraph, youmust let the reader know what your article is about. (You could call this theintroduction.) You need not explicitly name what you are going to prove, becausethat would produce an anticlimax. But let the reader know where you are takinghim. Incidentally, by “introduction,” I mean introductory remarks—a good openingparagraph or so in which you indicate what your subject is. Do not make aspecial production of this. Introductions as such really pertain to books [seechapter 9]. As a rule, you do not need to write a formal introduction to anarticle, as some writing courses claim. That is completely artificial.The “climax” in a nonfiction article is the point at which you demonstrate whatyou set out to demonstrate. It might require a single paragraph or severalpages. There are no rules here. But in preparing the outline, you must keep inmind where you start from (i.e., your subject) and where you want to go (i.e.,your theme—the conclusion you want your reader to reach). These two terminalpoints determine how you will get from one to the other. In good fiction, theclimax—which you must know in advance—determines what events you need in orderto bring the story to that point. In nonfiction too, your conclusion gives you alead to the steps needed to bring the reader to the climax.The guiding question in this process is: What does the reader need to know inorder to agree with the conclusion? That determines what to include. Select theessentials of what you need in order to convince the reader—keeping in mind thecontext of your subject. You are not starting from a tabula rasa. If you were,your reader would not know how to read English, but you could not teach him thatwhile writing on a more advanced subject. When you ask yourself what the readerneeds to know, you ask it only in regard to your specific subject, not in regardto his general knowledge.You must also keep in mind the scale of your article. This might be difficult atfirst, but with experience it becomes easier to project how much you can cover.In the beginning, the tendency is to try to cover too much. For example, as youbegin to write from your outline, you may find that you have used over half thespace intended for your article on just the first of ten points. This happens toevery writer who attempts ambitious themes, because there is always something toadd. You discover that you actually have three articles contained in youroutline, instead of one. But with a few properly written articles (i.e., writtenfrom a proper outline), the process of gauging the size of your work becomesalmost automatic.I do not mean you can judge, to the last page, the length of your article. Butyou must have some idea as to whether you are writing a one-page article, asix-page article, or an indeterminate volume. You have to adjust the projectionof your theme to a certain size—for example, no smaller than five pages and nobigger than eight. These are not absolute figures, but an approximation. So setyourself a minimum length you can do it in and a maximum over which you must notgo. This gives you a standard for judging how detailed to make your article,what points are essential, and what points are dispensable subcategories orsidelines.It is crucial to state your theme properly to yourself. For example, the themeof “The ‘Inexplicable Personal Alchemy’ ” is: the horrible destruction of thebest among the young people in Russia and in America, and the comparison betweenthe two. Stated that way, it entails too many things. My next step was to decidewhat the key points of the subject are which convey this theme. I then listedall such points, then selected the essential ones and omitted the others. Thisdetermined what I would have to say to demonstrate my theme.The theme is the standard by which you judge whether to include or omit somepoint. Suppose you are tempted to include an interesting sideline. Ask yourselfwhether the point is necessary to demonstrate your theme. And conversely, beforeomitting something, ask yourself whether your case will be fully demonstrated ifyou omit this point. This is all part of the process of deciding on youroutline—deciding what is needed to demonstrate your theme.The logical order of presentation is also determined by the theme. After youdecide on your theme and write down the steps that will convince your reader ofit, you will see that there are some options about which steps should precedewhich. (This is still in the pre-outline stage.) But to discover the overalllogical continuity, look for causal connections among the steps of yourargument. If you retrace what you had to know to arrive at a conclusion, andthen what the reader needs to know to arrive at it, you will see that some ofthe steps are the logical consequences of earlier ones. The nearest to a rule oflogical continuity is: observe the law of causality—i.e., observe which of yourpoints depend on which.There are no rules about how long or detailed an outline should be. It dependson each individual: you must judge how detailed a plan of action you need forwhat you have undertaken.The outline’s level of detail depends on how clear the subject is in your mind,and how complex the article is. I suggest the following test. If in making anoutline you feel vaguely that some point is difficult to formulate, though you“kind of” know what you mean, then you need more detail. On the other hand, ifyou begin to feel bored—if all you need are a few lines on some point but youare writing a volume—then you are being too detailed. As in all mental activity,you are the only judge.It may help to work in layers. First make a brief outline, then, before youstart writing, elaborate on certain points and make something between a firstdraft and a bare outline. Be honest with yourself. Decide how much of a generalmap you need to make the content of your article fully clear to you, inessentials and in an orderly form, before you start writing. When in doubt,remember the purpose of the outline. It is your blueprint. Only you can tell towhat extent you should expand it and what you can leave to logical implication.Some people think an outline should be so detailed that it is almost as long asthe future article. Nothing could be worse. That is not an outline, but a firstdraft. A first draft is a long, detailed piece in which you omit the polishingof your sentences and the fancier elaborations; but it is not an outline. Ifthat is what you have written, you have skipped the outline stage. It iseasier—except in the consequences—to sit down and write a long outline; it ismuch harder to make a properly organized and condensed one.I do not mean that you must write your outline in “headline” style (i.e.,without complete sentences). That style is more appropriate to an experiencedwriter or to someone very familiar with his subject. But it can be deceptive.You may think you have clearly stated what you intend to write, and then findyourself departing from your outline because it was not precise enough. On theother hand, making an overly detailed outline is as bad as writing without one.So I urge beginners to write a brief outline, but in grammatical sentences.When you make an outline, do not write: “Introduction. Progression. Conclusion.”That is far too abstract and thus useless. You need something many levels lessabstract than that. Say you are writing an article critical of the Nixonadministration. If you put in your outline: “Introduction of my subject,” thatis too broad. Instead write, as Point 1: “Introduction—express general reasonswhy I am dissatisfied and puzzled by Nixon’s behavior so far.” That is a verygeneralized statement, which you could not use in an article, but it is specificenough for your own guidance (and it is grammatical). Then list, on a separatepiece of paper, the main points you want to cover concerning yourdissatisfaction. Assume you are dissatisfied with his stands on Vietnam,welfare, and taxes. Say you decide that the most crucial of these three—i.e.,the worst—is his welfare policy. So you list it last, for dramatic progression.(If you list your most important objection first, you will produce ananticlimax.) Thus, you write under Point 2: “Nixon’s tax policy: I shallindicate how this represents a broken campaign promise, and why it is dangerousto pursue the same tax policy as that of the Johnson administration.” These areconnected sentences, not headlines. They are just specific enough for you toknow what to present fully in that part of the article.Then under Point 3, write something like: “Nixon’s Vietnam policy: Briefly coverthe essence of what was wrong with the Johnson policy. Indicate in what wayNixon seems to be continuing the same policy. Mention what indication he hasgiven that he has no new approach.” This is abstract, but it will delimit whatyou say about his Vietnam policy. Finally, you come to the climax: hiscontinuation of the welfare state. Write under Point 4: “Welfare: He isreshuffling the various agencies without eliminating the improper services. Heis vacillating with his ‘war on poverty’ and his constant welfare-statepromises.” You might even include here: “I shall quote, for illustration,certain points.” You proceed to list the facts that show his welfare policy tobe dubious. Finally, you come to Point 5, your conclusion. Since it is acritical article, you draw some kind of conclusion in order not to leave yourreader hanging. So you might write (if this is what you have proven):“Conclusion: I think we can give him more time; I am not yet sure that hisadministration will be bad, though I have serious doubts.” Or: “I think he hasindicated enough to make me conclude that nothing is to be expected of hisadministration. He is a variant of Johnson.”You should have your conclusion in mind from the start (though not necessarilyverbatim). Know the point of your article, whether cautious optimism or warydoubts or total pessimism, before you decide to write. Then, as you make youroutline, write down your conclusion as explicitly as you can (though notnecessarily in detail), so that it is clear to you. That sets up a standingorder in your mind, which helps in the actual process of writing. It serves as areference point whenever you are in doubt during the writing, particularly aboutside issues or elaborations. It tells you whether a point you are about toinclude is necessary or not.The conclusion—the theme—is your best criterion for composing the outline; makeit explicit. Some of the greatest troubles here come from mental approximation,when you “sort of” know what you want to say. The fact is you do not know, inthe full epistemological sense, until your thought is conceptualized ingrammatical form. Until then, you have only the material which you can organizeinto knowledge. In this sense, an outline is also helpful in formalizing and,therefore, in firming up, your knowledge.A proper outline is so dependent on the nature of your theme that it isimpossible to make many absolute rules about it. A rule such as: “Give threeparagraphs to your introduction, ten to the development, and one to theconclusion” is a kind of classicism (which I discuss and condemn in “What isRomanticism?”18 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-18]). It is thesubstitution of concretes for abstractions, and it becomes an artificialstraitjacket into which you are forced to fit your material. General principlescan be stated and followed, but there are no rules for the application of theseprinciples to the concretes of a given article.What I have given you so far is positive advice. I next want to mention somecommon problems to be avoided in making an outline.THE TEMPTATION TO INCLUDE SIDELINESBy “sidelines” I mean (1) issues which are connected to your subject and theme,but are not a necessary part of them, or (2) illustrations or applications fromcompletely new areas. This danger is particularly great with middle-rangearticles. For example, you are discussing politics arid you see brilliantsidelines in physics or psychology or esthetics, and want to squeeze them in.That can destroy your article.The wider and more integrated your knowledge, the more you will be tempted toinclude sidelines. This temptation comes from a good psycho-epistemology,because you should make connections with everything you learn. Writing articles,however, is not learning, but communicating knowledge. For that, you must breakup your integrations and judge, as you make your outline, which points areessential and which are merely interesting sidelines. If they are sidelines,omit them (especially if you are a beginner).THE PLATONIC APPROACH TO LOGICAL ORDERThere is a dangerous misconception about outlines, namely, that there is onlyone possible logical order of presentation.In the sense in which an outline is like a geometric theorem, there is only oneorder. But when you write an article, you do not confine yourself to three largeabstractions, like a syllogism: premise A, premise B, and the conclusion. Anarticle does follow that broad pattern, but under each of these basic divisionsthere are many details from which you must choose. Only a very simple articlewith a very simple theme would have only one possible order of presentation. Noworthwhile subject is so simple that there is only one logical order—the oneorder which would determine every paragraph.Suppose the subject is politics. An author might think there is only one logicalorder which, if he knew it, would make him discuss elections first, taxessecond, and the welfare state third. But then he starts to wonder: “Or is it inreverse? Or maybe the second point is first and the third point second?” Etc.Many people approach this with a Platonic outlook, which holds that there isonly one “ideal” order; and too often they conclude that since they do not knowwhat it is, they will write without any order.The principles behind determining the order of an outline are abstractionssubsuming a vast number of concretes. You can establish rules about theseprinciples, but not about the use of concretes. No set of principles can giveyou the one logical order.THE CONCRETE-BOUND APPROACH TO LOGICAL ORDERMany people are concrete-bound in regard to their outline, and this approachaffects the structure of their articles. Such writers see an article as a seriesof separate points. For example, Point 1 may lead logically to Point 2, butPoint 2 has no relation to Point 3. Point 3 may be connected to Points 4 and 5,but one does not know why Point 6 is included. Consequently, logical connectionsmight be made from paragraph to paragraph, or from one sequence to another, butthe total is not well integrated. When you read the whole article, you are notsure what the author’s theme is—i.e., the article does not seem to be centeredon any particular issue.This is an error not of knowledge or content, but of writing without a properoutline. While a writer should concentrate on the particular sentence orparagraph he is working on, the concrete-bound author has a totally nearsightedview. He loses sight of the article as a whole. He does not keep in mind thecontinuity of the total, i.e., the relationship between each sequence and allthe others.A well-integrated article requires an outline that is detailed enough to beclear, but not so detailed that it fails to isolate the essentials. Theessentials are needed for you to retain that abstract integration during theentire writing process.MISTAKING RELEVANCE FOR LOGICAL CONTINUITYSome beginners write the outline as if they were throwing disconnected pieces ofthought down on paper. For example, an author decides to write on capitalism. Hehas a wide context of relevant ideas, and begins to write almostinspirationally. His only sense of continuity is some loose relevance tocapitalism. He thinks that somehow all the pieces will integrate into a coherentpoint. There is nothing wrong with mulling over a subject in this loose way—ifyou are thinking about it and not yet writing. But never take that process asthe equivalent of an outline, because it is the opposite.I would like to suggest the following exercise. I will present a brief articleof mine. Your assignment is to make an outline of it in a form sufficient foryou to write from. My purpose is to help you learn how to analyze or reconstructsomething already written, so that you can then reverse the procedure and makean outline on your own. (Afterwards, I will provide the outline I used inwriting it.)In my outlines I use a headline style, rather than full grammatical sentences.After much experience, you can use a shorthand too and know its exact meaning.But at the beginning, in order to automatize the outline-article relationship,use full sentences.As you read the following article, write down its essentials. This enables youto see the overall logical order of the presentation, and to avoid beingconfused about why one paragraph follows another.Here is the article:“Doesn’t Life Require Compromise?”19 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-19]A compromise is an adjustment of conflicting claims by mutual concessions. Thismeans that both parties to a compromise have some valid claim and some value tooffer each other. And this means that both parties agree upon some fundamentalprinciple which serves as a base for their deal.It is only in regard to concretes or particulars, implementing a mutuallyaccepted basic principle, that one may compromise. For instance, one may bargainwith a buyer over the price one wants to receive for one’s product, and agree ona sum somewhere between one’s demand and his offer. The mutually accepted basicprinciple, in such case, is the principle of trade, namely: that the buyer mustpay the seller for his product. But if one wanted to be paid and the allegedbuyer wanted to obtain one’s product for nothing, no compromise, agreement ordiscussion would be possible, only the total surrender of one or the other.There can be no compromise between a property owner and a burglar; offering theburglar a single teaspoon of one’s silverware would not be a compromise, but atotal surrender—the recognition of his right to one’s property. What value orconcession did the burglar offer in return? And once the principle of unilateralconcessions is accepted as the base of a relationship by both parties, it isonly a matter of time before the burglar would seize the rest. As an example ofthis process, observe the present [1962] foreign policy of the United States.There can be no compromise between freedom and government controls; to accept“just a few controls” is to surrender the principle of inalienable individualrights and to substitute for it the principle of government’s unlimited,arbitrary power, thus delivering oneself into gradual enslavement. As an exampleof this process, observe the present domestic policy of the United States.There can be no compromise on basic principles or on fundamental issues. Whatwould you regard as a “compromise” between life and death? Or between truth andfalsehood? Or between reason and irrationality?Today, however, when people speak of “compromise,” what they mean is not alegitimate mutual concession or a trade, but precisely the betrayal of one’sprinciples—the unilateral surrender to any groundless, irrational claim. Theroot of that doctrine is ethical subjectivism, which holds that a desire or awhim is an irreducible moral primary, that every man is entitled to any desirehe might feel like asserting, that all desires have equal moral validity, andthat the only way men can get along together is by giving in to anything and“compromising” with anyone. It is not hard to see who would profit and who wouldlose by such a doctrine.The immorality of this doctrine—and the reason why the term “compromise”implies, in today’s general usage, an act of moral treason—lies in the fact thatit requires men to accept ethical subjectivism as the basic principlesuperseding all principles in human relationships and to sacrifice anything as aconcession to one another’s whims.The question “Doesn’t life require compromise?” is usually asked by those whofail to differentiate between a basic principle and some concrete, specificwish. Accepting a lesser job than one had wanted is not a “compromise.” Takingorders from one’s employer on how to do the work for which one is hired, is nota “compromise.” Failing to have a cake after one has eaten it, is not a“compromise.”Integrity does not consist of loyalty to one’s subjective whims, but of loyaltyto rational principles. A “compromise” (in the unprincipled sense of that word)is not a breach of one’s comfort, but a breach of one’s convictions. A“compromise” does not consist of doing something one dislikes, but of doingsomething one knows to be evil. Accompanying one’s husband or wife to a concert,when one does not care for music, is not a “compromise”; surrendering to his orher irrational demands for social conformity, for pretended religious observanceor for generosity toward boorish in-laws, is. Working for an employer who doesnot share one’s ideas, is not a “compromise”; pretending to share his ideas, is.Accepting a publisher’s suggestions to make changes in one’s manuscript, whenone sees the rational validity of his suggestions, is not a “compromise”; makingsuch changes in order to please him or to please “the public,” against one’s ownjudgment and standards, is.The excuse, given in all such cases, is that the “compromise” is only temporaryand that one will reclaim one’s integrity at some indeterminate future date. Butone cannot correct a husband’s or wife’s irrationality by giving in to it andencouraging it to grow. One cannot achieve the victory of one’s ideas by helpingpropagate their opposite. One cannot offer a literary masterpiece, “when one hasbecome rich and famous,” to a following one has acquired by writing trash. Ifone found it difficult to maintain one’s loyalty to one’s own convictions at thestart, a succession of betrayals—which helped to augment the power of the evilone lacked the courage to fight—will not make it easier at a later date, butwill make it virtually impossible.There can be no compromise on moral principles. “In any compromise between foodand poison, it is only death that can win. In any compromise between good andevil, it is only evil that can profit.” (Atlas Shrugged.) The next time you aretempted to ask: “Doesn’t life require compromise?” translate that question intoits actual meaning : “Doesn’t life require the surrender of that which is trueand good to that which is false and evil?” The answer is that that precisely iswhat life forbids—if one wishes to achieve anything but a stretch of torturedyears spent in progressive self-destruction. Here is the outline I used in writing the article: Subject: the moral meaning of compromise.Theme: the evil of compromise.1. Definition of compromise. Need of basic principle as ground for propercompromise.2. Impropriety of compromise on basic principles.3. Modem view: ethical subjectivism. All desires are equally valid.4. Cause of confusion is failure to differentiate between abstract basicprinciples and concrete wishes. Examples of what does and does not representcompromise.5. The metaphysical meaning of compromise on moral principles.This is not the way a beginner should construct an outline, because it is notdetailed enough. But it is easy to follow, and it is necessary for organizingthe details. It will be easier on you if you first establish such a broadoutline, and then fill in the necessary details. Otherwise, you could miss someof them or put them in the wrong place.Sometimes an author becomes too abstract because he has not quite decided whatdetails he will use to illustrate something, and so he begins to assert thearbitrary. On the other hand, a writer can add good details but in such adisordered way that they do not integrate into one structure. The broad outlineprotects against both errors.Here is how a beginner might expand the outline I used. He could, for example,include the actual definition of “compromise” in Point 1, as well as whatunderlies it. For instance:1. Definition of compromise: an adjustment of conflicting claims by mutualconcessions.a. Need of basic principle as ground for proper compromise.b. Presuppositions of a valid compromise:i. Both sides have some valid claim and some value to offer.ii. Both parties agree on an underlying principle.iii. The subject of the compromise is a concrete, not a principle.Or you could expand Point 5:5. The metaphysical meaning of compromise on moral principles. The question“Doesn’t life require compromise?” is the same as “Doesn’t life require thesurrender of good to evil?”—which is precisely what life forbids.[Editor’s note: The appendix contains more of Ayn Rand’s outlines.] I shall conclude my discussion of outlines with two methodological points.The most important one is what I call the “crow epistemology.”20[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-20] The purpose of an outline is topresent your future article in a form you can grasp as a unified whole. This iswhy I stress that each person should make his outline to suit his own purposes.The exact form of your outline will depend on the subject and theme, and on howdetailed or how abstract you need the outline to be in order to hold it all inyour mind. So first make it abstract enough so that you can hold the total inyour mind, and then, before you start writing, expand it by adding the necessarydetails. This way, you grasp the connections between the overall structure ofyour article and the more concrete outline from which you will write.Never start an article without knowing whether your structure is clear,organized, and properly delimited. If the abstract structure is not clear inyour mind, you cannot hold in mind the overall view of your article or decidewhat belongs in it, so problems will arise. For example, you will be tempted togo into sidelines—and the article will fall apart.Whenever you have a mental outline that is too narrow and detailed, tellyourself: “This is my subject. This is my material. Now, what exactly am I goingto do?” Step back and look at the total. To “step back” means to look at thenext level of abstraction. In effect, you condense your material, by essentials,as you ask yourself: “What am I actually doing?” You step back and look moreabstractly at the same content—as abstractly as necessary in order to hold theoverall view in your mind. When you reach that stage, you are in control.This is actually the pre-outline stage. You start from scratch with a certainsubject and theme, and a lot of material which is not yet organized in yourmind. You then make the abstract outline, followed by the more detailed one. Ifyou cannot do it this way, make a detailed outline first and then abstract tothe general one. When you have both outlines—an overall view and a detailedskeleton—you can start the actual writing.The second methodological point is the Aristotelian concept of final causation.Among Aristotle’s four causes, the two that play a constant role in our livesare final causation and efficient causation. The latter operates at the level ofinanimate matter: a certain cause is enacted and it has certain effects. Finalcausation, however, pertains only to consciousness. (Aristotle believed it alsoapplies to nature, but that is a different issue.)By final causation, Aristotle meant that a purpose is set in advance, and thenthe steps required to achieve it are determined. This is the process ofcausation that operates in human consciousness. To do anything, you must knowwhat you want to achieve. For instance, if you decide to drive to Chicago, theroads you select, the amount of gas, etc., will be determined by that goal. Butto get there, you will have to start a process of efficient causation, whichincludes filling the gas tank, starting the car, steering, etc. You will befollowing the laws of inanimate matter. But the whole process will be a chain ofactions you have selected in order to achieve a certain purpose, namely, to getto Chicago.In no human activity is final causation more important than in creative work,particularly in writing. In order to have a good outline, and later a goodarticle, you must initiate a process of final causation. When in doubt aboutyour outline, that is the test. You set yourself a definite purpose—i.e., youname explicitly your subject and theme—and that determines what material tochoose in order to end up with an article that satisfies your purpose. It isfinal causation that determines what to include both in your outline and in yourarticle.To sum up, what you need most to make a proper outline are: (1) the concept ofan essence—and the ability to distinguish essentials from details; and (2) theconcept of causality—and the ability to establish cause-and-effect relations inthe presentation of an idea. With these as your most important guidelines, youroutline will probably be good."},{"pageContent":"6Writing the Draft: The Primacy of the SubconsciousWriting involves both your conscious mind and your subconscious. This is animportant psycho-epistemological fact affecting every stage of writing. Withoutthe use of your subconscious, you cannot write (or speak). While completeknowledge of the role of the subconscious does not yet exist, there are helpfulprinciples.In general, writing problems come from not knowing when to use your consciousmind and when to rely on your subconscious. Of course, we use both elements allthe time: a conscious mind cannot function without the storage house of thesubconscious, and nobody can write using his subconscious alone (unless he issleepwalking). But the distinction is that when you prepare an outline and whenyou edit, you function predominantly by means of your conscious mind. Naturally,you draw on your subconscious knowledge of the subject and on any subconsciousintegrations that give you inspirational ideas—but your conscious mind directsthe process. When it comes to actually writing the draft, however, yoursubconscious must be in the driver’s seat. Your conscious mind ensures that youare in focus, know what you are writing about, and are driving in the rightdirection. But for the execution of your purpose, you rely on your subconscious.You cannot write by a fully conscious process. By “fully conscious” I mean thatyou make decisions according to your fully focused awareness. If you tried, youcould not write a single sentence. If you tried to select every word byconscious decision, it would take years, because you would have to study athesaurus for each one. Moreover, by the time you selected a couple of words,you would have forgotten what you wanted to say.As an experiment, make yourself self-conscious and try to tell someone what youdid this morning. Focus on what you are saying—on whether you are selecting theright words, the proper sentence structure, etc. You will stutter helplessly andbe unable to finish a sentence. The same happens if you write by suchoverfocused, over-conscious means. To speak or write, you must rely on yoursubconscious, automatized integrations.When we speak, it feels as if the words come automatically—as if the words andthoughts come simultaneously. Of course, they do not. If you observe childrenlearning to speak, or yourself learning a foreign language, you discover thatlanguage is not innate and automatic, but an acquired skill. It is so wellintegrated at the adult level, however, that the transition from the thought youwant to express to the words you use to express it is automatic.In writing, you need to establish the same kind of connection between yoursubconscious and the words you put on paper. Since any subject involves manycomplexities, the connection will never be quite so automatic or perfect. Thatis why editing is required. But while you are writing, do not act as an editorat the same time. Do not be self-conscious while writing. When you begin towrite your first draft, let the words come automatically. Do not think over yoursentences in advance and do not censor yourself.If you want your overall style to be natural and consistent, do not beartificially stylized in the process of writing. Write directly from yoursubconscious, as the words come to you. Your writing might be primitive or evenungrammatical, but that can be corrected later.Your outline sets the direction, and thus the standing orders, for yoursubconscious. You know your subject and what you want to say about it. But whenit comes to how you are going to say it, you must trust your subconscious as itis.It is a contradiction to think you can do better than your own mind, yet that iswhat the overcritical approach amounts to. No matter what the state of yoursubconscious—whether or not you have the requisite writing skill and knowledgeof the subject—it is your only tool. So do not demand the impossible ofyourself. Do not set a preconceived standard of what to expect from your subcon,scious. You can apply editorial principles consciously, later; but if you do itin the process of writing, it will be torture and you will achieve nothing. Whenyou edit, you can conclude that your subconscious was not functioning well, andeven arrive at principles for self-improvement. But while you are writing, youmust adopt the premise: my subconscious, right or wrong. You must let yourautomatic connections function, because you have no others.The subconscious is not an entity with a mind of its own. It is like a computerand will do what you consciously order it, within the limits of its knowledgeand training. In the process of writing, you will discover (if you introspectwell) how sensitive your subconscious is and how careful you must be in usingit. For instance, your subconscious will reflect exactly what your greatestconcern is. If you focus on whether people will like your article, what it willdo to your self-esteem, whether it is beautiful, etc., you will not squeeze outa sentence an hour, and will wonder why your thoughts do not flow freely. Thereason is that your subconscious is obeying you. If you are concerned with anestimate ahead of the facts, it will obey and will not be interested in writing.It will be busy with self-esteem problems (e.g., whether your writing revealstalent) or editorial problems (e.g., whether you write beautifully). As aresult, you will be paralyzed.When you write, be as conceited as you can be—“conceit” is not the right word,but I want to overstate the point. You must have total self-esteem. Leave yourself-doubts behind when you sit down to write—and pick them up again, if youwish, during the process of editing. Sometimes your writing will give you reasonto feel some self-doubt afterward (but this should be temporary, if you aredisappointed in what you read the next day). But while you are writing, you mustbe God’s perfect creature (if there were a God). Regard yourself as an absolute,sovereign consciousness. Forget that man is fallible and that you might makemistakes. That is true, but it is for the next day, when you edit.Trust your subconscious by writing as if everything that comes out of it isright. This is an advance vote of self-confidence. It is not self-delusion,because it is true in this respect: the freer your mind, the more clearly youwill see its exact capacity and knowledge on a given issue. If you rely on yoursubconscious without repression or self-doubt, you will discover the best yoursubconscious can do. For the purpose of your writing, in fact, there is nothingother than the process of your own creative subconscious, and you must trust it.You cannot do any better spontaneously. You can do better when you edit, butwhen writing, keep going without looking back.Your conscious mind while writing should be concerned with your subject. Youmust focus, with full confidence in your ability to say something important, onthe subject and theme—and let your subconscious provide the words to expressexactly what you want to say. The decisions concerning what you want to say andin what order have been made beforehand, in your outline—and any doubts you haveshould be reserved for the outline. But since an outline is very abstract, youcannot know in advance exactly what you will say. That comes only during theprocess of writing. To perform that process effectively, make your subject clearto yourself as you write—as clear as possible without pausing on every sentence.This is what it means to trust your subconscious. Give your subconscious thestanding order that you are concerned only with your subject and the clearestpresentation of it possible, and let that be the absolute directing yourwriting. If something bothers you on the periphery of your consciousness—somedistraction or self-doubt-ignore it; if it is serious, stop writing. But do notattempt to write with half your mind on the subject and the other half onirrelevant problems.The simplest sentence requires your subconscious connections—and thus a clearknowledge of the subject. To write even a short article, you must know much morethan you put on paper. For a book, you must know the equivalent of ten books, sothat you can exercise selectivity and be sure about what you say. But if youtell your subconscious: “I sort of know my subject, and while writing I’llfigure out what’s unclear when I come to it,” you will never come to it. Yoursubconscious will stop, because it will not know what to tell you.Someone asked me the following question: Should you have all your ideas thoughtout before you begin the first draft, or can you learn as you are writing? Andmy answer is that you can sometimes do the second accidentally—but God help youif you attempt to do it deliberately. Do not try to do your thinking and yourwriting at the same time. A clear outline helps you avoid this problem. Whileyou are writing, it allows you to focus your attention exclusively on conveyingyour thoughts in an objective, grammatical form.These are two separate jobs: the job of thinking and the job of expressing yourthoughts. And they cannot be done together. If you try, it will take you muchlonger, and be much more painful, than if you did each one separately—becauseyou are giving your subconscious contradictory orders. You are saying: “I haveto express something—but I do not know what.”It is true that you might start writing with a full understanding of yoursubject, and some new aspect suddenly occurs to you. You might put down acertain formulation, which then raises a question you never faced before. Thatis a normal process. And it would be perfectly appropriate to stop writing andthink this question over. Or you might even inspirationally get the answer rightaway. But never start with a question mark in your mind.In the process of writing, it is crucial not to stop for too long (andpreferably not at all). For instance, if you have two hours assigned to writing,write during that time without stopping. (No one besides a hack can write formuch more than two hours straight, except when there is unusual inspiration atthe end of a work.) If you can write continuously, chances are that your workwill require the least editing. But if you pause after every sentence to rereadand rewrite it, you will have a lot of trouble in editing. One of the deadliestobstacles to good writing is critical overconscientiousness exercised during theprocess of writing.If, as you write something, a better way of saying it spontaneously occurs toyou, make the change. That is still a subconscious process: your subconsciousgave you preliminary data and then fed you more refined data. But if the changerequires a switch to a conscious state, do not do it.I find the best way to write is not sentence by sentence (more on that errorshortly), but sequence by sequence. By “sequence” I mean a subdivision of youroutline. Since an outline is broken up into sequences, each point of an outlinestands for a certain progression of thought. The best way to write is by suchsequences, unless a given point is too lengthy.Take a look at your outline before you start, and then do not stop yourself—donot edit, and do not look at your outline—until you finish that sequence. Forexample, suppose the first sequence of your outline, Point 1, is called“Presentation of the General Subject,” and you know what you want to say. Startwriting and do not stop until you are ready for Point 2. Then you can look atyour outline and see what the second sequence is, etc.This suggestion is not an absolute. If you find yourself confused or stymied—forexample, because you went off on a sideline—then you may need to stop and checkyour outline. But short of such necessity, for rapid and well-integrated writingdo not look at your outline too closely. Train yourself to write from anabstraction. If you constantly consult the same point in your outline, you willfind your words stilted; after repeating the generalized sentence from youroutline., you will have nothing more to say. The reason is that you have givenyour subconscious the order to say only what you wrote in your outline.Your outline sets the direction. Keep that direction firmly in mind, but leaveyourself free to express each point fully. I cannot literally teach you to write. I can provide only a set of shortcutsthat are helpful as general principles. These shortcuts will save you frombewilderment and from having to discover them slowly by yourself. To this end,there are a few errors or problems I want to warn you against, all involving therole of the subconscious in writing.THE SQUIRMSThe “squirms” is a term coined by my husband, Frank, for a state of writingwhich is universal. It describes the following situation: you are writing, andsuddenly, on a given sequence or chapter, you find yourself completely paralyzedmentally. This strikes at unexpected moments.In writing Atlas Shrugged, for example, there were difficult sequences, and Iwas prepared for trouble; but when I got to them they almost wrote themselves.Then there were sequences which I thought were perfectly clear in my mind, butwhen I got to them, I found myself stopped for days. I could neither write norgive up the attempt.My husband called this the squirms simply by watching my behavior. I usually donot discuss my writing troubles during such periods. But Frank can tell, becauseit is an inner agony. It is probably the worst experience, psychologically, thatI know of. But when you solve the squirms, it loses all reality and the finalresult is worth the effort. That is the only consolation I can give you for oneof the worst penalties of writing.I asked many writers about this problem, and they all experienced it, with theexception of two Hollywood hacks who worked from 9 to 1, produced the samenumber of pages every day, and never had any trouble. Of course, this lack ofsquirms showed in their work. But writers of ability all go through the process.There is a good book by Eliot Hutchinson entitled How to Think Creatively,21[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-21] in which he discusses the squirms ingreat detail. He has his own terminology—for example, he calls the point atwhich this inner conflict ends “the moment of insight”—but it is the sameprocess no matter what you call it. He has some good descriptions of it and someproper advice to give.Let me describe what the squirms feel like. You find, suddenly, that yoursubconscious does not function. You know, consciously, what you want to say, butsomehow the words do not come. One sign that you are in this state is thatsuddenly you write like a high school student. Everything comes out in thatflat, “the-cat-is-on-the-mat” style, like a dry summary, wooden and artificial.Yet your writing lacks even the virtue of clarity. I do not try to write morethan two sentences in that state. If you force yourself, you will have spent aday in agony, only to discover the next morning that you can use nothing of whatyou wrote.The squirms make you feel ignorant about writing. During such periods, Iliterally felt that it was impossible to write. I told myself consciously that Ihad written before; but emotionally, in that moment, I felt I had lost the veryconcept of writing. Simultaneously, you feel as if the solution is right there,and that if you tried harder you would break through. It almost makes you feelguilty, because it feels as if there is something you could do if you reallywanted to—and you want to desperately, but can do nothing.Most of Atlas Shrugged was written that way. I had worse squirms on that bookthan on anything I ever wrote, even though I knew much more about writing than Idid when I wrote The Fountainhead or We the Living. In writing Atlas, Idiscarded five pages for every one that I kept, and it was torture. There werecertainly inspirational passages—passages that wrote themselves—but only as arare reward.If you write something at all complex, you will experience the squirms in oneform or another. The main reason for it is a subconscious contradiction. On theconscious level, in my case, I would create an outline, and my subject and themewould be perfectly clear to me. Only there were so many possibilities of which Iwas not aware—so many different ways of executing the theme—that my consciousmind in fact had not chosen clearly. Because of the complexity of the theme, Icould not select clearly, in advance, from the many possibilities; hence, therewere problems for my subconscious.I had terrible squirms in writing Atlas because of the complexity of theintegrations in that novel. I had to proceed slowly, because there was much moreto integrate than in The Fountainhead, for instance. If you compare the twonovels, especially their themes and sentence structures (i.e., what thosesentences have to carry), you will observe that in Atlas I had to do much more.It was a process of constant writing, polishing, and rewriting, until I got allof those intentions into one scene or one page.Another reason was that the background of Atlas was not familiar to me. AlthoughI had done sufficient research, there was a strain in projecting how a scientistwould feel, how Dagny Taggart would feel running a railroad, etc. After all, Iwas not writing naturalistically from my own experience. Now I had had to do thesame kind of research for The Fountainhead, since architecture is not myprofession, but that was only one profession. In Atlas, I wrote from theperspective of many different professions, none of them my own (except HughAkston’s, in part, and he is a minor character).Whenever you experience the squirms, some clash of intentions occurs on thesubconscious level, as if your inner circuits were tied in knots. You feelparalyzed because your subconscious is struggling with a contradiction, butsince it is on the subconscious level, you cannot identify it immediately.On projects simpler than a novel, the problem could be a contradiction in whatyou want to say about your subject. Suppose there are two closely relatedaspects of your subject. Subconsciously you may vacillate between these aspects,thereby short-circuiting your subconscious. It is a problem of uncertainty.Although you think you made a clear decision about what to say, when it comes toelaborating it on paper you are uncertain, and this paralyzes your subconscious.Another possible source of the squirms is a lack of knowledge. For example, on agiven passage, you find you have insufficient knowledge to deal with aparticular aspect of your subject. This stops you suddenly; you need an example,say, and cannot come up with one, or you are not sure whether a particularsub-clause is correct or not, etc. Your subconscious is not sure what to do, andso you are stopped dead. A related reason is indecisive thinking about yoursubject. You decide approximately what you want to say, and in making youroutline it seems sufficient. But when you write, you realize suddenly that morethinking is required on a certain point; again, you are stopped.You cannot discover these problems introspectively when they first occur,because your subconscious functions lightning fast, like a computer. It cangrasp what you have not grasped consciously. That is, if you give yoursubconscious contradictory orders, it does not hold on to that contradiction;rather it instantly identifies the implication of contradictory orders—and shutsdown.Solving the squirms is perhaps the most painful part of writing. You must stopwriting when they occur, but continue to work on the problem. To the best of myknowledge of psycho-epistemology, there is no other way out. The worst thing todo is to think that since it is a subconscious problem, you can take a rest,read a book, go to the movies—and let your subconscious resolve the problem. Itwill not. If you take a break of that kind, you prolong the agony. And thelonger you postpone the problem, the less chance you have of solving it.The problem can be solved, but it must be done consciously. You must sit at yourdesk and think about it, even when you feel you do not know what to think. Foran exercise in free will and will power, this is the hardest thing you candemand of yourself, but it is the only solution.As you consider the various aspects of the problem—what is the obstacle, what doyou want to say, should you try another approach—you think of different ways ofsolving it, each one ending in a blind alley. But do not get discouraged; as youconsider and discard various possibilities, you are actually untangling the knotin your subconscious.If you have a tendency to feel unearned guilt, you will certainly feel it at theend of such a day. I never feel it, except in a state of squirms. But I know howto localize it. I know consciously that this is a technical, professionalproblem, and not a reflection on my self-esteem. Therefore, above all, do nottake the squirms as an indication of your intelligence or writing talent orself-esteem.While trying to solve the squirms, you feel as if you are accomplishing nothing.But in fact, while you struggle with the problem, you are eliminating confusionsor contradictions in your mind. After three long days of work, for example, youmay wake up the next day knowing you have to start the struggle again. You haveno clue to the solution when you start on one more possibility, but suddenly youhave the right idea. It is like a revelation from another dimension, though youknow it is not. (This is one reason so many writers talk about inspiration fromGod or a spirit that moves the hand.) You become eager to write and it goesbeautifully. When your final attempt breaks through and clarifies everything, itis not an accident. It was made possible by those days of torture and falsestarts. That work was not wasted, even though at the time it felt as if it were.You untangle the knot in your mind by eliminating wrong possibilities. Thus youhave set your subconscious free to integrate, and the sudden “revelation” is thesubconscious finally integrating the right elements. As Hutchinson points out inHow to Think Creatively, it is like the accident of Newton’s apple. He says thataccidents happen to those who deserve them. He explains that if Newton had notworked on the law of gravitation, the apple falling on his head would haveaccomplished nothing. Newton had the knowledge, but was not yet able tointegrate it. The apple falling on his head at the right time permitted thefinal integration of all that complex material. (I have heard that this applestory is not true. But true or not, it is the best illustration of the creativeprocess; it applies equally to writing and every other creative activity.)Solving the squirms requires integrating an enormous range of material, whichmay not happen immediately because of the number of wrong possibilities. Yourmind can handle only so much at a time. At the right stage, however, one eventcan suddenly resolve the problem and reveal what kind of integration isnecessary.(Sometimes a writer has a personal problem unconnected to writing that he putsaside in order to write. He forces his mind away from the problem, yet it ismore important to him than he realized. It occupies his subconscious, andtherefore he has nothing to write with. If that happens to you, stop and solvethe problem. As you gain experience, it will be easy to identify whether theproblem is one of writing or a distraction from outside. The real squirms arethose involving the writing itself.)In How to Think Creatively, Hutchinson says he knows of no other solution tothis problem than to keep trying and to remember that it is a necessary part ofany creative process. He recommends that you maintain the conviction that youcan solve the problem. I was startled when I read this, because I had reachedthe same conclusion through introspection. So far, there is no way known toavoid the squirms. But if you view them as a professional hazard and maintainyour calm in the face of them, that is also the best way to foreshorten thetorture. The reward, when it comes, is worth it.If, however, you tell yourself you are no good, then you may not find a solutionwithout the help of a psychologist. You are pouring oil on the fire. So do notdoubt yourself.“WHITE TENNIS SHOES”A related problem is the pseudo-squirms or “white tennis shoes.” Years ago Iread an article in The New Yorker by a writer who described what she does in themorning before writing. What she describes is universal. When she sits down sheknows she does not want to write. Here is what her subconscious does to “save”her from that difficulty. She thinks of everything she has to do. She needs tocall a friend on business, and does so. She thinks of an aunt she has not calledfor months, and calls her. She thinks of what she has to order from the store,and places the order. She remembers she has not finished yesterday’s paper, soshe does. She continues in this way until she runs out of excuses and has tostart writing. But suddenly she remembers that last summer (it is now winter)she never cleaned her white tennis shoes. So she cleans them. That is why Irefer to this syndrome as the “white tennis shoes.”Getting into the writing state is difficult, and so you might procrastinate inthis way. This is the pseudo-squirms: the normal reluctance to face an abnormaldifficulty. This is not a moral, but a psycho-epistemological, issue. A mentalswitch is hard to make, yet it occurs every time you try to write, until you getused to writing and become severe with yourself. It is difficult to do becauseof the enormous concentration required. Every person has more than one value,and there are many legitimate things you could do which are easier thanwriting—maybe not cleaning tennis shoes, but going shopping or cleaning yourapartment, for instance. Contrast these kinds of activity with a completewithdrawal from your total context and an intense concentration. The temptationto do something else is always there before you start writing.In steelmaking, a blast furnace must be heated for weeks before it is hot enoughto forge steel. A writer getting himself into the writing mood is like thatfurnace. Nobody likes to get into that state, though once you are in it you wantno other, and would probably snap at anyone who interrupted you. Authenticsquirms exist when there is a conflict: you cannot write, but neither can youtake your mind off of writing. In such a state you could not think of tennisshoes. If the house were on fire you would not want to deal with it. But in thecase of the “white tennis shoes,” you must force yourself by sheer will powerimmediately to stop procrastinating and begin writing.Let me mention another possible solution, which I learned from a good Hollywoodwriter. He told me that if he stops writing at the end of a sequence, it isdifficult to pick up the continuity the next day. So when he reaches the end, hewrites the beginning of the next sequence and then stops. I find this helpfulsometimes, but it is not an absolute. If you come to the end of a sequence andknow clearly where you want to go next, it is helpful to establish thatbeachhead for the next day’s work. But if you have not thought out the nextsequence (which is often the case), do not force yourself to go on.FATIGUEA state between the squirms and the “white tennis shoes” is authentic fatigue.This occurs when you have been working for a long time, and so are too close tothe subject and simply need a rest. The mind, like the body, needs rest. If youare struggling and your writing is stale and uninspired, take a break. Go to themovies, watch television, listen to music. Take your mind off the article, andcome back to the subject with a fresh outlook.Learn to distinguish your inner states. Decide whether you are feeling thesquirms, or the “white tennis shoes” (where you simply have to exercise willpower), or tiredness (when your mind is closed and will power will not do, sinceyou would only be torturing an overloaded computer).CIRCULAR SQUIRMSThe difficulty in writing—both in planning an article and in executing it—isthat it requires a strain in one’s thinking, in the form of what might appear tobe a contradiction.Normally, as you acquire knowledge you automatize it. You do not hold all yourknowledge in the same form in which you first learned it. Learning to speak isthe best example; all other knowledge follows the same pattern. At first youlearn words by conscious effort. You are in control of that knowledge when youno longer have to grope for words—when expressing yourself in words is sohabitual that you cannot retrace the process by which you learned them. As anadult, you cannot grasp what happens in your mind when a thought is translatedinto words as you speak. But you can trace that process, as an adult, when youlearn a foreign language. In groping for words in a foreign language, you canget an idea of what takes place in your mind when you first learn to speak. Fromthat, you can see the real nature of automatization. First you learn somethingby focusing on it consciously. You have to grope for the knowledge and then useit consciously. With repetition and the growth of your knowledge, what you learnbecomes automatized. It is not innate, though it feels that way. You have, quiteproperly, forgotten how you learned it, and all that remains is the result—theskill-which permits you to acquire further knowledge without having to stumbleover words.Knowledge is being automatized throughout your life (if you are not a case ofarrested development). You are constantly increasing the complexity and scope ofyour knowledge. To the extent to which you are in command of that knowledge, youautomatize it. For the purposes of further knowledge, you need not remember allthe syllogisms you had to go through to be convinced of something. Yourknowledge comes to feel like a self-evident primary, and you use it as if itwere that; but if you are a good introspector, you know that it is not. Thismakes writing difficult. On the one hand, everything you know has becomeautomatized. On the other hand, when you present your knowledge in writing, youmust break up that automatization.Often, you want to present a complex idea that is clear to you, and yet youcannot find the right words or do not know where to begin. A certain circularityseems to set in: you cannot present Point A without first explaining Point B,but Point B is not clear without Point A. This is natural. When you are incontrol of your subject, you hold it as an integrated, clear total. This is notsubjective, but objective. But the form in which you hold it feels subjective,so when you try to explain it to somebody you do not know where to begin.The remedy, in part, is to guard against the tendency to accept a conclusionwhile forgetting the road by which you reached it. If you know, for instance,that capitalism is the best system, you can surely remember that you did notalways know it. There may even have been times when you were tempted towardother systems. The view that capitalism is best is a conviction acquired, at theearliest, on the semi-adult level, with full knowledge coming only later. Butonce you are fully convinced of it, you can operate with that knowledgeautomatically. If you read about a new law being proposed in Congress, you neednot retrace all the reasons that once convinced you of the correctness ofcapitalism. Your mind automatically refers to your conclusion as a standard, andautomatically evaluates some concrete law according to that standard.But suppose that in the middle of such automatic functioning you suddenlyquestioned why you think capitalism is best. If such a doubt entered your mindseriously, you could not judge the concretes. The automatic circuits would bebroken and you could not tell whether some law is good or bad. You would have tostop your machinery, in effect, and review the arguments that originallyconvinced you. If you met a liberal, you might find it difficult to show himthat capitalism is best. It would be hard to organize your arguments, becauseyou have forgotten the road you took intellectually to acquire this complexknowledge. You have retained, in conscious terms, only the conclusion—which isproper. But it is improper to let the underlying steps vanish from your mindentirely, because quite apart from writing articles or converting liberals, youmay encounter new arguments or tricky political situations and find yourselfhelpless. As a general rule, try to remember at least the essentials of theprocess by which you arrived at a given conclusion, so that if you have topresent that conclusion, you will have a standard for knowing what, in logic, isnecessary to defend it.What you must recall is the logical, not the biographical, process. You need notremember the actual thought process you yourself went through (though thatsometimes helps). For an orderly epistemology, what matters is logic. Forinstance, if somebody told you that capitalism is the most productive system,that would not yet fully convince you. But if he pointed out that it is the onlysystem that protects rights, or if he demonstrated that it is the only moralsystem, that argument will remain with you. This will enable you to know what isessential for a convincing article.Remember the logical antecedents—the steps that convinced you of a conclusion,which you today regard as almost self-evident. Keeping track of these stepsgives you a lead as to what to include in your article and how to delimit youroutline. It will determine what is necessary to prove a certain point, and whatare irrelevant details, elaborations, or side issues.This difficulty particularly affects people who know their subject well. Theyknow “too much,” and thus the selection becomes difficult. When you have layerupon layer of complex integrations, and need to isolate a particular aspectwithin your specialty, organizing your article and delimiting your theme may bedifficult. Whereas if, for instance, you write a spontaneous letter ofindignation to your college newspaper—I never did in Soviet Russia, because wehad no such newspaper, you can be sure—it may well be convincing. Though youknow far less than you will later, within the confines of your knowledge you aremaking your point properly, since knowledge is contextual. But when you have“too much” knowledge, you can no longer do this so easily.This does not mean that to write an article you must revise your entire methodof thinking. I am merely giving you a lead to a possible cause of trouble. Whenyou find yourself in the circular squirms—when you do not know where to beginbecause everything seems connected to everything else—take it as a sign ofwell-integrated, well-automatized knowledge, which may be causing problemsbecause you did not retain the logical steps by which you arrived at it. Thesolution is to break up the integration into its component parts, in logicalorder.If you experience this trouble in the actual writing process, rather than in theoutline, remind yourself that the circularity is only an illusion, and proceed.If you cannot decide whether Point A or Point B should be stated first, choosearbitrarily. If one is in fact better, you will discover that when you edit. Butin your draft, do not hesitate over this kind of circularity for too long. If itstops you, make a quick decision and go on.EDITING UNWRITTEN SENTENCESAn article, an outline, or a sentence does not exist until it is on paper. Thisis an absolute. It may seem obvious, but writers often ignore it and get intotrouble. They act as if they can edit a sentence before it comes into existence.Whenever your writing comes too slowly and you have to drag it out ofyourself—sentence by sentence, or word by word—the error is that you believe asentence exists in your mind or another dimension, and you can improve it beforeit exists in reality. But it does not exist. By existence, I mean objectivereality, i.e., that which can be perceived by a human consciousness. That whichexists in your own mind is only a state of consciousness. It is merely in theanteroom to existence for a creative work.Do not judge your work, edit it, or discuss it until it exists on paper.The same relationship exists between an embryo and an actual child. Catholicsclaim an embryo has the right to life, and that this supersedes the mother’slife. This is a ridiculous misapplication of the concept of rights. Rightspertain to a baby which has come into existence, not to a mere potential. In thesame way, the most beautiful future sentence, until it appears on paper, is onlyan embryo. (I have even heard people speak of a writer being “with novel.” It ismore than a metaphor.)A work in progress does not yet exist. If it is a book, some chapters may exist,but the book itself does not. When you are writing an article, some paragraphsor sequences may exist, as you put them down on paper, but the article itselfdoes not. The same principle applies to the building block of any writing: thesentence. A sentence does not exist until it is on paper. So let it be bornbefore you decide that it is deformed or should be destroyed. Fortunately, onedifference between writing and childbirth is that whereas you cannot destroy achild when it is bom, a sentence (or entire draft) can be discarded ifnecessary.The error of editing sentences before they exist occurs when, as you get acertain thought and begin putting it into words, you interrupt that crucialprocess and begin to edit. All beginners make that mistake, particularlyconscientious ones. They think maybe they can make the sentence a little better.There is a similar error people make. I know someone who went so far as to writedown a sentence with great torture, and then consult a thesaurus, looking upevery word to make sure there was not a better one. Then he would go on to thenext sentence.The mistake here is in thinking that a sentence can stand by itself, outside ofany context. But remember that Objectivism, above any other philosophy, holdscontext as the crucial element in cognition and in all value judgments. Just asyou cannot have concepts, definitions, or knowledge outside of a context, so youcannot judge a sentence out of context. All writing is contextual. The minimumstandard, or unit of judgment, in regard to a sentence is its paragraph. Buteven that is not final because it depends on all the other paragraphs.Therefore, you cannot fully and finally judge the value of a sentence until youhave finished the whole article (or, in a book, the whole chapter).So do not edit sentences before they are on paper; and for the same reason, donot immediately start editing a sentence once it is on paper. Do not go to adictionary, or wonder whether you should cut or add something, or whether itneeds clarification. You cannot judge that until you see the total.OVER-STARINGA corollary danger is too much rereading. In doing the draft, this occurs whenyou focus too much on a sentence, thereby losing your context and yourdirection. Then, to try to recover them, you constantly reread the precedingsentences. The result is that by the end of the first day of writing, you havememorized your paragraph. That is a problem all young writers suffer from.The greatest danger in regard to control over your writing is to memorize yourfirst draft. That sets it in your mind as the final expression of what you wantto say. As a result, you lose the capacity to evaluate or edit it, whichrequires that you be able to take a fresh look at your material. That is why theearliest you should edit your work is the next morning; editing requires aswitch to a conscious process, which is a different mental set.If you over-stare at a passage (as I call it), you delay for an indeterminateperiod the time when you can properly edit it. You may struggle, by will power,to edit it, but you will be handicapped: you will hear only a memorized recitalin your mind and will not be able to say whether it is good, effective, andeloquent. (The only time you should over-stare is when your article or book isin print. That kind of gloating is appropriate and enjoyable, and you can evenlearn from it.)If you do over-stare, struggle by whatever means you can to forget yourmaterial. Go so far as to pretend that you have forgotten it and try for a freshlook. Sometimes you will have to put the article aside for a week or more. Butyou will actually gain time that way, because otherwise each time you try toedit, you will become blinder to it, and eventually lose interest.PET SENTENCESMany writers save pet sentences from passages they have discarded, with the hopeof putting them to use in another work. A writer, however, must make a consciouschoice to write on a certain subject and theme, and then must program hissubconscious for that job. If, on a given sequence, his mind is more concernedabout using these brilliant pet sentences or aphorisms, it will not functionproperly, and he will torture himself. The reason is that he is interfering withhis own subconscious and trying to write by a partially conscious process. It istantamount to giving himself the following impossible order: “I want to presenta new theory of economics, with which I must integrate ethics andepistemology—and I also have sentences A, B, and C that must be included.” Thesubconscious is getting too many orders, and contradictory ones at that. It willsimply stop functioning.Keep in mind that no matter how good your pet sentences are, nothing isbrilliant outside of a context. If the context and logical progression of yourpresentation permit one of those sentences, it will come to you automatically.Your subconscious will not forget it. If it does not come automatically, then itdoes not belong in the new structure; and you cannot rework a structure merelyto feature a particular sentence. So let it go or put it down in a notebook. (Itis pleasant to save good sentences even if you cannot use them. After AtlasShrugged, I had a huge pile of discarded pages with sentences I liked. Therewere many good formulations, descriptions, and lines of dialogue that I wantedto save for future reference, though I found no use for them in the novel.)QUOTATIONSA related difficulty involves handling quotations. Writing an article thatincludes many quotations is a real strain, because it requires a constant switchbetween a conscious and subconscious progression of thought.The best way to handle quotations is to decide, while working on your outline,where you will place them. Do not pile up a lot of quotations without a firmdecision about where to use them. Otherwise you will constantly strain betweenwriting and looking at those quotations, wondering whether you should use numberone here or number three, etc. Even if you do decide in advance, when you cometo a quotation you are interrupting yourself—since a switch to the consciousmind is required—and thus will experience a certain amount of strain. But thestrain is minimal if the quotation comes when you are ready for it; all you haveto do then is copy it and continue.Incidentally, always copy the quote in your manuscript (unless it is too long)so that it becomes part of your writing. Your mind integrates the quotation, andthis gives you a proper springboard from which to continue.Some writers make the same mistake with quotations that others make with petsentences. For example, Leonard Peikoff told me that when writing The OminousParallels,22 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-22] he had a problemquoting Hegel. He had favorite quotations that did not quite fit a particulardiscussion, but they were so horrible philosophically—and thus sointeresting—that he regarded them as gems, and was eager to put them in. Theprinciple is the same as in the case of pet sentences: the requirements of yourcontext come first. Do not sacrifice logical progression for some outsideconsideration, such as a favorite quote. If you can fit it in, fine—but do notforce it.I had a problem handling numerous quotations in my article “Requiem for Man,”23[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-23] which deals with the papalencyclical Populorum Progressio (On the Development of Peoples). The subject ofmy article was the encyclical, and thus quotations played a central part. I hadto select the quotations that conveyed the encyclical’s point clearly and inessentials, while preserving the continuity of my own presentation. To objectconvincingly to the encyclical, I needed my own argument running through thequotations. In addition, I had to attemate between making an assertion about thePope’s view, supported by a quotation, and presenting a quotation, then arguingagainst it. It was a difficult job of organization, because 1 had to switch sooften between writing and selecting quotes.Here is how I did it. First I broke down the encyclical into its essentialpoints; then with colored pencils I established a code matching each color witha particular subject. I marked each relevant paragraph with the color pertainingto its subject. For example, red stood for economics, blue for politics, greenfor ethics, etc. Within each category, I selected only the most eloquent andessential quotations. I devised a system whereby each time I needed quotes on agiven subject, I decided in advance which were best, and limited my choice tothose. For instance, I started with the encyclical’s view of capitalism. I hadthree or four marked in the appropriate color, looked up only those, made aquick decision, copied the quotation, and continued writing. I did the same forevery other issue. That enabled me to integrate the reference material with therest of my writing.I prepared all this color coding before I made the final outline. I first made atentative outline and organized the quotations, then I made a final outline inwhich I numbered the quotations, which were already categorized. As I proceededto write, I could make quick selections according to those numbers. It was stilldifficult, but it was much easier than stopping each time and hunting throughthe encyclical for an appropriate quotation. So if you need to quote fromresearch material, the principle is: select the best in advance, and confineyour choice to those while writing.You may find, when you reread your first draft, that you want to add oreliminate some quotation(s). This is relatively easy, and it is better to haveto do this during editing than to give yourself too wide a choice, which leavesyou open to too much hesitation during the writing process itself.MULLINGThe mulling-over period precedes all other stages of writing. It is a process ofthinking in which you use your conscious mind to call forth certain ideas fromyour subconscious. It involves a tentative projection of a given subject andtheme. How exactly the process will work depends on your mind, your interest ina given subject, and your familiarity with it. So there can be no rules aboutthis process.If you have notes, clippings, quotations, etc., that pertain to your theme, itis certainly helpful to look them over during this period, because that helpsyou integrate your material. But there can be no rules about how often or whenprecisely to do it. As a general practice, you will find that at a certain stageof this process you need to do some reading on your subject; that may stimulateyour mind and help you to clarify your theme. But at another stage, it may bebad for you to read more, because that is when your subconscious needs tointegrate the material already there. You have to acquire the right amount ofknowledge, and then give your subconscious time to digest and integrate it. (Ofcourse, if you still feel confused, you can always do further thinking anddiscover more material.)In the mulling-over process, you—your conscious mind—are playing an instrument:your subconscious; and it is up to you to discover (by introspection) what yoursubconscious needs at which stage of writing. You must learn to trust thesignals your subconscious gives you. If you order yourself to do more readingfor a given article, but feel boredom and an enormous reluctance, it is likelythat your subconscious already has what you need, and that further research isredundant or irrelevant. By contrast, say you project what you would like toconvey in an article and even begin to make an outline, but you keep losing yourtrain of thought, as if encountering patches of fog. Chances are you have notdone enough thinking about, or research on, your subject. This is when youshould look up more material or go over your notes again.This is very general advice, because only you will be able to tell what isnecessary in each case, which will vary from article to article.PREMATURE DISCUSSIONAs a rule, it is dangerous to discuss your future article with your spouse orfriends before you finish your outline. Just as a sentence does not exist beforeit is on paper, neither does your article (not even as a potential) until youhave clarified what you want to say. It does not become firm, even in your ownmind, until you have an outline.Before you make an outline, what exists in your mind is a creative nebula, not asolar system. It is a chaos of matter which might be organized into a solarsystem. In this, the mulling-over stage, you are vulnerable to any outsidesuggestions, precisely because you have not made up your mind fully. In order towrite, you need more knowledge than you can include in any article, and whileyou are choosing what to include from that knowledge, you are vulnerable tooutside influences.There is no rule about how long the mulling-over process will last. It dependson your knowledge of the subject. Whether it is one day or several weeks, thereis a period during which you are merely playing with the subject freely in yourmind, and projecting in a flexible way what to include. This is how youcondition your subconscious to that particular subject.If you discuss your article while in this state, any suggestion seems to acquirea high level of objectivity, because it comes from outside. It is real—somebodyhas stated it—whereas your own view is still chaotic. The danger comes not froma bad suggestion, but from a good one. If the suggestion is bad, it might deludeyou temporarily, but eventually you will see through it. But suppose you aregroping and somebody gives you a valuable suggestion which, however, comes fromoutside your own context. You may consciously grasp and agree with it, but youhave not integrated it by yourself. Such a premature conclusion will act on youroutline and future article in the same way a favorite quotation or sentencedoes. The outside suggestion becomes an absolute to which you must fit yourarticle, and the result is a badly constructed piece. You will give birth to acrippled baby, with an extra leg or arm.Let me tell you how I discovered this principle. I wrote a stage adaptation ofWe the Living, which was produced under the title The Unconquered. It was aflop. The idea of making We the Living into a play was not mine. A producer whohad read the book approached me with the idea. He took an option on it, and Iwrote the play. (In the end, he could not raise enough money to produce it, butabout a year later, an actress became interested, approached me, and arrangedfor George Abbott to produce it.)I had a terrible time writing the play, and I disliked every version of it, fromthe original to the many rewrites. I became acutely aware of the fact that mypurpose in writing it did not originate with me. In addition, my reason forwriting it was to promote the book and help publicize it. (The novel had beenkilled totally by the default of the publisher; it went out of print after oneedition of 3,000 copies.) So I had a legitimate motive—only it was not aliterary motive. My primary goal and interest were not in the play as such.The play never was—and I came to realize, never could be—good. It grew out ofsomebody else’s suggestion plus my own irrelevant motive. So, no matter howconscientiously I tried, I could not make it good. The final version was more orless competent, but no better. This taught me never to write anything that wasnot my own idea. Even if it is a good idea, if it does not come out of my owncontext, I will be unable to integrate it. It will not be first-handed.Know when you are free to discuss a project. Before you start preparing anarticle, it is all right to discuss the subject. An exchange of views may helpyou clarify your own ideas. Regard it as a general discussion of ideas, notsomething you are engaging in with an eye to your future article. But when youare preparing to work on your outline and are still in the mulling-over stage,do not discuss the subject or the article. Once you put your outline on paperand it actually exists, then you can discuss it. You have formulated your ownintegration and thus can judge whether or not you will be able to use an outsidesuggestion. In short, learn to determine when discussion can be helpful, andwhen it can be confusing.There are people who talk for years about the articles or books they intend towrite. Editors have a general impression, which is true, that when a writertalks too much about a project, it will never be written.Psycho-epistemologically, the reason is the same as in discussing an outline toosoon. If you discuss a project too much before it is clear in your mind,particularly a large project like a book, you only confuse yourself.In some cases the motives here are dishonest. I have in mind those perennialnovel-promisers who like playing the role of novelist without bothering with thedifficult job of writing. Psycho-epistemologically, what helps the dishonestyalong—or rather, what penalizes it—is that the would-be writer’s act dissipateshis ability. He confuses his subconscious by discussions with, and suggestionsfrom, others, and he never gets to the actual writing. So even if he startedwith a semi-honest, vague intention to write that book, he can no longer do it.INTERRUPTIONSIf I get up in the morning and know, for example, that I have a four o’clockappointment, I cannot write that day. It is as if my mind closes down and willnot work. If I do try to work, I dawdle, look at the clock, and get dressed forthe appointment earlier than necessary, realizing that trying to write isuseless. The psycho-epistemological reason is that in order to write, you mustconcentrate and keep your subconscious open, so that it will formulate the ideasyou need. It is difficult to get into that state, and if you know that at acertain time—regardless of your progress—you will be interrupted, that knowledgewill stop you completely. Implicitly, your subconscious says: “What’s the use?All this effort for an hour or two. And if it goes well, that’s when I have tocut it off.” Therefore, I accept no daytime appointments unless it is absolutelyunavoidable. (When I was writing Atlas Shrugged, I accepted neither day norevening appointments, with rare exceptions, for roughly thirteen years.)This, again, is like the blast furnace I mentioned, which must be heated forweeks before it is ready to forge steel. It is a disaster if the furnace goesout. A furnace not in use is still kept burning, because it is a long andexpensive process to bring it back to the right temperature. This is a goodmetaphor for preparing the mind for writing, which takes such an enormous levelof concentration that an interruption is like the furnace going cold. If you areinterrupted, it takes much longer than the appointment to bring yourself back towork. Not only will you not work the same day, you will most likely lose thenext day as well. This happens even to experienced writers who recognize theirinner signs.Do not attempt to write if you have urgent interruptions. If you can, setyourself certain days of the week during which you do nothing but write. Do allyour other duties during the other part of the week. Subconsciously, what youneed in order to write is that sense of an uninterrupted immediate future. Itcannot extend forever, but you must know that at least for today—and preferablyfor the next few days—you will be free to devote yourself to writing alone.Similarly, if you have a mixed profession (i.e., a job besides writing), it isbetter to divide your week into two parts than to attempt to do both jobs on thesame day. Some people can manage it, but 1 have never been able to. When Iworked at jobs other than writing, I could not write at night, but only on theweekends. Some people, however, are more elastic; a lot depends on yourpsycho-epistemology. But it is an absolute that you cannot work if you know thatan interruption is imminent.DEADLINESThere is no general rule about deadlines. Whether they come from the outside orare self-imposed, they can be helpful or harmful. They are helpful if, forinstance, you are writing a book, feel you will never finish, and have attendedto none of the practical details—such as approaching a publisher. In such cases,the absence of a deadline can have a bad influence. You could spend the rest ofyour life adding chapter upon chapter. Writing is dependent on a complexity ofpsycho-epistemological issues, and the idea of an eternity before you isharmful. A certain pressure is necessary—the pressure of reality: if you arewriting something, it is appropriate to finish it. So a deadline does serve apurpose.However, if you must deliver a certain number of words on a given subject by acertain date, that too can be disastrous. You will either write carelessly,because you lack the time to think, or be completely paralyzed. The tendency iseither to become a hack (writing only what comes to you easily) or not to writeat all.The important issue, however, is not outside deadlines, but self-imposed ones.The ideal condition for writing is to set aside time, work as you can, and notpanic if a day passes without your producing something new. Nevertheless, youmust set deadlines for yourself—not as absolutes, but to avoid concludingsubconsciously that there is no time limit on the assignment. Making yourproject indefinite is demoralizing.Do not make time a constant pressure. Do not judge your progress by each day;since the production of any written material is irregular, nobody but a hack canbe sure how much he will produce in a given day. Otherwise, if you have a great,inspirational day and produce ten pages, you will tend to think: “At this rate,I will finish in a month.” And if the next day is unproductive and you write asingle dubious sentence, you might think: “At this rate, it will take me twoyears.” Both are demoralizing illusions. If you have a bad day, it will add toyour discouragement to project your own future at such a dismal pace. On theother hand, if you come to an unwarranted, overly optimistic conclusion, andfeel you can write without difficulty forever, that is a temporary illusion.Your next bad day (often the following day, precisely because of thisconclusion) you will be crushed, because you based your schedule on this fast,uninterrupted progression.Do not make any time generalizations in that form. Writing is an unpredictableprocess; it does not proceed regularly at so many words per minute. You canjudge your pace only in larger installments; your standard should be roughly theproduction of an average week. But there are always unpredictable factors. Youmay have personal problems, an illness, unavoidable interruptions—so do not setyourself such absolutes as: “I must finish in so many weeks or else I am nogood.” The absolute you do have to comply with is: “I will write during all thetime that I can (or all the time that I set aside for writing) to the best of myability.” Only you will know when you did your best—even if you merely produceda paragraph—or when you dawdled all day. With experience, you acquire a specialsense of this. Therefore, keep a general deadline in your mind, but withoutbeing too specific about the date. Do not put unnecessary pressure on yourself.DUTYIf you make something a duty, you will not be good at it. Creatively, acting onduty is a major barrier and destroyer.If you write from a sense of duty—say, you do not want to write the article, butsome publication needs it, or somebody wants you to do it, or you are doing itfor “the cause”—then your motive is not the desire to say things about thissubject, but some extraneous consideration. That is the duty premise, and itwill cause you nothing but trouble. Usually, writing on a duty premise producesnothing but unnecessary squirms caused by a rebellious subconscious.Apart from an outside duty, there is such a thing as self-made duty, which is,paradoxically, a passionate desire to write a given piece. It is so strong thatyou almost paralyze yourself. I experienced that while writing The Fountainhead,and I discovered the solution by accident.Often, especially after I had gone through the squirms, I would get up in themorning and want desperately to write. But when I sat down, I felt blank. It wasneither the squirms nor the “white tennis shoes.” I could not think of anythingbut writing, and yet I could not write. In such cases, I played solitaire,simply to do something not very purposeful while my mind got used to the idea ofwriting.One day, in this state, I picked up the cards. But I did not want to play, Iwanted to write. I thought to myself: “Why don’t you try it? This won’t bewriting yet, you will merely project what seems to be pressing on your mind.” Ileft the cards on the table, and thought I would come back to them in a fewminutes. I wrote for four hours, uninterrupted, and it was one of my best daysof inspirational writing. That taught me something. By an overpassionate desire,I put myself in a state of self-made duty. It was not a duty to the cause, thebook, the publisher, etc.; it was simply my own desire to write. But I made aduty out of it because I told myself that I have to write. Such intensitystopped me, and I realized that the cards, left there accidentally, helped mebreak the duty premise. They were a reminder that I could stop whenever Iwanted—that I was writing only for myself. I grasped something very important,which is a solution to most writing problems (though it cannot solve deepsquirms). It is what I call the pleasure principle.When you feel overburdened by the problems I have discussed, one of the bestsolutions is to ask yourself what you want. You are not writing for the cause,for humanity, for posterity. You are writing because you want to write; and ifyou do not want to, you do not have to, neither today nor ever. Remind yourselfthat it is all for your own happiness, and if you truly dislike the activity, donot try it. Writing is too difficult to do with a half-intention.Most people who try to write, however, really want to. Therefore, the best wayout of technical difficulties—the best fuel psychologically—is to remindyourself, explicitly, that writing is for your own pleasure. Never mind yourmistakes or who will say what about your work. Remind yourself what you soughtin writing, and what great pleasure there is in having your say about life,reality, or whatever subject you choose. In conclusion, I want to answer a question that may have occurred to you. Ifwriting requires so many principles—so much philosophical knowledge—why areunphilosophical writers able to write (particularly in fiction)? For instance,Mickey Spillane has enormous imagination. His style is flawed, but he writes anovel in two weeks, inspirationally, and sends it to his publisher. He does notedit it, and he does not permit corrections.Many people above him intellectually nevertheless have difficulties in writing.So how does he do it? The answer is: the same way a somnambulist is able to walka tightrope, while you cannot. If, early on, you set your writing premisessubconsciously and exempt the realm from any psychological or philosophicalproblems, you will be able to write. That is how writers even with innerconflicts can write, at times brilliantly. The danger, however, is that you arecompletely at the mercy of your subconscious, and cannot get out of theslightest psycho-epistemological difficulty. This is true of all inspirationalwriters. They cannot improve, and they soon write themselves out. If thematerial in their subconscious runs out, there is no way for them to replenishit, and thus they cannot develop. Such writers exempt the process of writingfrom conscious questions or premises. They rely entirely on the subconscious.The somnambulist on a tightrope moves with absolute certainty, focused only onhis particular job. But if you awaken him, he will fall, because he cannot walkthe rope consciously.So if you have not learned how to write automatically, as Spillane does, andcannot put yourself in the state of a somnambulist’s single-tracked assurance,your only alternative is to learn to write by a long, conscious process. Afterall, you can learn tó walk a tightrope, though it must be done by consciouspractice; and when you thus acquire the skill, it is much more reliable andpleasant than a somnambulist-like dependence on your subconscious. In thesomnambulist’s state, your writing and inspiration are not fully in yourcontrol.Do not envy the “inspirational” writers. Learn the skill of writing consciously."},{"pageContent":"7EditingThere are three major differences between writing and editing. First, in writingyou rely on your subconscious with minimum interference from your consciousmind. In editing, you do the opposite: the dominant process involves yourconscious mind.Second, writing, unlike editing, must be highly personal. You go by youremotions, as if you were writing only for yourself. While writing, do notcriticize or edit yourself. In editing, however, you must be as objective andimpersonal as possible. Try to forget what you have written and read it as if itwere by someone else. This is not difficult to do. Anyone who has acted orplayed charades knows that one can pretend to be another person. So imagine thatyou have forgotten how the article was written, including all of the emotions,hesitations, and choices involved.Here is where memorizing your writing impedes you. If you have read your piecetoo often, you are helpless to edit it. When I wrote We the Living, it took me aweek or longer before I could sufficiently forget a particular day’s work andstart editing it. I could not get a fresh look because I wrote too slowly andthus memorized everything. By the time I reached Atlas Shrugged, I could editsomething the next day. That should be your goal.You can make a few corrections the day you write, but I am speaking of editingas your main assignment. It is best to edit the next day. If you write steadily,you must reread what you have written in order to continue. And if you try toedit while you know every word, you might catch a few errors, but you will alsomemorize it more firmly; by the time you finish the sequence or the article, youwill not be able to judge anything. If you cannot tell what is good or bad aboutan article, you have over-stared. So if you cannot be objective the next day, donot start editing. Edit only when you know you are ready.Third, while writing, you must not question anything or doubt yourself. Whileediting, however, you are free to question everything, including whether toreconstruct the article totally or even whether to continue with it at all.Do not, however, start doubting for doubting’s sake. This is a common error; itis part of the mistake of thinking you must write the “perfect” article. If, asyou edit your article, it seems good, but you think: “I don’t see any error, butwhat if I could do better?”—that can paralyze your judgment. The epistemologicalprinciple is that the zero does not exist. Just as in science you need someevidence to warrant a hypothesis, so in judging what you have written you shouldnot ask: “I do not know how it could be improved, but what if it could be?”Question everything, but do not raise unwarranted doubts.In editing, there are two principles you must remember: ( 1 ) no judgment can bemade out of context; and (2) you cannot do everything at once. Therefore, thesubconscious also plays a part in editing, though you have to know how to useit. I recommend editing in layers, i.e., in several stages, by going over yourfirst draft many times, from different aspects.Let me explain the overall process of editing (i.e., the procedure for acompleted article) and then how to apply it to the kind of editing you may wantto do on a given part of an article.First, reading your article, focus mainly on structure. Ask yourself: Is thelogical progression good or confused? Are there repetitions? Is there imbalance,i.e., are some aspects too detailed and others too brief or condensed? (Not allaspects need to be equally detailed; you determine this by your theme andpurpose.)These are the types of questions you should ask during your first layer ofediting. The answers will determine whether you should rearrange the article’sstructure or let it stand. No matter how carefully you prepare your outline, theactual execution may show that you did not select the best logical order andthat some passages should be transposed; for example, certain points may beclearer or more dramatic if they come earlier. So in editing, focus on structurefirst. There is no use bothering about style or polish if you are going to haveto reconstruct the article.If, while you focus on structure, stylistic or grammatical corrections happen tooccur to you spontaneously, then make them. For example, if in some passage yousee immediately that there are too many adjectives, or a better adjective occursto you, make the change. But if you notice that something is wrongstylistically, and the correction does not occur to you immediately, do not workon it during the first reading. Make a mark in the margin and continue focusingon structure.Incidentally, do not let your outline show in your article. Do not let thereader in on the mechanics of what you are doing. Always let him in on thecontent, of course, but not on the scaffolding. The mistake here takes thefollowing form. As you finish a sequence, you write, for instance, “So much foraspect A, now we will discuss aspect B.” That is the scaffolding, and you shouldremove it. These are directions written for yourself; they are what you put inan outline. Your outline indicates that you must cover Point 1, then Point 2,etc., but in the actual writing, if the structure of your article is logical,you need not announce that you have finished Point 1.Once you are satisfied with the structure, read the article again. In the secondreading you should focus on clarity of thought and content. That is, on thefirst reading, you assume the content is clear. As long as you know what you arewriting about, you can judge the structure. But on the second reading, youexamine the verbal part of your writing—sentence structure and content—verycarefully. Watch for the clarity with which you express your thoughts andwhether the words you use objectively reflect what you want to say. Ask yourselfexplicitly: “Do I really know what I want to say, and have I said it?”Frequently you will answer in the negative. Later I will discuss the errorspossible in this category.Only on the third reading should you focus on style. Again, I will discuss thedetails later. Here I simply want to point out that you should not worry aboutsaying something in a more interesting way earlier than the third reading. Asyou acquire experience, ideas for presenting things more colorfully will occurto you all the time—in your original draft and in the first two editings—becauseyour subconscious will have the necessary standing order. But do not force this.Do not consciously focus on style until the final editing.Do not take “three readings” too literally. There is no rule about how often youneed to read your article. You may be able to combine some of the functions ofthe three readings into two. More likely, you will need many more than three. Donot take the number of readings you need as a reflection on your abilities. Ifyou know a great deal, you might need ten readings fully to accomplisheverything. There is only one general principle, which each of you must applyindividually: you cannot do everything at once, because too much is involved.You must edit in layers, according to how much your mind can handle at one time.This in turn depends on your experience, and on your knowledge of and interestin the subject.Here is how I myself discovered the process of editing in layers. I had alwaysedited in that way, but I never understood the principle involved until I wrotefor the Los Angeles Times. I had to write a weekly column24[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-24] of no more than a thousand words,though I was told a length of 700 to 800 words was preferable. Of course, Ifirst made an outline, then wrote the draft, and then edited it. As I went overit once, I discovered that cuts were always possible; but then I would come tothe point where I felt nothing more could be cut. This seemed fine, because Iwas a bit under a thousand words. But to my amazement, the next time I read thepiece I could cut some more, and the next time still more, until I got the wordcount down to around 750. I did this without straining after anything new, andwithout cutting content. What impressed me most was that I could not have madeall these cuts in the first editing. That made me grasp the extent to which amind cannot do everything at once.When you first read your article, you see only the obvious cuts. But after youeliminate them and read it again, in that new context you can see that otherchanges are necessary. For example, some sentences are too long, or there aretwo adjectives where only one is needed, or there is an unnecessary subordinateclause that was needed in the first version, but not in the edited one.Incidentally, because the Los Angeles Times left it up to me, I took pleasure inbeing as economical as possible without spoiling the content. It became achallenge and a good exercise.I grasped the principle—that you cannot do everything at once—on merely oneaspect of writing: brevity. When you consider all the elements of writing—fromyour subject and theme, to eloquence of expression—you see that you cannotpossibly hope to do everything the first time you edit. If you try, you areasking the impossible of your mind.Learn the rate of work—the tempo—appropriate to you, and then adjust itaccording to each job; the principle is that you must concentrate purposefully,since you cannot do something in part focus, but you must not strain. What stopsyou is demanding the unnatural of your mind. When you feel an inner tension,that may be a sign that you are trying to do too much and need to put the workaside for a while. Later, go back to it with a fresh mind. A mind can do only somuch at any one time; be careful not to overwork it.How do you know when something in your writing is wrong? In my article “Art andSense of Life,”25 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-25] I point out thatyour subconscious integrates data much faster than you can do so by a consciousprocess. It integrates all the elements of your article as you read it.Therefore, as you edit, if you leave your subconscious free, you will feeluneasy over an error before you consciously discover the error. You feelsomething is wrong, but cannot immediately say what it is. Part of theexperience you need in editing is to discover the form in which yoursubconscious tells you that something is wrong. Discover those inner signs,which you alone can recognize. Sometimes merely identifying that there issomething wrong enables you to discover the exact nature of the problem. Atother times, the discovery can take a long time. It depends on the complexity ofthe error.Refusing to engage in doubt for doubting’s sake will help you preserve yournatural, subconscious integrations. Self-doubt stifles the authenticsubconscious warning that something is wrong. Since you cannot always discoverwhat is wrong immediately, if you introduce too many doubts—e.g.. the fear thatthere is some error because “it’s poor little me who’s writing, and I don’t knowhow”—you will constantly feel that something is wrong and will not be able tojudge your article properly.If you approach editing objectively, you have nothing to fear. If there aremistakes in your piece, you or your editor will find them. If you are stuck on aproblem and have exhausted your ability to solve it, an objective check isalways possible. An editor, or even an intelligent friend, can tell you what iswrong, because he comes to the problem with a fresh mind.Sometimes when you work too long on a passage, you become unsure about it, soyou edit and change it. Then two days later, you restore the original version. Icall this over-improving, and it usually occurs because you did not rest enoughto be objective about your article. This is a normal part of editing, so do notworry about it.There are two kinds of changes that are always appropriate to make right away.First, if anything comes to your mind spontaneously—e.g., a better word or abetter sentence structure—make the correction, no matter what layer of editingyou are doing. Second, make any correction which can be done relatively briefly.For example, on a complex paragraph, you may spend about half an hour. You maythink over what is unclear, or try different ways of saying something. This isno longer spontaneous; it requires purposeful thinking. But if you spend twohours on one paragraph, you are on the wrong track. Here, time is proof ofsomething. If you find that you need to think over every adjective or toreformulate a sentence in ten different ways, and the more you try the moreconfused you become, then put the work aside until you can trust yoursubconscious to correct the problem.During this type of self-torture, it may appear that you are being extremelyconscientious, because you keep trying, no matter how painful it is. But it isactually self-induigence. You are being stubborn and acting, in effect, as ifthere were a battle between you and a sentence.It occurs when you attempt to solve a problem out of context. You are stumped bya particular sentence—but maybe your subconscious is telling you that the wholeparagraph is unnecessary. Or your mind simply wants to go on and not bother withthis at present. In such cases, do not keep struggling with the sentence word byword, because it will delay you in two ways: first, you will not solve theproblem, and second, you will exhaust your mind. You will become tired not onlyof the sentence, but of the whole article; and consequently you may findyourself unable to work on it productively. You will have exhausted yourcreative potential, and so will need time to rebuild your enthusiasm. Therefore,in this position, stop, trust your subconscious, and take a wider look at yourarticle.By taking a wider look I mean: leave the problem passage alone and begin anotherlayer of editing. Read the article from another aspect, and by the time you cometo the problem passage again, something might occur to you. If it does not, goon, edit everything else, and leave that passage to the end. If, however, yourefuse to leave that passage until you have fully figured out how to redo it,you will legitimately begin to hate writing, because such a process is torture.The problem, however, is neither in the content of your writing nor in yourtalent, but in your use of the wrong method. Do not attempt anything by forcingyour mind. Learn what it requires. Consciously observe what your mind needs inorder to work hard, purposefully, and with great concentration—but withoutstrain.Do not edit word by word. Moreover, do not use a thesaurus. That is sometimeshandy at the very end, for a final polish, but not until then. Use the best ofwhat your subconscious can do in the easiest and most purposeful way possible.My method—edit first for structure, then for clarity of thought and content,then for stylistic trimming—is only a general subdivision. Find whichever methodis best for you. Although you must edit for structure first and style last, youmay subdivide editing in many different ways, and require more than one readingfor each subdivision.The general process of editing can be applied to a book or article as a whole,as well as to their parts. For instance, in Atlas Shrugged I went over eachsequence of a chapter by this three-step method, then the whole chapter, theneach of the three major parts of the book, and finally, the whole book. If youdo not strain while editing, your subconscious keeps the full context—what youhave written and where you are going—constancy present in your mind, therebyenabling you to find many things to smooth out, clarify, or eliminate. Because Iwas not straining, it was an easy process, and progressively I had less and lessto change. But the method I used was always the same, no matter what unit ofwriting I was editing.No one can write an article in a day. So as you begin work each day, you shouldreread the work of the day before. Of course, the desire to edit will beirresistible, and this is appropriate; you want to bring order to your previousday’s work before you proceed. But here I strongly recommend that you focus onlyon structure and clarity (plus whatever occurs to you spontaneously). Check yourprevious day’s work only to see that its logical progression is appropriate andthat your sentences and paragraphs are clear. If you do more than that, you openyourself up to a further handicap. You bring your previous day’s work to a highpolish, you are pleased with it, you feel inspired at seeing how beautiful yourwork can be—but now you have to start on your raw material of the second day.Instead of being inspired, you feel discouraged.I went through this process and know it is unavoidable. It is like going from abeautifully polished, civilized city back into the jungle—back to the firstdraft. But you do not want to go back, and you get angry at yourself. Yoursubconscious feels: “Well, if I wrote that beautifully, why can’t I do it thefirst time?” (If you experience that emotion, you are forgetting that it tookyou at least two days—the first draft and one morning of editing—to arrive atthat smoothness; you cannot write that way the first time.) So do notover-polish the preceding day’s work. Do full polishing only after finishing asequence. If you could leave your whole article in an unfinished stage beforestarting to polish, then editing would be easier. But I do not recommend this,because the desire to polish each sequence right after it is written isunavoidable.Now let’s consider some other possible mistakes. There are two errors you needto watch out for, especially during the second layer of editing. The first isthe failure to say what you thought you said; the second is ungrammaticalwriting.The first is a complex issue, because it involves much more than writing,namely, objectivity. If you are at all subjective in your approach to life—indealing with people or in expressing yourself—it will show up in your writing toan even greater extent. If you do not know what is required to make your ideasobjectively clear, you will certainly have this problem when you write.I cannot cure you of subjectivity. I can only indicate what it consists of andpoint out a few principles you can use in judging your work. Most important, tryto read your article as if it were written by someone else. To the extent towhich you have not formed objective premises about communication, you will findthis difficult. Still, you must try your best.The source of this problem is your need to know much more than the material youuse in your article. When you confront that vast amount of information in yoursubconscious, the danger is that you will think you have made a certain pointwhen you have merely approximated it; the rest of what you need to say is stillin your mind. The penalty for subjectivism is the inability to distinguishbetween what is on paper and what is only in your mind.As an editor of others, I often come to a sentence or paragraph and fail tounderstand it, because it can be read in different ways. When I ask the authorwhat he means, he usually gives a brief and clear explanation—except that nopart of that explanation is on paper. When I ask why he did not write preciselywhat he said, the answer is usually that he thought he had. When I point outthat he has not, he sees that I am right, though he was incapable of discoveringit himself. I cannot cure an error of this kind here. But to identify it ishelpful, because you must explicitly ask yourself if what you have said is onlyan approximation; a lot depends on this.Proceed as if you are writing a legal contract and as if every word will be heldagainst you. When you write a contract, you must be careful about everyadjective and comma. If something is unclear, disaster can follow. You shouldnot even sign contracts for magazine subscriptions without reading the fineprint. You must understand to what you are committing yourself. The sameprinciple applies, in a different form, to writing. Look at the job of editingas if it were a review of a contract with reality. You must know that you havesaid exactly what you mean—no more and no less—and that it cannot bemisunderstood.Never sacrifice clarity. This is why the color of expression and the clarity ofthought should be two separate jobs. If you are unsure of the clarity of somethought, never try to hide it by means of a jazzy twist or beautiful metaphor.It will not save your reader from confusion.By the way, do not confuse clarity and precision. To be precise means to beclear in detail; it involves more than clarity. You can express a thoughtclearly, but it may not be fully precise. For example, if you say, “Man isgood,” that is clear—only one would not know exactly what you mean, because itis too broad an abstraction. If you then specify and say, “I regard man as goodwhen he is rational,” you have made it much more precise. It is an issue of thedegree of abstraction.Clarity applies to any level—to the broadest statement or to the minutestdetails. Whatever you say, it has to be clear. But precision is the issue thatyou have to consider when you are dealing with some abstraction and you have todecide whether, in your context, it requires more details (something closer tothe concrete). Here again the subject and theme determine the level ofabstraction. By the context of your writing, you have to decide when astatement, which may be clear, is nevertheless too broad (and will therefore beread as a floating abstraction).There is, however, also a problem of over-precision. You may include a lot ofunnecessary details, and thus dilute your clarity. This will cause the reader tolose the overall integration or the overall abstraction. Therefore, the issueyou have to watch constantly—and have to automatize in your mind—is: when canyou make an abstract statement and when do you need more details? Avoid both theerror of floating abstractions, where the tie to concrete reality is lost, andthe error of concrete-boundedness, where the abstraction is lost.Here are two reasons why you might be unable to judge the clarity of yourwriting.One is the attempt to overcondense. For example, you try to make two or threedifferent points at once by means of imprecise generality. This is not the sameas stating a wide abstraction, which subsumes many concretes, but still says onething (which is what abstractions are for). The mistake I have in mind is takingtwo or more different points, or distinct aspects of a given point, and forcingthem into one sentence. The result is the kind of sentence that drives an editorcrazy. It seems to mean something important, but no matter how often he reads ithe cannot tell exactly what it means. He has only an approximate sense of theauthor’s intention. When he asks the author, he finds, say, that there are threedistinct thoughts that should have been expressed in three separate sentences.But if you go step by step as your particular thought requires, not only willyou be clearer, you might discover that you do not need all of the points thatyou tried to squeeze into that one sentence.Another example of the attempt to overcondense is what I call the Germanicmethod of writing—making one enormous sentence out of what should be three orfour.A second reason you might be unable to judge clarity involves what I have saidabout automatization. If a thought is thoroughly automatized in your mind, andyou do not know how to explain it or how to break it up, you might put it downonly approximately. You believe it is objectively there on paper when it is not.My advice in both of these cases is to proceed more slowly. When you feel youare squeezing a great deal into a short sentence, take that as a sure sign thatyou need to do the opposite. Write more slowly, perhaps even in more detail thanyou need. You can always cut later. But first get it fully and clearly on paper.The second error I said you need to watch for when you edit concerns grammar.The relationship between objectivity and grammar is really a subdivision of thepoint about judging what one has written.I regret that one has to discuss this with educated adults, but most Americansdo not know English grammar. It is all the more ridiculous coming from someonelike me with a Russian accent. I do not mind the other errors in writing somuch, but this one is the hardest for me to encounter, to work with, and tocorrect, because it represents a cultural phenomenon, and you are notresponsible for it—the educational system is.Americans are trained (through the look-say approach to reading and all allied,Dewey-based ideas of education) to be emotional approximators. The nonobjective,ungrammatical way in which people express themselves today is truly frightening.What has been systematically undercut is their capacity for objectivecommunication. Americans tend to express themselves guided by feelings, not bythoughts. According to modem theory, there are no such things as thoughts; andeven if there were, they could not guide us.I am not a grammarian by profession. I do not know the grammatical rules ofEnglish by name, only by practice. But whenever I struggle with a sentence andfinally get it straight, I bless whoever invented these rules and I know thereis a reason behind them. If they were irrational, they would not survive.Sometimes grammarians do attempt irrational, arbitrary rules; but people do notabide by rules that complicate communication rather than clarify it.One of the most important applications of the Objectivist attitude toward reasonis grammar. The ability to think precisely, and thus to write precisely, cannotbe achieved without observing grammatical rules.Grammar has the same purpose as concepts. The rules of grammar are rules forusing concepts precisely. Since sentences consist of concepts, the whole secretof grammar is clarity and the avoidance of equivocation. The grammar of alllanguage tells us how to organize our concepts so as to make them communicate aspecific, unequivocal meaning. If you compare the number of concepts we havewith the vastly greater number of phenomena we deal with and have to describe bymeans of those concepts, you will grasp the importance of grammatical sentencestructure.If it were not for grammar, we could have words but could not speak sentences.We could merely say, for example, “Me Tarzan, you Jane.” That is the nature ofprimitive languages. Civilized languages, by contrast, have a grammar preciselybecause we deal with more than first-level, perceptually based concepts. If youhave to deal with the abstract—with abstraction from abstractions26[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-26]—you must know in what order and bywhat rules to organize them in order to communicate a specific thought.We were all bored by grammar in school. Memorizing rules is very dull. But bythe time you reach college, you should realize how important those rules are.Therefore, if you know why we should fight for reason, and for the right view ofconcepts, then let us—on the same grounds—have a crusade for grammar.Make it a rule to know sentence structure—to know which form communicates athought and which is open to ten different readings—and you will understand theimportance of grammar, not only for writing, but for cognition in general. Youhave to think grammatically. Do not accept ideas half in words and half with thefeeling: “I kinda know what it means.” Formulate what you think, and why, inspecific words, even when you are alone. This is why it is advisable, if thethought is too abstract, to make notes. When you make notes, you are obliged toput the thought into an objective form—not for your reader, but for yourself.Always reduce your convictions to a verbal formulation of your own. That is thefirst step toward grammatical clarity in your thinking, and toward makinggrammar and precision a habit.The difficulty here is that most of you today are so used to a subjectiveshorthand that you lose the distinction between your own inner context and anobjective statement. It is permissible to use a mental shorthand in thinking, ifit is clear to you. But a stenographer would be of no value if she could nottranscribe her shorthand into a document in English. Similarly, when it comestime to write, you must translate your shorthand into objective language.If you have forgotten your grade school lessons, get a good primer ongrammar—preferably an old one—and revive your knowledge.27[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-27] You will be surprised how much moreimportant it appears to you now than it did when you were a child. The reason isthat today, in reading those dry rules, you know why they were formed and whythey are rational.As to what your attitude toward writing should not be, the best image is “Ikethe Genius” in The Fountainhead—the modern play-wright who says he is a creativegenius, not a typist.28 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-28] Too manypeople today think: “I’m a creative genius, I’m above grammar.” But nobody whothinks or writes can be above grammar. It is like saying, “I’m a creativegenius, I’m above concepts”—which is the attitude of modem artists. If you are“above” grammar, you are “above” concepts; and if you are “above” concepts, youare “above” thought. The fact is that then you are not above, but far below,thought. Therefore, make a religion of grammar.Apart from a review of grammar by means of a good primer, I would suggest thefollowing. When a sentence of yours seems dubious, ask yourself some simplequestions, such as: What is the subject and what is the predicate? Do the kindof grammatical analysis you did in school. You will be surprised at what youdiscover. For example, you may find that you switched grammatical subjects inmid-sentence. Also ask yourself whether your sentence has more than one meaning.Here you need the full context of your work, which is why I recommend you dothis during the second stage of editing. Try to keep in mind the fullimplications of any generalized statement you make as you read it. Be sure notto state in the form of a general principle something you mean much morenarrowly—an error that many beginners make, particularly when they deal withcomplex subjects.Here are some examples of the two errors I have discussed, the failure to saywhat you think you said and ungrammatical writing.The first two examples come from articles I edited for The Objectivist. Onecontributor wrote that “the government-sponsored critics want the public toaccept modern art, not to understand it, because it cannot be understood inrational terms.” But this implies that one, can understand modern artirrationally. This is an example of an unintended implication. Anothercontributor wrote: ”Vast sums were spent, motivated by the desire for prestige.”This is what a rushed job can do. Although the author’s intention is clear, thesentence reads as if sums of money were motivated by the desire for prestige.“Sums” is the subject, but sums cannot be motivated.Another, more philosophical type of error is one I caught in the first editingof my article “What is Romanticism?”29[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-29] I originally wrote that the modernliterati’s resentment toward plot was “too violent for a mere issue of literarycanons.... This type of reaction pertains to metaphysical issues, i.e., toissues that threaten the foundations of a person’s entire view of life.” Theproblem is that I am talking about today’s literati. But if I left the line thisway, I would be making a general statement that was wider than I could possiblyintend—namely, that if someone ever feels that the foundations of hismetaphysics are threatened, he will necessarily feel a virulent resentment. Sowhat I did was add, in parentheses, “if that view is irrational,” which was allI meant, and all that was necessary.As another example, consider the error I committed in the original version ofNight of January 16th.30 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-30] I wanted tomake a certain line extra strong, so I had Nancy Lee Faulkner leap up and yell,“It’s a fictitious lie!” Many people read this, but nobody noticed the erroruntil we were in rehearsal in a Hollywood production, and a friend of one of theactors pointed it out to me. I was shocked and grateful—the latter because Inever made that mistake again. Originally, I made the mistake because I wantedto indicate that it was a very big lie—but what is a non-fictitious lie? So knowwhat you have actually said, and discover whether it is what you meant to say.Along the same lines, watch your punctuation. I am afraid that every writer issomewhat at fault here (except for Leonard Peikoff, who is more severe than Iam). If you feel you are above grammar, then you will certainly feel you areabove punctuation. But punctuation is extremely important. Although there is agreat deal of latitude in English, it is a language in which punctuation isparticularly crucial. Incidentally, the other two languages I know—Russian andFrench—are not quite so prone to equivocation or double meaning. English is verycondensed and exact (which is why I love it), but these very qualities makepossible sentences that can be read in two different ways, according to whetheryou insert or omit a comma.There are certain rules of punctuation that are optional, but the overall ruleis to aim at clarity. Do not leave punctuation up to the editor or copyreader.Make a point of focusing on it and being firm on where you want a certain mark.For the purpose of clarity, it is advisable to know the purpose of yourpunctuation—to know what you want to separate from what.Here is a ridiculous example of bad punctuation, which I came across years agoin The New Yorker, when that magazine collected (in the “Beautiful ClauseDepartment”) quotations from actual letters, articles, and books. This oneillustrates the importance of the comma. The sentence, without commas, reads:“Many is the time I’ve driven down this lane with my beloved wife who has sincegone to heaven in a buggy.” Now you know what the author meant, but commas wouldhave saved him: “Many is the time I’ve driven down this lane with my belovedwife, who has since gone to heaven, in a buggy.” (Obviously, it is simpler tosay “I have driven down this lane many times in a buggy with my beloved wife,who has since gone to heaven.” But assuming the author wanted it his way, onlycommas could make the thought intelligible.)I once heard of a politician who committed political suicide when he put up thefollowing campaign billboard: “My opponent has had eight years at the publictrough. Now give me a chance.” What he meant was “give me a chance to clean itout” or “give me a chance in office.” When such an error is committed inpolitics, the intent is usually obvious. The very ludicrousness of the statementsaves it from confusion. But when it happens in a philosophical passage, it maynot be so obvious. The same kind of double meaning, which is not immediatelyapparent, can be disastrous in articles that communicate ideas. So watch yourgrammar and your punctuation.If you want to express your ideas, particularly ideas based on Objectivism,learn clarity—and that means concepts, grammar, punctuation. I would rather havea simple, primer clarity than the best metaphors in the world. Make clarity afetish, an absolute, a dogma, a god.If you do that, everything else will be child’s play."},{"pageContent":"8StyleStyle is a distinctive, characteristic mode of execution. This definitionapplies to nonfiction writing as well as to all other creative activities, andit encompasses everything pertaining strictly to the form in which ideas arepresented.Style cannot be done to order. This is an absolute. If, when beginning asentence, you ask whether it is colorful, you will not finish it. Or you willproduce one artificial sentence after two hours of work. Style is the result ofsubconscious integration. You can know in principle how to bring about stylistictrimmings, but you cannot make them to order. Style, therefore, should not bepursued consciously; so many elements are involved that no mind could attend toand integrate all of them. It must be left to your subconscious.Style in this respect is somewhat similar to emotions. You cannot order yourselfto feel (or not feel) an emotion. You cannot control your emotions directly. Youcan, however, control them indirectly by identifying their root. Emotions arenot primaries; they have subconscious intellectual causes. The same is true ofstyle, which comes from a value-integration and must occur spontaneously.But your subconscious must be free enough to generate style. When writing, ifyou try to attend simultaneously to your outline, to the content of what you aresaying, and to saying it elegantly, your subconscious will be unable to handleit all at once. When what you want to say is clear, however, then spontaneouslyyou will find a way of saying it with a twist. So do not force yourself.Colorful writing is important. It makes your thought clearer and more dramatic,and therefore has both an intellectual and emotional appeal to the reader. Butthere is nothing worse than forced colorful writing, e.g., stretched metaphorsthat do not quite fit the content. The result of forced color is that the readerwill mistrust your content, even if you are otherwise logical and honest. Everyreader can sense this. He may not be able to tell you why, but he will knowsomething is phony.The reason why a mannered, artificial style leads to phoniness is implicit inthe definition of style. Style is a distinctive, characteristic mode ofexecution. Characteristic of whom? Obviously, of the writer, or else it is notan individual style. And distinct from what? Obviously, from that of others. Butyou cannot, by conscious calculation, write in an individual way that isdifferent from that of everybody else.A fact has been observed in literary circles which nobody can explain (but thenthese people explain so little): namely, that occasionally a writer appears whohas no training, yet writes brilliantly. In the twenties there was a truckdriver, with a commensurate type of education, who wrote quite well. I was notfond of what he wrote, but he was successful. What was good about his writingwas that it was completely natural. He wrote the way thoughts came to him. Thatcreated an inner conviction in his manner of writing. It sounded authentic andoriginal, because he obviously knew no literary rules. He often departed fromconvention, but these departures made sense.On the other hand, a great many failed would-be writers are college-educated(and usually come from English departments). The reason they fail is obvious.Those who went to school in the past few decades were intimidated and stymied.They were given either too many wrong rules, or no rules at all—only mysticalimplications, such as “either you have it or you don’t.” They spent their timeanalyzing metaphors and senseless nonessentials. Instead of being helpful, theseschools paralyze or discourage their students. But a truck driver may be free,if he has independently accepted certain premises, to express himselfauthentically and colorfully in his own way. This is one way in which education,particularly in the arts, can destroy rather than help potential talent.You cannot develop a style consciously. But you can give your subconscious thestanding order that you like stylistic color and want it to occur when possible.Be conscious of that desire, because you will not develop your own style if younever think about the subject. Whenever you read someone else’s work, if you seesomething you like, identify it consciously. Say, “This is an interesting way ofsaying something; I like this.” Then forget it. Do not memorize it, andcertainly do not stock your subconscious with future, unintended acts ofplagiarism. You would simply be stealing someone else’s concretes. But each timeyou identify such a concrete, it is a renewed order to your subconscious thatyou like colorful writing. If possible, identify also the principle the writerused—and then forget it. Similarly, when you read a passage you regard as bad,identify that, and why you regard it as bad. By making such literary valuejudgments, you develop the subconscious premises from which your own style willcome.You will find that, unexpectedly, your mind will, for example, throw you theright metaphor. This is why many writers think style is an inspiration, whenactually your subconscious is merely delivering after you have given itsufficient material and the permission to do so. Style comes from lightning-likeintegrations which your subconscious can make when it is free to do so. That iswhy you must write your first draft as spontaneously as possible, neither aimingat jazzy touches nor censuring yourself for their absence. When you forget aboutstylistic touches, they will come—sometimes in the first draft, and especiallyin editing. Instead of saying, “The cat is on the mat” (which is ideal for whatit says), you might write, “A ray of moonlight fell from the silver fur of acat, who sat on . . .” etc.—and you can do much better.If you practice this kind of premise-setting, you will be surprised howobservations that you forgot come out automatically. This is how you train yoursubconscious to throw you the right words in the - right combinations when youneed them, i.e., to suggest a form of expression which corresponds to yourvalues.As encouragement, let me tell you about my first published work, a pamphletabout the movie actress Pola a Negri.31[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-31] I was twenty and living in SovietRussia.At that time (in the twenties) American movies were beginning to appear inRussia, and they were very popular. Although there were no Russian fanmagazines, some people could get American ones from friends and relativesabroad, and they were a treasure to us. A state publishing house for the cinemawas publishing a series of monographs on foreign movie stars, and I asked if thehouse wanted to publish one on Pola Negri. She was a big star, and popular inRussia. I chose her because she was my favorite. They were delighted andcommissioned me immediately.After I submitted my first version of the pamphlet, the editor said I had goodmaterial, but that I wrote in a flat, dry manner that read like a synopsis. Heasked if I could make it more colorful, but I did not fully understand what hemeant. So he gave me a copy of the Max Linder pamphlet in the series—Max Linderwas one of the first comedians on the screen, and was famous in Europe—and toldme to observe how the author handled the material.I read the pamphlet and was impressed. The author had done a beautiful job,precisely from the aspect of color. He never said anything in a dry, synopsisstyle, but neither was every sentence fancy. What he did was dramatizeeverything. Rather than write, “Max Linder was born in such and such year inParis,” he would say, “On such and such a spring day, a child was born to Mr.and Mrs. Linder.” (I do not remember the details.) “And by the year so and so, ablackhaired little boy was marching happily to school in such and such districtof Paris.” It was much better than this, but that was the method. All I remembertoday is one sentence—an impressive description characterizing the overallscreen image of Linder: “This elegant figure shivering on the screens of thewhole world.” Old movies did shiver, and this comedian was an eleganttop-hat-and-cane type. From this one image I realized what colorful writing was.The author could have said, “He is an elegant screen comedian.” Instead, heintegrated the whole thought into an immediate visual image: an elegant figureshivering on the screens of the whole world. That taught me an important lesson.The important part of the story is that although I grasped the principle, Icould not write that way immediately. I did jazz up my Pola Negri pamphlet abit: I avoided saying everything in the manner of a direct synopsis. Instead, Icame at it a bit indirectly and, when possible, even elaborated from my ownimagination. The editor was satisfied, and it was published. But it was notnearly as good as the Max Linder pamphlet.Until I began writing We the Living (in the early thirties), the Max Linderpamphlet remained in my mind as the goal. I thought that this is what anaccomplished writer should do, but I also knew that I could not yet do it. Butby the time I began writing We the Living, I suddenly thought, “Why, I am doingit!” Not consistently, but once in a while. By the time I got to Atlas Shrugged,I could almost do it to order.Developing style involves conditioning your subconscious (which takes years)and, above all, never forcing yourself. I had to wait until I had enoughobservations and colorful ideas in my subconscious so that the standing orders Igave it could take effect. Only experience will do this, in conjunction withthat relaxed permission to your own subconscious to integrate things when and asit can. So do not start aiming at color immediately.The first thing to remember about style is to forget it. Let it come naturally.You acquire style by practicing. First learn to express your ideas clearly onpaper; only then will you notice one day that you are writing in your own style.But do not look at the calendar waiting for that day. When you write, focus onlyon your subject and the clarity with which you present it.There are principles that may help you with style, but this long preface wasnecessary, because I want to stress that you must not memorize everything I amgoing to say, nor think about it while you are writing.In every aspect of style, the absolute standard is your subject and theme. Theymust determine not only the content and the details, but also the particularwords and sentences you select to express them. When you write, do not thinkabout how beautiful your words are, or how people will react, or above all, whatit supposedly proves about you. Think exclusively of what you want to say. Tothe extent to which you can focus on your subject, you will write as best youcan at your present stage of development.It is often said that an artist is selfless—that when he paints or writes, heforgets himself and reality, and sees only his work. The same is said ofnonfiction writers. Of course, this is a misapplication of terms, because itmeans that you have no selfish interest in focusing on your subject—that onlybeing unselfish makes you forget all other considerations but your work.Actually, this exclusive focus on your work is the most selfish thing you can do(in the Objectivist sense of “selfish”32[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-32]), and you ought to train yourself todo it. If you want to write a good article, it is in your interest to do so. Butit is a complicated task, which requires the use of your subconscious; you mustforget all your other concerns and remember only what you are writing about.It would not occur to a scientist to focus partly on his experiment and partlyon his self-esteem or future fame. (If it does, he is a neurotic and willprobably not be heard from.) He has to focus exclusively on his experiment;nothing else is relevant. The same applies to writing, only it is harder becauseit is a purely mental job—there is nothing in reality yet except a blank sheetof paper. This is why so many people fail at it. It is harder to focus on thereality of what you have to produce when there is nothing before you but a blankpage. You have to originate the subject and theme along with everything thatgoes into carrying out your intention. In practice, therefore, you must be morereality-oriented than a scientist, who has the help of the physical problem andthe physical objects he is working with. Aim at being at least asreality-oriented as a scientist—which in this context means being exclusivelyfocused on your subject.Focusing on reality means pursuing clarity. The first concern of style isclarity. Remember that approximations will not do. They can occur in your firstdraft, but they are the first thing to look for in editing. Holding clarity asan absolute is the surest road first to a competent style, and perhapseventually to a brilliant style of your own.As I said in “Basic Principles of Literature,”33[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-33] the two main aspects of style—whichapply to nonfiction too—are choice of content and choice of words. The firstrefers to the abstractions or details you choose in order to present a givensubject; the second, to the words and sentence structure you choose.In nonfiction, perhaps the main issue in regard to choice of content is thechoice between abstract discourse and concretization. Nonfiction is primarilyabstract discourse. It is a presentation of certain views, which means certainprinciples, which means abstractions. When you write nonfiction, you arecommunicating knowledge. You are dealing with abstract issues, which you presentby means of abstractions, i.e., words and sentences. However, you must rememberthat only concretes exist—that abstractions are merely a method of classifyingconcretes. Therefore, if you are writing an abstract essay, the question willnecessarily arise: how and when do you tie what you are saying to reality?To present an abstract principle, you need illustrations. Giving examples(particularly if you are presenting a new theory) ties abstractions toreality—it shows what kinds of concretes illustrate the abstraction you arewriting about. This is one form of concretization. But what you do in regard tostyle is more complex. The color, the metaphors, the unusual verbal gimmicks allinvolve concretization.In a nonfiction article, you bring in concretizations or colorful details as ameans of integrating your subject in the reader’s mind. Specifically, this helpsintegrate not only the abstraction you are presenting and the concretes to whichit applies in reality, but also mind and emotions. Colorful touches achieve theintegration to values. This is what I call “good slanted writing.” By “slanted,”I mean writing which is selective—i.e., ruled by your values—not slanted in thesense of distorting reality. In this way you influence not only the mind of thereader, but also his emotions. You appeal to his values.This sort of concretization is a kind of bridge between nonfiction and fictionwriting. The same principle applies to fiction, only in a much more complex way.In choosing value-oriented concretes, you are acting on the fiction-writingpremise. Strictly speaking, nonfiction writing is concerned only with clarity ofpresentation. When you introduce colorful touches, you do so on the sameprinciple by which a fiction writer writes his whole story. You are, in alimited way, borrowing a certain technique from fiction writing.To illustrate how this works, I am going to analyze my “Brief Comments” onApollo 8. I want to show you, from the aspect of style, what considerations mademe concretize certain points, and what would happen had I written itdifferently.The article starts with a paragraph and a half that is strictly informative,nonfiction writing:The flight of Apollo 8 was a magnificent technological achievement. Leavingaside the question of whether the government should have a space program (which,apart from military defense purposes, it should not), it was an achievement ofhuman intelligence, of man’s rational faculty. The knowledge and the precisionrequired to plan, calculate, and execute that flight was such a feat that no onewill claim it was done by instinct, feeling, or “arbitrary social convention.”This is pure abstract discussion.Here is the last sentence of the second paragraph: “That flight was adeclaration spectacularly displayed to the whole world: ‘This is what man therational being can do.’ ” This sentence is a concretization of a definite point.Stylistically, it is drama. I could have said, “The flight was a rationalachievement,” but I had already said that. Therefore, for the purpose ofinforming the reader, my coming back to the issue of man the rational being wasnot necessary. Then why did I do it? Here is where theme and subject determinestyle. What did I want to say about the Apollo 8 flight? I was not discussingthe flight as such, nor the epistemological issue of reason versus emotion. Iwas focusing on a certain image of man and man’s achievement.Why would people feel enthusiastic if Apollo 8 succeeded ? Because of a properlyhuman, “collective” self-esteem—the pride and pleasure of knowing aboutsomething that man at his best has done. Therefore the meaning of the wholeflight, to the general public, is a certain view of man and the flight’ssignificance for man. Man is the ultimate purpose—the consumer of anyachievement of science. That is what I wanted to communicate. But if I said thisin the terms I am using now, I would not communicate much. You would understandme intellectually, but I would not make the point real, because it would stillbe an abstraction. If I said, “Man ought to be rational, and we are happy whenhe is,” those are abstract thoughts. But when I switch the reader’s focus to animage of man, I concretize something. I introduce something which is still anabstraction (namely, an image of man), but I connect it to reality, as thesubject of the piece requires.Now how could I do this briefly? There were several considerations. Observe theintegration. (This is the fiction method.) I wanted the reader to feel that thisachievement was great and triumphant. So I say, “That flight was a declarationspectacularly displayed to the whole world.” I wanted to mention, but only as anaside, that the whole world was watching. Most of all, I wanted to convey theringing quality, by connotation, of a manifesto: “This is what man, the rationalbeing can do!” I switched from an abstraction to something emotional andconcrete.Here is what follows: “Mankind was in desperate need of that reminder. Considerthe sewer of degradation which is today’s culture, and the images of man that itprojects.” Now I could have presented the rest of this paragraph ininformational, nonfiction terms: “In politics, the dominant trend is statism; inethics, altruism; in epistemology, irrationalism; in esthetics, blindemotionalism.” This says a lot, and does so economically, but in an abstract,nonfiction style; 1 am merely naming intellectual trends. Observe that what Iactually wrote is exactly the same thing, but concretized:Consider ... the images of man that [our culture] projects: politically, man therightless slave of the state [instead of simply saying “statism”]; morally, manthe congenital incompetent, to whose needs all life is to be sacrificed [Iconcretize what altruism is]; epistemologically, man the mindless, an irrationalcreature run by unknowable urges [this is a concretization]; esthetically, manthe howling hippie [this is a journalistic concrete].34[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-34]This is a method of condensing, and thus reminding the reader of, the meaning ofthe abstractions covered by a single word (such as “statism,” “altruism,”“irrationalism”). Since the purpose of the article is to tell the reader whatthe issue of irrationality versus achievement means to a given image of man, Ihad to make real, in an emotionally arousing way, what sort of images of man areprojected today.In nonfiction terms, I could have concluded this paragraph with: “Therefore theworld watched the flight eagerly. It wanted to see a rational achievement.” Thisis a good sentence, which says something important, but it is good enough for afirst draft only. What I write in the article is: “If you consider it, you willsee that the special intensity, the eagerness, the enthusiasm, with which theworld watched the astronauts’ journey, came from mankind’s hunger for areassertion of its trampled self-esteem, for a sight of man the hero.” This isconcretized, even though abstract. (Mankind’s self-esteem, for instance, is ahuge abstraction.) But it is enough to appeal to the emotions and values in thereader. “Mankind’s trampled self-esteem” is a strong metaphor, and the rationalreader should feel a certain shudder of indignation at this point—not because Iassert it arbitrarily, but because I here prepared the ground for it. I listedhow man is predominantly seen today, which confirms the trampling of mankind’sself-esteem; I provided the concretes, so when I use such a strong expression Ido not do so arbitrarily. And by the time I say “man the hero” (after “man theincompetent” and “man the hippie”), it has an inspiring quality. That is goodnonfiction writing, which borrows the methods of fiction.The next (one-line) paragraph reads: “It is an outrage and a tragedy that thatsight was undercut.” That is an assertion, and merely anotherattention-arrester. I continue:When, from the distance of the moon, from the height of the triumph of science,we expected to hear the astronauts’ message and heard, instead, a voice recitingthe moldy nonsense which even a slum-corner evangelist would not have chosen asa text—reciting the Bible’s cosmology—I, for one, felt as if the capsule haddisintegrated and we were left in the primordial darkness of empty space.At first (“from the distance of the moon,” etc.) this is merely selective butfactual nonfiction writing. I then write, “the moldy nonsense which even aslum-corner evangelist would not have chosen,” in order to concretize my point.I want to invoke, as economically as possible, the questionability of readingthe Bible’s cosmology. I want the reader to associate it with the place where itbelongs, which (in the twentieth century, at least) is below a street-cornerevangelist. Next, instead of drawing some abstract conclusion, I describe mypersonal emotions. This approach is determined by my theme. This is not anarticle on the importance of reason versus faith; it is a comment on a givenevent. Therefore, the Objectivist context—namely, the importance of reason—istaken for granted. I do not prove it or propagandize for it, but take it as anabsolute. So it would have been inappropriate at this point to talk about theimpropriety of mixing faith and science.My aim was to communicate the importance, and the disastrous effect, ofBible-reading in the context of the triumph of science. To do this, I did nothave to explain that Bible-reading is irrational. I had to describe an emotionalresponse, and the strongest I could think of was the one I experienced. Butsaying, “I, for one, felt sick” or “I felt indignant” would be arbitrary andwould fall flat. So I indicate, in concrete terms, why I felt that way: becausewe were back in the darkness of primordial space and the capsule haddisintegrated. This is metaphorical in the sense that the capsule was stillthere. But if we had been looking at Apollo 8 as a great achievement, and thenthis rational being started reading the Bible, then, from the point of view ofthe meaning of the event, the capsule had disappeared. The value of theintellectual triumph was negated by somebody reciting moldy stuff that nobodytakes seriously.That is what a line and a half accomplished.The astronauts reading the Bible from space is the subject of my article. Thetheme is what I think of that act—why it was wrong. So the climax is theparagraph about the Bible-reading. From then on, I am just cashing in on what Ihave established.The next paragraph is essentially nonfiction in style:If you wonder what perpetuates the reign of irrationality on Earth, you haveseen a demonstration: it is not done by the worst among men, but by the best—notby the masses of the ignorant, but by the leaders who default on theresponsibility of thought—not by witch doctors, but by scientists.For the most part, this is a straight nonfiction presentation. The point doesnot call for concretization or an appeal to emotions. The only concretization is“not by witch doctors, but by scientists.” This is appropriate in order toconcretize the issue of irrationality versus reason. Everybody knows that awitch doctor is the symbol of savagery ; and what a scientist is has beendemonstrated by the whole article up to that point. Therefore, the juxtapositionof the two concretes adds reality to the nonfiction style of the rest of theparagraph.The next three paragraphs are a further cashing-in, and were not obligatory. Icould have stopped the article with “not by witch doctors, but by scientists.”However, I wanted to make a wider point using the same concretes: “No witchdoctor’s power to encourage mankind’s darkest superstitions is comparable to thepower of an astronaut broadcasting from the moon.”The next paragraph is a concretization appropriate to the event. It is aconclusion that is pure propaganda, in the good sense of the word. I remindpeople of what they should have asked themselves long ago about the differencebetween science and the humanities: “There are two questions that should beasked: Would the astronauts treat the slightest malfunction of the leastsignificant instrument aboard the spacecraft as carelessly and thoughtlessly asthey treated the most important issues of philosophy?” You could make the samepoint by saying that nobody makes airplanes or automobiles as carelessly as theyespouse bad philosophy. But when you think of how much depends on the scientificprecision of a space flight, then it is irresistible to use this example topoint out to people that they do not treat matter as carelessly andthoughtlessly as they treat their own souls. Here is the second question: “And,if not, does not man’s spirit deserve the same disciplined, conscientious,rational attention that they gave to inanimate matter?”The final paragraph is pure abstraction: “The flight of Apollo 8 was a condenseddramatization of mankind’s tragedy: a demonstration of man’s epistemologicaldouble standard in the field of science and of the humanities.” Putting in suchtouches of philosophy is not something I recommend to beginners, because it isvery difficult to do. Do not attempt it until you are more at home withphilosophy on the one hand, and with the subject of your article on the other.It is optional in any case. Since I could do it in three lines, it wasappropriate. I included it as a lead for the reader; so much nonsense has beenwritten on the dichotomy between science and the humanities, and I had all thematerial necessary to indicate what is wrong with this false dichotomy. But itis strictly a reminder to my philosophical readers, for whom it is a valuablespringboard to future thinking.What I mean by dramatizing or concretizing should now be clear. There is no ruleabout when or how often to concretize; in general, do it when you need to tie acertain aspect of your abstract presentation to reality. Do it to appeal to thereader’s emotions (specifically, his sense of value) in an economical way, andto remind him of what specifically is entailed in your presentation.You need to be careful in judging when this is appropriate. Generally, if youare writing a theoretical article, then stylistically you should includeconcretizing touches as little as possible. They may be advisable, occasionally,when they grow out of your material, but not as a rule. You do give examples, ofcourse, which is an issue of content. But stylistically, you do not needmetaphors or color, because they would detract from the clarity of yourpresentation.If you think I am a colorful writer, read Introduction to ObjectivistEpistemology. There, I do not permit myself any color (except at the conclusionof each chapter, where I tie the material to its cultural influence orconsequences). The book is a strict presentation of theory in almost exclusivelyliteral terms: no metaphors, no jazz—only clarity. However, when you writemiddle-range articles—when you apply abstractions to concretes—you can permityourself certain elements of color, if they grow out of your material and you donot force anything. Even then, you must not overdo it. In any nonfiction piece,abstract narrative should predominate. You would not write a theoretical articleconsisting of nothing but examples, and the same applies to these stylistic,concretizing touches. They should be few, and used only when you have a reasonfor them, not to display your virtuosity or show off your imagination.Now let me add that these concretizations or dramatic touches are not the onlyelements of style. Straight narrative itself—the most abstract nonfictionwriting—has an element of style, too. It too involves a characteristic,distinctive manner of expression. The driest presentation of even an outline orhigh school synopsis still contains elements of your particular form ofexpression, because how you communicate always comes from your individualpsycho-epistemology. Since no two of these are exactly alike, everything youwrite has a certain element of individual style. In the case of a dry synopsis,the variation in the styles of different individuals is minimal; in the case ofnarrative passages, there are major differences.To sum up: one of the chief factors distinguishing individual style is when,how, and to what extent a writer concretizes.The other main subdivision of style is word-choice.There cannot be a rule that only one choice of words will communicate a giventhought. I said earlier that you should not aim at the “perfect” article,because it does not exist. Similarly, do not aim at some “perfect” words for agiven thought, if only you could get them. They do not exist. The possibilitiesare limitless, and there are many options. Clarity and precision are the onlyabsolutes. So be guided by the choice of words that expresses your thought asclearly and precisely as possible.Concretization or emotional appeal enters the issue of word-choice in the formof the connotation of words.Clarity depends exclusively on the denotation—the exact meaning—of words. Butgiven a particular thought that you want to express, the specific words you usecan make a great difference, because in any language there are subtledistinctions of meaning among certain words. Those distinctions determine theconnotations of your words; by means of these connotations you achieve the samepurpose that you gain by touches of concretization in the choice of content.For example, if you describe a woman as slender, the connotation is entirelydifferent than if you describe her as lanky. While there is a little more thanconnotation involved here, the words “slender” and “lanky” both describe peoplewho are thin. But the former connotes someone graceful and beautiful; thelatter, someone gawky and awkward. Almost every adjective has a series ofsemi-synonyms of this kind, and you need to be careful about which one youselect.I remember a short story in which the author, describing a hero, wrote: “Helooked well scrubbed.” She wanted to convey that he was clean-cut, in theserious, intellectual sense. But when you say “well scrubbed,” the immediateconnotation is non-intellectual; it suggests someone who spends a lot of time inthe bathroom with soap and water. By evoking that image, she achieved anunintended effect. That is what you should watch out for. (Most people choosewords almost “instinctively”; this choice is so automatized that, usually, aperson simply knows when he has chosen the wrong word.)Watch out for philosophical implications, too. For example, if someone writes,“He had an instinct for courage,” he may only want to convey, “He is brave.” Butthe actual, and improper, implication is that courage is an instinct.You must also watch out for the cultural corruption of words. No word can beinherently controversial, but it can become so by protracted cultural usage. Forexample, today, if you say that somebody is idealistic, it has the connotationof impractical foolishness. Strictly speaking, the word does not mean that. Butif you know the word is used that way, do not use it unless your context makesclear what you mean by it.It is important to know when to continue using a word despite its beingcorrupted, and when to drop such a word. The real test is: what does thecorruption of the word accomplish? For example, I fight for the word“selfishness,”35 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-35] even though theword, as used colloquially, designates both criminals and Peter Keatings, on theone hand, and also productive industrialists and Howard Roarks, on the other.36[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-36] Here, there is an attempt toobliterate a legitimate concept—selfishness—and thus we should not give up theword. (The same is true for “capitalism.”)By contrast, take the word “liberal.” In the nineteenth century, this was aproper term which stood for one who defended rights and limitedgovernment—except that it never represented a fully consistent politicalphilosophy. So historically, what started as nineteenth-century liberalismgradually became modern liberalism. (Conservatives used to claim they were thetrue liberals, but they have given up doing so.) Similarly, some people todayuse “libertarian” to designate the pro-free enterprise position, but there aresome modem liberals who call themselves libertarian as well. This stealing ofterms with undefined connotations is so prevalent today that I simply do not useany of these words. This is one reason I prefer “pro-capitalist” to“conservative.” When what is being disguised or destroyed is not exactly whatyou uphold, then drop the word and use another.As a rule, the right connotations contribute to clarity. In other words, thereis no necessary conflict between the exact denotation of a word, and itsparticular shading or emotional connotation. Sometimes, however, the two doconflict: a certain word appeals to you because it has the right emotionalconnotation, but it does not express what you want to say as clearly as another,less emotional, word. In such cases, sacrifice emotional connotation. I havethrown out beautiful passages I loved, because I found, in editing, that theyclashed with clarity. If it is a clash between color and clarity, then the colorgoes. Of course, ultimately the writing then is much more colorful, because thecolor grows out of, and supports, the material.I will speak briefly about metaphors. Metaphors, which are comparisons of onething to another, should manipulate properly the consciousness of your reader.For instance, if you say, “The snow was white as sugar,” it gives you animpression of that snow. It makes it concrete—and thus much clearer and morereal—than if you had said, “The snow was white.” Saying that “The sugar waswhite as snow” does the same thing. The principle is that a metaphor isolatesthe particular attribute of a given sensory image in order to make the readerfully aware of it. “The snow was white” and “The sugar was white” are merelyabstractions. But if you say, “The snow was white as sugar,” you make the readerhold in his mind, for a split second, the two concrete images. He has an imageof sugar and one of snow, and he sees what they have in common. It is likereconstructing the process of concept-formation in his mind—of observing whatattributes two concretes have in common.Whenever you read a passage which contains a metaphor you like, monitor what itactually does for you. You will see that, in an automatized way, the metaphorconcretizes a given attribute of a sight or event or situation, thus making itreal to you.That is all there is to the issue of metaphors. I make this point because thegreatest mystery is made of this subject in literary courses, particularly inEnglish departments. So much, in a general way, about the positive side of developing a style. On thenegative side, there are several “don’ts,” i.e., practices, that I stronglysuggest you avoid. Don’t #1: Don’t say something in a complicated manner when it can be saidsimply. Sometimes this error is caused by a mistake in thinking, when a writerhas not thought something through adequately and therefore cannot say what hewants in a simple manner. But I am speaking strictly about style here, where awriter does understand the content of his passage clearly, but nevertheless putswords together in a complicated way.Some writers do this deliberately to conceal the fact that they have nothing tosay. Nietzsche has a line [in Thus Spake Zarathustra] about poets muddying theirwaters to make them appear deep. Other writers do it so that people will notunderstand too clearly what they are saying. The archetype here is ImmanuelKant. Most of today’s newspaper and magazine reporting is a combination of the“muddied waters” approach and a gutter version of Kant. Its authors write sovaguely that they hide the fact that ( 1 ) they have nothing much to say, and(2) what they have to say is so evil that no one would accept it if they said itstraight. That is predominantly the way liberals write; they use every euphemismand indirection possible in order not to say that they are advocatingdictatorship.I want to focus here on stylistic errors, however, not on the intention to hideor disguise something.As an editor, I often correct sentences which, for example, use five words wheretwo would do. That is a purely grammatical issue. In this respect, it is goodpractice to assume that you have been given an assignment of a certain number ofwords. You would be surprised what economy this teaches. In fact, you shouldwrite this way even if you have 700,000 words to use, as I did in AtlasShrugged. That novel is very economically written given what it says. I wassharply aware of trying not to use a word or a thought that did not contributesomething important. Therefore, whether it is a newspaper column or a longnovel, the principle is the same: write economically. In editing, try to see howmany sentences can be simplified. See if fewer words will convey the samemeaning.Consider this example of one very abused structure: “It is this issue thatcontributed to the destruction of the culture.” A simpler way of stating thisis: “This issue contributed to the destruction of the culture.” There arecontexts in which the more complex form is necessary, because it has a differentemphasis—for example, as a conclusion to a certain development. But I oftenencounter that structure where it is unnecessary, and then it is very awkward.Here is another example: “Because A, B, and C—D will result.” Do not start along sentence with the word “because.” The reader does not know at the startthat you are talking about D, and so you make him retain too many subsidiary orconditional clauses without his knowing why. Do not overload your reader’s mind.You are entitled to assume that he is conscientious—that he is not skimmingquickly to the bottom of your paragraph, but is going at an even pace and istrying to grasp every word and sub-clause as you present it. But if you use a“because” in this way, your reader may have to return to the beginning of thesentence and reread it.Every rule of this kind has exceptions. In fact, stylistic rules are made to bebroken. If you observe them properly, you can sometimes achieve great effects bydeliberately breaking them. For example, in one scene in We the Living, there isa sentence which runs for almost an entire page, in which I use a lot ofsubsidiary “because’s” separated by colons. It was a deliberate fiction device—amontage of dramatic concretes before I came to the conclusion which followedfrom these concretes: “—Leo Kovalensky was sentenced to die.” Don’t #2: Don’t use a “seventy-five-cent word” where a two-syllable word willdo. Memorizing the more obscure parts of the dictionary is not erudition; anderudition (or the desire to show it) is not part of style. The simpler thewords, the better.I do not have in mind a folksy, artificial way of talking down to the reader,which one finds in today’s political literature. When I say “use simple words,”I mean it in the best sense. The simplest words in a language are the mostexpressive. So question the meaning of anything you cannot convey in simplewords. Of course, a word like “epistemology” is not simple (though it is so inthe basic vocabulary of philosophy). You need not avoid words for which thereare no synonyms. But to use an example I got from Leonard Peikoff: if you wantto say, “He said stubbornly,” do not use, “He asseverated contumaciously.”The archvillain here is William Buckley, who makes a clown of himself. Histrademark is to use words he probably spends half his time looking up in thedictionary. He expects you not to know them, and therefore to feel guilty andinferior. But the real effect is that you lose interest.Whenever you feel the need to use a word like “contumaciously,” do not. Thereare plenty of simple synonyms which are more expressive and direct. Wheneveryour reader fails to understand a word, you destroy the effect of the content onhim. Yet the main purpose of style is to communicate content as clearly andpowerfully as possible.As to the origins of such words, some are obsolete, while others come fromobscure, erudite sources a la Kant. They might have been used by writers whowanted to appear to be scholars rather than “common men.” They are predominantlyarchaic, academic remnants; no good writer today uses them. For instance, a goodnonfiction writer (whose ideas are atrocious) is Erich Fromm. He writes insimple terms which are valid both for his colleagues and for educated laymen. Heis the opposite of Buckley in that respect. This, incidentally, contributes toFromm’s prominence. Don’t #3: Don’t use pejorative adjectives, sarcasm, or inappropriate humor.In a first draft, it is sometimes valuable to express your feelings fully. Forexample, in a first draft, I have even written “abysmal bastards,” knowing thiswould not go into the final version. I was indicating that I need to projectstrong indignation and to prove it.If moral indignation is justified, then why are such words bad, stylistically?Because they are too easy. Unsupported expressions of emotion (e.g., insultingor pejorative adjectives) are arbitrary stylistically, and, philosophically,constitute emotionalism. They have the same stylistic effect as the kind ofquarrel which consists of “Says you, says I”; they always weaken an article.Even if you give reasons for your strong language, understatement is usuallymore desirable.When you understate something, the reader is aware of what you are saying; hisown mind then supplies the rest, which is what you want. But when you overstatesomething, you deafen the reader. You do not give him time to come to his ownconclusion. It is as if you were shouting at him. Observe that on stage—whilethere are situations in which nothing can substitute for a scream—in most of thefamous dramatic scenes, it is the whispered, simple sentence that gives youchills. When you overstate something, you disarm yourself. A man does not shoutwhen he is sure of his case. When a writer understates what he is saying, whatcomes across is an overwhelming assurance on his part.At one point in my article “Requiem for Man,”37[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-37] on the anticapitalist papalencyclical Populorum Progressio (“On the Development of Peoples”), I felt likereferring to the Pope as “the abysmal bastard” or worse, because I felt almostunbearable indignation. Instead, I communicated what I thought byunderstatement: “Anyone who evades that image [i.e., of life under the systemadvocated by the encyclical] ... and declares that human effort is not asufficient reason for a man to keep his own product—may claim any motive butlove of humanity.” There are circumstances in which it is proper to use ablatantly pejorative adjective, but they are the exceptions.The same point applies to sarcasm, which should be used sparingly. The generalprinciple is to prepare the ground for what you want to treat sarcastically.Make sure it is clear why you are making a sarcastic remark. Without thatcontext, sarcasm amounts stylistically to the argument from intimidation:38[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-38] you “persuade” the reader throughintimidation, saying, in effect, “I will not take you seriously if you say A,and I dismiss it sarcastically.” But in and of itself, it is of no consequencethat you, the author, dismiss something. When you have prepared your ground,however, a touch of sarcasm can be stylistically brilliant.There are some subjects which one can discuss only sarcastically, e.g., thehippies or modern art. There the subject gives you the necessary ground. It is acaricature in itself, and therefore you cannot evaluate it except in sarcasticterms (though you can discuss its psychological and philosophical rootsseriously). For instance, in my article “The ‘Inexplicable Personal Alchemy,’ ”when I move from the Russian rebels to the American rebels, I am sarcastic fromthe outset. I write: “America, too, has a vanguard of young rebels, dissenters,and fighters for freedom. Marching down the aisle of a theater, they shout theirprotest to the world: ‘I cannot travel without a passport! ... I am not allowedto smoke marijuana! ... I am not allowed to take my clothes off!’ ” I say thatthe hippies are “puppets in search of a master” and “exhibitionists who havenothing to exhibit,” etc., which are sarcastic metaphors. Yet there was no otherway to describe them.What I say about sarcasm applies to any kind of humor. Humor must be justifiedby your content. If you have not let the reader in on what you are laughing atand why, then humor is inappropriate. It becomes a substitute for giving areason—again, a form of the argument from intimidation; instead of refuting aposition, you dismiss it with humor.There are two broad categories of tone: serious and humorous. Which approach youtake depends on your evaluation of your subject—on whether you want to treat itseriously or make fun of it. As a general principle, a theoretical article mustbe serious. You might include touches of humor, but only as exceptions. As abasic approach, it would be extremely inappropriate to write a theoreticalarticle in a humorous tone, because you would be laughing at your own material.It is only the middle-range article that offers a wider choice here.In essence, humor is the denial of the importance or metaphysical validity ofsomething. Therefore, the type of humor you use depends on what you are laughingat. If you laugh at something evil, your humor will have a benevolent quality.If you laugh at the good, it will have a malicious quality.When I say it is proper to laugh at evil, I do not mean all evil. It isimproper, under all circumstances, to write humorously about tragic and painfulevents or issues—about death, cemeteries, torture chambers, concentration camps,executions, etc. This is called “sick humor,” and the designation is correct,because although it is possible to laugh at such things, one should not considerthem funny. For example, take comedies about the Nazis. I have a strong aversionto war comedies. War per se is bad enough, but war and dictatorship combined area fortiori not a subject for comedy. This applies to fiction and nonfictionwriting.Just as you should not treat tragic or painful evil humorously, neither shouldyou treat an important, good subject humorously. If, for example, with the bestintentions in the world, you wrote humorously about the heroic element in man,it would not be a good article—the issue is metaphysically important. Usually,if someone makes fun of heroes, it is not because he wants to glorify them, butbecause he is against heroism.As an example of appropriate humor in a nonfiction article, take the passage onHegel in the title essay of For the New Intellectual.39[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-39] Describing Hegel’s philosophy, Iwrite that “omniscience about the physical universe ... is to be derived, notfrom observations of the facts, but from the contemplation of [the] Idea’striple somersaults inside his, Hegel’s, mind.” The reference to triplesomersaults is meant to be light or humorous. I am not denying the seriousnessof the subject (the history of philosophy), but I am indicating that I do nottake Hegel seriously and that we need not worry about this particular monster.As a general conclusion about humor, observe that appropriate humor requires acommunity of basic premises among those whom you expect to laugh. For instance,if we disapprove of Hegel, and I make a crack about him, it will be funny to youonly because your basic estimate of him is the same as mine. But it would not befunny to a Hegelian, and you should keep this in mind. If you write an articleintended to persuade religious people that religion is wrong, a humorousapproach would be totally wrong—your readers do not share your premises, andyour humor will fall flat. In writing about ideas you oppose, use humor onlywhen you know it is based on what your audience considers funny. Don’t #4: Don’t use bromides. Bromides are canned integrations. They were goodthe first time they were used, which is why they became bromides. When writing afirst draft, if you need some color and a bromide occurs to you, but you want tocontinue writing, it is fine to keep it there as a temporary indication of athought. But do not let it stay in your final version.Bromides defeat themselves. In The Fountainhead, Austin Heller said that all thehouses offered to him were so alike, so similar to what he had seen before, thathe could not see them at all. Something too familiar becomes invisible.Similarly, bromides do not add color—they merely wipe out what you want tostress. If in editing you cannot find a colorful touch of your own, omit thecolor and use straight narrative. Do not leave in bromides. They give animpression of improper imitation.There are, of course, exceptions. For example, if you are discussing someonelike Hubert Humphrey and want to show that he is imitative or a windbag, thenselect from his speeches the most bromidic passages, provided they are notaccidental. If a politician speaks well but occasionally uses a bromide, and youselect those exceptions, that is dishonest; but if you are characterizingsomeone like Humphrey, you have a choice of riches, because everything he saysis either obfuscation or a bromide. Don’t #5: Do not use unnecessary synonyms. It was commonly held that a writershould never repeat a given word within a certain number of lines. On this view,if you used the same word twice in close proximity, you had to make a change.This is a grave error.The simplest examples of this error are found in some old novels, where theauthor wants to indicate that the characters are talking:“How do you do?” he said.“Very well, thank you,” she answered.“I’m glad to hear it,” he asserted.“Oh, are you?” she uttered.The result is an awkward collection of artificial synonyms. If you want to say“he said” and “she said,” just say it. Do not look for unnecessary synonyms.The same error occurs in nonfiction. For instance, if the word “philosophy”comes up too often, you might be tempted to look for synonyms, e.g., “wisdom,”“ideology,” “body of thought,” “world view.” Although it is awkward to use thesame word six times in two sentences, the solution is not to substitute asynonym, but to recast the sentence so as not to need to repeat the word. Oftenyou can simply use a pronoun, e.g., “it” instead of “philosophy.” But if therepetition of the word is necessary, and reconstructing the sentence leads tounnecessary complications, then simply repeat the word. This will not jump outat the reader if the context requires it.It is better to repeat a word, even if doing so is slightly obtrusive, than tosubstitute an unnatural synonym for the sake of form alone. When you use asynonym, not because you need a different shade of meaning, but strictly toavoid repetition, the result sounds phony. Moreover, when you change words notfor content but for form, the reader gets the impression that you are changingthe subject, and the result is confusing. This is particularly true inphilosophy, where there are no exact synonyms. For example, “philosophy” doesnot have quite the same meaning as “world view” or “body of thought.” In fact,there are few literal synonyms for any word. A thesaurus usually provides wordswith not quite identical meanings. In a nonfiction work, particularly on aserious subject, any time you change a word you introduce a slightly differentconnotation, and the reader will be justified in thinking that you are talkingabout something else. I want to turn now to some problem areas in the realm of style: emphasis,transitions, rhythm, and drama.EMPHASISSometimes a sentence is awkward, but you cannot figure out why. The principlehere is the same as in the rest of writing: when in doubt, refer to your exactmeaning. Just as in your article as a whole you refer to your theme as yourstandard, so in any particular sentence that seems awkward, refer to whatprecisely you want to say.The variety of grammatical structures possible in English permits you to put theemphasis where you want it. The same words combined into a grammatical sentencewill yield a different emphasis depending on how you arrange them. Therefore, ifyou have corrected any obvious problems and a sentence still seems awkward, youremphasis is probably misplaced. For instance, I once heard a beautiful line ofpoetry that went something like this: “Because you smiled at me, I was happy allday.” If it was: “I was happy all day because you smiled at me,” its emphasis,and thus its meaning, would be different. (Both arrangements are grammaticallypermissible.) In the line from the poem, the emphasis is on the fact that thespeaker’s happiness is owed to the smile of his beloved. In the other version,the emphasis is on his happiness; the cause is incidental.In an article once in Esquire, a number of people (myself included) were askedwhat the Apollo 11 astronauts should say when they land on the moon. Onecomedienne suggested: “Miami Beach, it isn’t.”40[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-40] Now if you said, “It isn’t MiamiBeach,” the meaning would be different. It is not simply the somewhat Yiddishword structure, but the misplaced emphasis. In the form the comedienne used, thethought is on Miami Beach—that is what she expects, and her first reaction is:“Well, it isn’t Miami Beach.” Therefore, she is not interested. But the otherversion—“It isn’t Miami Beach”—has no particular meaning, because it also isn’tNew York and it isn’t Paris; so it does not communicate the same thought thatwas achieved by that odd construction.For examples of this kind of manipulation of emphasis by means of wordplacement, read Time magazine. For instance, I remember Time describing someambitious, energetic man with the words: “No slouch, he.” This is typical of themagazine. The practice is not fully permissible grammatically, though it isclear and achieves a certain emphasis. If you wrote, “He is no slouch,” it wouldnot be as strong. Incidentally, although the style is amusing, Time ruins it byusing it constantly. Once you become accustomed to a distortion, it is simply adistortion and it loses emphasis. So use this sort of trick sparingly.Finally, note that whenever there are several grammatically permissiblealternatives, the smoothest will be the one that carries your exact emphasis.TRANSITIONSThere is a great deal of misunderstanding about transitions. Some believe youshould always indicate a transition from paragraph to paragraph—but in fact youcould not make a worse mistake. If it were true, you would also need atransition from sentence to sentence—but then what would be the transition froma sentence to a transition ? Transitions are not necessary if your sentencesfollow one another logically. Logic is the link between sentences, paragraphs,chapters, and volumes.When discussing a certain aspect of your subject, if you proceed to the nextparagraph and are still discussing that aspect, that is a logical transition andno special bridge is necessary. A transition is needed only when you switch to adifferent aspect of your subject. If its connection to the immediate discussionis not clear, you need a transition. But if in a certain discussion eachsentence follows from the preceding one, and each paragraph follows from thepreceding one, then you can rely on your reader’s own power of integration. Youmust assume your reader can hold a progression in mind. If your presentation isclear and logical, but your reader cannot keep in mind what you were discussingin paragraph #1, and why #2 and #3 follow, then he cannot read the articleanyway, and no transition would help. Do not write on the premise that you mustlead the reader by the hand every time you move to a new paragraph.A paragraph serves the same function as a period. It is a pause, whichunobtrusively makes the reader realize that he is coming to the end of somethingand that the author is starting on some new, though connected, development. Thereader has to integrate this quickly and automatically.As you edit your article, be the reader’s guide. If you introduce a certain ideaand in the next five paragraphs discuss various aspects of it, then, when youbegin the next sequence, you should perhaps remind your reader of your mainidea. (This is not really a transition, but a reminder.) Judge whether aprogression is too long for the reader to keep in mind. But aside from thesereminders, provide transitions only when there is a specific change of directionor aspect for which the reader cannot immediately see the need.In fiction writing, transitions must be hidden. But in nonfiction, the moreopenly and simply you indicate a (necessary) transition, the better, becausehidden transitions here are confusing and artificial. For example, suppose youwere talking about the politics of a mixed economy and now want to discusseconomics. Simply say: “Now let us consider the economics of a mixed economy,”or: “Turning to economics.” Take the reader into your confidence. If yourindication is brief and logical, he will know automatically that you arechanging aspects, and he will integrate them.If you fail to include a necessary transition, your reader will begin the newparagraph, pause, read the next sentence, and then return to the precedingparagraph to establish the transition himself. In effect, he thinks: “Oh, I see.He is now discussing economics instead of politics.” Never force your reader todo that.The simplest and most open transition is best. But suppose you say: “Now that wehave discussed the politics of a mixed economy, we will next turn to theeconomics of a mixed economy.” This kind of repetition is annoying, unnecessary,and confusing. The reader operates on the assumption that everything the authordoes is for a purpose. If you offer the reader unnecessary recapitulations, hewill ask himself what he missed—why this purposeful writer finds it necessary torepeat something. The result is that you momentarily lose the reader.It is sometimes necessary to number the subdivisions of an issue. For instance,if you are discussing the bad consequences of a mixed economy and want to makesure your reader remembers them all, then number each of the consequences. Ifyou use this method occasionally, it will help to integrate your material. Thenumbers remind the reader that these points are all part of one development. Andif it is a lengthy discussion, by the time the reader finishes with consequence#5, he can easily refer back to the beginning of the sequence and remind himselfof the others. But do not abuse this method. If at several places you use asentence followed by a series of numbers, it becomes too hard to follow.When you use the numerical method, be sure to indicate clearly when you arebeyond your numbered points. Often the content will do this, but sometimes youneed a transitional sentence to indicate that you have finished with consequence#5 and are proceeding to the next development. There are many ways of doing it,but the simplest form of this transition is something like: “Such are theconsequences of a mixed economy.”Sometimes the sentence structure itself provides a transition from onedevelopment to another. Since this is a complex method, I want to illustrate itfrom my article “What is Romanticism?” Here are the first two paragraphs:Romanticism is a category of art based on the recognition of the principle thatman possesses the faculty of volition.Art is a selective re-creation of reality according to an artist’s metaphysicalvalue-judgments. An artist recreates those aspects of reality which representhis fundamental view of man and of existence. In forming a view of man’s nature,a fundamental question one must answer is whether man possesses the faculty ofvolition—because one’s conclusions and evaluations in regard to all thecharacteristics, requirements and actions of man depend on the answer.First, I give a generalized definition of Romanticism. (Of course, I will haveto validate that definition.) Moving to a wider abstraction, I next define art.I indicate how an artist presents his fundamental view of man and of existence,and that with respect to man, a fundamental question is whether or not hepossesses volition.This abstract information lays the foundation for what follows. But I mustreturn to how this affects the nature of Romanticism. Here is my next sentence(the third paragraph): “Their opposite answers to this question constitute therespective basic premises of two broad categories of art: Romanticism, whichrecognizes the existence of man’s volition—and Naturalism, which denies it.” Thesentence structure provides the transition, which is in the first part of thissentence.Observe that I could have omitted this transition and begun the third paragraphwith: “There are two broad categories of art,” etc. That would be clear, butthere would still be a slight jump. So instead I make a verbal bridge, which Iinclude in the sentence structure in place of a separate transition. Instead ofdeclaring, “There are two categories,” I say, “Their opposite answers to thisquestion”—I have not yet said who “they” are—“constitute the respective basicpremises of two broad categories of art,” and then I name them. In this way Iform a transition from the generalized abstract discussion, which merelyindicated the foundation, to the specific subject of the article. I make thetransition to the discussion of Romanticism by tying it verbally, within thesame sentence, to the preceding development. That makes for smoother reading. Itforms a connection in the reader’s mind, and it indicates why I provided theabstract foundation. It also indicates why I divide art into these two broadcategories and what their essentials are. Before I go into any furtherdiscussion of the two categories, I indicate that they have opposite answers toa question which is fundamental to any art. Thus, I kill several birds with onesentence.I call this a sentence-structure transition, in that I do not use a separatestatement to indicate that I am going from the abstract to the concrete subjectof this article.It would be awkward, however, to start an article that way. If “Their oppositeanswers,” etc. were the first sentence, a series of unanswered questions wouldimmediately arise: Why am I putting something in reverse? Why do I start withoutindicating what the fundamental question is? Why do I want to discuss two broadcategories before I have named them?Stylistically, a smooth flowing presentation depends especially on the innerlogic of the progression of thought. If you follow this logic and do not pausetoo much between sentences, the result (after some editing) will be a smooth,logically connected presentation. A presentation which strikes you as awkward orjumpy, by contrast, is the result of a writer’s uncertainty. Either he is notfollowing the inner logic himself, or he has not fully integrated theprogression of thought even in his own mind. Thus he writes at random, or, morefrequently, he tries to write by his conscious mind, sentence by deliberatesentence. (This is one bad consequence of attempting to write by a consciousmethod, without subconscious integration.)RHYTHMRhythm is such a tricky problem area that, in effect, I advise you to leave italone.In poetry, the rhythm of a sentence is formalized; when you use one type, youknow what category it belongs to, so it is not a problem. But the rhythm of aprose sentence is a complex issue. Rhythm, after all, pertains primarily to therealm of music, not concepts. It has to do with the way certain sounds registerin our brain. Rhythm is the progression and timing of sounds, and the intervalsbetween them. Therefore, the trouble here is the same as with music: we do notyet have an objective vocabulary of music, and thus we cannot say objectivelywhy a certain combination of sounds affects us in a certain way.41[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-41] At present, it is impossible todefine precise principles by which to determine whether or not a given sentenceis rhythmical.Rhythm involves not only psychology, but neurology. It involves the waysensations reach our brain, along with the timing of, and the relationshipsamong, these sensations. This is not a mystical, but a perceptual sense—a sensepertaining to the development of our organ of hearing.So do not worry about this issue, and do not aim consciously at “good rhythm.”Let it come naturally. As you write, you will develop your own sense of rhythm.Whenever you begin to feel you need an extra word or syllable, you aredeveloping a sense of rhythm, and you would do well to observe it. In thisissue, as in music, ultimately it is each man for himself. For the time being,you must rely on your own sense of rhythm. Go by whatever your own ear senses assmooth or awkward. (There is, however, a lot of agreement about what constitutesa good or bad sentence rhythmically.)There is a correlation between rhythm and emphasis. Whenever your sentence iswrong in emphasis, chances are it will also be awkward in rhythm. It will sounduneven or unfinished somehow. Similarly, there is a correlation between rhythmand precision. A sentence may also sound uneven if it includes unnecessarywords—but this is not a guaranteed correlation.To give you an example of good and bad rhythm, consider a line from my article“What is Romanticism?” I write: “Man cannot live without philosophy, and neithercan he write.” I think this is properly rhythmical. But now suppose I hadwritten: “Man cannot live without philosophy, and he cannot write much.” Theproblem is not simply content (though the content is slightly different in eachcase, which illustrates the connection between rhythm and precision); thesentence is bad rhythmically. It sounds chopped off—as if it had no businessending on that particular syllable.When we hear sounds, our integrating mechanism requires a certain balance.Musical sequences are usually divided into equivalent phrase groups. The logicof the structure thus requires that the sequence be fulfilled; if it is not, onefeels unsatisfied and somewhat agitated. There is a feeling of somethingincomplete or unbalanced. An unfinished musical phrase is awful, and the sameissue is involved in the rhythm of sentences.Be sure to avoid rhymes. “Poems” without rhymes are neither prose norpoetry—they are nothing. For the same reason, a rhyme in a prose sentence is outof place, and thus distracts your attention by taking your mind to anothermedium. Moreover, it sounds artificial. If a rhyme occurs in prose, it cancreate all kinds of confusion.If you ever have to choose between rhythm and clarity, sacrifice rhythm. Shortof that, always adjust bad rhythm, because it is important to a good style.Generally, this is not difficult. The extra word or syllable can usually befound.When and if someone defines what constitutes rhythm (and this will take aneurologist, a psychologist, and an esthetician), we will have more exactprinciples to work with. But it is not necessary to be omniscient on thissubject. It is appropriate to go by your own sense of rhythm. If you have notdeveloped one, that is not necessarily a writing flaw. So do not worry muchabout rhythm.Like everything else about style, rhythm must never be aimed at consciously.More than any other aspect of style, it must come about naturally, by means ofsubconscious integration.DRAMAIn nonfiction, drama is a way of capturing or holding the reader’s interest.With rare exceptions, drama belongs not in theoretical, but in middle-rangearticles. It involves an indirect approach which must be brief and whichconsists of saying something unexpected or intriguing. It usually involvesstarting out of context, or uttering something a couple of paragraphs earlierthan the logical progression requires.To give an extreme example, suppose a writer begins an article: “You are amurderer whether you know it or not.” That is a dramatic opening, and it iscertainly intriguing. It arrests your attention immediately. The author thenproceeds to explain that the article is about the welfare state, and that if youever voted for any welfare measures, you are responsible for an unknown amountof destruction—and maybe even for deaths. He concludes by saying that you are asbad as a murderer if you vote for liberals. The above is an exaggeration, but itillustrates the method by which one achieves drama.Do not aim at drama consciously (particularly if you are a beginning writer). Ifyou do, the result will be not dramatic but artificial. Let any drama grow outof your material. When you are at home with a straight, logical presentation,then touches of drama might occur to you spontaneously—in which case, they willoften be just right and will add a colorful, attention-arresting element to yourmaterial. But do not try to force this. Remember, drama is not the essence ofnonfiction writing, contrary to what some writing courses teach.Finally, as in all issues of style, if there is ever a clash between drama andclarity, sacrifice drama. I want next to compare two different styles. I will present passages from twojournalistic articles that treat the same material, and will thereby make thedifferent stylistic elements clear. Observe here the choice of content and thechoice of words, and how different basic premises affect the presentations.Both articles cover the launching of Apollo 11 in 1969, and each passageconsists of (1) a description of the crowd in Titusville (the closest town tothe launch site, about ten miles away) the night before the launch, and (2) adescription of Apollo 11 at night from across the river.From “Apollo 11” by Ayn Rand42 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-42]On the shore of the Indian River, we saw cars, trucks, trailers filling everyfoot of space on both sides of the drive, in the vacant lots, on the lawns, onthe river’s sloping embankment. There were tents perched at the edge of thewater; there were men and children sleeping on the roofs of station wagons, inthe twisted positions of exhaustion ; I saw a half-naked man asleep in a hammockstrung between a car and a tree. These people had come from all over the countryto watch the launching across the river, miles away. (We heard later that thesame patient, cheerful human flood had spread through all the small communitiesaround Cape Kennedy that night, and that it numbered one million persons.) Icould not understand why these people would have such an intense desire towitness just a few brief moments; some hours later I understood it.It was still dark as we drove along the river. The sky and the water were asolid spread of dark blue that seemed soft, cold, and empty. But, framed by themotionless black leaves of the trees on the embankment, two things marked offthe identity of the sky and the earth: far above the sky, there was a single,large star; and on earth, far across the river, two enormous sheaves of whitelight stood shooting motionlessly into the empty darkness from two tiny uprightshafts of crystal that looked liked glowing icicles; they were Apollo 11 and itsservice tower.From “Apollo’s Great Leap for the Moon” by Loudon Wainwright43[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-43]All along the shoulders of U.S. Highway #1 and packed solid to the river thatran near it were thousands of trailers, camping vans, tents, makeshift sheltersof all kinds. People lolled in the grass, infants were sleeping in cradles onthe hoods and tops of cars, fathers and sons were setting up telescopes, bandsof the young in trunks and bikinis ran everywhere. Clearly visible through thenight about 10 miles away was the Apollo 11, bathed in searchlights, a tinystalk of light in the darkness, and this vast picnic crowd had gathered to seethe booster belch out its tremendous power, and hurl likenesses of themselves atthe Moon.By morning there were many more—campsites, beaches, jetties, every place ofviewing space was jammed with the watchers, and it was extraordinary indeed todrive past miles of faces staring toward 30 seconds of history.The main point to observe, stylistically, is showing versus telling.44[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-44] I am not a reporter by profession,but in my article I operated on a premise that reporters do not use today (ifthey did, they would be giants of journalism)—namely, to be a literal reporter.I show you the scene, I do not tell you about it. If you want your readers tofeel as if they were there, then concretize the event selectively. Stay awayfrom generalities. I tried to reconstruct the event exactly as I saw it, almostdeliberately omitting any editorial interference. I gave my editorial viewpointby means of concretes; whether the reader accepts it or not, he feels he hasseen the event. The typical reporter, however, merely tells you about an event.Observe how this is done. For instance, I write: “On the shore of the IndianRiver, we saw cars, trucks, trailers filling every foot of space on both sidesof the drive, in the vacant lots, on the lawns, on the river’s slopingembankment.” Wainwright writes: “All along the shoulders of U.S. Highway #1 andpacked solid to the river that ran near it were thousands of trailers, campingvans, tents, makeshift shelters of all kinds.” His big mistake stylistically is“of all kinds.” It was unnecessary. He lists all the different types of vehiclesand where they were placed, as do 1. But I tell you they were in every availablefoot of space and provide some examples of the kinds of space. I give you enoughconcretes so that you get the impression that it is a large crowd. I did notmake any generalized estimates. It is sufficient to say there were cars, trucks,trailers. The reader can project that those are not the only kinds of vehicles.But when Wainright adds “makeshift shelters of all kinds,” that is improperabstraction. It destroys the reality of the concretes, because you cannot, inreality, see such a thing as “of all kinds.” He destroys the firsthandperception of the scene, giving the reader instead an editorial summation.Similarly, he writes that “bands of the young in trunks and bikinis raneverywhere.” “Ran everywhere” involves the same mistake. He cannot literallymean everywhere, so it is a sloppy way of saying, “I saw many of them.” Such anexaggerated generality destroys the concrete reality of the sight.His best line is: “it was extraordinary indeed to drive past miles of facesstaring toward 30 seconds of history.” He combines and condenses the concretesby means of a wide abstraction. So even though faces cannot literally stare athistory, the expression is appropriate. He makes it original because he combinesmiles of faces staring in one direction, which gives you a visual concrete, withthe fact that it lasted only thirty seconds. He is referring to the blastoffitself, but says that the thirty seconds represent history. This dramaticallycondenses several complex thoughts into one image.Since nobody can include literally every detail, what you choose to includebecomes very significant. I discuss this issue in “Art and Sense of Life.”45[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-45] I begin the article with adescription of a painting of a beautiful woman who has a cold sore, and use itto make the point that everything in a work of art is significant by reason ofits inclusion. The same principle applies to nonfiction writing. You cannot be averbal photographer who includes everything. Therefore, the total effect isachieved by the kind of concretes you do include, even in a journalisticaccount. Wainwright and I are both describing the same scene. But I select onlyrelevant details—and in the case of the crowd, only details relevant to oneoverall image: its purposefulness, and the difficulties people were willing toendure. Take, for instance, the half-naked man in the hammock. It is anuncomfortable position, and reveals his ingenuity and determination.Wainwright’s worst selection was “bands of the young in trunks and bikinis raneverywhere.” I saw no one in trunks or bikinis, or running around. WhatWainwright probably did was combine (through sheer inattention) sights from thenight before the launch with what he saw right after it. There was an unbearabletraffic jam along the road after the launch, and you did see a lot of trunks andbikinis. It would be appropriate to mention them if you were describing theterrible heat during the day, after the launch. But what you saw the nightbefore was immobility. There was no place to run around, since everything wastightly packed. Even if there were a boy in trunks and a girl in a bikinirunning for a sandwich or to visit a friend in another car, you should notinclude this, because it would be a purely accidental, atypical element.Wainwright’s choice of such nonessentials suggests falsely a circus atmosphere.If you are describing a huge crowd that came from everywhere, attracted by agreat event, you do not introduce bikinis. If you mention them at all, it shouldbe in some unflattering contrast to what is important. But he picks that as anessential part of the atmosphere.Everything I select adds up to a total and is purposeful. My mind does notwander to some boy’s trunks or girl’s bikini. But he has no hierarchy of values,and thus no conscious purposefulness. I know what is accidental and what istypical of the crowd. For instance, take the man in the hammock. He might havebeen the only one, but this was typical of the kind of adjustments to discomfortthat people were making. Therefore, I included him as an individual. If I hadseen many girls running in bikinis for some reason, whether contributing to theevent or distracting from it, 1 would have included that fact. But one girldoing so is an accident. Further, Wainwright does not project the mood of thecrowd; if anything, he detracts from it. He uses words like “people lolled” and“they ran everywhere,” so you do not know whether it is a picnic, as he callsit, or something else. His description adds up to nothing.There are situations in which you want to describe a purposeless crowd. In thosecases you do what he did: select random, contradictory bits. But he was tryingto describe a purposeful event—a crowd gathered for a specific purpose. The moodof the event was visually perceptible—you could tell people took it seriously.But he does not project that.A different approach to an event dictates a different way of writing about it. Igive the view of Apollo 11 at night a whole paragraph. He makes it onesubsidiary sentence. His focus is on the crowd, not on the rocket. I say as muchabout the people as he does, but they never steal the stage. In my article, thecrowd serves to feature the importance of the event. That is how my mindorganized the material. This is how basic premises direct your choice ofcontent—of what aspect of the event you present in what manner—and you cannotcalculate that consciously.If you want subtler streaks of style which create a certain impression, observethe following: “There were tents perched at the edge of the water; there weremen and children sleeping on the roofs of station wagons, in the twistedpositions of exhaustion; I saw a half-naked man asleep in a hammock strungbetween a car and a tree.” This is a choppy description. “There were” is notvery elegant—it is too direct and easy. But I use it to give the reader thefeeling (since Frank and I were driving past) of a montage. Again, I appeal toactual visual perception. I did not see a flowing progression, but snatches oftypical sights. Therefore, I wanted choppiness in my description. What holds ittogether is the fact that the concretes are all part of the same scene; they addup to an impression of the size, discomfort, and exhaustion of the crowd. Later,when I say, “the same, patient cheerful flood,” it would have been a badeditorial estimate had I not already given you the concretes. Had I presented asmooth, flowing sentence, that too would have been an editorial summation,whereas I wanted to show what I saw. Always try in such cases to reconstruct forthe reader, by means of essentials, what you perceived.Now consider this line of Wainwright’s: “this vast picnic crowd had gathered tosee the booster belch out its tremendous power and hurl likenesses of themselvesat the Moon.” It is disgusting. First, notice the choice of words, and keep inmind my discussion of connotation. I would use a word like “belch” only if Iwanted to degrade something. While that was not his intention, it is a veryinappropriate word here. And “likenesses of themselves” provides a disgustingglimpse of his ideas about human motivation.Observe also the mixture of time elements. He is describing the night before thelaunch. The next paragraph begins: “By morning there were many more.” So thepreceding sentence about the belching and hurling is, in his mind, part of thenight before. That is undercutting. He projects what he saw later and makes itpart of the description of the night before, and then returns to the nextmorning. Therefore, his readers do not know where they are. He is trying to tellyou how he imagined, that night, what the crowd was going to see. Not only isthis confusing, but nothing could be more anti-climactic and more presumptuousthan projecting a great event that is going to happen. He had no business doingit. This approach would be bad enough if it described a small event, because itproduces an anticlimax. But considering the grand nature of this event, hispresumption is dreadful.If there is an unprecedented sight of such importance that a million people comefrom far away and endure terrible discomfort to see it, and the reporter says,“I know what will happen, there will be fire belching and likenesses hurled,”that is presumptuous. He sees no difference between a description of the eventand his own imaginary bromides about it. I would not dare do this. Everyliterary and philosophical premise in me would stop me. If I think the event isbig, I let it speak for itself.Had I been disappointed—which I was not, it was greater than anything I couldhave imagined—! would say, “I expected a big burst of fire and it fizzled.” Onecould properly write that about some event that, for example, was oversold bypress agents.Do not project in images what you think an event is going to be like. Alwaysstay behind the event. If you have any values to project (which I did), do it bymeans of the concretes you select, never by means of your own imaginaryconstructs.Here are some more problems with Wainwright’s choice of words. He said, “Peoplelolled in the grass.” Nobody lolled that night. But even if he saw, forinstance, somebody sitting in the grass, the verb “lolled” destroys thedescription. Nobody would loll on a lawn if he had to stay awake all night indreadful heat. If you saw those people, you would never think of a lightweightverb pertaining to relaxation. Similarly, he should not have used “picnic” as hedid. Again, watch the connotations of the words you use.His worst mistake with respect to word choice comes in his description of Apollo11 at night: “Clearly visible through the night about 10 miles away was theApollo 11, bathed in searchlights, a tiny stalk of light in the darkness.” Morethan anything else, this made me furious. I had gone through the process ofworking to convey that tremendous visual sight. Then to see somebody with thesame problem dismiss it in this way—it was most telling. “Bathed insearchlights” is a bromide. You could say “dripping with light” or “wet withlight” (as I once said in The Fountainhead); that says something. But “bathed inlight” is a bad choice of words; even if somehow you had to use that bromide, itmore appropriately describes something indoors (e.g., “a drawing room bathed inlight”). But Wainwright uses an inexact bromide about a sight that had enormousgrandeur, instead of struggling to describe accurately those huge lights comingout of the two small figures. I almost felt like a proletarian angry at the ideaof a bourgeois who does not earn his income. Wainwright did not work at it—hewas inadequate to the task.Moreover, they were not searchlights, because searchlights move. They were hugebatteries of light installed around Apollo 11 and its service tower. This is agood example of the difference between showing and telling. He uses aninappropriate conceptual summation—“searchlights”—instead of giving you theactual sight and letting you conclude that they were searchlights or some otherkind of lights. He sums up, rather than showing you what he saw.Earlier I said that you can improve your ability to write by identifying a badpassage and why it is bad; you thereby learn the abstract principles involved. Ihope this comparison clarifies what I meant by that advice."},{"pageContent":"9Book Reviews and IntroductionsReviewing books is a valid profession, if practiced properly. Its purpose istwofold: to report on and to evaluate what is published. A reviewer functions asa reporter and scout, since nobody can read everything that is published.There used to be reviewers who had personal followings, because they werereliable. They had definite viewpoints, and you knew by what standards theypraised or panned a book. I observed through the years that as these peoplelowered their standards and recommended bad books, they lost their followings.Today, no reviewer has a following, because none has any standards. Some openlyadmit the fact that they follow their feelings, while most evade it. But eventhe worst irrationalist will not be guided by somebody else’s feelings forever.Therefore, reviewers have no function today, even among people who agree withthem. If anyone reads them, it is for the reason I do: to discover what the bookis about, ignoring the reviewer’s estimate. That is the best reviewers can dotoday, and it is a disgrace to the profession.In The Objectivist, we do not review bad books, because there are enough badideas floating around, and it would not be worthwhile to my readers to be toldhow many bad books are published. Not only would it have no value, but we couldnot keep up with them.The special purpose of our book reviews is to help those who agree withObjectivism acquire relevant knowledge. A philosophy provides the basicprinciples that apply to all of existence, but it does not tell you everything.There are many discoveries and arguments, particularly in the social sciences,which are relevant to philosophy and necessary to know. For example, it is notenough to be for free enterprise on moral grounds. You must also know thehistorical case for it, and be able to answer the questions being raised aboutit today.A corollary purpose is to help worthwhile books against the blockade of liberalson the left and religionists on the right. Little of value is published today.But those books of value that are published may never be heard of, given thepresent state of reviewing. I dread to think of how many good books have beenpublished but went unknown. Of course, personally, that is my battle. So asecondary purpose of book reviewing in The Objectivist is to let an interestedaudience know that these worthwhile books exist. Few books are fully on ourside; but any book whose virtues, ideologically, outweigh its errors is worthsupporting. This does not mean we have to praise every book we review. It meanswe do not review the books we cannot praise. Since we are not a generalinformation magazine, but one with a certain viewpoint, we are not obligated toreview everything that appears.A magazine with a general cultural viewpoint, however, is so obligated, thoughsuch magazines seldom fulfill that obligation. A general reviewer of booksshould review the whole field of books, and only differentiate between books ofgreater and lesser importance (by the length of the reviews and, in general, bythe attention given the books). This is a legitimate undertaking, thoughmagazines today never do it. But that is their problem and their immorality.A magazine that undertakes to review the whole field of books requires negativebook reviewing. The responsibility for assigning books is the editor’s, not thereviewer’s. For example, the policy of The New York Times is to give left-wingbooks to sympathetic left-wing reviewers, and right-wing books to left-wingreviewers as well. That is dishonest and nonobjective. But suppose a magazine’spolicy were fair, and you received a book to review, which you found was bad. Itis appropriate to write a negative review.There are three basic requirements for a book review: ( 1 ) to indicate thenature of the book; (2) to tell the reader what its value is; and (3) to tellhim briefly what its flaws are, if any. (I am speaking now of nonfiction books;I will cover reviews of fiction later. ) Point 1: The nature of the book. Do not give a full synopsis. Do not reportevery salient point or the exact progression of a book. This is a mistakebeginning reviewers often commit. Indicate the nature of the book, but do notrecapitulate it. There is an old joke where one intellectual asks another: “Haveyou read any good book reviews lately?” That used to be the literati’s custom,and you should avoid it.Always indicate the author’s general theme. You need not describe all of hisreasoning or material; merely indicate the overall direction by saying theauthor claims A, B, and C, and such is the theme of the book. Whether you agreewith him or not is a separate issue (which comes under points 2 and 3).As a reviewer, you must be skillful enough to isolate the book’s essentials, andpresent only those. State the subject and give some idea of the author’sdevelopment of that subject—the highlights and key points. (And even here youneed not include everything.) But never include nonessentials while omitting keypoints, because that constitutes a misrepresentation. This can happen when youare in a hurry: if your space is limited, and you have not prepared a goodoutline, you might start listing the first points that come to your mind,although they are nonessential. But to be fair, you must include what isessential to the author’s theme.Always include some quotations that are typical of the author. This is importanton two counts: ( 1 ) it gives the reader, firsthand, an idea of the author’sapproach, and (2) it gives an idea of his style (which is important, even innonfiction). In a certain sense, a reader has to take you on faith. You are themiddleman, and the more quotations you provide, the better you are as areporter, because it is by means of these that the reader can judge you as wellas the book. He can see whether what you allege about the book is actuallysupported by the quotations. I frequently read reviews in which the quo- .tations do not fit the reviewer’s evaluation (and often they are much moreinteresting than what the reviewer tells you). Therefore, whenever you usequotations—and use them appropriately—you provide objective evidence of your ownreliability.The difficulty is finding brief quotations, because a review made uppredominantly of quotations ceases to be a review. It becomes a sampling, like amovie trailer, and does not tell the reader what the book is about; he does notknow what there is between those quotations. So preserve a balance.Obviously, your selection of quotations must not be distorted. If you readtoday’s reviews, you will notice that anything can be supported by ellipses andthe out-of-context quotation, which is immoral. If you cannot support aparticular contention of yours by means of quotes, do so without them. It can bedifficult, especially in nonfiction books, to find a quotation which is brief,yet distinctive enough to indicate the author’s viewpoint and the quality of hiswriting.In all writing, the principle of selectivity operates by implication. The readerwill necessarily think, to the extent he trusts you, that if you select aquotation, it is representative and fair. Your selection carries weight by thefact of being selected, so be sure it lives up to your purpose—namely, toindicate the essentials of the author’s approach and style. There is noprofession immune from the rules of objectivity. If you are not objective inreviewing books, you will lose your following. And every writer should want afollowing, in the sense of having his readers satisfied rationally and havingthem trust him.Suppose you review a book that has many different aspects. If the author isparticularly interested in one aspect, but you focus on another which you findmore interesting, that is not improper, provided you indicate both the author’sinterest and your own. You need not share the author’s main interest in order towrite a fair review.Suppose somebody were reviewing Atlas Shrugged (to take an example fromfiction). If he consulted me, I would say the most important aspects to coverare: esthetically, the presentation of man the hero; and philosophically, thebook’s ethics and epistemology. But suppose the reviewer, who agrees with thenovel’s philosophy, is particularly interested in its political aspects, whichhe stresses. That would not please me, but I would not consider it dishonest, solong as he indicates that my theme is wider than politics. His approach would beall right, because that aspect is in the book, only it is not as important to meas it is to this reviewer. Such a review is fair, because you cannot expect areviewer to agree with you on every aspect of your book and to have the samehierarchy of values.It would be inappropriate, however, if one had a totally different motive.Suppose you are reviewing a book on esthetics, in which the author presents anew theory of art. But you are primarily interested in capitalism, and thus inthe single section of the book that discusses the plight of the artist insociety. You then take the book as a springboard for presenting something quitedifferent from its actual subject and theme. That would be misleading.Fairness is always possible. The secret is to identify the facts, and thenexplicitly identify to yourself and to your readers what you are doing. In thatway, you can be perfectly fair to an author, even when you disagree with majoraspects of his book. Point 2: The value of the book. I can state this point briefly. Indicate what isgood or informative about the book, i.e., what the reader will learn from it.Here you can follow a simple rule: if you think the book is valuable, askyourself what you learned from it. Select what is most important, and indicatethat to the reader. Point 3: The flaws of the book. Briefly indicate the book’s philosophical andstylistic flaws. This is especially important in regard to nonfiction books ofmixed premises, which are the best an Objectivist can recommend today. Therewill always be books of mixed premises which are valuable, but their mistakesmust be indicated.If you do not indicate the book’s flaws, you bewilder your reader. It is unfairnot to tell the reader the aspects of the book with which you disagree. But donot argue with the author. For example, some inexperienced Objectivist writersbelieve you should use a book review to spread Objectivism. But the sameconsiderations [discussed in chapter 4] apply here, only more so. When youreport on a book, you are not selling your philosophy. You are merely sellingthe particular values which the reader can find in this book. It is not your jobto save the soul of the author. And more importantly, you must not use his bookto present your ideas. That is what too many of today’s reviewers do. Whetherthey do it to show off their intelligence or to proselytize for their ownphilosophy, it is a mistake.As a reviewer, you must express your opinion. But be sure to keep your estimateseparate from your report on the book. When you find flaws, it is important toindicate them and, if the issue is serious enough, to indicate what the truth ison that issue. But do not begin to argue for the correct view. Merely indicatewhat the truth is about some error by the author, and give a reference to wherethe reader can look up the proof of your point, if necessary.In effect, your policy should be: “This book has values A, B, C, and D, whichmake the book worthwhile, but it has flaws Y and Z. Here is why I regard them asflaws ...” But be sure you present the author’s ideas correctly. If the authoris good on certain points, do not exaggerate them and make him out to be betterthan he is. Likewise, if there are points which contradict your own viewpoint,do not denounce him and exaggerate his flaws. A review is not a polemic.A polemical article has its place. One can take a book with a wrong viewpointand write an article denouncing it and explaining why it is wrong. Even in suchan article you must present the author’s viewpoint fairly, so as to avoidattacking a strawman. But that is not a book review—it is a discussion of ideasfor which the particular book you are attacking serves as the springboard.Having examined the three basic requirements of a book review, I next want tomention two errors that reviewers often make.The first error is to tell the author how he should have written his book. Neverdo this. You can offer criticisms without telling the author what he should havedone. This error takes the form: “If the author had done so and so,” or even:“The author should have done so and so.” That is no longer a report orevaluation, but the attitude of a bad editor. (A good editor never tells anauthor how to rewrite a book; he merely indicates the flaws he finds.) It ispermissible to say, for example, “The author has stated such and such, but hehas not touched on these aspects.” That is not the same as saying “The authorshould have included these aspects.”This is not merely a semantic issue. The impropriety is not only the form youuse, but your intention. Telling an author what he should have done is soinappropriate that any writer should resent it. I resent it every time Iencounter it, even if the book is bad, because it is presumptuous andpatronizing. A reviewer’s job is to report on a book and evaluate it, not to sethimself up as a collaborator and to tell the author or the public how a givenbook should have been written. He cannot hold as the author’s fault the factthat the author has a different philosophical outlook, even if it is wrong. Areviewer must inform the reader about the author’s viewpoint, not substitute hisown. Moreover, to say what a marvelous book you would have written is entirelyinappropriate; and a reader’s immediate reaction is: “Why didn’t you write it?”Therefore, avoid telling the author what he should have done. (If you write,“The author claims it is appropriate for the government to interfere; I,however, disagree,” you are not implying the author should have rewritten theline. For you are not saying the author should have accepted your views, or evenknown of them.)This leads me to the second error: the failure to keep a strict line betweenwhat the author says and what the reviewer says. This problem enters into everyreview, because you should not entirely isolate the description from theevaluation; you must make parenthetical value judgments as you proceed. The bestway to avoid the error is by explicit statement. You say, in effect, “This isthe author’s viewpoint ; and now this is me, the reviewer, talking.”When you are synopsizing the author, you need not constantly remind the readerthat you are doing so. But at occasional intervals, when you want to stress thatthis is something you have gathered from the book, write: “as the author states”or the like. And after every aside in which you have expressed an opinion,indicate your return to the presentation of the author’s views.In a negative review, you have to tell the reader why the book is bad and whatkinds of errors the author commits (e.g., he suppresses or distorts facts, or hedraws the wrong conclusions from them). But there too, be sure to keep yourviews separate from the narrative material. First, present the essentials of thebook, and of the author’s viewpoint, as clearly and fairly as possible. Thensay, for example, “I think this is a bad book because the author distorts theevidence on such and such facts,” and cite the proof of his misrepresentations.Then say, “From these facts he draws the following conclusion, and here is whatis wrong with it.” But at no time should your motive be to show the stupidauthor how much cleverer you are than he (which is not much of an achievement ifthe book is that bad). A review is not a contest between you and the author.Your own philosophy should not be your primary focus. For instance, you write:“The author distorts facts A, B, and C, and he draws the collectivist conclusionX, which is wrong. Free enterprise did not lead to the evils he asserts; thecause was Y.” Here, your own pro-capitalist viewpoint is implied. You can even,when appropriate, state it openly. But always remember that it is not yourpurpose to use a book to propagandize for capitalism or whatever your viewsmight be. If the assignment is to report on a given book, that is what youshould do. If the magazine did not hire you to write a hymn to capitalism, donot write one. (If that was what the editors wanted, they would have asked youfor an article, not a review.)Never use a bad book for some improper or irrelevant purpose, just because yourpurpose is “good.” The end does not justify the means. This is what left-wingreviewers try to do. They may even know they are being dishonest and slantingtheir reviews, but they argue: “The author is for capitalism, therefore he isevil; I am doing this for collectivism, therefore I am good and my distortionsare justified.” That is the psychology of leftist reviewers, and you must notaccept any part of it. Unfortunately, the opportunity to review good fiction will rarely come up. Iwish there were more fiction books to plug, but there are not. There may be inthe future, however, so you should know how to handle such a happy contingency.The three main elements to cover in nonfiction reviewing—the nature of the book,its value, and its flaws—apply also to fiction reviewing, but with certainvariations.In regard to the first point, when you review fiction, indicate the nature andprogression of the story, but not its climax or resolution. This is not anabsolute. Sometimes the climax illuminates the whole book, so you need todiscuss it. But usually it is better to build up the suspense and then, ineffect, tell the reader, “If you want to know how it turns out, read the book.”If your review is positive, it serves as a “movie trailer” for the book. A movietrailer selects what will arouse the viewer’s interest, and presents him with abrief montage of the film. The same principle applies to a positive review offiction. Indicate what the story is about and some of its progression, but donot give away everything. Make the reader interested enough to read the book.In mystery reviews it is an unwritten law that a reviewer must never give awaythe solution. In a certain sense, this applies to any serious work of fiction.If you give the reader an exact summary of the book, you destroy the suspense,particularly if it is a book with a good plot.Always indicate the four main elements of a novel: plot, theme,characterization, and style.46 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-46] Butdo not present them one at a time, like a classroom analysis. Skillfullyintegrate all’ of them. For example, when you present a paragraph aboutinteresting events that start the plot, at the same time indicate what kind ofcharacters enact it. This is not always possible, but it should be your goal.In regard to the second and third points of book reviewing, concerningevaluation, do not read fiction as if it were merely the means to an ideologicalend. It will be a long time before anyone attempts what I did in Atlas Shrugged,where reviewers would be semi-justified in thinking the fiction is merely aspringboard for presenting a philosophy. That is not the way Atlas was written,but it is a very philosophical book. Therefore, if a reviewer decided that thisis primarily a philosophical treatise with the fiction as an excuse, I could notblame him much objectively—though I would hate him personally, because it is nottrue. While most fiction is not as philosophical, any serious work will havesome philosophical meaning.But if you stress that a book is wonderful ideologically, you commit afirst-class offense against the author as a fiction writer. You invert theproper hierarchy of values when you review fiction exclusively or predominantlyfrom the viewpoint of its philosophical value. That it has some valuable ideasmust be treated as pure gravy. So review fiction primarily as literature.The main requirement for a review of fiction pertains to drama and color. If youwant to recommend the book, your review must be dramatic and colorful enough tocommunicate to the reader some of the literary quality of the book, though insmaller scale. This is a matter of careful integration. In this regard,quotations are helpful if they are succinct and representative. They canindicate the drama, color, and style of the author.Do not praise a book if only a few lines are good. At The Objectivist, a readeronce sent me a children’s book, recommending that I review it. She quoted acouple of lines to indicate why she thought it was wonderful. It was a poemabout dinosaurs, and the gist of what she quoted was that dinosaurs perishedbecause they did not use their brains. But the book was dreadful. Itconcentrated mainly on which animals were eating which, and it presented aterrible jungle atmosphere, which is certainly not for six-year-olds (the book’sintended audience). It actually said nothing about the importance of the brain.The mistake this reader made was taking the few lines about the dinosaur’s brainas the meaning of the whole book.Many people are so glad these days to see one sensible touch that, dropping thecontext, they forget the rest and decide a book is good. But you should do theopposite: you must be most severe precisely when you think a book containssomething valuable. It is fine to enjoy good passages apart from the totalcontext. Nevertheless, in judging an entire book, you must remain objective.Similarly, with respect to the indication of flaws, do not exaggerate some touchthat you dislike into the meaning of the whole. Do not condemn a book simplybecause some lines may be wrong.Never overpraise or overcriticize a book. In reviewing both fiction andnonfiction, but especially fiction, you need to preserve a clear view of thetotal in order to pronounce judgment. You need the full context of the book tojudge fairly and objectively its virtues and its flaws (if any), and whether thevirtues are more significant than the flaws. Always ask yourself whether youcovered all the essentials of the book, or merely took an incomplete view andthus misrepresented it. Turning now to writing introductions to books, the main rule is to take the word“introduction” seriously. Not all books need introductions; but if you writeone, you must convey information to the reader which is relevant to a book, butis not part of it. This applies to writing an introduction to somebody else’swork—whether to a classic or the work of an unknown author—or to a work of yourown.When the book is your own, the one fairly absolute rule is that the introductionmust contain material which is not appropriate to the book itself, but which thereader needs to know—for example, acknowledgments.I wrote introductions to all my collections of essays.47[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-47] Since they are collections and notwritten in book form, introductions were necessary. There were two things I hadto provide in these introductions: technical explanations, e.g., where thearticles came from, or (where applicable) who the other contributors are; and anindication of the intellectual content. I made general remarks about the essays,which served as an integration of the total—an indication to the reader of whatthe book is about.Your approach must be somewhat different if you are asked to write anintroduction to somebody else’s book. If it is a living author, you do what youwould for a book of your own, i.e., include some general remarks about thesubject of the book. But here you have more freedom than you would in anintroduction to your own book, because the purpose is to state what the authorcannot appropriately say himself, namely, why the book is important. This is whyan introduction to the work of a living author is written by someone betterknown professionally than the author. It carries the judgment and prestige ofthat person, who tells the reader why he should read this book by an unknownauthor.48 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-48]If you write an introduction to a classic (e.g., my introduction to VictorHugo’s Ninety-Three49 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-49]), here too youmust present a generalized, integrating statement about the nature andimportance of the book. Only your position is reversed: instead of relying onthe prestige of your name, you must be sure not to push yourself forward toomuch. Your job is not to do a favor to the classic—it has already succeeded onits own. It is usually advisable, but not mandatory, to include something aboutthe history of the book which may be of interest to a modem reader. But aboveall, the purpose is to tie the nature and theme of the classic to contemporaryculture—to tell a contemporary reader why the book is important to him.Do not feature yourself when you write an introduction to a classic. This issuenever would have occurred to me if not for the fact that modem introductions dojust that. There are all kinds of miserable little pipsqueaks who writeintroductions to classics in a patronizing manner, without saying anything aboutthe book. The introduction serves only as an opportunity to show off thewriter’s own supposed erudition. A contemptible instance of this is EdwardAlbee’s introduction to three plays by Noel Coward.50[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-50] (Coward was living at the time, butwas already a classic.) Albee patronizingly says, in effect, that although thereis some value in Coward’s plays, he does not know his job as well as Albee does.Now, if Albee wrote for two centuries, he would not be able to come near theworst play of Noel Coward’s. But it is Albee’s approach that I want you tonotice and avoid.Of course, as in the case of book reviews, when you write an introduction, youhave to indicate what aspects of the book you disagree with, if any. Otherwisethere is an implicit sanction, which would be improper with respect to your ownviews. Mention as clearly, briefly, and politely as possible what you disagreewith or consider a flaw, but do not start a polemic with the author, and do nottell him how he should have written his book—particularly if he is not around toanswer you.If you disagree with an author more than you agree, do not write theintroduction. But if the disagreement is minor, or you agree with more aspectsof the book than you disagree, then you mention any disagreements unobtrusively,toward the end. Do not make them the major focus of your introduction.Remember that “the book’s the thing.” An introduction is supposed to be aservice to the reader and to the book. It cannot be an end in itself. So be sureyour views are always relevant to and justified by the content of the book. Ifthey are, it is appropriate to express them; do not be inhibited or humble. Butit is inappropriate to use an introduction as an occasion to air views whichhave nothing to do with the book’s content."},{"pageContent":"10Writing a BookA detailed account of how to write a book would itself take a book. Here, I willdiscuss only how to apply certain principles of article-writing to a book.The basic principles of the two are the same. The only significant difference isscale. A beginning writer may not know how to apply what he has learned aboutwriting an article to a whole book. So he must step back, abstract, and discoverthe equivalents. What in an article is a section or sequence, in a book may be achapter or more; what is a paragraph in an article may be a sequence or even achapter in a book.There are no rules about a book’s length. It can range from a monograph to awork of several volumes. Nor are there rules about how to divide a book intovarious parts, chapters, or sequences. All of this is determined by the natureof the subject. But in general, the purpose of subdividing a book is to aid thereader in absorbing the content, and to achieve clarity of presentation. Theneed for divisions is based on the fact that a mind cannot absorb everything atonce (i.e., the “crow epistemology”). By breaking your material into segments,you direct the order in which the reader’s mind will absorb it.The same subject can be treated in an article, a book, or a set of books. Thedifference will be the level of abstraction, i.e., the degree of specificity.For example, I have often presented Objectivism in five minutes,51[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-51] but that is not the same as thepresentation in Atlas Shrugged. I do not present a different philosophy; if onefollowed all the implications of my brief presentation, one would arrive atAtlas (though it would take years). Any subject can be communicated veryabstractly or in minute detail, and the length of a work depends on the levelone chooses.In an article, it is difficult to communicate ideas very abstractly. The higherthe level of abstraction at which you write, the wider the concepts you dealwith. Therefore, the difficulty in presenting something briefly—which you mustdo in an article—is to state your abstractions in a form clear enough todifferentiate your viewpoint from any other. There is always the risk ofpresenting floating abstractions. (This is one reason I am concerned wheneversomeone, particularly a non-Objectivist, synopsizes Objectivism.) For instance,if you said Objectivism is a philosophy that stands for the good, that would beworse than a floating abstraction—it is floating smoke—because every philosophyclaims this. In a certain sense it is true of Objectivism—only it is sogeneralized that it could apply to anything, and therefore is worthless as anabstraction.In regard to a book, however, the danger is the tendency to expand yourpresentation into an encyclopedia. I said [in chapter 2] that you must delimityour subject when you write an article, despite the temptation to digress. Thatdanger is much greater in a book. Since a book permits more detailed statementsof a subject than does an article, a beginner might get the idea that he has thespace to say anything—which quickly becomes everything. This kind of expansionis particularly problematic when your theme is broad; the broader your theme,the greater the temptation to include increasingly more subdivisions. The factthat a book does permit a certain latitude—the fact that it is like a complexorchestration with a central theme, the development of which permits a greatmany sub-themes—can make your book spread into total shapelessness.Therefore, as important as an outline is for an article, it is a hundred timesmore important for a book. No book—fictionor nonfiction—can be written properlywithout an outline. There are fiction writers who claim to writeinspirationally, without an outline, and it shows in their books, which areplotless and shapeless. But I know of no nonfiction writer who claims he canwrite a book that way. This is an absolute: a nonfiction book cannot be writteninspirationally, because it is supposed to deal with ideas. It does not evenhave the excuse—which is only an excuse—that someone might offer for fiction,namely, that it deals with emotions. A nonfiction book is primarily educational;it conveys information. You cannot throw ideas at the reader and hope he willuntangle them. You must present them so that the progression is logical andclear.When you create an outline for a book, first make a general one indicating whichparts of your argument will go into each chapter, and in what order. Then, asyou come to each chapter, make a more detailed outline, as detailed as you wouldfor an article. If you make the general outline too detailed, you will be unableto hold the total in your mind. But if you do not create the more detailedchapter outlines, you will be unable to determine the specific order of points,or to achieve a clarity of presentation, for each chapter.In writing a book, integration of the total is very important. One young writerI know made the following mistake: he thought that one integrates a givenchapter to the preceding chapter only. Consequently, in spite of a good generaloutline, he found it difficult to decide what to include in his second chapter.He was relating chapter 2 to chapter 1 alone, as if the integration workedbackwards only. He thought that if he kept in mind what he had written inchapter 1, he could determine what would proceed from it in chapter 2 (which ina sense is true). But of course, what should constantly be in a writer’smind—and what should direct him at every stage—is the book as a whole.Every aspect of a work has to be integrated into the total, whether paragraphsinto a chapter or chapters into a book. The book should be one unified wholewhen you finish. So integrate each chapter not only with the preceding one, butalso with the following ones—i.e., with the total of your book, which is not yetwritten. Train your subconscious to do this. It can be difficult, which is onereason the outline is so crucial.Just as a sentence in your mind does not exist until it is on paper, so theunwritten chapters do not exist until they are written. Before then, what existsis only your outline—the abstractions which tell you what you will discuss. Butthe actual words are not yet there. Therefore, until your final chapters aredone, little in your earlier ones has to be considered an absolute. The onlyabsolute while you are writing is your abstract outline. You cannot depart fromit (unless some essential omission or addition occurs to you, in which case youstop and redo your outline). But as you present the concrete material withineach chapter, an incalculable number of options open up to you. For example,regarding some point of second- or third-rank importance, the question oftenarises: where should you discuss it—in chapter 2, say, or in chapter 4? Whilethe overall, logical presentation of your subject is set in advance, you may notbe able to resolve such narrow issues without the full, final context. Theprinciple, therefore, is to view what you have written as open to correctionuntil you finish the book. Your book must not become an absolute in your mind,in regard to its concrete content, until your final editing.Often you find certain sequences so good that you know you will keep them; buteven this is not an absolute. If you are that pleased with a passage, you willprobably turn out to be right. But without becoming a relativist, be a goodcontextualist: do not set any such absolutes until you finish the whole book.This requires a difficult combination of absolutism about your value judgmentsand, at the same time, flexibility about your writing. Your premise should be:“This seems right to me within my present context of knowledge, butthree-quarters of my book, say, does not yet exist, and therefore I allow forthe possibility of making changes.”Of course, the real absolute is the page proofs or galleys. A lot of editingwill be done in galleys; when you see your work in print, it acquires anobjectivity which a typewritten manuscript does not possess. A typewrittenmanuscript is too open to your corrections, and your subconscious knows it. Yourmind remembers how many times you made corrections, and how many possibilitiesthere were. Therefore, everything is still somewhat provisional. But when yousee what you have written in cold print, set by somebody else, it acquires amore objective finality, and some new corrections or improvements might thenstrike you.Regard your book as finished only after you have gone over it as one integratedwhole. Keeping in mind all the complicated threads and issues involved, you canthen see whether your provisional integrations were correct.Someone once said that a writer’s most important tool is scissors, by which hemeant that a writer should never be afraid to cut his own work when necessary. Ihave never sympathized with this attitude, because I hold this premise as suchan absolute that I do not think one should boast about it. Courage is notrequired if your purpose is to write a good article or book, and some beautifulpassage does not fit into the total context. In such a case, there is no choiceinvolved: of course, you make the cut. Acquire that kind of ruthlessness. Makeyour central value the total job, not any particular passage.Here is an example from my own experience. The Fountainhead is a long book witha complex theme. There were numerous sub-themes (which, in a nonfiction book, Icall issues of second- or third-rank importance). I determined in my outlinewhat incidents of the plot would dramatize which steps of the major theme. Buton many lesser issues or subsidiary illustrations, it was difficult to decidethe best place. When I started submitting the book to publishers, I had writtenpart 1 and about a third of part 2. In this material, I had several scenes whichwere well-written, but repetitive. They dramatized the same issue. Nevertheless,I could not yet decide which of them fit better, and in which part of the bookthey belonged. I decided I would keep every uncertain scene until I saw thetotal, at which time I would choose which to save. I knew that the reason Icould not decide at the time was that I needed the total context. When Isubmitted the material to Bobbs-Merrill, I gave Archie Ogden, the editor, anestimated number of words. He pointed out that part 1 then seemed too long. Iexplained to him my method, and said that in the final version a third of part 1would be cut. And that is exactly what happened. I even cut an entire, veryinteresting, character— Vesta Dunning—from part 1. I felt a moment’s sadness anda mild regret, and then felt nothing, because cutting her was necessary: it wasthat character or the total novel.52 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-52]This is what I mean by flexibility. It is not relativism or whim-worship. Thereare passages you cannot integrate into an unwritten whole, and therefore youshould leave them in provisionally.Writers who believe, consciously or subconsciously, in an “ideal,” Platonicarchetype of a book would never use this method, and so would torture themselvesneedlessly. Such writers believe there is an abstract rule somewhere in infinitythat indicates which sequences should remain and which should be cut; but, ofcourse, they fail ever to discover it.A book is a creative product, and the possibilities are incalculable. If at somepoint you do not know what choice to make, it simply means all the evidence isnot in, and so you postpone the decision without any self-doubt. Every piece ofwriting involves new problems. Reason and reality are the only absolutes, andthe theme and the outline are the sub-absolutes. Everything else is up to you.Many issues are optional, and it is no reflection on you if you sometimeshesitate or are uncertain.In fact, hesitation is often a good sign in regard to the development of yoursubconscious writing premises. A child writing a story will not have the choicesyou do as an adult writing a book. He might write inspirationally and produce,for his context, a good piece of work. But he would not yet know that there arequestions over which one can hesitate. So if you hesitate, it may be that yourknowledge is broad and you have grasped numerous possibilities. Finally,remember that if there was no indecisiveness, there would be no pleasure insolving a problem, nor in writing anything. Therefore, take the bitter with thesweet (which is a bromide I would kill you for using in writing).Let us turn to a related point: do not regard your chapters as separatearticles. This can be tricky, because in one sense you do need to regard them asseparate entities. (In this respect, do not take my nonfiction books aspatterns, because most of them are collections of articles. Even so, I did a lotof editing to eliminate repetition and bring the articles into a greater unity.However, we are not discussing anthologies, but nonfiction books written fromscratch.)Your subject and theme are not completely covered in each chapter, only in thewhole book. Therefore, you must regard your chapters as steps in an overallprogression. The end is the total. The comparison to steps is accurate, becauseit is by means of dividing your complex subject and theme and covering them ininstallments that you achieve a progression which is integrated into a totalpresentation. But the chapters must be steps. Each has to be an entity in itsown right—not an independent essay, but a part of your book that has covered acertain distance. At the same time, each chapter must serve as a base for thechapters that follow. It is particularly in your early chapters that you have toplan a great many future ones which will carry you through the total of thebook. In that way, each is a means to the next chapter and to the total.The best illustration of this process (only as a metaphor) is the passage fromAtlas Shrugged in which Dagny has quit the railroad for the first time, and isthinking about the aimlessness of her days. She says that the proper progressionof a man’s life resembles stations on the way to a final terminal. Man must havean overall purpose—a career—which is in turn broken up into particular purposes.A career consists of certain goals, and each one opens the way for widergoals—for wider achievements. If you are a writer, you do not write one book andthen stop; you grow with every book. If you are a properly developing writer,you do not coast on what you have learned, but attempt ever harder subjects.This same principle applies to the book itself. Each chapter is a stationreached—a part of your book which has achieved something. But you do not stop atone chapter. It is not an end in itself, but the means to the final terminal,i.e., the completed book.Do not, however, regard your chapters as one long, uninterrupted lecture; do notbegin each chapter by picking up from the last line of the prior one. A book isnot a continuous speech. So regard each chapter as a little whole, as an end initself—not in content, but in form. The breaking of a book into chapters givesthe reader a chance to absorb distinct subdivisions of your total presentation.You do not merely give him the chance to rest involved in a blank page, and thencontinue. You regard a completed chapter as an. end in itself formally; like thebook as a whole, it has a beginning, a logical development, and a conclusion—andyou start the next chapter, in form, as if it were a new essay. The sameprinciple applies to the structure of a paragraph. You indicate what you arestarting with, you lead the thought to a certain conclusion, and, when thatconclusion is reached, you start a new paragraph. In content, however, rememberthat each chapter and paragraph must be a (completed) part of a whole—a waystation, not a terminal.Here are a few suggestions about some lesser aspects of writing books.Do not constantly repeat yourself for fear that your readers will forgetsomething or go out of focus. For instance, if you depart briefly from your mainsubject and then return to it, do not say, “As I already discussed ...” Trustyour reader to remember and to integrate what you have written. If he does not,reminders will not bring order to his mind. If he is out of focus, your writingwill not put him into focus, no matter how good you are. If you write clearly,on a level of knowledge appropriate to your reader, you must count on his focusand his ability to carry the progression in his mind.There are exceptions to this principle. If you return to a topic only aftermaking some other point at great length, you may need to remind your reader ofthat topic. If it has been, say, a hundred pages since you last made some point,a reminder may be called for (though you should not re-prove the point).Nevertheless, in general, there is nothing wrong with a reader having to lookback; it is not your job to prevent that from happening. In fact, every readerof a nonfiction book will need to do it—with the frequency depending on hislevel of focus and, even more, on his knowledge of the subject. For example, ifyou write a book on philosophy, an intelligent layman may need to check backmore times than a philosophy major. Of course, you must write so that even thelayman will understand it, though he might have to do more thinking, and readmore slowly, than the philosophy major.This point about not repeating yourself is particularly important in bringingout a crucial difference between writing and teaching.The purpose of teaching is not only to communicate knowledge, but also toinstill a rational psycho-epistemology in one’s students. If you analyze what agood teacher is doing, and why his students get so much out of his class, youwill find that he is communicating the material in a certain order, which, byimplication, trains his class to absorb knowledge rationally. In that process,he must adjust his presentation, to some extent, to the level of a particularclass, since some classes are brighter or more attentive than others. Evenwithin a given class, the teacher may repeat certain things to help the sloweror less focused students. So a greater latitude is possible to him. Obviously,the best teacher cannot force a student to understand if the student wants to beout of focus, and just sits there doing nothing; the consciousness of one man isnever responsible for that of another. But to the degree to which one can helpanother, that is what good teachers do.These classroom methods are applicable, to some degree, to writing a textbook,where many subdivisions and repetitions are permissible. But textbooks aside,when you write a nonfiction book, you are not a teacher (except in themetaphorical sense of presenting certain information to your readers). You are abroadcaster, and you aim at the best receiving set for the kind of frequency onwhich you are broadcasting. But the choice of whether to tune in, and of howgood the receiving sets are, is up to the audience. Therefore, you cannotpresent a subject by hammering it, through repetition, into your readers. If ateacher sees the class attention wandering, he should do something to recaptureit. But it is never proper for a writer to adjust his writing in anticipation ofsuch deficiencies on the part of the reader.Another problem that often occurs—particularly on a first book—is the trap ofthe first chapter. When a writer starts a book, the first chapter is more of arevelation to him than to any reader—a revelation not in content, but in regardto the power of writing. When you start a book—and particularly yourfirst—yougrow with every chapter. By the time you finish chapter 1, you havelearned so much that, as a rule, the beginning of your chapter no longersatisfies you. You now know how to improve it—and by the time you finish redoingit, you will have learned still more.If you are a beginner, you often feel as if you are going to spend the rest ofyour life on chapter 1. If whenever you feel you can do better, you thus startrewriting the whole chapter, you would be caught in an infinite regress, becauseyou always learn from the process of writing. If you are not a hack or aone-book author, you improve constantly, to the end of your career. Therefore,you cannot stop each time you write a first chapter—or a tenth, for that matter.Even when you feel as if you can dance with words rather than drag them alongpainfully and ploddingly, you cannot keep rewriting chapter 1. Otherwise, youwill never get to chapter 2.This temptation is understandable; it is quite proper to stop and edit the wholechapter once or twice. But after that, go on unhesitatingly to chapter 2. Acceptthe fact that you are growing and that you must stop each chapter when you feelthat at present, this is the best you can do, i.e., knowing that you will beable to do better, but not now. So do not limit your development to your firstchapter. You must proceed.Let your subconscious take its course. Do not stand in its way by attemptingendless improvements. In the end, you will have plenty of opportunity to adjustthe beginning. There will be a stage by about the middle of the book when,because you are much more in control of the writing, you will feel that yourfirst chapters must be terrible. By the time you finish the book, however, youwill have acquired perspective (particularly if you do not reread itconstantly), and you will discover just how good the first chapters actuallyare. Editorial improvements will always be necessary, because you have learnedso much, but they will be minor.If the first chapters had really been bad, you would have been stopped bylegitimate problems long before you finished."},{"pageContent":"11Selecting a TitleWhen you select a title, ninety percent of your consideration should beappropriateness, five percent clarity (and if it is appropriate it will beclear), and if possible, the other five percent should be drama or intrigue. Asalways, do not aim at drama directly.Selecting a title is difficult because it should grow out of an integration ofall your material and must apply to the work’s essence. It must come more orless inspirationally—through the same process by which you get colorful touchesin writing; it can rarely be arrived at consciously.If you think I am good at titles, I assure you I am not. I find it difficult tocome up with good titles, which is a common complaint of writers. As a rule, butnot as an absolute, I let a title grow out of my material. Sometimes I start anarticle with a provisional working title, and as the material develops, somewritten phrase strikes me and suggests a better title. At other times, as I amwriting and focusing on the subject, something that condenses the essencesuddenly occurs to me (which is not a phrase in the work itself).You may find it useful to hear how I arrived at the titles of The Fountainheadand Atlas Shrugged.First, let me tell you about the mistitling of The Fountainhead. This is not theoriginal title, and I still do not particularly like it. The original title wasSecondhand Lives. Everyone disliked it, including my agent and all thepublishers I heard from. But I wanted that title, because it named a completelynew idea featured in the book, i.e., that many people, such as Peter Keating,live by the opinions of others. Then Archie Ogden, my editor at Bobbs-Merrill,said something that changed my mind instantly: “If you use that title, you arefeaturing Peter Keating.” This horrified me. I had missed that implicationentirely.So now I had to search for a title that would feature Howard Roark. The title Ichose next was The Prime Mover. But my publisher objected that most people,seeing the book in a store window, would think it was about movers. He wasright, though I would have taken the chance, because I do not care whatsuperficial people might think. Still, the expression “prime mover” is not wellknown enough to convey the grandeur it would to someone acquainted withphilosophy. Only a dedicated Aristotelian could appreciate it.I next chose Mainspring, but discovered it had already been used. So I took athesaurus and started looking for words. Finally I found “fountainhead.” What Idislike about it is that the metaphor is a bit too poetic for the nature of thebook. Mainspring would have been better, because it suggests engineering.The most brilliant inspiration for a title of mine is Frank’s suggestion ofAtlas Shrugged, which is almost a mystery to me. I do not know how he made thatintegration, but it is brilliant, because it names in two words the essence ofthe book. When I asked him how he came up with the title, he could not explainit. It was purely inspirational; titles usually occur that way.Atlas Shrugged was not my original title for the book, and it was a big regretin my life that I could not use my original title, which was The Strike. As Iwrote the book, however, I realized “The Strike” gave away too much. But thedrama behind that title was this: I first conceived of the book shortly afterthe publication of The Fountainhead. This was in the heyday of the New Deal,when strikes were fashionable and they were all by the Left. Today, they arepassé—taken for granted. If you see pickets, you take them as part of dailylife. We have a completely mixed economy, so each pressure group uses means ofthat type to gain something. But in those days, it was a collectivist,definitely Leftist phenomenon. At the time, I thought there would be a certaindrama in having a novel with that title by me, who after The Fountainhead waswell known as a “reactionary.” I was being slightly subjective in that I wascounting on the reputation of my previous novel. The change in title is actuallya monument to how long it took me to write the book. If the novel had beenpublished within the first five years, The Strike might have been all right. Butfrom the perspective of the ages, it would have been dated, and it would not bea good title even now. But the main consideration was that The Strike gave awaytoo much.I did not change the title to Atlas Shrugged until about four years after Franksuggested it. I loved The Strike, and have a strong prejudice against titleswith a verb in them—in this case, “shrugged.” A title is like a name, and I havealways felt a title should contain only nouns, and perhaps adjectives, but notverbs. Yet the appropriateness of this title outweighed my particular dislike,because there can be no rule against using verbs. “Atlas Shrugged” was so rightthat when Frank told it to me, I felt that this was destined to be the title. Iweighed the choice carefully, but each time I considered the issue, itsappropriateness and enormous condensation made me conclude that there was nobetter title for the book. It names everything and gives away nothing.I even tried the title on Henry Blanke, the producer of the movie TheFountainhead. This was around 1947. He was an intelligent man, though not aparticularly profound thinker. I told him I was considering a title for my nextnovel. He knew nothing about it except that it would deal with industry. Iasked: “My husband suggested the following title; how would you take it? Whatwould it suggest to you?” Then I said: “Atlas Shrugged.” He looked as if alightbulb had appeared over his head, and he said: “Hmm.” Then he shrugged hisshoulders and said: “Well, there goes the world.” That was an ideal reaction,and it impressed me very much.Let me give you some general advice about selecting a title, if you keep in mindthat there are no absolute rules here.When I say a title should be appropriate, I mean, for instance, that if you arewriting about a serious subject, your title should not be humorous. Even here,it may sometimes be appropriate to use a humorous title in a bitter or faintlysarcastic way. Above all, however, your title should not be misleading.The best example of a misleading title is How to Think Creatively. Thisexcellent book is a serious psychological study of the creative process. Thetitle, however, suggests it is a home course on how to become a genius. The bookactually contains nothing on how to think creatively; it merely describes someimportant aspects of the process of creative thinking. (If you were activementally, you could get from it some valuable leads to help you thinkcreatively, but it is not a technological book; it does not tell you what todo.)A great many interesting nonfiction books could be handicapped by a title thatfalsely suggests something academic, statistical, or technical. On the otherhand, if you write a technical book for specialists, do not call it, forexample, The Coming Spring. So when you do battle with commercial publishers,which is not a happy experience, do not let them put an inappropriate title onyour book.There is a superstition among publishers, which the better ones reject, that atitle helps or hinders a book. It does not. They think including something sexyin the title sells the book, but it does not, particularly not today. Anintriguing title does not necessarily sell a book, nor does a bad titlenecessarily hamper it. A book ultimately succeeds by word of mouth, which isbased on content. In nonfiction books, particularly those that deal with ajournalistic subject which will be dated in five years, the title might beimportant—not so much to sell the book, but to indicate that it deals with acontemporary issue.Of course, do not have so ponderous a title that nobody can retain it. Forexample, do not select the kind of title that John Nelson chose for his article“Some Current Conceptions of Freedom: The ‘Freedom’ of the Hippie and theYippie.”53 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-53] He felt it was in theacademic style, and since there is nothing wrong with it ideologically, aseditor I did not want to force anything optional on him. But it is a regrettabletitle; and in fact, people simply call it “The ‘Freedom’ of the Hippie and theYippie.” He did not have to include ”Some Current Conceptions of Freedom.”Also avoid deliberately bewildering or ungrammatical titles. Years ago somejournal offered a parody on such titles which captured their essence very well.It was: Gently the Swallow. That names the whole modem style. It is a noun andan adverb, and irresistibly you want to ask: “gently what?” The issue here isfidelity to grammar. It is not intriguing or interesting to be deliberatelyungrammatical. Titles of that kind merely indicate that the author is muddyinghis waters.When choosing a title, do not be so detailed and academic that you call yourarticle .“A Few Observations on the Subject of Epistemology, with Limitations...” etc. On the other hand, do not be confusing. For instance, if you arewriting on a current bill in Congress, do not call it “Of Higher Metaphysics” or“The Higher Reaches of Man.”Generally, in selecting a title, choose one that feels right to you. This is asense of life issue. If a title feels right, it will be consistent with yourstyle. Sometimes someone else, e.g., an editor, suggests a title which grates onyou, even though it is good. If you get that feeling, the title will surelyclash with the overall style of your book, because the psycho-epistemologicalelements at work here are the same as those at work in your style. They dependon your subconscious, automatic values and integrations.Let us look at some examples. There is a good book that has two differenttitles, East Minus West Equals Zero in the American edition, and Are theRussians Ten Feet Tall? in the British.54[rand_9781101137291_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-54] The former is an excellent title.First, it names the essential subject and theme of the book. It indicates notonly what the author discusses—Western aid to the communist East—but also hisviewpoint. The form is intriguing: it is original to use a mathematicalequation, but not so bewildering that no one understands it. (One minor flaw isthat it could be taken as saying East = West, but most people are not somathematically minded as to immediately translate the formula into figures. Theygrasp that it is a metaphor.)But Are the Russians Ten Feet Tall? is a bad title. It is cheap slang, andinappropriately humorous. This expression is usually used in such a form as:“What do you think you are, ten feet tall?” and is meant to deflate somebody’spretentiousness. But this is a small issue pertaining to human vanity, and thusis not appropriate for so horrible and tragic a subject as Western aid to SovietRussia, which is certainly not a light or funny subject. (There is a touch ofhumor in the first title, but it is profoundly sarcastic.)Now what if the author had titled the book Western Aid to Soviet EconomicDevelopment? That names the subject, but it does not indicate the theme. Basedon the title, the book could be anti-communist, neutral, or even pro-communist(arguing that Western countries do not give enough aid to Russia). In fact, thetitle strongly suggests a boring, statistical account, with no evaluation oneway or the other. While a title cannot ultimately damage a book’s sales, aneutral title of this kind would be inadvisable.As practical advice, when you are stuck, try out a title on some intelligentfriends who do not know your subject. Ask them what kind of interpretation yourtitle suggests, particularly if it is intriguing and must be interpreted. Thismight bring out connotations which have never occurred to you. You might findthat although they do not understand your title, the interpretations they giveyou are interesting and not the opposite of your intention. That could be areason for keeping it.In conclusion, short of avoiding deliberate obscurity, there really are no rulesfor selecting a title. There can be as many titles as first names. If you askedme to invent an original name for a baby, I could come up with many combinationsof sounds, some attractive, and some awkward and ugly. But there are no rulesabout how to invent a name, except to make it pronounceable (unlike someOriental and Balkan names that contain only consonants). A similar standardapplies to titles. Make your title grammatical and appropriate to your subject,but not confusing. For the rest, there are no general rules."},{"pageContent":"12Acquiring Ideas for WritingThere remains one point to discuss: how to condition yourself to get good ideasfor writing in the middle range. It should be clear why I waited until the endto discuss this topic. Implied in much of what I have said so far are the mainpremises required to get ideas for articles and books.Let me begin with what to avoid.There is one great enemy of mental activity: repression. Repression, and anypremise of unearned self-doubt, blocks many minds. Self-doubt may be appropriatein your psychological thinking or in your sessions with a psychologist, but notin action, particularly not when you are trying to stimulate your mind forwriting. In regard to getting ideas, you must do what I recommended [in chapter6] for actual writing, namely, trust your subconscious. Let your mind be free towander around a subject and to judge it. Do not set artificial constraints—suchas telling yourself that this morning you will produce ideas for ten articles.Instead, assume that you are able and willing to judge reality—to judge events,people, trends, and news stories—and that although you may have difficultieslater in writing a given article, at the beginning you are problem-free. If youdo not censor your mind with regard to getting ideas, you can acquire a fertile,creative imagination.Not every idea you get will be right. Some might even be preposterous. But thatis what your critical judgment is for. Just as you can edit your writing, so youcan later decide that an idea for an article is not interesting, or too narrow,or too broad, etc. But do not then become self-critical and conclude that yoursubconscious is bad and does not give you good ideas. Permit yourself to rangefreely over what you observe and to form ideas. You will discard some of them,but you will find others worth pursuing.On the positive side, the main point is that to write an interesting article,you must have a theme—i.e., you must have something to say. But there is no wayto find something interesting to say unless it comes from a wider premise, widerthan the subject you want to discuss. The principle is that you must have somepremise of more abstract interest than the particular news item or event you arewriting about. And that kind of premise comes from your philosophicalconvictions.Since every adult has some philosophy—some conscious convictions on itsissues—the question is how to use your philosophy to get ideas for writing. (Ofcourse, if your philosophy is Objectivism, it will help you much more, since itis consistent and can be applied to any aspect of the culture.) You must have anactive interest in some aspect of philosophy (not philosophy in the academicsense, but philosophy as it applies to life). Merely to say “I would like towrite an article from the Objectivist viewpoint” is to say nothing. It does notyet contain any specific lead or incentive to get you started on writing.You get ideas according to the standing orders you have established in yourmind. For instance, since I am interested in the application of Objectivism tolife, and since every aspect of philosophy—from esthetics to epistemology andmetaphysics—interests me, almost anything I hear or read is of great interest tome. I do not want merely to discover the right ethics and stop there. If I did,I would not get many ideas for writing. The application of my philosophy to lifeis a constant standing order to myself, which leads me to observe how variousideas, good and bad, work on the culture. Thus, almost anything I read ismaterial for my writing.You need to be an intellectual detective. You must look at a certain statementyou encounter and work forward and backward: ask yourself what are theimplications of that statement and, more important, what are the premises behindit? I love doing that, and I would love to train you to do it. It would save mefrom feeling, every time I read something terrible, that I should write anarticle exposing it—which I cannot do, because there are just too many suchoccasions.You need not be a professional philosopher. If you want to get good ideas forarticles on topics that interest you, and at the same time enlarge yourperspective on your own profession, be on the lookout for ideas that pertain toyour profession. If you want to be, not a narrow professional, but one with awider philosophical foundation, consider the interests of your own professionfrom a broader viewpoint. Your best lead will be any issue that pleases ordispleases you.For instance, take the physical sciences. How can a scientist tie his professionto philosophy? If he wants to write about abortion, for example, he may startfrom a scientific or medical viewpoint (e.g., by focusing on a test forabnormalities in fetuses) and then branch out into the wider, philosophicalissues. With the advance of the physical sciences and the retrogression of thehumanities, we are in a dreadful state. A scientist will feel nothing butdisgust for the philosophical ideas of his colleagues and the general state ofthe culture. He should ask himself what makes him disgusted and indignant andwhy. If he observes a trend he thinks threatens his profession, he should askhimself why he thinks so, and what are its consequences. He would thereby getseveral ideas for articles every time he reads a newspaper.This is even truer in the humanities. A rational person in the humanities neednot go outside his own profession to feel frustrated indignation. This is a goldmine for articles if, instead of merely suffering or repressing what you feel,you identify your reaction conceptually. If you are disgusted with yourprofession, do not simply note that it is in a terrible state. Ask: “What isirrational about my colleagues? What about their ideas makes me indignant?” Youwill find more to write about (unfortunately) than you will ever be able to use.(“Unfortunately,” because the culture is so rich in negatives.) I am notadvocating a “John Birch Society” approach, where you start by defining what youare against. But if you want to write in the middle range, you willunfortunately find it easier to start with negative articles. Since such is thestate of the culture, that is what a person must do if he wants to lead aphilosophical life and apply his philosophy to what he sees around him.Of course, if you find something good in the culture, and above all in yourprofession, that should be acknowledged. That will make for a much better theme,because there are so few occasions for it today. Whether it is someone’s newidea or a resolution passed or a policy adopted, if you approve of it, theninstead of merely sensing that it is on the right track, identify why you findit good and what implications it has for your profession and for society. Rightthere, you will get more ideas for articles than you can handle at any one time(not because there are so many good occasions, but because there is so much thatcan be identified on such issues).I am not saying everyone must use his profession as a springboard. But if youwant to write and do not know where to begin, the most fertile field is yourprofession. That is your central concern, and any issue corollary to it willinterest you much more than if you arbitrarily decide to write about, say,deep-sea diving, which does not interest you. But obviously you have more thanprofessional interests, so if some other issue attracts you—because it isimportant, and you can demonstrate why—thattoo is a good source of ideas.Incidentally, the desire for an ever-deeper understanding of your profession isa standing order you must carry throughout life anyway. At no point should yousay, “I understand my profession, I am successful, so I no longer have to thinkabout it.” That attitude would be your downfall. We cannot stand still in life.We either move forward or we deteriorate. Therefore, always seek to enlarge yourunderstanding. If you want to be creative in your profession, and not merely ahack—if you want to be young regardless of your age, so that you will be a real“personality,” and not merely a mildly competent practitioner—then you need thesame premise that is necessary to get ideas for writing.Never think you know enough. I do not mean that you must doubt the knowledge youhave, but that you need to enlarge it. Nobody is in the position today—and I donot know in what society one would be—of being completely satisfied witheverything he can do in his profession, and with the performance of everybodyaround him. And that does not even take into account one’s personal life. Thereare always personal matters that need attention, correction, and progress; andeven if everything is ideal in your life, the more you know, the more avenuesare open to you to go on to more complex, abstract knowledge. I am not advisingan eternal treadmill, where you are never allowed to tell yourself that you knowenough. Rather, you should be on the premise that you do know enough and thatwhat you know is valid, but that you want to go further. Not only will thisactive standing order enlarge your professional abilities and interests, it willalso give you all the ideas for writing that you can possibly use.As an example, take the profession of teaching. If you are a competent teacher,you can tell how successfully your students learn. Some learn well, some arebright but slow, and some seem hopeless. Where would that knowledge lead you? Ifyou want to be a good teacher, you would ask yourself: What do I know aboutyoung people’s methods of learning? How do I explain the fact that some are fastand others are not? What incentive do the good students have? Have I providedsuch incentives, or do they bring it to class themselves? Why are the others sobad? Can I stimulate them? Up to what point is it my responsibility? At whatpoint is it theirs? Also, I see in my colleagues’ classes that some teachers aregood and others are not. Why do I think so? What mistakes do the bad teachersmake? What good premises do the others have?You could not fully answer all of these questions in a lifetime, yet they areall important. Like all teachers, you know that you do answer these questions,though not explicitly. You make certain observations and decisions, and after awhile you discover, for instance, that you can tell by his first words what astudent will do or say. But if you were asked how you learned it, you would notknow. You would say you can simply tell, which means you have acquired manyvaluable automatized premises, but never paused on the wider meaning of what youwere discovering and applying. That is, you are conscious of the fact that youare improving, but not self-conscious—i.e., you do not monitor yourself.Make yourself self-conscious in regard to your own progress. You will besurprised how much you will discover and how much you will stimulate your mind.For example, if you do not properly monitor some observations you make aboutcertain students, you may decide, “When I see students yawning, I must be boringthem, so I should cut this subject short.” That does not lead you far, thoughperhaps next time you will know, by “instinct,” how to present the subject moreclearly or in a more interesting way. Unfortunately, for most people this is theextent of their development.The better approach would be to identify the problem and then ask the widerquestions: “If I made a mistake and went on too long, why? I thought my classwas slow, you might answer, and I did not know what was enough for them, so Ioverexplained. How can I devise a method of better judging their level ofintelligence? Also, I notice that sometimes they are interested and sometimesthey are not. Are they on the right premise? What is their motivation? Can Idiscover, from what interests them, something about the basic philosophy of themajority of my students?”Every one of these questions requires thinking, though probably not verydifficult thinking, because as a teacher you have more observations than youhave consciously identified. If you constantly ask yourself wider questions—ifinstead of asking, “How do I get through my next lesson?” you ask, “What is theprinciple by which I intend to get through my next lesson?”—you are puttingyourself on a philosophical premise; you are deriving wider principles fromconcrete events. In this way, you will get ideas from every minor incident inclass. Some dunce asking stupid questions might be the cause of an importantpedagogical discovery. You might discover the wider principle of why hefunctions as he does: perhaps he was showing off or is a neurotic or is simplystupid and does not belong in your class. Whatever it is, you are learningsomething from the least inspiring incident. Similarly, if something goodhappens in class, do not think: “For once I got a marvelous student, but too badit is only for this semester.” Instead try to identify why you like thestudent’s intellectual performance, whether there is some way to communicate itto other students, etc. Not only will you function better, but each question isitself enough for an interesting article.This is how one applies wider abstractions to one’s own life and, therefore, tomiddle-range articles and books. This, in essence, is how you should conditionyour mind to be active and to get ideas automatically. Like everything else inthe mind that seems automatic, this process must be started consciously. Onceyou condition your subconscious properly, it throws you ideas unexpectedly. Itmay feel as if the ideas come to you spontaneously, but to mention once againthat good line from How to Think Creatively: accidents happen only to those whodeserve them. So give yourself this standing order: “I am interested in certainsubjects, and I am on the lookout for any relevant event, trend, statement, ortheory—which I then want to understand and evaluate.” Do this, and you willcondition your mind in a truly productive way. Let me conclude this course by telling you about an incident which made a bigimpression on me. It is particularly relevant to the difference between anactive psycho-epistemology and a conforming one. It pertains to the whole issueof how one learns something new.When I began my first job as a screenwriter, I had some idea of how to write ascript. But I did not know the technical terminology. When I arrived at WarnerBrothers to work on the movie of The Fountainhead, I asked for a sample script,and was given one. I was also given a secretary to provide me with any help Ineeded. I never had to ask her a question. I simply looked at the sample andfigured out what was meant by “close-up,” “dissolve,” “fade-out,” etc. Forexample, I observed that “fade-out” referred to the end of a sequence.Now, fade-out to a few years later. I am working for Hal Wallis at Paramount.Wallis had bought an original story, which was intelligent and had gooddialogue. But, he told me, he was disappointed in the screenwriter (who had alsowritten the story) because although the story was good, the screenplay was amess. He asked me to take a look at it.I did, and could not understand the screenplay. It had a close-up where theaction did not necessitate one; there was a long shot when only one person wasin the room; and so on. None of the technical directions matched the action ofthe story. I asked the screenwriter how he decided where to use a particulardirection. He said he had asked for a sample script to see how it was done—andthen he followed it exactly. If the sample opened with a close-up, he openedwith a close-up. If two pages later there was a long shot, he marked a long shottwo pages later, etc. Ultimately, I had to make a great many changes and rewritesome sequences, and so I received part credit.This incident impressed me, because on my first job, I too had asked for asample script. But I looked for the abstract format and knew that I had to fitthat abstraction to my own story. He took the format of his sample literally. Hewas a conformist. He never asked himself why there were certain technicalindications at specific points. He never observed that the close-ups,long-shots, and dissolves followed a certain pattern. He was a ritualist, andfollowed the sample dogmatically, on blind faith.I do not think this person ever wrote anything else, although he had made apromising start.Do not think that this writer was the first person to make this mistake. It wasthe same one that the Classicists made in literature. They thought that the wayto make a good play was to look at Greek tragedies, for example, then reducethem to a set of rules: a good play had to have so many acts, so manycharacters, etc. The essential error here is concrete-bound conformity, based onthe premise that someone else understands why a script or play is written acertain way, and therefore the writer does not have to understand. It is thereliance on other people that is responsible for this error.The psycho-epistemological point to remember is that you must think on your own.In some situations, you may find no particular guidance, philosophical orotherwise, and yet you need to learn something new. To be innovative when youare up against a new problem, you have to approach it abstractly. That is why Istress principles. Never assume that any leads you have from others must befollowed to the letter. Never assume that the concretes are absolutes for yourinstruction. Concretes are merely concretes.Of course, as I said [in chapter 4], all reality is concrete. There are no suchthings as abstractions. But abstraction is the human method of classifying,integrating, and identifying concretes. Therefore, whenever you start on aproblem, ask yourself whether you are being concrete-bound. Take a step backintellectually. Take a look at what abstraction is applicable. If you examine agiven concrete—whether a script, an event, a situation, a news story, or aperson—always draw the wider abstraction from the concretes of the case. That isthe only way to learn, and the only way to be independent.My story serves as a good concrete example of a proper abstraction. Use all thatyou have learned in this course, not as rigid rules, but as abstract principlesto be applied by your independent thinking to your particular problems.Follow my method, not the conformist writer’s—and best premises to you in yourfuture careers as writers."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIXSelected Outlines Used by Ayn Rand in Writing ArticlesEditor’s Note: During the course, Ayn Rand asked the class to outline several ofher articles, with the aim of improving their skill in creating outlines.

Ayn Rand writes:“Since consciousness is a specific faculty, it has a specific nature or identityand, therefore, its range is limited: it cannot perceive everything at once;since awareness, on all its levels, requires an active process, it cannot doeverything at once. Whether the units with which one deals are percepts orconcepts, the range of what man can hold in the focus of his conscious awarenessat any given moment, is limited” (p. 63).21 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_c06_r1.html#Ref-FTN-21]New York: Abingdon-Cokesbury Press, 1959.22 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_c06_r1.html#Ref-FTN-22]The Ominous Parallels: The End of Freedom in America (New York: New AmericanLibrary, 1982).23 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_c06_r1.html#Ref-FTN-23]Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.24 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_c07_r1.html#Ref-FTN-24]See The Ayn Rand Column, edited by Peter Schwartz (Gaylordsville, CT: SecondRenaissance Books, 1991; expanded ed., 1998).25 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_c07_r1.html#Ref-FTN-25]The Romantic Manifesto.26 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_c07_r1.html#Ref-FTN-26]See chapter 3 (“Abstraction from Abstractions”) of Introduction to ObjectivistEpistemology.27 [rand_9781101137291_oeb_c07_r1.html#Ref-FTN-27]In her course, Ayn Rand does not recommend any specific primers on grammar.
