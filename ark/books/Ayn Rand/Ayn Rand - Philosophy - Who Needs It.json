Whoelse could write a book called Philosophy: Who Needs It—and have an answer tooffer?Ayn Rand’s power to sell philosophy is a consequence of her particularphilosophy, Objectivism.“. . . I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism,” she wrote adecade ago; “and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If onerecognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the restfollows. This—the supremacy of reason—was, is and will be the primary concern ofmy work, and the essence of Objectivism.” (The Objectivist, September 1971.)Reason, according to Objectivism, is not merely a distinguishing attribute ofman; it is his fundamental attribute—his basic means of survival. Therefore,whatever reason requires in order to function is a necessity of human life.Reason functions by integrating perceptual data into concepts. This process, AynRand holds, ultimately requires the widest integrations—those which give manknowledge of the universe in which he acts, of his means of knowledge, and ofhis proper values.Man, therefore, needs metaphysics, epistemology and ethics; i.e., he needsphilosophy. He needs it by his essential nature and for a practical purpose: inorder to be able to think, to act, to live.In today’s world, this view of the role of philosophy is unique—just as, intoday’s neo-mystic culture, Objectivism’s advocacy of reason is all but unique.To Ayn Rand, philosophy is not a senseless parade of abstractions created tofill out the ritual at cocktail parties or in Sunday morning services. It is nota ponderous Continental wail of futility resonating with Oriental overtones. Itis not a chess game divorced from reality designed by British professors forotherwise unemployable colleagues. To Ayn Rand, philosophy is the fundamentalfactor in human life; it is the basic force that shapes the mind and characterof men and the destiny of nations. It shapes them for good or for evil,depending on the kind of philosophy men accept.A man’s choice, according to Ayn Rand, is not whether to have a philosophy, butonly which philosophy to have. His choice is whether his philosophy will beconscious, explicit, logical, and therefore practical—or random, unidentified,contradictory, and therefore lethal.In these essays, Ayn Rand explains some of the steps necessary to achieve aconscious, rational philosophy. She teaches the reader how to identify, and thenevaluate, the hidden premises at work in his own soul or nation. She makes clearthe mechanism by which philosophy rules men and societies, the forms thatabstract theory takes in daily life, and the profound existential consequencesthat flow from even the most abstruse ideas, ideas which may seem at firstglance to be of merely academic concern. She shows that, when an idea isrational, its consequence, ultimately, is the preservation of man’s life; andthat when an idea is irrational, its consequence is the opposite.Contrary to the injunctions issued to men for millennia, Ayn Rand did not equateobjectivity with “disinterest”; she was interested in philosophy, in theObjectivist sense of “self-interest”; she wanted—selfishly, for the sake of herown actions and life—to know which ideas are right. If man needs philosophy, sheheld, he needs one that is true, i.e., in accordance with reality.Philosophy: Who Needs It is the last work planned by Ayn Rand before her deathin March of this year.The book was first suggested by a Canadian Objectivist, Walter Huebscher. In thefall of 1981, he wrote to Miss Rand: “In [your articles], you detaildramatically how everyone, through each statement he makes, uses philosophicalpremises. . . . If [such] articles were published in a single volume, I believethat it would focus direct attention on philosophy’s powerful influence,identify the philosophical roots of some of today’s most dangerous trends, [and]indicate that it is possible to reverse a cultural trend, that everyone can andshould get involved in doing just that.”Miss Rand was pleased with Mr. Huebscher’s idea of a collection taken largelyfrom her newsletter, The Ayn Rand Letter, and featuring as its title piece oneof her favorites among her own articles, “Philosophy: Who Needs It”—originally aspeech given at the United States Military Academy at West Point. In subsequentmonths—with her publisher at Bobbs-Merrill, Grace Shaw, and with friends andassociates—she several times discussed her concept of the book. She indicatedits content and structure in general terms. She mentioned articles whoseinclusion would be mandatory, and others that she regarded as optional. She didnot live long enough, however, to determine the final selection of pieces ortheir sequence. It has fallen to me to make these decisions, guided, whereverpossible, by Miss Rand’s stated wishes.Following her policy in other anthologies, I have placed the more theoreticalarticles in the first part of the book, and followed them by more concreteapplications and/or essentially critical articles. None of the pieces has beenpublished before in book form.The title article is followed by one written originally as its companion piece.Next comes a group dealing with the Objectivist philosophy. The first of these(Chapter 3), her analysis of what is or is not open to change, represents AynRand’s fullest discussion in print of one element of the Objectivistmetaphysics—the primacy of existence. The following discussions of theanti-conceptual mentality (Chapters 4 and 5) are a demonstration, in reverse, ofone element of the Objectivist epistemology: they show what happens to men whonever fully develop the human form of knowledge—concepts. The open letter toBoris Spassky (Chapter 6), the Soviet chessmaster, is a tour de forcesummarizing, in the form of a single startling example, the role in man’s lifeof every branch of philosophy.With one exception, all the articles in this book were written between 1970 and1975. The exception is “Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World”(Chapter 7), a speech given initially at Yale University in 1960, a few yearsafter the publication of Atlas Shrugged. This speech is an excellent, simpleintroduction to Objectivism and to Ayn Rand’s view of today’s world. Until now,it has not been easily available. Those unfamiliar with Miss Rand’s work mightbe well advised to begin their reading with this chapter.There follows an essentially critical section (Chapters 8-13) dealing with Kant,and with some of his heirs, such as the egalitarian movement and B. F. Skinner.Miss Rand was frequently asked why there are so few advocates of good ideas inpositions of power today. To indicate her answer, at least in part, I haveincluded two political pieces (Chapters 14 and 15); they discuss some currentmethods used by the government to corrupt our cultural life. These are followedby two pieces (Chapters 16 and 17) relating to another question Ayn Rand wasrepeatedly asked: What can anyone do about the state of today’s world?I have ended the book as, I think, Miss Rand would have ended it. “Don’t Let ItGo” presents the American sense of life as the basis of hope for this country’sfuture.When articles written years apart are published in book form, editorial changesare occasionally necessary. I have enclosed such changes in square brackets. Ina few cases, where Miss Rand uses a term that would be unfamiliar to newreaders, I have offered a brief definition, also in square brackets. Otherwise,aside from minor copy-editing, the text is exactly as worded (and in some caseslater reworded) by Ayn Rand herself. (Please note that square brackets within aquotation are in every case Miss Rand’s, and represent her own additions to orcomments on the quotation.)Since Miss Rand’s death, her associates in New York have received a great dealof mail inquiring how one can learn more about her ideas; how one can obtainback issues of her magazines; what current publications, schools, courses nowcarry on her philosophy; what work is done by the Foundation for the NewIntellectual; etc. If you are interested in any of the above, I suggest that youwrite to: Objectivism PW, P.O. Box 51808, Irvine, California 92619-9930. Iregret that, owing to the volume of mail, you will probably not receive apersonal reply; but in due course you will receive literature from severalsources indicating the direction to pursue if you wish to investigate Ayn Rand’sideas further, or to support them.Meanwhile, if you are about to read these essays for the first time, I envy you,because of what you still have in store for you. Ayn Rand has changed manypeople’s minds and lives. Perhaps she will change yours, too. LEONARD PEIKOFFNew York CityMay 1982"},{"pageContent":"1Philosophy: Who Needs It1974(An address given to the graduating class of the United States Military Academyat West Point on March 6, 1974.)Since I am a fiction writer, let us start with a short short story. Suppose thatyou are an astronaut whose spaceship gets out of control and crashes on anunknown planet. When you regain consciousness and find that you are not hurtbadly, the first three questions in your mind would be: Where am I? How can Idiscover it? What should I do?You see unfamiliar vegetation outside, and there is air to breathe; the sunlightseems paler than you remember it and colder. You turn to look at the sky, butstop. You are struck by a sudden feeling: if you don’t look, you won’t have toknow that you are, perhaps, too far from the earth and no return is possible; solong as you don’t know it, you are free to believe what you wish—and youexperience a foggy, pleasant, but somehow guilty, kind of hope.You turn to your instruments: they may be damaged, you don’t know how seriously.But you stop, struck by a sudden fear: how can you trust these instruments? Howcan you be sure that they won’t mislead you? How can you know whether they willwork in a different world? You turn away from the instruments.Now you begin to wonder why you have no desire to do anything. It seems so muchsafer just to wait for something to turn up somehow; it is better, you tellyourself, not to rock the spaceship. Far in the distance, you see some sort ofliving creatures approaching; you don’t know whether they are human, but theywalk on two feet. They, you decide, will tell you what to do.You are never heard from again.This is fantasy, you say? You would not act like that and no astronaut everwould? Perhaps not. But this is the way most men live their lives, here, onearth.Most men spend their days struggling to evade three questions, the answers towhich underlie man’s every thought, feeling and action, whether he isconsciously aware of it or not: Where am I? How do I know it? What should I do?By the time they are old enough to understand these questions, men believe thatthey know the answers. Where am I? Say, in New York City. How do I know it? It’sself-evident. What should I do? Here, they are not too sure—but the usual answeris: whatever everybody does. The only trouble seems to be that they are not veryactive, not very confident, not very happy—and they experience, at times, acauseless fear and an undefined guilt, which they cannot explain or get rid of.They have never discovered the fact that the trouble comes from the threeunanswered questions—and that there is only one science that can answer them:philosophy.Philosophy studies the fundamental nature of existence, of man, and of man’srelationship to existence. As against the special sciences, which deal only withparticular aspects, philosophy deals with those aspects of the universe whichpertain to everything that exists. In the realm of cognition, the specialsciences are the trees, but philosophy is the soil which makes the forestpossible.Philosophy would not tell you, for instance, whether you are in New York City orin Zanzibar (though it would give you the means to find out). But here is whatit would tell you: Are you in a universe which is ruled by natural laws and,therefore, is stable, firm, absolute—and knowable? Or are you in anincomprehensible chaos, a realm of inexplicable miracles, an unpredictable,unknowable flux, which your mind is impotent to grasp? Are the things you seearound you real—or are they only an illusion? Do they exist independent of anyobserver—or are they created by the observer? Are they the object or the subjectof man’s consciousness? Are they what they are—or can they be changed by a mereact of your consciousness, such as a wish?The nature of your actions—and of your ambition—will be different, according towhich set of answers you come to accept. These answers are the province ofmetaphysics—the study of existence as such or, in Aristotle’s words, of “beingqua being”—the basic branch of philosophy.No matter what conclusions you reach, you will be confronted by the necessity toanswer another, corollary question: How do I know it? Since man is notomniscient or infallible, you have to discover what you can claim as knowledgeand how to prove the validity of your conclusions. Does man acquire knowledge bya process of reason—or by sudden revelation from a supernatural power? Is reasona faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man’ssenses—or is it fed by innate ideas, implanted in man’s mind before he was born?Is reason competent to perceive reality—or does man possess some other cognitivefaculty which is superior to reason? Can man achieve certainty—or is he doomedto perpetual doubt?The extent of your self-confidence—and of your success—will be different,according to which set of answers you accept. These answers are the province ofepistemology, the theory of knowledge, which studies man’s means of cognition.These two branches are the theoretical foundation of philosophy. The thirdbranch—ethics—may be regarded as its technology. Ethics does not apply toeverything that exists, only to man, but it applies to every aspect of man’slife: his character, his actions, his values, his relationship to all ofexistence. Ethics, or morality, defines a code of values to guide man’s choicesand actions—the choices and actions that determine the course of his life.Just as the astronaut in my story did not know what he should do, because herefused to know where he was and how to discover it, so you cannot know what youshould do until you know the nature of the universe you deal with, the nature ofyour means of cognition—and your own nature. Before you come to ethics, you mustanswer the questions posed by metaphysics and epistemology: Is man a rationalbeing, able to deal with reality—or is he a helplessly blind misfit, a chipbuffeted by the universal flux? Are achievement and enjoyment possible to man onearth—or is he doomed to failure and disaster? Depending on the answers, you canproceed to consider the questions posed by ethics: What is good or evil forman—and why? Should man’s primary concern be a quest for joy—or an escape fromsuffering? Should man hold self-fulfillment—or self-destruction—as the goal ofhis life? Should man pursue his values—or should he place the interests ofothers above his own? Should man seek happiness—or self-sacrifice?I do not have to point out the different consequences of these two sets ofanswers. You can see them everywhere—within you and around you.The answers given by ethics determine how man should treat other men, and thisdetermines the fourth branch of philosophy: politics, which defines theprinciples of a proper social system. As an example of philosophy’s function,political philosophy will not tell you how much rationed gas you should be givenand on which day of the week—it will tell you whether the government has theright to impose any rationing on anything.The fifth and last branch of philosophy is esthetics, the study of art, which isbased on metaphysics, epistemology and ethics. Art deals with the needs—therefueling—of man’s consciousness.Now some of you might say, as many people do: “Aw, I never think in suchabstract terms—I want to deal with concrete, particular, real-life problems—whatdo I need philosophy for?” My answer is: In order to be able to deal withconcrete, particular, real-life problems—i.e., in order to be able to live onearth.You might claim—as most people do—that you have never been influenced byphilosophy. I will ask you to check that claim. Have you ever thought or saidthe following? “Don’t be so sure—nobody can be certain of anything.” You gotthat notion from David Hume (and many, many others), even though you might neverhave heard of him. Or: “This may be good in theory, but it doesn’t work inpractice.” You got that from Plato. Or: “That was a rotten thing to do, but it’sonly human, nobody is perfect in this world.” You got it from Augustine. Or: “Itmay be true for you, but it’s not true for me.” You got it from William James.Or: “I couldn’t help it! Nobody can help anything he does.” You got it fromHegel. Or: “I can’t prove it, but I feel that it’s true.” You got it from Kant.Or: “It’s logical, but logic has nothing to do with reality.” You got it fromKant. Or: “It’s evil, because it’s selfish.” You got it from Kant. Have youheard the modern activists say: “Act first, think afterward”? They got it fromJohn Dewey.Some people might answer: “Sure, I’ve said those things at different times, butI don’t have to believe that stuff all of the time. It may have been trueyesterday, but it’s not true today.” They got it from Hegel. They might say:“Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.” They got it from a very littlemind, Emerson. They might say: “But can’t one compromise and borrow differentideas from different philosophies according to the expediency of the moment?”They got it from Richard Nixon—who got it from William James.Now ask yourself: if you are not interested in abstract ideas, why do you (andall men) feel compelled to use them? The fact is that abstract ideas areconceptual integrations which subsume an incalculable number of concretes—andthat without abstract ideas you would not be able to deal with concrete,particular, real-life problems. You would be in the position of a newborninfant, to whom every object is a unique, unprecedented phenomenon. Thedifference between his mental state and yours lies in the number of conceptualintegrations your mind has performed.You have no choice about the necessity to integrate your observations, yourexperiences, your knowledge into abstract ideas, i.e., into principles. Youronly choice is whether these principles are true or false, whether theyrepresent your conscious, rational convictions—or a grab-bag of notions snatchedat random, whose sources, validity, context and consequences you do not know,notions which, more often than not, you would drop like a hot potato if youknew.But the principles you accept (consciously or subconsciously) may clash with orcontradict one another; they, too, have to be integrated. What integrates them?Philosophy. A philosophic system is an integrated view of existence. As a humanbeing, you have no choice about the fact that you need a philosophy. Your onlychoice is whether you define your philosophy by a conscious, rational,disciplined process of thought and scrupulously logical deliberation—or let yoursubconscious accumulate a junk heap of unwarranted conclusions, falsegeneralizations, undefined contradictions, undigested slogans, unidentifiedwishes, doubts and fears, thrown together by chance, but integrated by yoursubconscious into a kind of mongrel philosophy and fused into a single, solidweight: self-doubt, like a ball and chain in the place where your mind’s wingsshould have grown.You might say, as many people do, that it is not easy always to act on abstractprinciples. No, it is not easy. But how much harder is it, to have to act onthem without knowing what they are?Your subconscious is like a computer—more complex a computer than men canbuild—and its main function is the integration of your ideas. Who programs it?Your conscious mind. If you default, if you don’t reach any firm convictions,your subconscious is programmed by chance—and you deliver yourself into thepower of ideas you do not know you have accepted. But one way or the other, yourcomputer gives you print-outs, daily and hourly, in the form of emotions—whichare lightning-like estimates of the things around you, calculated according toyour values. If you programmed your computer by conscious thinking, you know thenature of your values and emotions. If you didn’t, you don’t.Many people, particularly today, claim that man cannot live by logic alone, thatthere’s the emotional element of his nature to consider, and that they rely onthe guidance of their emotions. Well, so did the astronaut in my story. The jokeis on him—and on them: man’s values and emotions are determined by hisfundamental view of life. The ultimate programmer of his subconscious isphilosophy—the science which, according to the emotionalists, is impotent toaffect or penetrate the murky mysteries of their feelings.The quality of a computer’s output is determined by the quality of its input. Ifyour subconscious is programmed by chance, its output will have a correspondingcharacter. You have probably heard the computer operators’ eloquent term“gigo”—which means: “Garbage in, garbage out.” The same formula applies to therelationship between a man’s thinking and his emotions.A man who is run by emotions is like a man who is run by a computer whoseprint-outs he cannot read. He does not know whether its programming is true orfalse, right or wrong, whether it’s set to lead him to success or destruction,whether it serves his goals or those of some evil, unknowable power. He is blindon two fronts: blind to the world around him and to his own inner world, unableto grasp reality or his own motives, and he is in chronic terror of both.Emotions are not tools of cognition. The men who are not interested inphilosophy need it most urgently: they are most helplessly in its power.The men who are not interested in philosophy absorb its principles from thecultural atmosphere around them—from schools, colleges, books, magazines,newspapers, movies, television, etc. Who sets the tone of a culture? A smallhandful of men: the philosophers. Others follow their lead, either by convictionor by default. For some two hundred years, under the influence of Immanuel Kant,the dominant trend of philosophy has been directed to a single goal: thedestruction of man’s mind, of his confidence in the power of reason. Today, weare seeing the climax of that trend.When men abandon reason, they find not only that their emotions cannot guidethem, but that they can experience no emotions save one: terror. The spread ofdrug addiction among young people brought up on today’s intellectual fashions,demonstrates the unbearable inner state of men who are deprived of their meansof cognition and who seek escape from reality—from the terror of their impotenceto deal with existence. Observe these young people’s dread of independence andtheir frantic desire to “belong,” to attach themselves to some group, clique organg. Most of them have never heard of philosophy, but they sense that they needsome fundamental answers to questions they dare not ask—and they hope that thetribe will tell them how to live. They are ready to be taken over by any witchdoctor, guru, or dictator. One of the most dangerous things a man can do is tosurrender his moral autonomy to others: like the astronaut in my story, he doesnot know whether they are human, even though they walk on two feet.Now you may ask: If philosophy can be that evil, why should one study it?Particularly, why should one study the philosophical theories which areblatantly false, make no sense, and bear no relation to real life?My answer is: In self-protection—and in defense of truth, justice, freedom, andany value you ever held or may ever hold.Not all philosophies are evil, though too many of them are, particularly inmodern history. On the other hand, at the root of every civilized achievement,such as science, technology, progress, freedom—at the root of every value weenjoy today, including the birth of this country—you will find the achievementof one man, who lived over two thousand years ago: Aristotle.If you feel nothing but boredom when reading the virtually unintelligibletheories of some philosophers, you have my deepest sympathy. But if you brushthem aside, saying: “Why should I study that stuff when I know it’snonsense?”—you are mistaken. It is nonsense, but you don’t know it—not so longas you go on accepting all their conclusions, all the vicious catch phrasesgenerated by those philosophers. And not so long as you are unable to refutethem.That nonsense deals with the most crucial, the life-or-death issues of man’sexistence. At the root of every significant philosophic theory, there is alegitimate issue—in the sense that there is an authentic need of man’sconsciousness, which some theories struggle to clarify and others struggle toobfuscate, to corrupt, to prevent man from ever discovering. The battle ofphilosophers is a battle for man’s mind. If you do not understand theirtheories, you are vulnerable to the worst among them.The best way to study philosophy is to approach it as one approaches a detectivestory: follow every trail, clue and implication, in order to discover who is amurderer and who is a hero. The criterion of detection is two questions: Why?and How? If a given tenet seems to be true—why? If another tenet seems to befalse—why? and how is it being put over? You will not find all the answersimmediately, but you will acquire an invaluable characteristic: the ability tothink in terms of essentials.Nothing is given to man automatically, neither knowledge, nor self-confidence,nor inner serenity, nor the right way to use his mind. Every value he needs orwants has to be discovered, learned and acquired—even the proper posture of hisbody. In this context, I want to say that I have always admired the posture ofWest Point graduates, a posture that projects man in proud, disciplined controlof his body. Well, philosophical training gives man the proper intellectualposture—a proud, disciplined control of his mind.In your own profession, in military science, you know the importance of keepingtrack of the enemy’s weapons, strategy and tactics—and of being prepared tocounter them. The same is true in philosophy: you have to understand the enemy’sideas and be prepared to refute them, you have to know his basic arguments andbe able to blast them.In physical warfare, you would not send your men into a booby trap: you wouldmake every effort to discover its location. Well, Kant’s system is the biggestand most intricate booby trap in the history of philosophy—but it’s so full ofholes that once you grasp its gimmick, you can defuse it without any trouble andwalk forward over it in perfect safety. And, once it is defused, the lesserKantians—the lower ranks of his army, the philosophical sergeants, buckprivates, and mercenaries of today—will fall of their own weightlessness, bychain reaction.There is a special reason why you, the future leaders of the United States Army,need to be philosophically armed today. You are the target of a special attackby the Kantian-Hegelian-collectivist establishment that dominates our culturalinstitutions at present. You are the army of the last semi-free country left onearth, yet you are accused of being a tool of imperialism—and “imperialism” isthe name given to the foreign policy of this country, which has never engaged inmilitary conquest and has never profited from the two world wars, which she didnot initiate, but entered and won. (It was, incidentally, a foolishlyovergenerous policy, which made this country waste her wealth on helping bothher allies and her former enemies.) Something called “the military-industrialcomplex”—which is a myth or worse—is being blamed for all of this country’stroubles. Bloody college hoodlums scream demands that R.O.T.C. units be bannedfrom college campuses. Our defense budget is being attacked, denounced andundercut by people who claim that financial priority should be given toecological rose gardens and to classes in esthetic self-expression for theresidents of the slums.Some of you may be bewildered by this campaign and may be wondering, in goodfaith, what errors you committed to bring it about. If so, it is urgentlyimportant for you to understand the nature of the enemy. You are attacked, notfor any errors or flaws, but for your virtues. You are denounced, not for anyweaknesses, but for your strength and your competence. You are penalized forbeing the protectors of the United States. On a lower level of the same issue, asimilar kind of campaign is conducted against the police force. Those who seekto destroy this country, seek to disarm it—intellectually and physically. But itis not a mere political issue; politics is not the cause, but the lastconsequence of philosophical ideas. It is not a communist conspiracy, thoughsome communists may be involved—as maggots cashing in on a disaster they had nopower to originate. The motive of the destroyers is not love for communism, buthatred for America. Why hatred? Because America is the living refutation of aKantian universe.Today’s mawkish concern with and compassion for the feeble, the flawed, thesuffering, the guilty, is a cover for the profoundly Kantian hatred of theinnocent, the strong, the able, the successful, the virtuous, the confident, thehappy. A philosophy out to destroy man’s mind is necessarily a philosophy ofhatred for man, for man’s life, and for every human value. Hatred of the goodfor being the good, is the hallmark of the twentieth century. This is the enemyyou are facing.A battle of this kind requires special weapons. It has to be fought with a fullunderstanding of your cause, a full confidence in yourself, and the fullestcertainty of the moral rightness of both. Only philosophy can provide you withthese weapons.The assignment I gave myself for tonight is not to sell you on my philosophy,but on philosophy as such. I have, however, been speaking implicitly of myphilosophy in every sentence—since none of us and no statement can escape fromphilosophical premises. What is my selfish interest in the matter? I amconfident enough to think that if you accept the importance of philosophy andthe task of examining it critically, it is my philosophy that you will come toaccept. Formally, I call it Objectivism, but informally I call it a philosophyfor living on earth. You will find an explicit presentation of it in my books,particularly in Atlas Shrugged.In conclusion, allow me to speak in personal terms. This evening means a greatdeal to me. I feel deeply honored by the opportunity to address you. I cansay—not as a patriotic bromide, but with full knowledge of the necessarymetaphysical, epistemological, ethical, political and esthetic roots—that theUnited States of America is the greatest, the noblest and, in its originalfounding principles, the only moral country in the history of the world. Thereis a kind of quiet radiance associated in my mind with the name WestPoint—because you have preserved the spirit of those original foundingprinciples and you are their symbol. There were contradictions and omissions inthose principles, and there may be in yours—but I am speaking of the essentials.There may be individuals in your history who did not live up to your higheststandards—as there are in every institution—since no institution and no socialsystem can guarantee the automatic perfection of all its members; this dependson an individual’s free will. I am speaking of your standards. You havepreserved three qualities of character which were typical at the time ofAmerica’s birth, but are virtually nonexistent today: earnestness—dedication—asense of honor. Honor is self-esteem made visible in action.You have chosen to risk your lives for the defense of this country. I will notinsult you by saying that you are dedicated to selfless service—it is not avirtue in my morality. In my morality, the defense of one’s country means that aman is personally unwilling to live as the conquered slave of any enemy, foreignor domestic. This is an enormous virtue. Some of you may not be consciouslyaware of it. I want to help you to realize it.The army of a free country has a great responsibility: the right to use force,but not as an instrument of compulsion and brute conquest—as the armies of othercountries have done in their histories—only as an instrument of a free nation’sself-defense, which means: the defense of a man’s individual rights. Theprinciple of using force only in retaliation against those who initiate its use,is the principle of subordinating might to right. The highest integrity andsense of honor are required for such a task. No other army in the world hasachieved it. You have.West Point has given America a long line of heroes, known and unknown. You, thisyear’s graduates, have a glorious tradition to carry on—which I admireprofoundly, not because it is a tradition, but because it is glorious.Since I came from a country guilty of the worst tyranny on earth, I amparticularly able to appreciate the meaning, the greatness and the supreme valueof that which you are defending. So, in my own name and in the name of manypeople who think as I do, I want to say, to all the men of West Point, past,present and future: Thank you."},{"pageContent":"2Philosophical Detection1974 My [lecture at West Point was] devoted to a brief presentation of an enormoussubject: “Philosophy: Who Needs It.” I covered the essentials, but a moredetailed discussion of certain points will be helpful to those who wish to studyphilosophy (particularly today, because philosophy has been abolished by the twocurrently fashionable schools, Linguistic Analysis and Existentialism).I said that the best way to study philosophy is to approach it as one approachesa detective story. A detective seeks to discover the truth about a crime. Aphilosophical detective must seek to determine the truth or falsehood of anabstract system and thus discover whether he is dealing with a great achievementor an intellectual crime. A detective knows what to look for, or what clues toregard as significant. A philosophical detective must remember that all humanknowledge has a hierarchical structure; he must learn to distinguish thefundamental from the derivative, and in judging a given philosopher’s system, hemust look—first and above all else—at its fundamentals. If the foundation doesnot hold, neither will anything else.In philosophy, the fundamentals are metaphysics and epistemology. On the basisof a knowable universe and of a rational faculty’s competence to grasp it, youcan define man’s proper ethics, politics and esthetics. (And if you make anerror, you retain the means and the frame of reference necessary to correct it.)But what will you accomplish if you advocate honesty in ethics, while tellingmen that there is no such thing as truth, fact or reality? What will you do ifyou advocate political freedom on the grounds that you feel it is good, and findyourself confronting an ambitious thug who declares that he feels quitedifferently?The layman’s error, in regard to philosophy, is the tendency to acceptconsequences while ignoring their causes—to take the end result of a longsequence of thought as the given and to regard it as “self-evident” or as anirreducible primary, while negating its preconditions. Examples can be seen allaround us, particularly in politics. There are liberals who want to preserveindividual freedom while denying its source: individual rights. There arereligious conservatives who claim to advocate capitalism while attacking itsroot: reason. There are sundry “libertarians” who plagiarize the Objectivisttheory of politics, while rejecting the metaphysics, epistemology and ethics onwhich it rests. That attitude, of course, is not confined to philosophy: itssimplest example is the people who scream that they need more gas and that theoil industry should be taxed out of existence.As a philosophical detective, you must remember that nothing is self-evidentexcept the material of sensory perception—and that an irreducible primary is afact which cannot be analyzed (i.e., broken into components) or derived fromantecedent facts. You must examine your own convictions and any idea or theoryyou study, by asking: Is this an irreducible primary—and, if not, what does itdepend on? You must ask the same question about any answer you obtain, until youdo come to an irreducible primary: if a given idea contradicts a primary, theidea is false. This process will lead you to the field of metaphysics andepistemology—and you will discover in what way every aspect of man’s knowledgedepends on that field and stands or falls with it.There is an old fable which I read in Russian (I do not know whether it existsin English). A pig comes upon an oak tree, devours the acorns strewn on theground and, when his belly is full, starts digging the soil to undercut the oaktree’s roots. A bird perched on a high branch upbraids him, saying: “If youcould lift your snoot, you would discover that the acorns grow on this tree.”In order to avoid that pig’s role in the forest of the intellect, one must knowand protect the metaphysical-epistemological tree that produces the acorns ofone’s convictions, goals and desires. And, conversely, one must not gobble upany brightly colored fruit one finds, without bothering to discover that itcomes from a deadly yew tree. If laymen did no more than learn to identify thenature of such fruit and stop munching it or passing it around, they would stopbeing the victims and the unwary transmission belts of philosophical poison. Buta minimal grasp of philosophy is required in order to do it.If an intelligent and honest layman were to translate his implicit, common-senserationality (which he takes for granted) into explicit philosophical premises,he would hold that the world he perceives is real (existence exists), thatthings are what they are (the Law of Identity), that reason is the only means ofgaining knowledge and logic is the method of using reason. Assuming this base,let me give you an example of what a philosophical detective would do with someof the catch phrases I cited in [“Philosophy: Who Needs It”].“It may be true for you, but it’s not true for me.” What is the meaning of theconcept “truth”: Truth is the recognition of reality. (This is known as thecorrespondence theory of truth.) The same thing cannot be true and untrue at thesame time and in the same respect. That catch phrase, therefore, means: a. thatthe Law of Identity is invalid; b. that there is no objectively perceivablereality, only some indeterminate flux which is nothing in particular, i.e., thatthere is no reality (in which case, there can be no such thing as truth); or c.that the two debaters perceive two different universes (in which case, no debateis possible). (The purpose of the catch phrase is the destruction ofobjectivity.)“Don’t be so sure—nobody can be certain of anything.” Bertrand Russell’sgibberish to the contrary notwithstanding, that pronouncement includes itself;therefore, one cannot be sure that one cannot be sure of anything. Thepronouncement means that no knowledge of any kind is possible to man, i.e., thatman is not conscious. Furthermore, if one tried to accept that catch phrase, onewould find that its second part contradicts its first: if nobody can be certainof anything, then everybody can be certain of everything he pleases—since itcannot be refuted, and he can claim he is not certain he is certain (which isthe purpose of that notion).“This may be good in theory, but it doesn’t work in practice.” What is a theory?It is a set of abstract principles purporting to be either a correct descriptionof reality or a set of guidelines for man’s actions. Correspondence to realityis the standard of value by which one estimates a theory. If a theory isinapplicable to reality, by what standards can it be estimated as “good”? If onewere to accept that notion, it would mean: a. that the activity of man’s mind isunrelated to reality; b. that the purpose of thinking is neither to acquireknowledge nor to guide man’s actions. (The purpose of that catch phrase is toinvalidate man’s conceptual faculty.)“It’s logical, but logic has nothing to do with reality.” Logic is the art orskill of non-contradictory identification. Logic has a single law, the Law ofIdentity, and its various corollaries. If logic has nothing to do with reality,it means that the Law of Identity is inapplicable to reality. If so, then: a.things are not what they are; b. things can be and not be at the same time, inthe same respect, i.e., reality is made up of contradictions. If so, by whatmeans did anyone discover it? By illogical means. (This last is for sure.) Thepurpose of that notion is crudely obvious. Its actual meaning is not: “Logic hasnothing to do with reality,” but: “I, the speaker, have nothing to do with logic(or with reality).” When people use that catch phrase, they mean either “It’slogical, but I don’t choose to be logical” or: “It’s logical, but people are notlogical, they don’t think—and I intend to pander to their irrationality.”This is a clue to the kind of error (or epistemological sloppiness) that permitsthe spread of such catch phrases. Most people use them in regard to someconcrete, particular instance and are not aware of the fact that they areuttering a devastating metaphysical generalization. When they say: “It may betrue for you, but it’s not true for me,” they usually mean some optional matterof taste, involving some minor value-judgment. The meaning they intend to conveyis closer to: “You may like it, but I don’t.” The unchallenged idea thatvalue-preferences and emotions are unaccountable primaries, is at the root oftheir statement. And, in defense of their failure of introspection, they arerecklessly willing to wipe the universe out of existence.When people hear the catch phrase: “It may have been true yesterday, but it’snot true today,” they usually think of man-made issues or customs, such as: “Menfought duels yesterday, but not today” or: “Women wore hoop skirts yesterday,but not today” or: “We’re not in the horse-and-buggy age any longer.” Theproponents of that catch phrase are seldom innocent, and the examples they giveare usually of the above kind. So their victims—who have never discovered thedifference between the metaphysical and the man-made—find themselves, inhelpless bewilderment, unable to refute such conclusions as: “Freedom was avalue yesterday, but not today” or: “Work was a human necessity yesterday, butnot today” or: “Reason was valid yesterday, but not today.”Now observe the method I used to analyze those catch phrases. You must attachclear, specific meanings to words, i.e., be able to identify their referents inreality. This is a precondition, without which neither critical judgment northinking of any kind is possible. All philosophical con games count on yourusing words as vague approximations. You must not take a catch phrase—or anyabstract statement—as if it were approximate. Take it literally. Don’t translateit, don’t glamorize it, don’t make the mistake of thinking, as many people do:“Oh, nobody could possibly mean this!” and then proceed to endow it with somewhitewashed meaning of your own. Take it straight, for what it does say andmean.Instead of dismissing the catch phrase, accept it—for a few brief moments. Tellyourself, in effect: “If I were to accept it as true, what would follow?” Thisis the best way of unmasking any philosophical fraud. The old saying of plaincon men holds true for intellectual ones: “You can’t cheat an honest man.”Intellectual honesty consists in taking ideas seriously. To take ideas seriouslymeans that you intend to live by, to practice, any idea you accept as true.Philosophy provides man with a comprehensive view of life. In order to evaluateit properly, ask yourself what a given theory, if accepted, would do to a humanlife, starting with your own.Most people would be astonished by this method. They think that abstractthinking must be “impersonal”—which means that ideas must hold no personalmeaning, value or importance to the thinker. This notion rests on the premisethat a personal interest is an agent of distortion. But “personal” does not mean“non-objective”; it depends on the kind of person you are. If your thinking isdetermined by your emotions, then you will not be able to judge anythingpersonally or impersonally. But if you are the kind of person who knows thatreality is not your enemy, that truth and knowledge are of crucial, personal,selfish importance to you and to your own life—then, the more passionatelypersonal the thinking, the clearer and truer.Would you be willing and able to act, daily and consistently, on the belief thatreality is an illusion? That the things you see around you, do not exist? Thatit makes no difference whether you drive your car down a road or over the edgeof an abyss—whether you eat or starve—whether you save the life of a person youlove or push him into a blazing fire? It is particularly important to apply thistest to any moral theory. Would you be willing and able to act on the beliefthat altruism is a moral ideal? That you must sacrifice everything—everythingyou love, seek, own, or desire, including your life—for the benefit of any andevery stranger?Do not evade such issues by means of self-abasement—by saying: “Maybe reality isunreal, but I’m not wise enough to transcend my low-grade, materialisticbondage” or: “Yes, altruism is an ideal, but I’m not good enough to practiceit.” Self-abasement is not an answer—and it is not a license to apply to othersthe precepts from which you exempt yourself; it is merely a trap set by the veryphilosophers you are trying to judge. They have spent a prodigious effort toteach you to assume an unearned guilt. Once you assume it, you pronounce yourmind incompetent to judge, you renounce morality, integrity and thought, and youcondemn yourself to the gray fog of the approximate, the uncertain, theuninspiring, the flameless, through which most men drag their lives—which is thepurpose of that trap.The acceptance of unearned guilt is a major cause of philosophical passivity.There are other causes—and other kinds of guilt which are earned.A major source of men’s earned guilt in regard to philosophy—as well as inregard to their own minds and lives—is failure of introspection. Specifically,it is the failure to identify the nature and causes of their emotions.An emotion as such tells you nothing about reality, beyond the fact thatsomething makes you feel something. Without a ruthlessly honest commitment tointrospection—to the conceptual identification of your inner states—you will notdiscover what you feel, what arouses the feeling, and whether your feeling is anappropriate response to the facts of reality, or a mistaken response, or avicious illusion produced by years of self-deception. The men who scorn or dreadintrospection take their inner states for granted, as an irreducible andirresistible primary, and let their emotions determine their actions. This meansthat they choose to act without knowing the context (reality), the causes(motives), and the consequences (goals) of their actions.The field of extrospection is based on two cardinal questions: “What do I know?”and “How do I know it?” In the field of introspection, the two guiding questionsare: “What do I feel?” and “Why do I feel it?”Most men can give themselves only some primitively superficial answers—and theyspend their lives struggling with incomprehensible inner conflicts, alternatelyrepressing their emotions and indulging in emotional fits, regretting it, losingcontrol again, rebelling against the mystery of their inner chaos, trying tounravel it, giving up, deciding to feel nothing—and feeling the growing pressureof fear, guilt, self-doubt, which makes the answers progressively harder tofind.Since an emotion is experienced as an immediate primary, but is, in fact, acomplex, derivative sum, it permits men to practice one of the ugliest ofpsychological phenomena: rationalization. Rationalization is a cover-up, aprocess of providing one’s emotions with a false identity, of giving themspurious explanations and justifications—in order to hide one’s motives, notjust from others, but primarily from oneself. The price of rationalizing is thehampering, the distortion and, ultimately, the destruction of one’s cognitivefaculty. Rationalization is a process not of perceiving reality, but ofattempting to make reality fit one’s emotions.Philosophical catch phrases are handy means of rationalization. They are quoted,repeated and perpetuated in order to justify feelings which men are unwilling toadmit.“Nobody can be certain of anything” is a rationalization for a feeling of envyand hatred toward those who are certain. “It may be true for you, but it’s nottrue for me” is a rationalization for one’s inability and unwillingness to provethe validity of one’s contentions. “Nobody is perfect in this world” is arationalization for the desire to continue indulging in one’s imperfections,i.e., the desire to escape morality. “Nobody can help anything he does” is arationalization for the escape from moral responsibility. “It may have been trueyesterday, but it’s not true today” is a rationalization for the desire to getaway with contradictions. “Logic has nothing to do with reality” is a cruderationalization for a desire to subordinate reality to one’s whims.“I can’t prove it, but I feel that it’s true” is more than a rationalization: itis a description of the process of rationalizing. Men do not accept a catchphrase by a process of thought, they seize upon a catch phrase—any catchphrase—because it fits their emotions. Such men do not judge the truth of astatement by its correspondence to reality—they judge reality by itscorrespondence to their feelings.If, in the course of philosophical detection, you find yourself, at times,stopped by the indignantly bewildered question: “How could anyone arrive at suchnonsense?”—you will begin to understand it when you discover that evilphilosophies are systems of rationalization.The nonsense is never accidental, if you observe what subjects it deals with.The elaborate structures in which it is presented are never purposeless. You mayfind a grim proof of reality’s power in the fact that the most virulently rabidirrationalist senses the derivative nature of emotions and will not proclaimtheir primacy, their sovereign causelessness, but will seek to justify them asresponses to reality—and if reality contradicts them, he will invent anotherreality of which they are the humble reflectors, not the rulers.In modern history, the philosophy of Kant is a systematic rationalization ofevery major psychological vice. The metaphysical inferiority of this world (as a“phenomenal” world of mere “appearances”), is a rationalization for the hatredof reality. The notion that reason is unable to perceive reality and deals onlywith “appearances,” is a rationalization for the hatred of reason; it is also arationalization for a profound kind of epistemological egalitarianism whichreduces reason to equality with the futile puttering of “idealistic” dreamers.The metaphysical superiority of the “noumenal” world, is a rationalization forthe supremacy of emotions, which are thus given the power to know the unknowableby ineffable means.The complaint that man can perceive things only through his own consciousness,not through any other kinds of consciousnesses, is a rationalization for themost profound type of second-handedness ever confessed in print: it is the whineof a man tortured by perpetual concern with what others think and by inabilityto decide which others he should conform to. The wish to perceive “things inthemselves” unprocessed by any consciousness, is a rationalization for the wishto escape the effort and responsibility of cognition—by means of the automaticomniscience a whim-worshiper ascribes to his emotions. The moral imperative ofthe duty to sacrifice oneself to duty, a sacrifice without beneficiaries, is agross rationalization for the image (and soul) of an austere, ascetic monk whowinks at you with an obscenely sadistic pleasure—the pleasure of breaking man’sspirit, ambition, success, self-esteem, and enjoyment of life on earth. Etcetera. These are just some of the highlights.Observe that the history of philosophy reproduces—in slow motion, on amacrocosmic screen—the workings of ideas in an individual man’s mind. A man whohas accepted false premises is free to reject them, but until and unless hedoes, they do not lie still in his mind, they grow without his consciousparticipation and reach their ultimate logical conclusions. A similar processtakes place in a culture: if the false premises of an influential philosopherare not challenged, generations of his followers—acting as the culture’ssubconscious—milk them down to their ultimate consequences.Since Kant substituted the collective for the objective (in the form of“categories” collectively creating a “phenomenal” world), the next step was thephilosophy of Hegel—which is a rationalization for subjectivism, for thepower-lust of an ambitious elite who would create a “noumenal,” non-materialworld (by means of establishing the brute force of an absolute state in the“phenomenal,” material one). Since those outside the elite could not be countedupon to obey or accept such a future, the next side step was Pragmatism—which isa rationalization for the concrete-bound, range-of-the-moment, anti-conceptualmentalities that long for liberation from principles and future.Today, there is the philosophy of Linguistic Analysis—which is a rationalizationfor men who are able to focus on single words, but unable to integrate them intosentences, paragraphs or philosophical systems, yet who wish to be philosophers.And there is the philosophy of Existentialism—which discards the politeness ofrationalization, takes Kant straight, and proclaims the supremacy of emotions inan unknowable, incomprehensible, inexplicable, nauseating non-world.Observe that, in spite of their differences, altruism is the untouched,unchallenged common denominator in the ethics of all these philosophies. It isthe single richest source of rationalizations. A morality that cannot bepracticed is an unlimited cover for any practice. Altruism is therationalization for the mass slaughter in Soviet Russia—for the legalizedlooting in the welfare state—for the power-lust of politicians seeking to servethe “common good”—for the concept of a “common good”—for envy, hatred, malice,brutality—for the arson, robbery, highjacking, kidnapping, murder perpetrated bythe selfless advocates of sundry collectivist causes—for sacrifice and moresacrifice and an infinity of sacrificial victims. When a theory achieves nothingbut the opposite of its alleged goals, yet its advocates remain undeterred, youmay be certain that it is not a conviction or an “ideal,” but a rationalization.Philosophical rationalizations are not always easy to detect. Some of them areso complex that an innocent man may be taken in and paralyzed by intellectualconfusion. At their first encounter with modern philosophy, many people make themistake of dropping it and running, with the thought: “I know it’s false, but Ican’t prove it. I know something’s wrong there, but I can’t waste my time andeffort trying to untangle it.” Here is the danger of such a policy: you mightforget all about Kant’s “categories” and his “noumenal” world, but someday,under the pressure of facing some painfully difficult choice, when you feeltempted to evade the responsibility or to make a dishonest decision, when youneed all of your inner strength, confidence and courage, you will find yourselfthinking: “How do I know what’s true? Nobody knows it. Nobody can be certain ofanything.” This is all Kant wanted of you.A thinker like Kant does not want you to agree with him: all he wants is thatyou give him the benefit of the doubt. He knows that your own subconscious doesthe rest. What he dreads is your conscious mind: once you understand the meaningof his theories, they lose their power to threaten you, like a Halloween mask inbright sunlight.One further suggestion: if you undertake the task of philosophical detection,drop the dangerous little catch phrase which advises you to keep an “open mind.”This is a very ambiguous term—as demonstrated by a man who once accused a famouspolitician of having “a wide open mind.” That term is an anti-concept: it isusually taken to mean an objective, unbiased approach to ideas, but it is usedas a call for perpetual skepticism, for holding no firm convictions and grantingplausibility to anything. A “closed mind” is usually taken to mean the attitudeof a man impervious to ideas, arguments, facts and logic, who clings stubbornlyto some mixture of unwarranted assumptions, fashionable catch phrases, tribalprejudices—and emotions. But this is not a “closed” mind, it is a passive one.It is a mind that has dispensed with (or never acquired) the practice ofthinking or judging, and feels threatened by any request to consider anything.What objectivity and the study of philosophy require is not an “open mind,” butan active mind—a mind able and eagerly willing to examine ideas, but to examinethem critically. An active mind does not grant equal status to truth andfalsehood; it does not remain floating forever in a stagnant vacuum ofneutrality and uncertainty; by assuming the responsibility of judgment, itreaches firm convictions and holds to them. Since it is able to prove itsconvictions, an active mind achieves an unassailable certainty in confrontationswith assailants—a certainty untainted by spots of blind faith, approximation,evasion and fear.If you keep an active mind, you will discover (assuming that you started withcommon-sense rationality) that every challenge you examine will strengthen yourconvictions, that the conscious, reasoned rejection of false theories will helpyou to clarify and amplify the true ones, that your ideological enemies willmake you invulnerable by providing countless demonstrations of their ownimpotence.No, you will not have to keep your mind eternally open to the task of examiningevery new variant of the same old falsehoods. You will discover that they arevariants or attacks on certain philosophical essentials—and that the entire,gigantic battle of philosophy (and of human history) revolves around theupholding or the destruction of these essentials. You will learn to recognize ata glance a given theory’s stand on these essentials, and to reject the attackswithout lengthy consideration—because you will know (and will be able to prove)in what way any given attack, old or new, is made of contradictions and “stolenconcepts.”1 [rand_9781101137703_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-1] I will list these essentials for your future reference. But do not attempt theshortcut of accepting them on faith (or as semi-grasped approximations andfloating abstractions). That would be a fundamental contradiction and it wouldnot work.The essentials are: in metaphysics, the Law of Identity—in epistemology, thesupremacy of reason—in ethics, rational egoism—in politics, individual rights(i.e., capitalism)—in esthetics, metaphysical values.If you reach the day when these essentials become your absolutes, you will haveentered Atlantis—at least psychologically; which is a precondition of thepossibility ever to enter it existentially."},{"pageContent":"3The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made1973 “God grant me the serenity to accept things I cannot change, courage to changethings I can, and wisdom to know the difference.”This remarkable statement is attributed to a theologian with whose ideas Idisagree in every fundamental respect: Reinhold Niebuhr. But—omitting the formof a prayer, i.e., the implication that one’s mental-emotional states are a giftfrom God—that statement is profoundly true, as a summary and a guideline: itnames the mental attitude which a rational man must seek to achieve. Thestatement is beautiful in its eloquent simplicity; but the achievement of thatattitude involves philosophy’s deepest metaphysical-moral issues.I was startled to learn that that statement has been adopted as a prayer byAlcoholics Anonymous, which is not exactly a philosophical organization. In viewof the fact that today’s social-psychological theories stress emotional, notintellectual, needs and frustrations as the cause of human suffering (e.g., thelack of “love”), that organization deserves credit for discovering that such aprayer is relevant to the problems of alcoholics—that the misery of confusion onthose issues has devastating consequences and is one of the factors driving mento drink—i.e., to seek escape from reality. This is just one more example of theway in which philosophy rules the lives of men who have never heard or cared tohear about it.Most men spend their lives in futile rebellion against things they cannotchange, in passive resignation to things they can, and—never attempting to learnthe difference—in chronic guilt and self-doubt on both counts.Observe what philosophical premises are implicit in that advice and are requiredfor an attempt to live up to it. If there are things that man can change, itmeans that he possesses the power of choice, i.e., the faculty of volition. Ifhe does not possess it, he can change nothing, including his own actions andcharacteristics, such as courage or lack of it. If there are things that mancannot change, it means that there are things that cannot be affected by hisactions and are not open to his choice. This leads to the basic metaphysicalissue that lies at the root of any system of philosophy: the primacy ofexistence or the primacy of consciousness.The primacy of existence (of reality) is the axiom that existence exists, i.e.,that the universe exists independent of consciousness (of any consciousness),that things are what they are, that they possess a specific nature, an identity.The epistemological corollary is the axiom that consciousness is the faculty ofperceiving that which exists—and that man gains knowledge of reality by lookingoutward. The rejection of these axioms represents a reversal: the primacy ofconsciousness—the notion that the universe has no independent existence, that itis the product of a consciousness (either human or divine or both). Theepistemological corollary is the notion that man gains knowledge of reality bylooking inward (either at his own consciousness or at the revelations itreceives from another, superior consciousness).The source of this reversal is the inability or unwillingness fully to grasp thedifference between one’s inner state and the outer world, i.e., between theperceiver and the perceived (thus blending consciousness and existence into oneindeterminate package-deal).2 [rand_9781101137703_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-2] Thiscrucial distinction is not given to man automatically; it has to be learned. Itis implicit in any awareness, but it has to be grasped conceptually and held asan absolute. As far as can be observed, infants and savages do not grasp it(they may, perhaps, have some rudimentary glimmer of it). Very few men everchoose to grasp it and fully to accept it. The majority keep swinging from sideto side, implicitly recognizing the primacy of existence in some cases anddenying it in others, adopting a kind of hit-or-miss, rule-of-thumbepistemological agnosticism, through ignorance and/or by intention—the result ofwhich is the shrinking of their intellectual range, i.e., of their capacity todeal with abstractions. And although few people today believe that the singingof mystic incantations will bring rain, most people still regard as valid anargument such as: “If there is no God, who created the universe?”To grasp the axiom that existence exists, means to grasp the fact that nature,i.e., the universe as a whole, cannot be created or annihilated, that it cannotcome into or go out of existence. Whether its basic constituent elements areatoms, or subatomic particles, or some yet undiscovered forms of energy, it isnot ruled by a consciousness or by will or by chance, but by the Law ofIdentity. All the countless forms, motions, combinations and dissolutions ofelements within the universe—from a floating speck of dust to the formation of agalaxy to the emergence of life—are caused and determined by the identities ofthe elements involved. Nature is the metaphysically given—i.e., the nature ofnature is outside the power of any volition.Man’s volition is an attribute of his consciousness (of his rational faculty)and consists in the choice to perceive existence or to evade it. To perceiveexistence, to discover the characteristics or properties (the identities) of thethings that exist, means to discover and accept the metaphysically given. Onlyon the basis of this knowledge is man able to learn how the things given innature can be rearranged to serve his needs (which is his method of survival).The power to rearrange the combinations of natural elements is the only creativepower man possesses. It is an enormous and glorious power—and it is the onlymeaning of the concept “creative.” “Creation” does not (and metaphysicallycannot) mean the power to bring something into existence out of nothing.“Creation” means the power to bring into existence an arrangement (orcombination or integration) of natural elements that had not existed before.(This is true of any human product, scientific or esthetic: man’s imagination isnothing more than the ability to rearrange the things he has observed inreality.) The best and briefest identification of man’s power in regard tonature is Francis Bacon’s “Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed.” In thiscontext, “to be commanded” means to be made to serve man’s purposes; “to beobeyed” means that they cannot be served unless man discovers the properties ofnatural elements and uses them accordingly.For example, two hundred years ago, men would have said that it is impossible tohear a human voice at a distance of 238,000 miles. It is as impossible today asit was then. But if we are able to hear an astronaut’s voice coming from themoon, it is by means of the science of electronics, which discovered certainnatural phenomena and enabled men to build the kind of equipment that picks upthe vibrations of that voice, transmits them, and reproduces them on earth.Without this knowledge and this equipment, centuries of wishing, praying,screaming and foot-stamping would not make a man’s voice heard at the distanceof ten miles.Today, this is (implicitly) understood and (more or less) accepted in regard tothe physical sciences (hence their progress). It is neither understood noraccepted—and is, in fact, vociferously denied—in regard to the humanities, thesciences dealing with man (hence their stagnant barbarism). Almost unanimously,man is regarded as an unnatural phenomenon: either as a supernatural entity,whose mystic (divine) endowment, the mind (“soul”), is above nature—or as asubnatural entity, whose mystic (demoniacal) endowment, the mind, is an enemy ofnature (“ecology”). The purpose of all such theories is to exempt man from theLaw of Identity.But man exists and his mind exists. Both are part of nature, both possess aspecific identity. The attribute of volition does not contradict the fact ofidentity, just as the existence of living organisms does not contradict theexistence of inanimate matter. Living organisms possess the power ofself-initiated motion, which inanimate matter does not possess; man’sconsciousness possesses the power of self-initiated motion in the realm ofcognition (thinking), which the consciousnesses of other living species do notpossess. But just as animals are able to move only in accordance with the natureof their bodies, so man is able to initiate and direct his mental action only inaccordance with the nature (the identity) of his consciousness. His volition islimited to his cognitive processes; he has the power to identify (and toconceive of rearranging) the elements of reality, but not the power to alterthem. He has the power to use his cognitive faculty as its nature requires, butnot the power to alter it nor to escape the consequences of its misuse. He hasthe power to suspend, evade, corrupt or subvert his perception of reality, butnot the power to escape the existential and psychological disasters that follow.(The use or misuse of his cognitive faculty determines a man’s choice of values,which determine his emotions and his character. It is in this sense that man isa being of self-made soul.)Man’s faculty of volition as such is not a contradiction of nature, but it opensthe way for a host of contradictions—when and if men do not grasp the crucialdifference between the metaphysically given and any object, institution,procedure, or rule of conduct made by man.It is the metaphysically given that must be accepted: it cannot be changed. Itis the man-made that must never be accepted uncritically: it must be judged,then accepted or rejected and changed when necessary. Man is not omniscient orinfallible: he can make innocent errors through lack of knowledge, or he canlie, cheat and fake. The man-made may be a product of genius, perceptiveness,ingenuity—or it may be a product of stupidity, deception, malice, evil. One manmay be right and everyone else wrong, or vice versa (or any numerical divisionin between). Nature does not give man any automatic guarantee of the truth ofhis judgments (and this is a metaphysically given fact, which must be accepted).Who, then, is to judge? Each man, to the best of his ability and honesty. Whatis his standard of judgment? The metaphysically given.The metaphysically given cannot be true or false, it simply is—and mandetermines the truth or falsehood of his judgments by whether they correspond toor contradict the facts of reality. The metaphysically given cannot be right orwrong—it is the standard of right or wrong, by which a (rational) man judges hisgoals, his values, his choices. The metaphysically given is, was, will be, andhad to be. Nothing made by man had to be: it was made by choice.To rebel against the metaphysically given is to engage in a futile attempt tonegate existence. To accept the man-made as beyond challenge is to engage in asuccessful attempt to negate one’s own consciousness. Serenity comes from theability to say “Yes” to existence. Courage comes from the ability to say “No” tothe wrong choices made by others.Any natural phenomenon, i.e., any event which occurs without humanparticipation, is the metaphysically given, and could not have occurreddifferently or failed to occur; any phenomenon involving human action is theman-made, and could have been different. For example, a flood occurring in anuninhabited land, is the metaphysically given; a dam built to contain the floodwater, is the man-made; if the builders miscalculate and the dam breaks, thedisaster is metaphysical in its origin, but intensified by man in itsconsequences. To correct the situation, men must obey nature by studying thecauses and potentialities of the flood, then command nature by building betterflood controls.But to declare that all of man’s efforts to improve the conditions of hisexistence are futile, to declare that nature is unknowable because we cannotprove that there will be a flood next year, even though there has been one everyyear in memory, to declare that human knowledge is an illusion because theoriginal dam builders were certain that the dam would hold, but it did not—is todrive men back to the primordial confusion on the relationship of consciousnessto existence, and thus to rob men of serenity and courage (as well as of manyother things). Yet this is what modern philosophy has been declaring for twohundred years or longer.Observe that the philosophical system based on the axiom of the primacy ofexistence (i.e., on recognizing the absolutism of reality) led to therecognition of man’s identity and rights. But the philosophical systems based onthe primacy of consciousness (i.e., on the seemingly megalomaniacal notion thatnature is whatever man wants it to be) lead to the view that man possesses noidentity, that he is infinitely flexible, malleable, usable and disposable. Askyourself why.A major part of the philosophers’ attack on man’s mind is devoted to attempts toobliterate the difference between the metaphysically given and the man-made. Theconfusion on this issue started as an ancient error (to which even Aristotlecontributed in some of his Platonist aspects); but today it is runningdeliberately and inexcusably wild.A typical package-deal, used by professors of philosophy, runs as follows: toprove the assertion that there is no such thing as “necessity” in the universe,a professor declares that just as this country did not have to have fiftystates, there could have been forty-eight or fifty-two—so the solar system didnot have to have nine planets, there could have been seven or eleven. It is notsufficient, he declares, to prove that something is, one must also prove that ithad to be—and since nothing had to be, nothing is certain and anything goes.The technique of undercutting man’s mind consists in palming off the man-made asif it were the metaphysically given, then ascribing to nature the concepts thatrefer only to men’s lack of knowledge, such as “chance” or “contingency,” thenreversing the two elements of the package-deal. From the assertion: “Man isunpredictable, therefore nature is unpredictable,” the argument goes to: “Naturepossesses volition, man does not—nature is free, man is ruled by unknowableforces—nature is not to be conquered, man is.”Most people believe that an issue of this kind is empty academic talk, of nopractical significance to anyone—which blinds them to its consequences in theirown lives. If one were to tell them that the package-deal made of this issue ispart of the nagging uncertainty, the quiet hopelessness, the gray despair oftheir daily inner state, they would deny it: they would not recognize itintrospectively. But the inability to introspect is one of the consequences ofthis package-deal.Most men have no knowledge of the nature or the functioning of a humanconsciousness and, consequently, no knowledge of what is or is not possible tothem, what one can or cannot demand of oneself and of others, what is or is notone’s fault. On the implicit premise that consciousness has no identity, menalternate between the feeling that they possess some sort of omnipotent powerover their consciousness and can abuse it with impunity (“It doesn’t matter,it’s only in my mind”)—and the feeling that they have no choice, no control,that the content of consciousness is innately predetermined, that they arevictims of the impenetrable mystery inside their own skulls, prisoners of anunknowable enemy, helpless automatons driven by inexplicable emotions (“I can’thelp it, that’s the way I am”).Many men are crippled by the influence of this uncertainty. When such a manconsiders a goal or desire he wants to achieve, the first question in his mindis: “Can I do it?”—not: “What is required to do it?” His question means: “Do Ihave the innate ability?” For example: “I want to be a composer more thananything else on earth, but I have no idea of how it’s done. Do I have thatmysterious gift which will do it for me, somehow?” He has never heard of apremise such as the primacy of consciousness, but that is the premise moving himas he embarks on a hopeless search through the dark labyrinth of hisconsciousness (hopeless, because without reference to existence, nothing can belearned about one’s consciousness).If he does not give up his desire right then, he stumbles uncertainly to attemptto achieve it. Any small success augments his anxiety: he does not know whatcaused it and whether he can repeat it. Any small failure is a crushing blow: hetakes it as proof that he lacks the mystic endowment. When he makes a mistake,he does not ask himself: “What do I need to learn?”—he asks: “What’s wrong withme?” He waits for an automatic and omnipotent inspiration, which never comes. Hespends years on a cheerless struggle, with his eyes focused inward, on thegrowing, leering monster of self-doubt, while existence drifts by, unseen, onthe periphery of his mental vision. Eventually, he gives up.Substitute for “composer” any other profession, goal or desire—to be ascientist, a businessman, a reporter or a headwaiter, to get rich, to findfriends, to lose weight—and the pattern remains the same. Some of the pattern’svictims are phonies, but not all. It is impossible to tell what amount ofauthentic intelligence, particularly in the arts, has been hampered, stunted orcrushed by the myth of “innate endowment.”Unable to determine what they can or cannot change, some men attempt to “rewritereality,” i.e., to alter the nature of the metaphysically given. Some dream of auniverse in which man experiences nothing but happiness—no pain, no frustration,no illness—and wonder why they lose the desire to improve their life on earth.Some feel that they would be brave, honest, ambitious in a world where everyoneautomatically shared these virtues—but not in the world as it is. Some dread thethought of eventual death—and never undertake the task of living. Some grantomniscience to the passage of time and regard tradition as the equivalent ofnature: if people have believed an idea for centuries, they feel, it must betrue. Some grant omnipotence and the status of the metaphysically given, noteven to people’s ideas, but to people’s feelings, and pander to theirrationality of others, to their blind emotions (such as prejudices,superstitions, envy), regardless of the truth or falsehood of the issuesinvolved—on the premise that “It doesn’t matter whether this is true if peoplefeel that it’s true.”Some men switch to others (who were helpless in the matter) the blame for theirown actions; some men, who were helpless in the matter, accept the blame for theactions of others. Some feel guilty because they do not know what they have noway of knowing. Some feel guilty for not having known yesterday what they havelearned today. Some feel guilty for not being able to convert the whole world totheir own ideas effortlessly and overnight.The question of how to deal with nature is partially understood, at least bysome people; but the question of how to deal with men and how to judge them isstill in the state of a primeval jungle. It is man’s faculty of volition thatsets him apart (even in the eyes of those who deny the existence of thatfaculty), and makes men regard themselves and others as unintelligible,unknowable, exempt from the Law of Identity.But nothing is exempt from the Law of Identity. A man-made product did not haveto exist, but, once made, it does exist. A man’s actions did not have to beperformed, but, once performed, they are facts of reality. The same is true of aman’s character: he did not have to make the choices he made, but, once he hasformed his character, it is a fact, and it is his personal identity. (Man’svolition gives him great, but not unlimited, latitude to change his character;if he does, the change becomes a fact.)Things of human origin (whether physical or psychological) may be designated as“man-made facts”—as distinguished from the metaphysically given facts. Askyscraper is a man-made fact, a mountain is a metaphysically given fact. Onecan alter a skyscraper or blow it up (just as one can alter or blow up amountain), but so long as it exists, one cannot pretend that it is not there orthat it is not what it is. The same principle applies to men’s actions andcharacters. A man does not have to be a worthless scoundrel, but so long as hechooses to be, he is a worthless scoundrel and must be treated accordingly; totreat him otherwise is to contradict a fact. A man does not have to be a heroicachiever; but so long as he chooses to be, he is a heroic achiever and must betreated accordingly; to treat him otherwise is to contradict a fact. Men did nothave to build a skyscraper; but, once they did, it is worse than a contradictionto regard a skyscraper as a mountain, as a metaphysically given fact which, onthis view, “just happened to happen.”The faculty of volition gives man a special status in two crucial respects: 1.unlike the metaphysically given, man’s products, whether material orintellectual, are not to be accepted uncritically—and 2. by its metaphysicallygiven nature, a man’s volition is outside the power of other men. What theunalterable basic constituents are to nature, the attribute of a volitionalconsciousness is to the entity “man.” Nothing can force a man to think. Othersmay offer him incentives or impediments, rewards or punishments, they maydestroy his brain by drugs or by the blow of a club, but they cannot order hismind to function: this is in his exclusive, sovereign power. Man is neither tobe obeyed nor to be commanded.What has to be “obeyed” is man’s metaphysically given nature—in the sense inwhich one “obeys” the nature of all existents; this means, in man’s case, thatone must recognize the fact that his mind is not to be “commanded” in any sense,including the sense applicable to the rest of nature. Natural objects can bereshaped to serve men’s goals and are to be regarded as means to men’s ends, butman himself cannot and is not.In regard to nature, “to accept what I cannot change” means to accept themetaphysically given; “to change what I can” means to strive to rearrange thegiven by acquiring knowledge—as science and technology (e.g., medicine) aredoing; “to know the difference” means to know that one cannot rebel againstnature and, when no action is possible, one must accept nature serenely.In regard to man, “to accept” does not mean to agree, and “to change” does notmean to force. What one must accept is the fact that the minds of other men arenot in one’s power, as one’s own mind is not in theirs; one must accept theirright to make their own choices, and one must agree or disagree, accept orreject, join or oppose them, as one’s mind dictates. The only means of“changing” men is the same as the means of “changing” nature: knowledge—which,in regard to men, is to be used as a process of persuasion, when and if theirminds are active; when they are not, one must leave them to the consequences oftheir own errors. “To know the difference” means that one must never acceptman-made evils (there are no others) in silent resignation, one must neversubmit to them voluntarily—and even if one is imprisoned in some ghastlydictatorship’s jail, where no action is possible, serenity comes from theknowledge that one does not accept it.To deal with men by force is as impractical as to deal with nature bypersuasion—which is the policy of savages, who rule men by force and plead withnature by prayers, incantations and bribes (sacrifices). It does not work andhas not worked in any human society in history. Yet this is the policy to whichmodern philosophers are urging mankind to revert—as they have reverted to thenotion of the primacy of consciousness. They urge a passive, mystic,“ecological” submission to nature—and the rule of brute force for men.The philosophers’ denial of the Law of Identity permits them to evade man’sidentity and the requirements of his survival. It permits them to evade the factthat man cannot survive for long in a state of nature, that reason is his toolof survival, that he survives by means of man-made products, and that the sourceof man-made products is man’s intelligence. Intelligence is the ability to graspthe facts of reality and to deal with them long-range (i.e., conceptually). Onthe axiom of the primacy of existence, intelligence is man’s most preciousattribute. But it has no place in a society ruled by the primacy ofconsciousness: it is such a society’s deadliest enemy.Today, intelligence is neither recognized nor rewarded, but is beingsystematically extinguished in a growing flood of brazenly flauntedirrationality. As just one example of the extent to which today’s culture isdominated by the primacy of consciousness, observe the following: in politics,people hold a ruthless, absolutist, either-or attitude toward elections, theyexpect a man either to win or not and are concerned only with the winner,ignoring the loser altogether (even though, in some cases, the loser wasright)—while in economics, in the realm of production, they evade the absolutismof reality, of the fact that man either produces or not, and destroy the winnersin favor of the losers. To them, men’s decisions are an absolute; reality’sdemands are not.The climax of that trend, the ultimate cashing-in on the package-deal of themetaphysical and the man-made, is the egalitarian movement and its philosophicalmanifesto, John Rawls’s A Theory of Justice.3[rand_9781101137703_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-3] This obscenely evil theory proposesto subordinate man’s nature and mind to the desires (including the envy), notmerely of the lowest human specimens, but of the lowest non-existents—to theemotions these would have felt before they were born—and requires that men makelifelong choices on the premise that they are all equally devoid of brains. Thefact that a brain cannot project an alteration of its own nature and power, thata genius cannot project himself into the state of a moron, and vice versa, thatthe needs and desires of a genius and a moron are not identical, that a geniusreduced to the existential level of a moron would perish in unspeakable agony,and a moron raised to the existential level of a genius would paint graffiti onthe sides of a computer, then die of starvation—all this does not enter theskulls of men who have dispensed with the Law of Identity (and, therefore, withreality), who demand “equal results” regardless of unequal causes, and whopropose to alter metaphysical facts by the power of whims and guns.This is being preached, touted and demanded today. There can be nointellectual—or moral—neutrality on such an issue. The moral cowards who try toevade it by pleading ignorance, confusion or helplessness, who keep silent andavoid the battle, yet feel a growing sense of guilty terror over the question ofwhat they can or cannot change, are paving the way for the egalitarians’atrocities, and will end up like the derelicts whom Alcoholics Anonymous isstruggling to help.The least that any decent man can do today is to fight that book’s doctrine—tofight it intransigently on moral grounds. A proposal to annihilate intelligenceby slow torture cannot be treated as a difference of civilized opinion.If any man feels that the world is too complex and its evil is too big to copewith, let him remember that it is too big to drown in a glass of whiskey."},{"pageContent":"4The Missing Link1973 I shall begin by giving you four examples and asking you to identify whatpsychological element they have in common.1. I once knew a businessman in a large Midwestern city, who was an unusuallyhard-working, active, energetic person. He had built a small business of his ownand had risen from poverty to affluence. He was the adviser and protector of anenormous conglomeration of relatives, friends, and friends of friends, who ranto him, not merely for loans, but for help with problems of any kind. He was inhis late thirties, but acted as a sort of tribal patriarch.It was hard to tell whether he enjoyed or resented his role; he seemed to takeit for granted, as a kind of metaphysical duty: he had probably never thought ofquestioning it. He did enjoy acting as a small big shot, however, and doingfavors for people, about which he was very generous. He had, apparently, somemarginal connections with his particular district’s political machine and heloved obtaining for his friends the sort of favors that were unobtainablewithout special pull, such as extra ration coupons (in World War II) or thefixing of traffic tickets. The concept of “friends” had some peculiarsignificance to him. He watched their intentions like a hypochondriac watcheshis health—in a manner that projected a touchy suspiciousness and a fierceloyalty to some unwritten moral code.Politically, he tended to be a conservative, and was usually complaining aboutthis country’s trends. One day, he launched into a passionate denunciation ofthe liberals, the government, the unfairness to businessmen, the arbitrary powerof political machines. “Do you know how powerful they are?” he asked bitterly,and proceeded to tell me that he had tried to run for some minuscule cityoffice, but “they” had ordered him to withdraw his candidacy “or else,” and hehad complied.I said that such problems would always exist so long as government controlsexisted, and that the only solution was a system of full, laissez-fairecapitalism, under which no groups could acquire economic privileges or specialpull, so that everyone would have to stand on his own. “That’s impossible!” hesnapped; his voice was peculiarly tense, abrupt, defensive, as if he wereslamming a mental door on some barely glimpsed fact; the voice conveyed fear. Idid not pursue the subject: I had grasped a psychological issue that was new tome.2. A well-known lady novelist once wrote an essay on the nature of fiction.Adopting an extreme Naturalist position, she declared: “The distinctive mark ofthe novel is its concern with the actual world, the world of fact . . .” And by“fact,” she meant the immediately available facts—“the empiric element inexperience.” “The novel does not permit occurrences outside the order ofnature—miracles. . . . You remember how in The Brothers Karamazov when FatherZossima dies, his faction (most of the sympathetic characters in the book)expects a miracle: that his body will stay sweet and fresh because he died ‘inthe odor of sanctity.’ But instead he begins to stink. The stink of FatherZossima is the natural, generic smell of the novel. By the same law, a novelcannot be laid in the future, since the future, until it happens, is outside theorder of nature . . .”She declared that “the novel’s characteristic tone is one of gossip andtittletattle. . . . Here is another criterion: if the breath of scandal has nottouched it, the book is not a novel. . . . The scandals of a village or aprovince, the scandals of a nation or of the high seas feed on facts and breedspeculation. But it is of the essence of a scandal that it be finite . . . It isimpossible, except for theologians, to conceive of a world-wide scandal or auniverse-wide scandal; the proof of this is the way people have settled down toliving with nuclear fission, radiation poisoning, hydrogen bombs, satellites,and space rockets.” Why facts of this kind should be regarded as the province oftheology, she did not explain. “Yet these ‘scandals,’ in the theological sense,of the large world and the universe have dwarfed the finite scandals of thevillage and the province . . .”She then proceeded to explain what she regards as “the dilemma of the novelist”:we forget or ignore the events of the modern world, “because their specialquality is to stagger belief.” But if we think of them, “our daily life becomesincredible to us. . . . The coexistence of the great world and us, whencontemplated, appears impossible.” From this, she drew a conclusion: since thenovelist is motivated by his love of truth, “ordinary common truth recognizableto everyone,” the novel is “of all forms the least adapted to encompass themodern world, whose leading characteristic is irreality. And that, so far as Ican understand, is why the novel is dying.”3. The following story was told to me by an American businessman. In his youth,he took a job as efficiency-expert adviser to the manager of a factory in SouthAmerica. The factory was using U.S. machines, but was getting only 45 percent ofthe machines’ potential productivity. Observing the low wage scale, he concludedthat the men were given no incentive to work—and suggested the introduction ofpay by piecework. The elderly manager told him, with a skeptical smile, thatthis would be futile, but agreed to try it.In the first three weeks of the new plan, productivity soared. In the fourthweek, no one showed up for work: virtually the entire labor force vanished—anddid not come back until a week later. Having earned a month’s wages in threeweeks, the workers saw no reason to work that extra week; they had no desire toearn more than they had been earning. No arguments could persuade them; the planwas discontinued.4. A professor of philosophy once invited me to address his class on ethics;they were studying the subject of “justice,” and he asked me to present theObjectivist view of justice. The format he proposed was a fifteen-minutepresentation, followed by a question period. I pointed out to him that it wouldbe very difficult to present, in fifteen minutes, the basis of the Objectivistethics and thus give the reasons for my definition of justice. “Oh, you don’thave to give the reasons,” he said, “just present your views.” (I did notcomply.)The circumstances and the people in these four examples are different; the typeof mentality they display is the same. This mentality is self-made, but manydifferent factors can contribute to its formation. These factors may be social,as in the case of the South American workers—or personal, as in the case of thelady novelist—or both, as in the case of the Midwestern businessman. As to theprofessor of philosophy, the modern trend of his profession is the factorresponsible for all the rest.These cases are examples of the anti-conceptual mentality.The main characteristic of this mentality is a special kind of passivity: notpassivity as such and not across-the-board, but passivity beyond a certainlimit—i.e., passivity in regard to the process of conceptualization and,therefore, in regard to fundamental principles. It is a mentality which decided,at a certain point of development, that it knows enough and does not care tolook further. What does it accept as “enough”? The immediately given, directlyperceivable concretes of its background—“the empiric element in experience.”To grasp and deal with such concretes, a human being needs a certain degree ofconceptual development, a process which the brain of an animal cannot perform.But after the initial feat of learning to speak, a child can counterfeit thisprocess, by memorization and imitation. The anti-conceptual mentality stops onthis level of development—on the first levels of abstractions, which identifyperceptual material consisting predominantly of physical objects—and does notchoose to take the next, crucial, fully volitional step: the higher levels ofabstraction from abstractions, which cannot be learned by imitation. (See mybook Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology.) Such a mind can grasp thescandals of a village or a province or (at secondhand) a nation; it cannot graspthe concepts of “world” or “universe”—or the fact that their events are not“scandals.”The anti-conceptual mentality takes most things as irreducible primaries andregards them as “self-evident.” It treats concepts as if they were (memorized)percepts; it treats abstractions as if they were perceptual concretes. To such amentality, everything is the given: the passage of time, the four seasons, theinstitution of marriage, the weather, the breeding of children, a flood, a fire,an earthquake, a revolution, a book are phenomena of the same order. Thedistinction between the metaphysical and the man-made is not merely unknown tothis mentality, it is incommunicable.The two cardinal questions, the prime movers of a human mind—“Why?” and “Whatfor?”—are alien to an anti-conceptual mentality. If asked, they elicit nothingbeyond the conventionally accepted answers. The answers are usually someequivalent of “Such is life” or “One is supposed to.” Whose life? Blank out.Supposed—by whom? Blank out.The absence of concern with the “Why?” eliminates the concept of causality andcuts off the past. The absence of concern with the “What for?” eliminateslong-range purpose and cuts off the future. Thus only the present is fully realto an anti-conceptual mentality. Something of the past remains with it, in theform of stagnant bits of a random chronicle, like a kind of small talk ofmemory, without goal or meaning. But the future is a blank; the future cannot begrasped perceptually.In this respect, paradoxically enough, the hidebound traditionalist and themodern college activist are two sides of the same psycho-epistemological coin.4[rand_9781101137703_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-4] The first seeks to escape the terrorof an unknowable future by seeking safety in the alleged wisdom of the past.(“What was good enough for my father, is good enough for me!”) The second seeksto escape the terror of an unintelligible past by screaming his way into anindefinable future. (“If it’s not good for my father, it’s not good enough forme!”) And, paradoxically enough, neither of them is able to live in thepresent—because man’s life span is a continuum whose only integrator is hisconceptual faculty.In the brain of an anti-conceptual person, the process of integration is largelyreplaced by a process of association. What his subconscious stores andautomatizes is not ideas, but an indiscriminate accumulation of sundryconcretes, random facts, and unidentified feelings, piled into unlabeled mentalfile folders. This works, up to a certain point—i.e., so long as such a persondeals with other persons whose folders are stuffed similarly, and thus no searchthrough the entire filing system is ever required. Within such limits, theperson can be active and willing to work hard—like the Midwestern businessman,who exercised a great deal of initiative and ingenuity, within the limits set byhis particular city district—like the lady novelist, who wrote many books,within the terms set by her college teachers—like the professor of philosophy,who spent his time analyzing results, without bothering about their causes.A person of this mentality may uphold some abstract principles or profess someintellectual convictions (without remembering where or how he picked them up).But if one asks him what he means by a given idea, he will not be able toanswer. If one asks him the reasons of his convictions, one will discover thathis convictions are a thin, fragile film floating over a vacuum, like an oilslick in empty space—and one will be shocked by the number of questions it hadnever occurred to him to ask.This kind of psycho-epistemology works so long as no part of it is challenged.But all hell breaks loose when it is—because what is threatened then is not aparticular idea, but that mind’s whole structure. The hell ranges from fear toresentment to stubborn evasion to hostility to panic to malice to hatred.The best illustration of an anti-conceptual mentality is a small incident in anovel published years ago, whose title, unfortunately, I do not remember. Acommonplace kind of blonde goes out on a date with a college boy; when she isasked later whether she had a good time, she answers: “No. He was awfullyboring. He never said anything I’d ever heard before.”The concrete-bound, anti-conceptual mentality can cope only with men who arebound by the same concretes—by the same kind of “finite” world. To thismentality, it means a world in which men do not have to deal with abstractprinciples: principles are replaced by memorized rules of behavior, which areaccepted uncritically as the given. What is “finite” in such a world is not itsextension, but the degree of mental effort required of its inhabitants. Whenthey say “finite,” they mean “perceptual.”Within the limits of their rules (which are usually called “traditions”), theinhabitants of such worlds are free to function—i.e., to deal with concreteswithout worrying about consequences, to deal with results without botheringabout causes, to deal with “facts” as discrete phenomena, unhampered by the“intangibles” of theory—and to feel safe. Safe from what? Consciously, theywould answer “Safe from outsiders.” Actually, the answer is: safe from thenecessity of dealing with fundamental principles (and, consequently, safe fromfull responsibility for one’s own life).It is the fundamentals of philosophy (particularly, of ethics) that ananti-conceptual person dreads above all else. To understand and to apply themrequires a long conceptual chain, which he has made his mind incapable ofholding beyond the first, rudimentary links. If his professed beliefs—i.e., therules and slogans of his group—are challenged, he feels his consciousnessdissolving in fog. Hence, his fear of outsiders. The word “outsiders,” to him,means the whole wide world beyond the confines of his village or town organg—the world of all those people who do not live by his “rules.” He does notknow why he feels that outsiders are a deadly threat to him and why they fillhim with helpless terror. The threat is not existential, butpsycho-epistemological: to deal with them requires that he rise above his“rules” to the level of abstract principles. He would die rather than attemptit.“Protection from outsiders” is the benefit he seeks in clinging to his group.What the group demands in return is obedience to its rules, which he is eager toobey: those rules are his protection—from the dreaded realm of abstract thought.By whom are those rules established? In theory, by tradition. In fact, by thosewho happen to be the leaders of his group; the way it stands in his mind is: bythose who know the mysteries he does not have to know.Thus, his survival depends on the substitution of men for ideas—and on thesubordination of the metaphysical to the man-made. The metaphysical is beyondhis grasp—laws of nature cannot be grasped perceptually—but man-made rules areabsolutes that protect him from the unknowable, psychologically andexistentially. The group comes to his rescue if he gets into trouble—and he doesnot have to earn their help, it is given to him automatically, it is not at theprecarious mercy of his own virtues, flaws or errors, it is his by grace of thefact that he belongs to the group.As an example of the principle that the rational is the moral, observe that theanti-conceptual is the profoundly anti-moral. The basic commandment of all suchgroups, which takes precedence over any other rules, is: loyalty to thegroup—not to ideas, but to people; not to the group’s beliefs, which are minimaland chiefly ritualistic, but to the group’s members and leaders. Whether a givenmember is right or wrong, the others must protect him from outsiders; whether heis innocent or guilty, the others must stand by him against outsiders; whetherhe is competent or not, the others must employ him or trade with him inpreference to outsiders. Thus a physical qualification—the accident of birth ina given village or tribe—takes precedence over morality and justice. (But thephysical is only the most frequently apparent and superficial qualification,since such groups reject the nonconforming children of their own members. Theactual qualification is psycho-epistemological: men bound by the sameconcretes.)Primitive tribes are an obvious example of the anti-conceptualmentality—perhaps, with some justification: savages, like children, are on thepreconceptual level of development. Their later counterparts, however,demonstrate that this mentality is not the product of ignorance (nor is itcaused by lack of intelligence): it is self-made, i.e., self-arrested. It hasresisted the rise of civilization and has manifested itself in countless formsthroughout history. Its symptom is always an attempt to circumvent reality bysubstituting men for ideas, the man-made for the metaphysical, favors forrights, special pull for merit—i.e., an attempt to reduce man’s life to a smallback-yard (or rat hole) exempt from the absolutism of reason. (The drivingmotive of these attempts is deeper than power-lust: the rulers of such groupsseek protection from reality as anxiously as the followers.)Racism is an obvious manifestation of the anti-conceptual mentality. So isxenophobia—the fear or hatred of foreigners (“outsiders”). So is any castesystem, which prescribes a man’s status (i.e., assigns him to a tribe) accordingto his birth; a caste system is perpetuated by a special kind of snobbishness(i.e., group loyalty) not merely among the aristocrats, but, perhaps morefiercely, among the commoners or even the serfs, who like to “know their place”and to guard it jealously against the outsiders from above or from below. So isguild socialism. So is any kind of ancestor worship or of family “solidarity”(the family including uncles, aunts and third cousins). So is any criminal gang.Tribalism (which is the best name to give to all the group manifestations of theanti-conceptual mentality) is a dominant element in Europe, as a reciprocallyreinforcing cause and result of Europe’s long history of caste systems, ofnational and local (provincial) chauvinism, of rule by brute force and endless,bloody wars. As an example, observe the Balkan nations, which are perenniallybent upon exterminating one another over minuscule differences of tradition orlanguage. Tribalism had no place in the United States—until recent decades. Itcould not take root here, its imported seedlings were withering away and turningto slag in the melting pot whose fire was fed by two inexhaustible sources ofenergy: individual rights and objective law; these two were the only protectionman needed.The remnants of European tribalism, imported by the more timid immigrants, tookthe innocuous form of “ethnic” neighborhoods in cities, each neighborhoodoffering its own customs, traditional festivals, old-country restaurants, andwords in its native language on battered store-signs. Those signs were battered,because the men who clung to the tribal rule of giving trade priorities tofellow-tribesmen, remained in the backwaters of impoverished neighborhoods,while the torrent of productive energy that placed merit above tribe, swept pastthem, carrying away the best of their children.There was no harm in such backwaters, so long as no one was forced to remain inthem. The pressure of enlightenment by example was undercutting the grouployalty of the most stubbornly anti-conceptual mentalities, urging them toventure out into the great world where no man is an “outsider” (or all men are,as far as special privileges are concerned).The disintegration of philosophy reversed this trend. Tribalism is a product offear, and fear is the dominant emotion of any person, culture or society thatrejects man’s power of survival: reason. As philosophy slithered into theprimitive swamp of irrationalism, men were driven—existentially andpsychologically—into its primordial corollary: tribalism. Existentially, therise of the welfare state broke up the country into pressure groups, eachfighting for special privileges at the expense of the others—so that anindividual unaffiliated with any group became fair game for tribal predators.Psychologically, Pragmatism lobotomized the country’s intellectuals: JohnDewey’s theory of “Progressive” education (which has dominated the schools forclose to half a century), established a method of crippling a child’s conceptualfaculty and replacing cognition with “social adjustment.” It was and is asystematic attempt to manufacture tribal mentalities. (See my article “TheComprachicos” in The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution.)Observe that today’s resurgence of tribalism is not a product of the lowerclasses—of the poor, the helpless, the ignorant—but of the intellectuals, thecollege-educated “elitists” (which is a purely tribalistic term). Observe theproliferation of grotesque herds or gangs—hippies, yippies, beatniks, peaceniks,Women’s Libs, Gay Libs, Jesus Freaks, Earth Children—which are not tribes, butshifting aggregates of people desperately seeking tribal “protection.”The common denominator of all such gangs is the belief in motion (massdemonstrations), not action—in chanting, not arguing—in demanding, notachieving—in feeling, not thinking—in denouncing “outsiders,” not in pursuingvalues—in focusing only on the “now,” the “today” without a “tomorrow”—inseeking to return to “nature,” to “the earth,” to the mud, to physical labor,i.e., to all the things which a perceptual mentality is able to handle. Youdon’t see advocates of reason and science clogging a street in the belief thatusing their bodies to stop traffic, will solve any problem.Most of those embryonic tribal gangs are leftist or collectivist. But as ademonstration of the fact that the cause of tribalism is deeper than politics,there are tribalists still further removed from reality, who claim to berightists. They are champions of individualism, they claim, which they define asthe right to form one’s own gang and use physical force against others—and theyintend to preserve capitalism, they claim, by replacing it with anarchism(establishing “private” or “competing” governments, i.e., tribal rule). Thecommon denominator of such individualists is the desire to escape fromobjectivity (objectivity requires a very long conceptual chain and very abstractprinciples), to act on whim, and to deal with men rather than with ideas—i.e.,with the men of their own gang bound by the same concretes.These rightists’ distance from reality may be gauged by the fact that they areunable to recognize the actual examples of their ideals in practice. One suchexample is the Mafia. The Mafia (or “family”) is a “private government,” withsubjects who chose to join it voluntarily, with a rigid set of rules rigidly,efficiently and bloodily enforced, a “government” that undertakes to protect youfrom “outsiders” and to enforce your immediate interests—at the price of yourselling your soul, i.e., of your total obedience to any “favor” it may demand.Another example of a “government” without territorial sovereignty is offered bythe Palestinian guerrillas, who have no country of their own, but who engage interroristic attacks and slaughter of “outsiders” anywhere on earth.The activist manifestations of modern tribalism, of Left or “Right,” are crudeextremes. It is the subtler manifestations of the anti-conceptual mentality thatare more tragic and harder to deal with. These are the “mixed economies” of thespirit—the men torn inwardly between tribal emotions and scattered fragments ofthought—the products of modern education who do not like the nature of what theyfeel, but have never learned to think.Since early childhood, their emotions have been conditioned by the tribalpremise that one must “belong,” one must be “in,” one must swim with the“mainstream,” one must follow the lead of “those who know.” A man’s frustratedmind adds another emotion to the tribal conditioning: a blindly bitterresentment of his own intellectual subservience. Modern men are gregarious andantisocial at the same time. They have no inkling of what constitutes a rationalhuman association.There is a crucial difference between an association and a tribe. Just as aproper society is ruled by laws, not by men, so a proper association is unitedby ideas, not by men, and its members are loyal to the ideas, not to the group.It is eminently reasonable that men should seek to associate with those whoshare their convictions and values. It is impossible to deal or even tocommunicate with men whose ideas are fundamentally opposed to one’s own (and oneshould be free not to deal with them). All proper associations are formed orjoined by individual choice and on conscious, intellectual grounds(philosophical, political, professional, etc.)—not by the physiological orgeographical accident of birth, and not on the ground of tradition. When men areunited by ideas, i.e., by explicit principles, there is no room for favors,whims, or arbitrary power: the principles serve as an objective criterion fordetermining actions and for judging men, whether leaders or members.This requires a high degree of conceptual development and independence, whichthe anti-conceptual mentality is desperately struggling to avoid. But this isthe only way men can work together justly, benevo-lently and safely. There is noway for men to survive on the perceptual level of consciousness.I am not a student of the theory of evolution and, therefore, I am neither itssupporter nor its opponent. But a certain hypothesis has haunted me for years; Iwant to stress that it is only a hypothesis. There is an enormous breach ofcontinuity between man and all the other living species. The difference lies inthe nature of man’s consciousness, in its distinctive characteristic: hisconceptual faculty. It is as if, after aeons of physiological development, theevolutionary process altered its course, and the higher stages of developmentfocused primarily on the consciousness of living species, not their bodies. Butthe development of a man’s consciousness is volitional: no matter what theinnate degree of his intelligence, he must develop it, he must learn how to useit, he must become a human being by choice. What if he does not choose to? Thenhe becomes a transitional phenomenon—a desperate creature that strugglesfrantically against his own nature, longing for the effortless “safety” of ananimal’s consciousness, which he cannot recapture, and rebelling against a humanconsciousness, which he is afraid to achieve.For years, scientists have been looking for a “missing link” between man andanimals. Perhaps that missing link is the anti-conceptual mentality."},{"pageContent":"5Selfishness Without a Self1974 In [“The Missing Link”], I discussed the anti-conceptual mentality and itssocial (tribal) manifestations. All tribalists are anti-conceptual in variousdegrees, but not all anti-conceptual mentalities are tribalists. Some are lonewolves (stressing that species’ most predatory characteristics).The majority of such wolves are frustrated tribalists, i.e., persons rejected bythe tribe (or by the people of their immediate environment): they are toounreliable to abide by conventional rules, and too crudely manipulative tocompete for tribal power. Since a perceptual mentality cannot provide a man witha way of survival, such a person, left to his own devices, becomes a kind ofintellectual hobo, roaming about as an eclectic second-hander or brainpicker,snatching bits of ideas at random, switching them at whim, with only oneconstant in his behavior: the drifting from group to group, the need to cling topeople, any sort of people, and to manipulate them.Whatever theoretical constructs he may be able to spin and juggle in variousfields, it is the field of ethics that fills him with the deepest sense ofterror and of his own impotence. Ethics is a conceptual discipline; loyalty to acode of values requires the ability to grasp abstract principles and to applythem to concrete situations and actions (even on the most primitive level ofpracticing some rudimentary moral commandments). The tribal lone wolf has nofirsthand grasp of values. He senses that this is a lack he must conceal at anyprice—and that this issue, for him, is the hardest one to fake. The whims thatguide him and switch from moment to moment or from year to year, cannot help himto conceive of an inner state of lifelong dedication to one’s chosen values. Hiswhims condition him to the opposite: they automatize his avoidance of anypermanent commitment to anything or anyone. Without personal values, a man canhave no sense of right or wrong. The tribal lone wolf is an amoralist all theway down.The clearest symptom by which one can recognize this type of person, is histotal inability to judge himself, his actions, or his work by any sort ofstandard. The normal pattern of self-appraisal requires a reference to someabstract value or virtue—e.g., “I am good because I am rational,” “I am goodbecause I am honest,” even the second-hander’s notion of “I am good becausepeople like me.” Regardless of whether the value-standards involved are true orfalse, these examples imply the recognition of an essential moral principle:that one’s own value has to be earned.The amoralist’s implicit pattern of self-appraisal (which he seldom identifiesor admits) is: “I am good because it’s me.”Beyond the age of about three to five (i.e., beyond the perceptual level ofmental development), this is not an expression of pride or self-esteem, but ofthe opposite: of a vacuum—of a stagnant, arrested mentality confessing itsimpotence to achieve any personal value or virtue.Do not confuse this pattern with psychological subjectivism. A psychologicalsubjectivist is unable fully to identify his values or to prove their objectivevalidity, but he may be profoundly consistent and loyal to them in practice(though with terrible psycho-epistemological difficulty). The amoralist does nothold subjective values; he does not hold any values. The implicit pattern of allhis estimates is: “It’s good because I like it”—“It’s right because I didit”—“It’s true because I want it to be true.” What is the “I” in thesestatements? A physical hulk driven by chronic anxiety.The frequently encountered examples of this pattern are: the writer who rehashessome ancient bromides and feels that his work is new, because he wrote it—thenon-objective artist who feels that his smears are superior to those made by amonkey’s tail, because he made them—the businessman who hires mediocritiesbecause he likes them—the political “idealist” who claims that racism is good ifpracticed by a minority (of his choice), but evil if practiced by a majority—andany advocate of any sort of double standard.But even such shoddy substitutes for morality are only a pretense: the amoralistdoes not believe that “I am good because it’s me.” That implicit policy is hisprotection against his deepest, never-to-be-identified conviction: “I am no goodthrough and through.”Love is a response to values. The amoralist’s actual self-appraisal is revealedin his abnormal need to be loved (but not in the rational sense of the word)—tobe “loved for himself,” i.e., causelessly. James Taggart reveals the nature ofsuch a need: “I don’t want to be loved for anything. I want to be loved formyself—not for anything I do or have or say or think. For myself—not for my bodyor mind or words or works or actions.” (Atlas Shrugged.) When his wife asks:“But then . . . what is yourself?” he has no answer.As a real-life example: Years ago, I knew an older woman who was a writer andvery intelligent, but inclined toward mysticism, embittered, hostile, lonely,and very unhappy. Her views of love and friendship were similar to JamesTaggart’s. At the time of the publication of The Fountainhead, I told her that Iwas very grateful to Archibald Ogden, the editor who had threatened to resign ifhis employers did not publish it. She listened with a peculiar kind of skepticalor disapproving look, then said: “You don’t have to feel grateful to him. He didnot do it for you. He did it to further his own career, because he thought itwas a good book.” I was truly appalled. I asked: “Do you mean that his actionwould be better—and that I should prefer it—if he thought it was a worthlessbook, but fought for its publication out of charity to me?” She would not answerand changed the subject. I was unable to get any explanation out of her. It tookme many years to begin to understand.A similar phenomenon, which had puzzled me for a long time, can be observed inpolitics. Commentators often exhort some politician to place the interests ofthe country above his own (or his party’s) and to compromise with hisopponents—and such exhortations are not addressed to petty grafters, but toreputable men. What does this mean? If the politician is convinced that hisideas are right, it is the country that he would betray by compromising. If heis convinced that his opponents’ ideas are wrong, it is the country that hewould be harming. If he is not certain of either, then he should check his viewsfor his own sake, not merely the country’s—because the truth or falsehood of hisideas should be of the utmost personal interest to him.But these considerations presuppose a conceptual consciousness that takes ideasseriously—i.e., that derives its views from principles derived from reality. Aperceptual consciousness is unable to believe that ideas can be of personalimportance to anyone; it regards ideas as a matter of arbitrary choice, as meansto some immediate ends. On this view, a man does not seek to be elected to apublic office in order to carry out certain policies—he advocates certainpolicies in order to be elected. If so, then why on earth should he want to beelected? Perceptual mentalities never ask such a question: the concept of along-range goal is outside their limits. (There are a great many politicians anda great many commentators of that type—and since that mentality is taken forgranted as proper and normal, what does this indicate about the intellectualstate of today’s culture?)If a man subordinates ideas and principles to his “personal interests,” what arehis personal interests and by what means does he determine them? Consider thesenseless, selfless drudgery to which a politician condemns himself if the goalof his work—the proper administration of the country—is of no personal interestto him (or a lawyer, if justice is of no personal interest to him; or a writer,if the objective value of his books is of no personal interest to him, as thewoman I quoted was suggesting). But a perceptual mentality is incapable ofgenerating values or goals, and has to pick them secondhand, as the given, thengo through the expected motions. (Not all such men are tribal lone wolves—someare faithful, bewildered tribalists out of their psycho-epistemologicaldepth—but all are anti-conceptual mentalities.)With all of his emphasis on “himself” (and on being “loved for himself”), thetribal lone wolf has no self and no personal interests, only momentary whims. Heis aware of his own immediate sensations and of very little else. Observe thatwhenever he ventures to speak of spiritual (i.e., intellectual) values—of thethings he personally loves or admires—one is shocked by the triteness, thevulgarity, the borrowed trashiness of what comes out of him.A tribal lone wolf feels that his “self” is dissociated from his actions, hiswork, his pursuits, his ideas. All these, he feels, are things that some outsidepower—society or reality or the material universe—has somehow forced on him. Hisreal “self,” he feels, is some ineffable entity devoid of attributes. One thingis true: his “self” is ineffable, i.e., non-existent. A man’s self is hismind—the faculty that perceives reality, forms judgments, chooses values. To atribal lone wolf, “reality” is a meaningless term; his metaphysics consists inthe chronic feeling that life, somehow, is a conspiracy of people and thingsagainst him, and he will walk over piles of corpses—in order to assert himself?no—in order to hide (or fill) the nagging inner vacuum left by his aborted self.The grim joke on mankind is the fact that he is held up as a symbol ofselfishness. This encourages him in his depredations: it gives him the hope ofsuccess in faking a stature he knows to be beyond his power. Selfishness is aprofoundly philosophical, conceptual achievement. Anyone who holds a tribal lonewolf as an image of selfishness, is merely confessing the perceptual nature ofhis own mental functioning.Yet the tribalists keep proclaiming that morality is an exclusively socialphenomenon and that adherence to a tribe—any tribe—is the only way to keep menmoral. But the docile members of a tribe are no better than their rejectedwolfish brother and fully as amoral: their standard is “We’re good because it’sus.”The abdication and shriveling of the self is a salient characteristic of allperceptual mentalities, tribalist or lone-wolfish. All of them dreadself-reliance; all of them dread the responsibilities which only a self (i.e., aconceptual consciousness) can perform, and they seek escape from the twoactivities which an actually selfish man would defend with his life: judgmentand choice. They fear reason (which is exercised volition-ally) and trust theiremotions (which are automatic)—they prefer relatives (an accident of birth) tofriends (a matter of choice)—they prefer the tribe (the given) to outsiders (thenew)—they prefer commandments (the memorized) to principles (theunderstood)—they welcome every theory of determinism, every notion that permitsthem to cry: “I couldn’t help it!”It is obvious why the morality of altruism is a tribal phenomenon. Prehistoricalmen were physically unable to survive without clinging to a tribe for leadershipand protection against other tribes. The cause of altruism’s perpetuation intocivilized eras is not physical, but psycho-epistemological: the men ofself-arrested, perceptual mentality are unable to survive without triballeadership and “protection” against reality. The doctrine of self-sacrifice doesnot offend them: they have no sense of self or of personal value—they do notknow what it is that they are asked to sacrifice—they have no firsthand inklingof such things as intellectual integrity, love of truth, personally chosenvalues, or a passionate dedication to an idea. When they hear injunctionsagainst “selfishness,” they believe that what they must renounce is the brute,mindless whim-worship of a tribal lone wolf. But their leaders—the theoreticiansof altruism—know better. Immanuel Kant knew it; John Dewey knew it; B. F.Skinner knows it; John Rawls knows it. Observe that it is not the mindlessbrute, but reason, intelligence, ability, merit, self-confidence, self-esteemthat they are out to destroy.Today, we are seeing a ghastly spectacle: a magnificent scientific civilizationdominated by the morality of prehistorical savagery. The phenomenon that makesit possible is the split psycho-epistemology of “com-partmentalized” minds. Itsbest example are men who escape into the physical sciences (or technology orindustry or business), hoping to find protection from human irrationality, andabandoning the field of ideas to the enemies of reason. Such refugees includesome of mankind’s best brains. But no such refuge is possible. These men, whoperform feats of conceptual integration and rational thinking in their work,become helplessly anti-conceptual in all the other aspects of their lives,particularly in human relationships and in social issues. (E.g., compareEinstein’s scientific achievement to his political views.)Man’s progress requires specialization. But a division-of-labor society cannotsurvive without a rational philosophy—without a firm base of fundamentalprinciples whose task is to train a human mind to be human, i.e., conceptual."},{"pageContent":"6An Open Letter to Boris Spassky1974 Dear Comrade Spassky:I have been watching with great interest your world chess championship matchwith Bobby Fischer. I am not a chess enthusiast or even a player, and know onlythe rudiments of the game. I am a novelist-philosopher by profession.But I watched some of your games, reproduced play by play on television, andfound them to be a fascinating demonstration of the enormous complexity ofthought and planning required of a chess player—a demonstration of how manyconsiderations he has to bear in mind, how many factors to integrate, how manycontingencies to be prepared for, how far ahead to see and plan. It was obviousthat you and your opponent had to have an unusual intellectual capacity.Then I was struck by the realization that the game itself and the players’exercise of mental virtuosity are made possible by the metaphysical absolutismof the reality with which they deal. The game is ruled by the Law of Identityand its corollary, the Law of Causality. Each piece is what it is: a queen is aqueen, a bishop is a bishop—and the actions each can perform are determined byits nature: a queen can move any distance in any open line, straight ordiagonal, a bishop cannot; a rook can move from one side of the board to theother, a pawn cannot; etc. Their identities and the rules of their movements areimmutable—and this enables the player’s mind to devise a complex, long-rangestrategy, so that the game depends on nothing but the power of his (and hisopponent’s) ingenuity.This led me to some questions that I should like to ask you.1. Would you be able to play if, at a crucial moment—when, after hours ofbrain-wrenching effort, you had succeeded in cornering your opponent—an unknown,arbitrary power suddenly changed the rules of the game in his favor, allowing,say, his bishops to move like queens? You would not be able to continue? Yet outin the living world, this is the law of your country—and this is the conditionin which your countrymen are expected, not to play, but to live.2. Would you be able to play if the rules of chess were updated to conform to adialectic reality, in which opposites merge—so that, at a crucial moment, yourqueen turned suddenly from White to Black, becoming the queen of your opponent,and then turned Gray, belonging to both of you? You would not be able tocontinue? Yet in the living world, this is the view of reality your countrymenare taught to accept, to absorb, and to live by.3. Would you be able to play if you had to play by teamwork—i.e., if you wereforbidden to think or act alone and had to play not with a group of advisers,but with a team that determined your every move by vote? Since, as champion, youwould be the best mind among them, how much time and effort would you have tospend persuading the team that your strategy is the best? Would you be likely tosucceed? And what would you do if some pragmatist, range-of-the-momentmentalities voted to grab an opponent’s knight at the price of a checkmate toyou three moves later? You would not be able to continue? Yet in the livingworld, this is the theoretical ideal of your country, and this is the method bywhich it proposes to deal (someday) with scientific research, industrialproduction, and every other kind of activity required for man’s survival.4. Would you be able to play if the cumbersome mechanism of teamwork werestreamlined, and your moves were dictated simply by a man standing behind you,with a gun pressed to your back—a man who would not explain or argue, his gunbeing his only argument and sole qualification? You would not be able to start,let alone continue, playing? Yet in the living world, this is the practicalpolicy under which men live—and die—in your country.5. Would you be able to play—or to enjoy the professional understanding,interest and acclaim of an international Chess Federation—if the rules of thegame were splintered, and you played by “proletarian” rules while your opponentplayed by “bourgeois” rules? Would you say that such “polyrulism” is morepreposterous than polylogism? Yet in the living world, your country professes toseek global harmony and understanding, while proclaiming that she follows“proletarian” logic and that others follow “bourgeois” logic, or “Aryan” logic,or “third-world” logic, etc.6. Would you be able to play if the rules of the game remained as they are atpresent, with one exception: that the pawns were declared to be the mostvaluable and non-expendable pieces (since they may symbolize the masses) whichhad to be protected at the price of sacrificing the more efficacious pieces (theindividuals)? You might claim a draw on the answer to this one—since it is notonly your country, but the whole living world that accepts this sort of rule inmorality.7. Would you care to play, if the rules of the game remained unchanged, but thedistribution of rewards were altered in accordance with egalitarian principles:if the prizes, the honors, the fame were given not to the winner, but to theloser—if winning were regarded as a symptom of selfishness, and the winner werepenalized for the crime of possessing a superior intelligence, the penaltyconsisting in suspension for a year, in order to give others a chance? Would youand your opponent try playing not to win, but to lose? What would this do toyour mind?You do not have to answer me, Comrade. You are not free to speak or even tothink of such questions—and I know the answers. No, you would not be able toplay under any of the conditions listed above. It is to escape this category ofphenomena that you fled into the world of chess.Oh yes, Comrade, chess is an escape—an escape from reality. It is an “out,” akind of “make-work” for a man of higher than average intelligence who was afraidto live, but could not leave his mind unemployed and devoted it to aplacebo—thus surrendering to others the living world he had rejected as too hardto understand.Please do not take this to mean that I object to games as such: games are animportant part of man’s life, they provide a necessary rest, and chess may do sofor men who live under the constant pressure of purposeful work. Besides, somegames—such as sports contests, for instance—offer us an opportunity to seecertain human skills developed to a level of perfection. But what would youthink of a world champion runner who, in real life, moved about in a wheelchair?Or of a champion high jumper who crawled about on all fours? You, the chessprofessionals, are taken as exponents of the most precious of human skills:intellectual power—yet that power deserts you beyond the confines of thesixty-four squares of a chessboard, leaving you confused, anxious, andhelplessly unfocused. Because, you see, the chessboard is not a training ground,but a substitute for reality.A gifted, precocious youth often finds himself bewildered by the world: it ispeople that he cannot understand, it is their inexplicable, contradictory, messybehavior that frightens him. The enemy he rightly senses, but does not choose tofight, is human irrationality. He withdraws, gives up, and runs, looking forsome sanctuary where his mind would be appreciated—and he falls into the boobytrap of chess.You, the chess professionals, live in a special world—a safe, protected, orderlyworld, in which all the great, fundamental principles of existence are so firmlyestablished and obeyed that you do not even have to be aware of them. (They arethe principles involved in my seven questions.) You do not know that theseprinciples are the preconditions of your game—and you do not have to recognizethem when you encounter them, or their breach, in reality. In your world, you donot have to be concerned with them: all you have to do is think.The process of thinking is man’s basic means of survival. The pleasure ofperforming this process successfully—of experiencing the efficacy of one’s ownmind—is the most profound pleasure possible to men, and it is their deepestneed, on any level of intelligence, great or small. So one can understand whatattracts you to chess: you believe that you have found a world in which allirrelevant obstacles have been eliminated, and nothing matters, but the pure,triumphant exercise of your mind’s powers. But have you, Comrade?Unlike algebra, chess does not represent the abstraction—the basic pattern—ofmental effort; it represents the opposite: it focuses mental effort on a set ofconcretes, and demands such complex calculations that a mind has no room foranything else. By creating an illusion of action and struggle, chess reduces theprofessional player’s mind to an uncritical, unvaluing passivity toward life.Chess removes the motor of intellectual effort—the question “What for?”—andleaves a somewhat frightening phenomenon: intellectual effort devoid of purpose.If—for any number of reasons, psychological or existential—a man comes tobelieve that the living world is closed to him, that he has nothing to seek orto achieve, that no action is possible, then chess becomes his antidote, themeans of drugging his own rebellious mind that refuses fully to believe it andto stand still. This, Comrade, is the reason why chess has always been sopopular in your country, before and since its present regime—and why there havenot been many American masters. You see, in this country, men are still free toact.Because the rulers of your country have proclaimed this championship match to bean ideological issue, a contest between Russia and America, I am rooting forBobby to win—and so are all my friends. The reason why this match has aroused anunprecedented interest in our country is the longstanding frustration andindignation of the American people at your country’s policy of attacks,provocations, and hooligan insolence—and at our own government’s overtolerant,overcourteous patience. There is a widespread desire in our country to seeSoviet Russia beaten in any way, shape or form, and—since we are all sick andtired of the global clashes among the faceless, anonymous masses ofcollectives—the almost medieval drama of two individual knights fighting thebattle of good against evil, appeals to us symbolically. (But this, of course,is only a symbol; you are not necessarily the voluntary defender of evil—for allwe know, you might be as much its victim as the rest of the world.)Bobby Fischer’s behavior, however, mars the symbolism—but it is a clear exampleof the clash between a chess expert’s mind, and reality. This confident,disciplined, obviously brilliant player falls to pieces when he has to deal withthe real world. He throws tantrums like a child, breaks agreements, makesarbitrary demands, and indulges in the kind of whim worship one touch of whichin the playing of chess would disqualify him for a high-school tournament. Thushe brings to the real world the very evil that made him escape it:irrationality. A man who is afraid to sign a letter, who fears any firmcommitment, who seeks the guidance of the arbitrary edicts of a mystic sect inorder to learn how to live his life—is not a great, confident mind, but atragically helpless victim, torn by acute anxiety and, perhaps, by a sense oftreason to what might have been a great potential.But, you may wish to say, the principles of reason are not applicable beyond thelimit of a chessboard, they are merely a human invention, they are impotentagainst the chaos outside, they have no chance in the real world. If this weretrue, none of us would have survived nor even been born, because the humanspecies would have perished long ago. If, under irrational rules, like the onesI listed above, men could not even play a game, how could they live? It is notreason, but irrationality that is a human invention—or, rather, a default.Nature (reality) is just as absolutist as chess, and her rules (laws) are justas immutable (more so)—but her rules and their applications are much, much morecomplex, and have to be discovered by man. And just as a man may memorize therules of chess, but has to use his own mind in order to apply them, i.e., inorder to play well—so each man has to use his own mind in order to apply therules of nature, i.e., in order to live successfully. A long time ago, thegrandmaster of all grandmasters gave us the basic principles of the method bywhich one discovers the rules of nature and of life. His name was Aristotle.Would you have wanted to escape into chess, if you lived in a society based onAristotelian principles? It would be a country where the rules were objective,firm and clear, where you could use the power of your mind to its fullestextent, on any scale you wished, where you would gain rewards for yourachievements, and men who chose to be irrational would not have the power tostop you nor to harm anyone but themselves. Such a social system could not bedevised, you say? But it was devised, and it came close to full existence—only,the mentalities whose level was playing jacks or craps, the men with the gunsand their witch doctors, did not want mankind to know it. It was calledCapitalism.But on this issue, Comrade, you may claim a draw: your country does not know themeaning of that word—and, today, most people in our country do not know it,either.Sincerely, AYN RAND"},{"pageContent":"7Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World1960(A lecture delivered at Yale University on February 17, 1960; at BrooklynCollege on April 4, 1960; and at Columbia University on May 5, 1960.)If you want me to name in one sentence what is wrong with the modern world, Iwill say that never before has the world been clamoring so desperately foranswers to crucial problems—and never before has the world been so franticallycommitted to the belief that no answers are possible.Observe the peculiar nature of this contradiction and the peculiar emotionalatmosphere of our age. There have been periods in history when men failed tofind answers because they evaded the existence of the problems, pretended thatnothing threatened them and denounced anyone who spoke of approaching disaster.This is not the predominant attitude of our age. Today, the voices proclaimingdisaster are so fashionable a bromide that people are battered into apathy bytheir monotonous insistence; but the anxiety under that apathy is real.Consciously or subconsciously, intellectually or emotionally, most people todayknow that the world is in a terrible state and that it cannot continue on itspresent course much longer.The existence of the problems is acknowledged, yet we hear nothing butmeaningless generalities and shameful evasions from our so-called intellectualleaders. Wherever you look—whether in philosophical publications, orintellectual magazines, or newspaper editorials or political speeches of eitherparty—you find the same mental attitude, made of two characteristics: stalenessand superficiality. People seem to insist on talking—and on carefully sayingnothing. The eva-siveness, the dullness, the gray conformity of today’sintellectual expressions sound like the voices of men under censorship—where nocensorship exists. Never before has there been an age characterized by such agrotesque combination of qualities as despair and boredom.You might say that this is the honest exhaustion of men who have done their bestin the struggle to find answers, and have failed. But the dignity of an honestlyhelpless resignation is certainly not the emotional atmosphere of our age. Anhonest resignation would not be served or expressed by repeating the sameworn-out bromides over and over again, while going through the motions of aquest. A man who is honestly convinced that he can find no answers, would notfeel the need to pretend that he is looking for them.You might say that the explanation lies in our modern cynicism and that peoplefail to find answers because they really don’t care. It is true that people arecynical today, but this is merely a symptom, not a cause. Today’s cynicism has aspecial twist: we are dealing with cynics who do care—and the ugly secret of ourage lies in that which they do care about, that which they are seeking.The truth about the intellectual state of the modern world, the characteristicpeculiar to the twentieth century, which distinguishes it from other periods ofcultural crises, is the fact that what people are seeking is not the answers toproblems, but the reassurance that no answers are possible.A friend of mine once said that today’s attitude, paraphrasing the Bible, is:“Forgive me, Father, for I know not what I’m doing—and please don’t tell me.”Observe how noisily the modern intellectuals are seeking solutions forproblems—and how swiftly they blank out the existence of any theory or idea,past or present, that offers the lead to a solution. Observe that these modernrelativists—with their credo of intellectual tolerance, of the open mind, of theanti-absolute—turn into howling dogmatists to denounce anyone who claims topossess knowledge. Observe that they tolerate anything, except certainty—andapprove of anything, except values. Observe that they profess to love mankind,and drool with sympathy over any literary study of murderers, dipsomaniacs, drugaddicts and psychotics, over any presentation of their loved object’sdepravity—and scream with anger when anyone dares to claim that man is notdepraved. Observe that they profess to be moved by compassion for humansuffering—and close their ears indignantly to any suggestion that man does nothave to suffer.What you see around you today, among modern intellectuals, is the grotesquespectacle of such attributes as militant uncertainty, crusading cynicism,dogmatic agnosticism, boastful self-abasement and self-righteous depravity. Thetwo absolutes of today’s non-absolutists are that ignorance consists of claimingknowledge, and that immorality consists of pronouncing moral judgments.Now why would people want to cling to the conviction that doom, darkness,depravity and ultimate disaster are inevitable? Well, psychologists will tellyou that when a man suffers from neurotic anxiety, he seizes upon anyrationalization available to explain his fear to himself, and he clings to thatrationalization in defiance of logic, reason, reality or any argument assuringhim that the danger can be averted. He does not want it to be averted becausethe rationalization serves as a screen to hide from himself the real cause ofhis fear, the cause he does not dare to face.Ladies and gentlemen, what you are seeing today is the neurotic anxiety of anentire culture. People do not want to find any answers to avert their danger:all they want, all they’re looking for, is only some excuse to yell: “I couldn’thelp it!”If certain centuries are to be identified by their dominant characteristics,like the Age of Reason or the Age of Enlightenment, then ours is the Age ofGuilt.What is it that people dread—and what do they feel guilty of?They dread the unadmitted knowledge that their culture is bankrupt. They feelguilty, because they know that they have brought it to bankruptcy and that theylack the courage to make a fresh start.They dread the knowledge that they have reached the dead end of the traditionalevasions of the centuries behind them, that the contradictions of Westerncivilization have caught up with them, that no compromises ormiddle-of-the-roads will work any longer and that the responsibility ofresolving those contradictions by making a fundamental choice is theirs, now,today. They are temporizing, in order to evade the fact that we have to checkour basic premises, or pay the price of all unresolved contradictions, which is:destruction.The three values which men had held for centuries and which have now collapsedare: mysticism, collectivism, altruism. Mysticism—as a cultural power—died atthe time of the Renaissance. Collectivism—as a political ideal—died in World WarII. As to altruism—it has never been alive. It is the poison of death in theblood of Western civilization, and men survived it only to the extent to whichthey neither believed nor practiced it. But it has caught up with them—and thatis the killer which they now have to face and to defeat. That is the basicchoice they have to make. If any civilization is to survive, it is the moralityof altruism that men have to reject.Some of you will recognize my next sentences. Yes, this is an age of moralcrisis. Yes, you are bearing punishment for your evil. Your moral code hasreached its climax, the blind alley at the end of its course. And if you wish togo on living, what you now need is not to return to morality, but to discoverit.What is morality? It is a code of values to guide man’s choices and actions—thechoices which determine the purpose and the course of his life. It is a code bymeans of which he judges what is right or wrong, good or evil.What is the moral code of altruism? The basic principle of altruism is that manhas no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the onlyjustification of his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moralduty, virtue and value.Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights ofothers. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruismmakes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute, isself-sacrifice—which means: self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial,self-destruction—which means: the self as a standard of evil, the selfless as astandard of the good.Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should notgive a dime to a beggar. That is not the issue. The issue is whether you do ordo not have the right to exist without giving him that dime. The issue iswhether you must keep buying your life, dime by dime, from any beggar who mightchoose to approach you. The issue is whether the need of others is the firstmortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence. The issue iswhether man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal. Any man of self-esteemwill answer: “No.” Altruism says: “Yes.”Now there is one word—a single word—which can blast the morality of altruism outof existence and which it cannot withstand—the word: “Why?” Why must man livefor the sake of others? Why must he be a sacrificial animal? Why is that thegood? There is no earthly reason for it—and, ladies and gentlemen, in the wholehistory of philosophy no earthly reason has ever been given.It is only mysticism that can permit moralists to get away with it. It wasmysticism, the unearthly, the supernatural, the irrational that has always beencalled upon to justify it—or, to be exact, to escape the necessity ofjustification. One does not justify the irrational, one just takes it on faith.What most moralists—and few of their victims—realize is that reason and altruismare incompatible. And this is the basic contradiction of Western civilization:reason versus altruism. This is the conflict that had to explode sooner orlater.The real conflict, of course, is reason versus mysticism. But if it weren’t forthe altruist morality, mysticism would have died when it did die—at theRenaissance—leaving no vampire to haunt Western culture. A “vampire” is supposedto be a dead creature that comes out of its grave only at night—only in thedarkness—and drains the blood of the living. The description, applied toaltruism, is exact.Western civilization was the child and product of reason—via ancient Greece. Inall other civilizations, reason has always been the menial servant—thehandmaiden—of mysticism. You may observe the results. It is only Western culturethat has ever been dominated—imperfectly, incompletely, precariously and at rareintervals—but still, dominated by reason. You may observe the results of that.The conflict of reason versus mysticism is the issue of life or death—of freedomor slavery—of progress or stagnant brutality. Or, to put it another way, it isthe conflict of consciousness versus unconsciousness.Let us define our terms. What is reason? Reason is the faculty which perceives,identifies and integrates the material provided by man’s senses. Reasonintegrates man’s perceptions by means of forming abstractions or conceptions,thus raising man’s knowledge from the perceptual level, which he shares withanimals, to the conceptual level, which he alone can reach. The method whichreason employs in this process is logic—and logic is the art ofnon-contradictory identification.What is mysticism? Mysticism is the acceptance of allegations without evidenceor proof, either apart from or against the evidence of one’s senses and one’sreason. Mysticism is the claim to some non-sensory, non-rational, non-definable,non-identifiable means of knowledge, such as “instinct,” “intuition,”“revelation,” or any form of “just knowing.”Reason is the perception of reality, and rests on a single axiom: the Law ofIdentity.Mysticism is the claim to the perception of some other reality—other than theone in which we live— whose definition is only that it is not natural, it issupernatural, and is to be perceived by some form of unnatural or supernaturalmeans.You realize, of course, that epistemology—the theory of knowledge—is the mostcomplex branch of philosophy, which cannot be covered exhaustively in a singlelecture. So I will not attempt to cover it. I will say only that those who wisha fuller discussion will find it in Atlas Shrugged. For the purposes oftonight’s discussion, the definitions I have given you contain the essence ofthe issue, regardless of whose theory, argument or philosophy you choose toaccept.I will repeat: Reason is the faculty which perceives, identifies and integratesthe material provided by man’s senses. Mysticism is the claim to a non-sensorymeans of knowledge.In Western civilization, the period ruled by mysticism is known as the Dark Agesand the Middle Ages. I will assume that you know the nature of that period andthe state of human existence in those ages. The Renaissance broke the rule ofthe mystics. “Renais-sance” means “rebirth.” Few people today will care toremind you that it was a rebirth of reason—of man’s mind.In the light of what followed—most particularly, in the light of the industrialrevolution—nobody can now take faith, or religion, or revelation, or any form ofmysticism as his basic and exclusive guide to existence, not in the way it wastaken in the Middle Ages. This does not mean that the Renaissance hasautomatically converted everybody to rationality; far from it. It means onlythat so long as a single automobile, a single skyscraper or a single copy ofAristotle’s Logic remains in existence, nobody will be able to arouse men’shope, eagerness and joyous enthusiasm by telling them to ditch their mind andrely on mystic faith. This is why I said that mysticism, as a cultural power, isdead. Observe that in the attempts at a mystic revival today, it is not anappeal to life, hope and joy that the mystics are making, but an appeal to fear,doom and despair. “Give up, your mind is impotent, life is only a foxhole,” isnot a motto that can revive a culture.Now, if you ask me to name the man most responsible for the present state of theworld, the man whose influence has almost succeeded in destroying theachievements of the Renaissance—I will name Immanuel Kant. He was thephilosopher who saved the morality of altruism, and who knew that what it had tobe saved from was—reason.This is not a mere hypothesis. It is a known historical fact that Kant’sinterest and purpose in philosophy was to save the morality of altruism, whichcould not survive without a mystic base. His metaphysics and his epistemologywere devised for that purpose. He did not, of course, announce himself as amystic—few of them have, since the Renaissance. He announced himself as achampion of reason—of “pure” reason.There are two ways to destroy the power of a concept: one, by an open attack inopen discussion—the other, by subversion, from the inside; that is: bysubverting the meaning of the concept, setting up a straw man and then refutingit. Kant did the second. He did not attack reason—he merely constructed such aversion of what is reason that it made mysticism look like plain, rationalcommon sense by comparison. He did not deny the validity of reason—he merelyclaimed that reason is “limited,” that it leads us to impossible contradictions,that everything we perceive is an illusion and that we can never perceivereality or “things as they are.” He claimed, in effect, that the things weperceive are not real, because we perceive them.A “straw man” is an odd metaphor to apply to such an enormous, cumbersome,ponderous construction as Kant’s system of epistemology. Nevertheless, a strawman is what it was—and the doubts, the uncertainty, the skepticism thatfollowed, skepticism about man’s ability ever to know anything, were not, infact, applicable to human consciousness, because it was not a humanconsciousness that Kant’s robot represented. But philosophers accepted it assuch. And while they cried that reason had been invalidated, they did not noticethat reason had been pushed off the philosophical scene altogether and that thefaculty they were arguing about was not reason.No, Kant did not destroy reason; he merely did as thorough a job of undercuttingas anyone could ever do.If you trace the roots of all our current philosophies—such as Pragmatism,Logical Positivism, and all the rest of the neo-mystics who announce happilythat you cannot prove that you exist—you will find that they all grew out ofKant.As to Kant’s version of the altruist morality, he claimed that it was derivedfrom “pure reason,” not from revelation—except that it rested on a specialinstinct for duty, a “categorical imperative” which one “just knows.” Hisversion of morality makes the Christian one sound like a healthy, cheerful,benevolent code of selfishness. Christianity merely told man to love hisneighbor as himself; that’s not exactly rational—but at least it does not forbidman to love himself. What Kant propounded was full, total, abject selflessness:he held that an action is moral only if you perform it out of a sense of dutyand derive no benefit from it of any kind, neither material nor spiritual; ifyou derive any benefit, your action is not moral any longer. This is theultimate form of demanding that man turn himself into a “shmoo”—the mysticlittle animal of the Li’l Abner comic strip, that went around seeking to beeaten by somebody.It is Kant’s version of altruism that is generally accepted today, notpracticed—who can practice it?—but guiltily accepted. It is Kant’s version ofaltruism that people, who have never heard of Kant, profess when they equateself-interest with evil. It is Kant’s version of altruism that’s workingwhenever people are afraid to admit the pursuit of any personal pleasure or gainor motive—whenever men are afraid to confess that they are seeking their ownhappiness—whenever businessmen are afraid to say that they are makingprofits—whenever the victims of an advancing dictatorship are afraid to asserttheir “selfish” rights.The ultimate monument to Kant and to the whole altruist morality is SovietRussia.If you want to prove to yourself the power of ideas and, particularly, ofmorality—the intellectual history of the nineteenth century would be a goodexample to study. The greatest, unprecedented, undreamed of events andachievements were taking place before men’s eyes—but men did not see them anddid not understand their meaning, as they do not understand it to this day. I amspeaking of the industrial revolution, of the United States and of capitalism.For the first time in history, men gained control over physical nature and threwoff the control of men over men—that is: men discovered science and politicalfreedom. The creative energy, the abundance, the wealth, the rising standard ofliving for every level of the population were such that the nineteenth centurylooks like a fiction-Utopia, like a blinding burst of sunlight, in the drabprogression of most of human history. If life on earth is one’s standard ofvalue, then the nineteenth century moved mankind forward more than all the othercenturies combined.Did anyone appreciate it? Does anyone appreciate it now? Has anyone identifiedthe causes of that historical miracle?They did not and have not. What blinded them? The morality of altruism.Let me explain this. There are, fundamentally, only two causes of the progressof the nineteenth century—the same two causes which you will find at the root ofany happy, benevolent, progressive era in human history. One cause ispsychological, the other existential—or: one pertains to man’s consciousness,the other to the physical conditions of his existence. The first is reason, thesecond is freedom. And when I say “freedom,” I do not mean poetic sloppiness,such as “freedom from want” or “freedom from fear” or “freedom from thenecessity of earning a living.” I mean “freedom from compulson—freedom from ruleby physical force.” Which means: political freedom.These two—reason and freedom—are corollaries, and their relationship isreciprocal: when men are rational, freedom wins; when men are free, reason wins.Their antagonists are: faith and force. These, also, are corollaries: everyperiod of history dominated by mysticism, was a period of statism, ofdictatorship, of tyranny. Look at the Middle Ages—and look at the politicalsystems of today.The nineteenth century was the ultimate product and expression of theintellectual trend of the Renaissance and the Age of Reason, which means: of apredominantly Aristotelian philosophy. And, for the first time in history, itcreated a new economic system, the necessary corollary of political freedom, asystem of free trade on a free market: capitalism.No, it was not a full, perfect, unregulated, totally laissez-faire capitalism—asit should have been. Various degrees of government interference and controlstill remained, even in America—and this is what led to the eventual destructionof capitalism. But the extent to which certain countries were free was the exactextent of their economic progress. America, the freest, achieved the most.Never mind the low wages and the harsh living conditions of the early years ofcapitalism. They were all that the national economies of the time could afford.Capitalism did not create poverty—it inherited it. Compared to the centuries ofprecapitalist starvation, the living conditions of the poor in the early yearsof capitalism were the first chance the poor had ever had to survive. Asproof—the enormous growth of the European population during the nineteenthcentury, a growth of over 300 percent, as compared to the previous growth ofsomething like 3 percent per century.Now why was this not appreciated? Why did capitalism, the truly magnificentbenefactor of mankind, arouse nothing but resentment, denunciations and hatred,then and now? Why did the so-called defenders of capitalism keep apologizing forit, then and now? Because, ladies and gentlemen, capitalism and altruism areincompatible.Make no mistake about it—and tell it to your Republican friends: capitalism andaltruism cannot coexist in the same man or in the same society.Tell it to anyone who attempts to justify capitalism on the ground of the“public good” or the “general welfare” or “service to society” or the benefit itbrings to the poor. All these things are true, but they are the by-products, thesecondary consequences of capitalism—not its goal, purpose or moraljustification. The moral justification of capitalism is man’s right to exist forhis own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others tohimself; it is the recognition that man—every man—is an end in himself, not ameans to the ends of others, not a sacrificial animal serving anyone’s need.This is implicit in the function of capitalism, but, until now, it has neverbeen stated explicitly, in moral terms. Why not? Because this is the base of amorality diametrically opposed to the morality of altruism which, to this day,people are afraid to challenge.There is a tragic, twisted sort of compliment to mankind involved in this issue:in spite of all their irrationalities, inconsistencies, hypocrisies andevasions, the majority of men will not act, in major issues, without a sense ofbeing morally right and will not oppose the morality they have accepted. Theywill break it, they will cheat on it, but they will not oppose it; and when theybreak it, they take the blame on themselves. The power of morality is thegreatest of all intellectual powers—and mankind’s tragedy lies in the fact thatthe vicious moral code men have accepted destroys them by means of the bestwithin them.So long as altruism was their moral ideal, men had to regard capitalism asimmoral; capitalism certainly does not and cannot work on the principle ofselfless service and sacrifice. This was the reason why the majority of thenineteenth-century intellectuals regarded capitalism as a vulgar, uninspiring,materialistic necessity of this earth, and continued to long for their unearthlymoral ideal. From the start, while capitalism was creating the splendor of itsachievements, creating it in silence, unacknowledged and undefended (morallyundefended), the intellectuals were moving in greater and greater numberstowards a new dream: socialism.Just as a small illustration of how ineffectual a defense of capitalism wasoffered by its most famous advocates, let me mention that the Britishsocialists, the Fabians, were predominantly students and admirers of John StuartMill and Jeremy Bentham.The socialists had a certain kind of logic on their side: if the collectivesacrifice of all to all is the moral ideal, then they wanted to establish thisideal in practice, here and on this earth. The arguments that socialism wouldnot and could not work, did not stop them: neither has altruism ever worked, butthis has not caused men to stop and question it. Only reason can ask suchquestions—and reason, they were told on all sides, has nothing to do withmorality, morality lies outside the realm of reason, no rational morality canever be defined.The fallacies and contradictions in the economic theories of socialism wereexposed and refuted time and time again, in the nineteenth century as well astoday. This did not and does not stop anyone: it is not an issue of economics,but of morality. The intellectuals and the so-called idealists were determinedto make socialism work. How? By that magic means of all irrationalists: somehow.It was not the tycoons of big business, it was not the labor unions, it was notthe working classes, it was the intellectuals who reversed the trend towardpolitical freedom and revived the doctrines of the absolute State, oftotalitarian government rule, of the government’s right to control the lives ofthe citizens in any manner it pleases. This time, it was not in the name of the“divine right of kings,” but in the name of the divine right of the masses. Thebasic principle was the same: the right to enforce at the point of a gun themoral doctrines of whoever happens to seize control of the machinery ofgovernment.There are only two means by which men can deal with one another: guns or logic.Force or persuasion. Those who know that they cannot win by means of logic, havealways resorted to guns.Well, ladies and gentlemen, the socialists got their dream. They got it in thetwentieth century and they got it in triplicate, plus a great many lesser carboncopies; they got it in every possible form and variant, so that now there can beno mistake about its nature: Soviet Russia—Nazi Germany—Socialist England.This was the collapse of the modern intellectuals’ most cherished tradition. Itwas World War II that destroyed collectivism as a political ideal. Oh, yes,people still mouth its slogans, by routine, by social conformity and bydefault—but it is not a moral crusade any longer. It is an ugly, horrifyingreality—and part of the modern intellectuals’ guilt is the knowledge that theyhave created it. They have seen for themselves the bloody slaughterhouse whichthey had once greeted as a noble experiment—Soviet Russia. They have seen NaziGermany—and they know that “Nazi” means “National Socialism.” Perhaps the worstblow to them, the greatest disillusionment, was Socialist England: here wastheir literal dream, a bloodless socialism, where force was not used for murder,only for expropriation, where lives were not taken, only the products, themeaning and the future of lives, here was a country that had not been murdered,but had voted itself into suicide. Most of the modern intellectuals, even themore evasive ones, have now understood what socialism—or any form of politicaland economic collectivism—actually means.Today, their perfunctory advocacy of collectivism is as feeble, futile andevasive as the alleged conservatives’ defense of capitalism. The fire and themoral fervor have gone out of it. And when you hear the liberals mumble thatRussia is not really socialistic, or that it was all Stalin’s fault, or thatsocialism never had a real chance in England, or that what they advocate issomething that’s different somehow—you know that you are hearing the voices ofmen who haven’t a leg to stand on, men who are reduced to some vague hope that“somehow, my gang would have done it better.”The secret dread of modern intellectuals, liberals and conservatives alike, theunadmitted terror at the root of their anxiety, which all of their currentirrationalities are intended to stave off and to disguise, is the unstatedknowledge that Soviet Russia is the full, actual, literal, consistent embodimentof the morality of altruism, that Stalin did not corrupt a noble ideal, thatthis is the only way altruism has to be or can ever be practiced. If service andself-sacrifice are a moral ideal, and if the “selfishness” of human natureprevents men from leaping into sacrificial furnaces, there is no reason—noreason that a mystic moralist could name—why a dictator should not push them inat the point of bayonets—for their own good, or the good of humanity, or thegood of posterity, or the good of the latest bureaucrat’s latest five-year plan.There is no reason that they can name to oppose any atrocity. The value of aman’s life? His right to exist? His right to pursue his own happiness? These areconcepts that belong to individualism and capitalism—to the antithesis of thealtruist morality.Twenty years ago, the conservatives were uncertain, evasive, morally disarmedbefore the aggressive moral self-righteousness of the liberals. Today, both areuncertain, evasive, morally disarmed before the aggressiveness of thecommunists. It is not a moral aggressiveness any longer, it is the plainaggressiveness of a thug—but what disarms the modern intellectuals is the secretrealization that a thug is the inevitable, ultimate and only product of theircherished morality.I have said that faith and force are corollaries, and that mysticism will alwayslead to the rule of brutality. The cause of it is contained in the very natureof mysticism. Reason is the only objective means of communication and ofunderstanding among men; when men deal with one another by means of reason,reality is their objective standard and frame of reference. But when men claimto possess supernatural means of knowledge, no persuasion, communication orunderstanding are possible. Why do we kill wild animals in the jungle? Becauseno other way of dealing with them is open to us. And that is the state to whichmysticism reduces mankind—a state where, in case of disagreement, men have norecourse except to physical violence. And more: no man or mystical elite canhold a whole society subjugated to their arbitrary assertions, edicts and whims,without the use of force. Anyone who resorts to the formula: “It’s so, because Isay so,” will have to reach for a gun, sooner or later. Communists, like allmaterialists, are neo-mystics: it does not matter whether one rejects the mindin favor of revelations or in favor of conditioned reflexes. The basic premiseand the results are the same.Such is the nature of the evil which modern intellectuals have helped to letloose in the world—and such is the nature of their guilt.Now take a look at the state of the world. The signs and symptoms of the DarkAges are rising again all over the earth. Slave labor, executions without trial,torture chambers, concentration camps, mass slaughter—all the things which thecapitalism of the nineteenth century had abolished in the civilized world, arenow brought back by the rule of the neo-mystics.Look at the state of our intellectual life. In philosophy, the climax of theKantian version of reason has brought us to the point where allegedphilosophers, forgetting the existence of dictionaries and grammar primers, runaround studying such questions as: “What do we mean when we say ‘The cat is onthe mat’?”—while other philosophers proclaim that nouns are an illusion, butsuch terms as “if-then,” “but” and “or” have profound philosophicalsignificance—while still others toy with the idea of an “index of prohibitedwords” and desire to place on it such words as—Iquote—“entity—essence—mind—matter—reality—thing.”In psychology, one school holds that man, by nature, is a helpless,guilt-ridden, instinct-driven automaton—while another school objects that thisis not true, because there is no scientific evidence to prove that man isconscious.In literature, man is presented as a mindless cripple, inhabiting garbage cans.In art, people announce that they do not paint objects, they paint emotions. Inyouth movements—if that’s what it can be called—young men attract attention byopenly announcing that they are “beat.”The spirit of it all, both the cause of it and the final climax, is contained ina quotation which I am going to read to you. I will preface it by saying that inAtlas Shrugged I stated that the world is being destroyed by mysticism andaltruism, which are anti-man, anti-mind and anti-life. You have undoubtedlyheard me being accused of exaggeration. I shall now read to you an excerpt fromthe paper of a professor, published by an alumni faculty seminar of a prominentuniversity.“Perhaps in the future reason will cease to be important. Perhaps for guidancein time of trouble, people will turn not to human thought, but to the humancapacity for suffering. Not the universities with their thinkers, but the placesand people in distress, the inmates of asylums and concentration camps, thehelpless decision makers in bureaucracy and the helpless soldiers infoxholes—these will be the ones to lighten man’s way, to refashion his knowledgeof disaster into something creative. We may be entering a new age. Our heroesmay not be intellectual giants like Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein, but victimslike Anne Frank, who will show us a greater miracle than thought. They willteach us how to endure—how to create good in the midst of evil and how tonurture love in the presence of death. Should this happen, however, theuniversity will still have its place. Even the intellectual man can be anexample of creative suffering.”Observe that we are not to question “the helpless decision makers inbureaucracy”—we are not to discover that they are the cause of the concentrationcamps, of the foxholes and of victims like Anne Frank—we are not to help suchvictims, we are merely to feel suffering and to learn to suffer some more—wecan’t help it, the helpless bureaucrats can’t help it, nobody can help it—theinmates of asylums will guide us, not intellectual giants—suffering is thesupreme value, not reason.This, ladies and gentlemen, is cultural bankruptcy.Since “challenge” is your slogan, I will say that if you are looking for achallenge, you are facing the greatest one in history. A moral revolution is themost difficult, the most demanding, the most radical form of rebellion, but thatis the task to be done today, if you choose to accept it. When I say “radical,”I mean it in its literal and reputable sense: fundamental. Civilization does nothave to perish. The brutes are winning only by default. But in order to fightthem to the finish and with full rectitude, it is the altruist morality that youhave to reject.Now, if you want to know what my philosophy, Objectivism, offers you—I will giveyou a brief indication. I will not attempt, in one lecture, to present my wholephilosophy. I will merely indicate to you what I mean by a rational morality ofself-interest, what I mean by the opposite of altruism, what kind of morality ispossible to man and why. I will preface it by reminding you that mostphilosophers—especially most of them today—have always claimed that morality isoutside the province of reason, that no rational morality can be defined, andthat man has no practical need of morality. Morality, they claim, is not anecessity of man’s existence, but only some sort of mystical luxury or arbitrarysocial whim; in fact, they claim, nobody can prove why we should be moral atall; in reason, they claim, there’s no reason to be moral.I cannot summarize for you the essence and the base of my morality any betterthan I did it in Atlas Shrugged. So, rather than attempt to paraphrase it, Iwill read to you the passages from Atlas Shrugged which pertain to the nature,the base and the proof of my morality.“Man’s mind is his basic tool of survival. Life is given to him, survival isnot. His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him,its content is not. To remain alive, he must act, and before he can act he mustknow the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot obtain his food without aknowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch—or build acyclotron—without a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it. Toremain alive, he must think.“But to think is an act of choice. The key to what you so recklessly call ‘humannature,’ the open secret you live with, yet dread to name, is the fact that manis a being of volitional consciousness. Reason does not work automatically;thinking is not a mechanical process; the connections of logic are not made byinstinct. The function of your stomach, lungs or heart is automatic; thefunction of your mind is not. In any hour and issue of your life, you are freeto think or to evade that effort. But you are not free to escape from yournature, from the fact that reason is your means of survival—so that for you, whoare a human being, the question ‘to be or not to be’ is the question ‘to thinkor not to think.’“A being of volitional consciousness has no automatic course of behavior. Heneeds a code of values to guide his actions. ‘Value’ is that which one acts togain and keep, ‘virtue’ is the action by which one gains and keeps it. ‘Value’presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and for what? ‘Value’presupposes a standard, a purpose and the necessity of action in the face of analternative. Where there are no alternatives, no values are possible.“There is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence ornon-existence—and it pertains to a single class of entities: to livingorganisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence oflife is not: it depends on a specific course of action. Matter isindestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease to exist. It is only aliving organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death.Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action. If an organismfails in that action, it dies; its chemical elements remain, but its life goesout of existence. It is only the concept of ‘Life’ that makes the concept of‘Value’ possible. It is only to a living entity that things can be good or evil.“A plant must feed itself in order to live; the sunlight, the water, thechemicals it needs are the values its nature has set it to pursue; its life isthe standard of value directing its actions. But a plant has no choice ofaction; there are alternatives in the conditions it encounters, but there is noalternative in its function: it acts automatically to further its life, itcannot act for its own destruction.“An animal is equipped for sustaining its life; its senses provide it with anautomatic code of action, an automatic knowledge of what is good for it or evil.It has no power to extend its knowledge or to evade it. In conditions where itsknowledge proves inadequate, it dies. But so long as it lives, it acts on itsknowledge, with automatic safety and no power of choice, it is unable to ignoreits own good, unable to decide to choose the evil and act as its own destroyer.“Man has no automatic code of survival. His particular distinction from allother living species is the necessity to act in the face of alternatives bymeans of volitional choice. He has no automatic knowledge of what is good forhim or evil, what values his life depends on, what course of action it requires.Are you prattling about an instinct of self-preservation? An instinct ofself-preservation is precisely what man does not possess. An ‘instinct’ is anunerring and automatic form of knowledge. A desire is not an instinct. A desireto live does not give you the knowledge required for living. And even man’sdesire to live is not automatic: your secret evil today is that that is thedesire you do not hold. Your fear of death is not a love for life and will notgive you the knowledge needed to keep it. Man must obtain his knowledge andchoose his actions by a process of thinking, which nature will not force him toperform. Man has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way hehas acted through most of his history. . . .“Man has been called a rational being, but rationality is a matter of choice—andthe alternative his nature offers him is: rational being or suicidal animal. Manhas to be man—by choice; he has to hold his life as a value—by choice; he has tolearn to sustain it—by choice; he has to discover the values it requires andpractice his virtues—by choice.“A code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality.“Whoever you are, you who are hearing me now, I am speaking to whatever livingremnant is left uncorrupted within you, to the remnant of the human, to yourmind, and I say: There is a morality of reason, a morality proper to man, andMan’s Life is its standard of value.“All that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good; all thatwhich destroys it is the evil.“Man’s life, as required by his nature, is not the life of a mindless brute, ofa looting thug or a mooching mystic, but the life of a thinking being—not lifeby means of force or fraud, but life by means of achievement—not survival at anyprice, since there’s only one price that pays for man’s survival: reason.“Man’s life is the standard of morality, but your own life is its purpose. Ifexistence on earth is your goal, you must choose your actions and values by thestandard of that which is proper to man—for the purpose of preserving,fulfilling and enjoying the irreplaceable value which is your life.”This, ladies and gentlemen, is what Objectivism offers you.And when you make your choice, I would like you to remember that the onlyalternative to it is communist slavery. The “middle-of-the-road” is like anunstable, radioactive element that can last only so long—and its time is runningout. There is no more chance for a middle-of-the-road.The issue will be decided, not in the middle, but between the two consistentextremes. It’s Objectivism or communism. It’s a rational morality based on man’sright to exist—or altruism, which means: slave labor camps under the rule ofsuch masters as you might have seen on the screens of your TV last year. If thatis what you prefer, the choice is yours.But don’t make that choice blindly. You, the young generation, have beenbetrayed in the most dreadful way by your elders—by those liberals of thethirties who armed Soviet Russia, and destroyed the last remnants of Americancapitalism. All that they have to offer you now is foxholes, or the kind ofattitude expressed in the quotation on “creative suffering” that I read to you.This is all that you will hear on any side: “Give up before you have started.Give up before you have tried.” And to make sure that you give up, they do noteven let you know what the nineteenth century was. I hope this may not be fullytrue here, but I have met too many young people in universities, who have noclear idea, not even in the most primitive terms, of what capitalism really is.They do not let you know what the theory of capitalism is, nor how it worked inpractice, nor what was its actual history.Don’t give up too easily; don’t sell out your life. If you make an effort toinquire on your own, you will find that it is not necessary to give up and thatthe allegedly powerful monster now threatening us will run like a rat at thefirst sign of a human step.It is not physical danger that threatens you, and it is not militaryconsiderations that make our so-called intellectual leaders tell you that we aredoomed. That is merely their rationalization. The real danger is that communismis an enemy whom they do not dare to fight on moral grounds, and it can befought only on moral grounds.This, then, is the choice. Think it over. Consider the subject, check yourpremises, check past history and find out whether it is true that men can neverbe free. It isn’t true, because they have been. Find out what made it possible.See for yourself. And then if you are convinced—rationally convinced—then let ussave the world together. We still have time.To quote Galt once more, such is the choice before you. Let your mind and yourlove of existence decide."},{"pageContent":"8From the Horse’s Mouth1975 While recovering from [an] illness, I had a chance to catch up on some reading Ihad wanted to do for a long time. Opening one interesting book, I almost leapedout of bed. I read some statements which shocked me much more profoundly thanany of today’s pronouncements in the news magazines or on the Op-Ed page of TheNew York Times. I had been reporting on some of those journalistic writingsoccasionally, as a warning against the kinds of intellectual dangers (and boobytraps) they represented. But they looked like cheap little graffiti compared tothe sweep of wholesale destruction presented in a few sentences of that book.Just as, at the end of Atlas Shrugged, Francisco saw a radiant future containedin a few words, so I saw the long, dismal, slithering disintegration of thetwentieth century held implicitly in a few sentences. I wanted to scream awarning, but it was too late: that book had been published in 1898. Written byFriedrich Paulsen, it is entitled Immanuel Kant: His Life and Doctrine.Professor Paulsen is a devoted Kantian; but, judging by his style of writing, heis an honest commentator— in the sense that he does not try to disguise what heis saying: “There are three attitudes of the mind towards reality which layclaim to truth—Religion, Philosophy, and Science. . . . In general, philosophyoccupies an intermediate place between science and religion. . . . The historyof philosophy shows that its task consists simply in mediating between scienceand religion. It seeks to unite knowledge and faith, and in this way to restorethe unity of the mental life. . . . As in the case of the individual, itmediates between the head and the heart, so in society it prevents science andreligion from becoming entirely strange and indifferent to each other, andhinders also the mental life of the people from being split up into afaith-hating science and a science-hating faith or superstition.” (New York,Ungar, 1963, pp. 1-2.)This means that science and mystic fantasies are equally valid as methods ofgaining knowledge; that reason and feelings—the worst kinds of feelings: fear,cowardice, self-abnegation—have equal value as tools of cognition; and thatphilosophy, “the love of wisdom,” is a contemptible middle-of-the-roader whosetask is to seek a compromise—a detente—between truth and falsehood.Professor Paulsen’s statement is an accurate presentation of Kant’s attitude,but it is not Kant that shocked me, it is Paulsen. Philosophic system-builders,such as Kant, set the trends of a nation’s culture (for good or evil), but it isthe average practitioners who serve as a barometer of a trend’s success orfailure. What shocked me was the fact that a modest commentator would start hisbook with a statement of that kind. I thought (no, hoped) that in the nineteenthcentury a man upholding the cognitive pretensions of religion to an equalfooting with science, would have been laughed off any serious lectern. I wasmistaken. Here was Professor Paulsen casually proclaiming—in the nineteenthcentury—that philosophy is the handmaiden of theology.Existentially (i.e., in regard to conditions of living, scale of achievement,and rapidity of progress), the nineteenth century was the best in Westernhistory. Philosophically, it was one of the worst. People thought they hadentered an era of inexhaustible radiance; but it was merely the sunset ofAristotle’s influence, which the philosophers were extinguishing. If you havefelt an occasional touch of wistful envy at the thought that there was a timewhen men went to the opening of a new play, and what they saw was not Hair orGrease, but Cyrano de Bergerac, which opened in 1897—take a wider look. I wishthat, borrowing from Victor Hugo’s Notre Dame de Paris, someone had pointed tothe Paulsen book, then to the play, and said: “This will kill that.” But therewas no such person.I do not mean to imply that the Paulsen book had so fateful an influence; I amciting the book as a symptom, not a cause. The cause and the influence wereKant’s. Paulsen merely demonstrates how thoroughly that malignancy had spreadthrough Western culture at the dawn of the twentieth century.The conflict between knowledge and faith, Paulsen explains, “has extendedthrough the entire history of human thought” (p. 4) and Kant’s greatachievement, he claims, consisted in reconciling them. “. . . the critical[Kantian] philosophy solves the old problem of the relation of knowledge andfaith. Kant is convinced that by properly fixing the limits of each he hassucceeded in furnishing a basis for an honorable and enduring peace betweenthem. Indeed, the significance and vitality of his philosophy will restprincipally upon this. . . . it is [his philosophy’s] enduring merit to havedrawn for the first time, with a firm hand and in clear outline, the dividingline between knowledge and faith. This gives to knowledge what belongs to it—theentire world of phenomena for free investigation; it conserves, on the otherhand, to faith its eternal right to the interpretation of life and of the worldfrom the standpoint of value.” (P. 6.)This means that the ancient mind-body dichotomy—which the rise of science hadbeen healing slowly, as men were learning how to live on earth—was revived byKant, and man was split in two, not with old daggers, but with a meat-ax. Itmeans that Kant gave to science the entire material world (which, however, wasto be regarded as unreal), and left (“conserved”) one thing to faith: morality.If you are not entirely sure of which side would win in a division of that kind,look around you today.Material objects as such have neither value nor disvalue; they acquirevalue-significance only in regard to a living being—particularly, in regard toserving or hindering man’s goals. Man’s goals and values are determined by hismoral code. The Kantian division allows man’s reason to conquer the materialworld, but eliminates reason from the choice of the goals for which materialachievements are to be used. Man’s goals, actions, choices and values—accordingto Kant—are to be determined irrationally, i.e., by faith.In fact, man needs morality in order to discover the right way to live on earth.In Kant’s system, morality is severed from any concern with man’s existence. Infact, man’s every problem, goal or desire involves the material world. In Kant’ssystem, morality has nothing to do with this world, nor with reason, nor withscience, but comes—via feelings—from another, unknowable, “noumenal” dimension.If you share the error prevalent among modern businessmen, and tend to believethat nonsense such as Kant’s is merely a verbal pastime for mentally unemployedacademicians, that it is too preposterous to be of any practicalconsequence—look again at the opening quotation from Professor Paulsen’s book.Yes, it is nonsense and vicious nonsense—but, by grace of the above attitude, ithas conquered the world.There is more than one way of accepting and spreading a philosophic theory. Theguiltiest group, which has contributed the most to the victory of Kantianism, isthe group that professes to despise it: the scientists. Adopting one variant oranother of Logical Positivism (a Kantian offshoot), they rejected Kant’snoumenal dimension, but agreed that the material world is unreal, that realityis unknowable, and that science does not deal with facts, but with constructs.They rejected any concern with morality, agreeing that morality is beyond thepower of reason or science and must be surrendered to subjective whims.Now observe the breach between the physical sciences and the humanities.Although the progress of theoretical science is slowing down (by reason of aflawed epistemology, among other things), the momentum of the Aristotelian pastis so great that science is still moving forward, while the humanities arebankrupt. Spatially, science is reaching beyond the solar system—while,temporally, the humanities are sliding back into the primeval ooze. Science islanding men on the moon and monitoring radio emissions from other galaxies—whileastrology is the growing fashion here on earth; while courses in astrology andblack magic are given in colleges; while horoscopes are sent galloping over theairwaves of a great scientific achievement, television.Scientists are willing to produce nuclear weapons for the thugs who rule SovietRussia—just as they were willing to produce military rockets for the thugs whoruled Nazi Germany. There was a story in the press that during the first test ofan atom bomb in New Mexico, Robert Oppenheimer, head of the Los Alamos group whohad produced the bomb, carried a four-leaf clover in his pocket. More recently,there was the story of Edgar Mitchell, an astronaut who conducted ESPexperiments on his way to the moon. There was the story of a space scientist whois a believer in occultism and black magic.Such is the “honorable and enduring peace” between knowledge and faith, achievedby the Kantian philosophy.Now what if one of those men gained political power and had to consider thequestion of whether to unleash a nuclear war? As a Kantian, he would have tomake his decision, not on the grounds of reason, knowledge and facts, but on theurgings of faith, i.e., of feelings, i.e., on whim.There are many examples of Kantianism ravaging the field of today’s politics inslower, but equally lethal, ways. Observe the farce of inflation versus“compassion.” The policies of welfare statism have brought this country (and thewhole civilized world) to the edge of economic bankruptcy, the forerunner ofwhich is inflation—yet pressure groups are demanding larger and larger handoutsto the nonproductive, and screaming that their opponents lack “compassion.”Compassion as such cannot grow a blade of grass, let alone of wheat. Of what useis the “compassion” of a man (or a country) who is broke—i.e., who has consumedhis resources, is unable to produce, and has nothing to give away?If you cannot understand how anyone can evade reality to such an extent, youhave not understood Kantianism. “Compassion” is a moral term, and moralissues—to the thoroughly Kantianized intellectuals—are independent of materialreality. The task of morality—they believe—is to make demands, with which theworld of material “phenomena” has to comply; and, since that material world isunreal, its problems or shortages cannot affect the success of moral goals,which are dictated by the “noumenal” real reality.Dear businessmen, why do you worry about a half-percent of interest on a loan orinvestment—when your money supports the schools where those notions are taughtto your children?No, most people do not know Kant’s theories, nor care. What they do know is thattheir teachers and intellectual leaders have some deep, tricky justification—thetrickier, the better—for the net result of all such theories, which the averageperson welcomes: “Be rational, except when you don’t feel like it.”Note the motivation of those who accepted the grotesque irrationality of Kant’ssystem in the first place—as declared by his admirer, Professor Paulsen: “Thereis indeed no doubt that the great influence which Kant exerted upon his age wasdue just to the fact that he appeared as a deliverer from unendurable suspense.The old view regarding the claims of the feelings and the understanding onreality had been more and more called in question during the second half of theeighteenth century. . . . Science seemed to demand the renunciation of the oldfaith. On the other hand, the heart still clung to it. . . . Kant showed a wayof escape from the dilemma. His philosophy made it possible to be at once acandid thinker and an honest man of faith. For that, thousands of hearts havethanked him with passionate devotion.” (Pp. 6-7; emphasis added—no other commentis necessary.)Philosophy is a necessity for a rational being: philosophy is the foundation ofscience, the organizer of man’s mind, the integrator of his knowledge, theprogrammer of his subconscious, the selector of his values. To set philosophyagainst reason, i.e., against man’s power of cognition, to turn philosophy intoan apologist for and a protector of superstition—is such a crime againsthumanity that no modern atrocities can equal it: it is the cause of modernatrocities.If Paulsen is representative of the nineteenth century, the twentieth never hada chance. But if men grasp the source of their destruction—if they dedicatethemselves to the greatest of all crusades: a crusade for the absolutism ofreason—the twenty-first century will have a chance once more."},{"pageContent":"9Kant Versus Sullivan1970 In the title essay of For the New Intellectual, discussing modern philosophy’sconcerted attack on man’s mind, I referred to the philosophers’ division intotwo camps, “those who claimed that man obtains his knowledge of the world bydeducing it exclusively from concepts, which come from inside his head and arenot derived from the perception of physical facts (the Rationalists)—and thosewho claimed that man obtains his knowledge from experience, which was held tomean: by direct perception of immediate facts, with no recourse to concepts (theEmpiricists). To put it more simply: those who joined the Witch Doctor, byabandoning reality—and those who clung to reality, by abandoning their mind.”For the past several decades, the dominant fashion among academic philosopherswas empiricism—a militant kind of empiricism. Its exponents dismissedphilosophical problems by declaring that fundamental concepts—such as existence,entity, identity, reality—are meaningless; they declared that concepts arearbitrary social conventions and that only sense data, “unpro-cessed” byconceptualization, represent a valid or “scientific” form of knowledge; and theydebated such issues as whether man may claim with certainty that he perceives atomato or only a patch of red.Sooner or later, it had to become apparent that cooks, let alone scientists, dosomething with that patch of red by some means which is not direct and immediatesensory perception. And—as in any field of activity ruled by fashion, notfacts—the philosophical pendulum began to swing to the other side of the samecoin.Accepting the empiricists’ basic premise that concepts have no necessaryrelation to sense data, a new breed of rationalists is floating up to thesurface of the academic mainstream, declaring that scientific knowledge does notrequire any sense data at all (which means: that man does not need his senseorgans).If the empiricist trend—with its glib, glossy, up-to-the-minute modernism ofquasi-technological jargon and pseudo-mathematical equations—may be regarded asthe miniskirt period of philosophical fashion, then the rationalist revivalbrings in the maxiskirt period, an old, bedraggled, pavement-sweeping,unsanitary maxiskirt, as unsuited for climbing into a modern car or airplane (orfor any kind of climbing) as its equivalent in the field of ladies’ garments.How low this new fashion can fall and what its hem-line can pick up may beobserved in the November 20, 1969 issue of The Journal of Philosophy—a magazineregarded as the most “prestigious” of the American journals of the philosophicprofession, published at Columbia University.The lead article is entitled “Science Without Experience” by Paul K. Feyerabendof the University of California and London University. (Remember that what ismeant here by “experience” is the evidence of man’s senses.) The articledeclares: “It must be possible to imagine a natural science without sensoryelements, and it should perhaps also be possible to indicate how such a scienceis going to work.“Now experience is said to enter science at three points: testing; assimilationof the results of test; understanding of theories.”Whoever is said to have said this, did not include observation among his threepoints, implying that science begins with “testing.” If so, what does one“test”? No answer is given.“It is easily seen that experience is needed at none of the three points justmentioned.“To start with, it does not need to enter the process of test: we can put atheory into a computer, provide the computer with suitable instruments directedby him (her, it) so that relevant measurements are made which return to thecomputer, leading there to an evaluation of the theory. The computer can give asimple yes-no response from which a scientist may learn whether or not a theoryhas been confirmed without having in any way participated in the test (i.e.,without having been subjected to some relevant experience).” (All italics inoriginal.)One might feel, at this point, that one’s brain is being paralyzed by too manyquestions. Just to name a few of them: Who built the computer, and was he ableto do it without sensory experience? Who programs the computer and by whatmeans? Who provides the computer with “suitable instruments” and how does heknow what is suitable? How does the scientist know that the object he is dealingwith is a computer?But such questions become unnecessary if one remembers two fallacies identifiedin Objectivist epistemology, which can help, not to elucidate, but to accountfor that paragraph: the fallacies of context-dropping and of“concept-stealing”—which the article seems to flaunt as valid epistemologicalmethods, proceeding, as it does, from the basic premise that the computers arehere.This still leaves the question: by what means does the scientist learn thecomputer’s verdict? To this one, the article’s author provides an answer—whichis point 2 of his theory of knowledge.“Usually such information travels via the senses, giving rise to distinctsensations. But this is not always the case. Subliminal perception [of what?]leads to reactions directly, and without sensory data. Latent learning leads tomemory traces [of what?] directly, and without sensory data. Posthypnoticsuggestion [by whom and by what means?] leads to (belated) reactions directly,and without sensory data. In addition there is the whole unexplored field oftelepathic phenomena.”Apparently in order not to let this sink in fully, the article’s next sentencecontinues the paragraph uninterrupted. But I have interrupted it precisely tolet this sink in fully.The paragraph’s next sentence is: “I am not asserting that the natural sciencesas we know them today could be built on these phenomena alone and could be freedfrom sensations entirely. Considering the peripheral nature of the phenomena andconsidering also how little attention is given to them in our education (we arenot trained to use effectively our ability for latent learning) this would beboth unwise and impractical. But the point is made that sensations are notnecessary for the business of science and that they occur for practical reasonsonly.”What would be the meaning or value of an impractical process of consciousness?Since the practice of the faculty of consciousness is to give us informationabout reality, an impractical process would be one that fails in this function.Yet it is some such process that the author advocates as superior or, at least,as equal to the processes of sensory experience—and urges our educators todevelop in us.Turning now to point 3 of his theory of knowledge—the relationship of experienceto the understanding of theories—the author announces that “experience arisestogether with theoretical assumptions, not before them . . .” He proves it asfollows: “eliminate part of the theoretical knowledge of a sensing subject andyou have a person who is completely disoriented, incapable of carrying out thesimplest action.”A disoriented person is an adult who, losing part of his acquired conceptualknowledge, is unable to function on a purely sensory-perceptual level, i.e.,unable to revert to the stage of infancy. Normally developing infants andchildren are not disoriented. It is the abnormal state of an adult that thearticle offers as a demonstration of the cognitive impotence of sense data.Then the article’s author plunges rapidly into his theory of a child’s cognitivedevelopment, as follows: the development “gets started only because the childreacts correctly toward signals, interprets them correctly, because he possessesmeans of interpretation even before he has experienced his first clearsensation.”The possession of means and their use are not the same thing: e.g., a childpossesses the means of digesting food, but would you accept the notion that heperforms the process of digestion before he has taken in any food? In the sameway, a child possesses the means of “interpreting” sense data, i.e., aconceptual faculty, but this faculty cannot interpret anything, let aloneinterpret it “correctly,” before he has experienced his first clear sensation.What would it be interpreting?“Again we can imagine that this interpretative apparatus acts without beingaccompanied by sensations (as do all reflexes and all well-learned movementssuch as typing). The theoretical knowledge it contains certainly can be appliedcorrectly, though it is perhaps not understood. But what do sensationscontribute to our understanding? Taken by themselves, i.e., taken as they wouldappear to a completely disoriented person, they are of no use, either forunderstanding, or for action.”After a few more sentences of the same kind, the paragraph concludes:“Understanding in the sense demanded here thus turns out to be ineffective andsuperfluous. Result: sensations can be eliminated from the process ofunderstanding also (though they may of course continue to accompany it, just asa headache accompanies deep thought).”Let me now summarize the preceding, i.e., that article’s theory of man and ofknowledge: a zombie whose mental apparatus produces theoretical knowledge whichhe does not understand, but which “interprets” signals “correctly” and enableshim to “apply” it correctly, i.e., to act without any understanding—directed byhis ultimate cognitive authority, the scientist, a blind-deaf-mute who engagesin mental telepathy with a computer.Now for the article’s payoff or cashing-in: “Why is it preferable to interprettheories on the basis of an observational language rather than on the basis of alanguage of intuitively evident statements (as was done only a few centuries agoand as must be done anyway, for observation does not help a disoriented person),or on the basis of a language containing short sentences (as is done in everyelementary physics course)? . . . Knowledge can enter our brain without touchingour senses. And some knowledge resides in the individual brain without everhaving entered it. Nor is observational knowledge the most reliable knowledge wepossess. Science took a big step forward when the Aristotelian idea of thereliability of our everyday experience was given up and was replaced by anempiricism of a more subtle kind. . . . Empiricism . . . is therefore anunreasonable doctrine, not in agreement with scientific practice.”Summing up his procedure, the article’s author concludes with: “Proceeding inthis way of course means leaving the confines of empiricism and moving on to amore comprehensive and more satisfactory kind of philosophy.” The “confines ofempiricism,” in this context, means: the confines of reality.Before we return to the morgue for the task of dissection, let us pause for abreath of fresh air—for a moment’s tribute to the lonely giant whom, twothousand three hundred years after his death, the enemies of man’s mind stillhave to try to attack before they can destroy the rest of us.A graphic description of what a non-observational, non-Aristotelian languagewould be like is given in an academically less prestigious journal—Lookmagazine, January 13, 1970. An article entitled “Growl to Me Softly and I’llUnderstand” declares: “On a personal level, there’ll be no need to cling toformal grammar to convey meaning. Speech doesn’t have to be linear; it can comeout as a compressed overlay of facts and sensations and moods and ideas andimages. Words can serve as signals, and others will understand. The way a manfeels can be unashamedly expressed in sheer sound, such as a low, glottal hum,like the purring of a cat, to indicate contentment. . . . Feelings have meaning.Sounds have meaning. Open language can be a joy—a language we can grow with,growl with. Words can cramp your style.”Suppose that you are on trial for a crime you did not commit; you need theclearest focus, the fullest concentration on facts, the strictest justice in theminds of those you face, in order to prove your innocence; but what “comes out”of the judge and jury is “a compressed overlay of facts and sensations and moodsand ideas and images.”Suppose that the government issues a decree which expropriates everything youown, sends your children to a concentration camp, your wife to a firing squad,yourself to forced labor, and your country into a nuclear war; you strugglefrantically to understand why; but what “comes out” of your country’s leaders is“a compressed overlay of facts and sensations and moods and ideas and images.”These examples are not exaggerations; they are precisely what the two articlesquoted mean, and the only things they can mean—in that factual, existentialreality where your sole tool of protection and survival is concepts, i.e.,language.The Look article wears a thin fig leaf, in the form of restricting the growls tothe “personal level” (which cannot be done, since the human mind is unable tocarry for long that kind of double psycho-epistemology). But The Journal ofPhilosophy article advocates the method of the “compressed overlay”—anon-observational language—for the mental activities of scientists.“Science Without Experience” heralds the retrogression of philosophy to theprimordial, pre-philosophical rationalism of the jungle (“as was done only a fewcenturies ago,” states the author, in support of a non-observational language).But what is innocent and explicable in an infant or a savage becomes senilecorruption when the snake oil, totem poles and magic potions are replaced by acomputer. This is the sort of rationalism that Plato, Descartes and all theothers of that school would be ashamed of; but not Kant. This is his baby andhis ultimate triumph, since he is the most fertile father of the doctrineequating the means of consciousness with its content—I refer you to his notionthat the machinery of consciousness produces its own (categorial) content.“Science Without Experience” is an article without significance and would not beworth considering or discussing if it were not for the shocking fact that it waspublished in the leading American journal of the philosophic profession. If thisis the view of man, of reason, of knowledge, of science, of existence sanctionedand propagated by the philosophic authorities of our time, can you blame thehippies and yippies who are their products? Can you blame an average youth whois thrown out into the world with this kind of mental equipment? Do you need anycommittees, commissions or multi-million-dollar studies to tell you the causesof campus violence and drug addiction?A brilliant young professor of philosophy gave me the following explanation ofthe appearance of that article: “They [the academic philosophers] would enjoy itbecause it attacks philosophy, in a hooligan manner, including some of their ownmost cherished beliefs, such as empiricism. They get a kick out of it. They willread and publish anything, so long as it does not imply or advocate a broad,consistent, integrated system of ideas.”For a long time, the academic philosophers have been able to do nothing butattack and refute one another (which is not difficult) without being able tooffer any theory of a constructive or positive nature. Every new attack confirmstheir notion that nothing else is possible to their profession and nothing elsecan be demanded of them. If the style of the attack is hooligan, it reassuresthem: they don’t have to take it (or philosophy) seriously. They will tolerateanything, so long as it does not require that they check the validity of theirown premises—i.e., so long as it does not threaten the belief that one set of(arbitrary) assumptions is as good as another.In For the New Intellectual, I mentioned the central cause of thepost-Renaissance philosophy’s disaster, the issue that brought its eventualcollapse. “They [the philosophers] were unable to offer a solution to the‘problem of universals,’ that is: to define the nature and source ofabstractions, to determine the relationship of concepts to perceptual data—andto prove the validity of scientific induction. . . . [They] were unable torefute the Witch Doctor’s claim that their concepts were as arbitrary as hiswhims and that their scientific knowledge had no greater metaphysical validitythan his revelations.”(Observe that the demands for this sort of epistemological equality is still theirrationalists’ policy, strategy and goal. “Why is it preferable to interprettheories on the basis of an observational language rather than on the basis of alanguage of intuitively evident statements . . . ?” asks the author of “ScienceWithout Experience.” This is the perverse form in which mystics are compelled toacknowledge the supremacy of reason and to confess their motive, their envy andtheir fear; an advocate of reason does not ask that his knowledge be grantedequality with the intuitions and revelations of mystics.)Concepts are the products of a mental process that integrates and organizes theevidence provided by man’s senses. (See my Introduction to ObjectivistEpistemology. ) Man’s senses are his only direct cognitive contact with realityand, therefore, his only source of information. Without sensory evidence, therecan be no concepts; without concepts, there can be no language; withoutlanguage, there can be no knowledge and no science.The answer to the question of the relationship of concepts to perceptual datadetermines man’s evaluation of the cognitive efficacy of his mind; it determinesthe course of every individual life and the fate of nations, of empires, ofscience, of art, of civilization. There are not many men who would die for thesake of protecting the right answer to that question, yet countless millionshave died because of the wrong answers.Through all the ages, a major attack on man’s conceptual faculty was directed atits foundation, i.e., at his senses—in the form of the allegation that man’ssenses are “unreliable.” It remained for the brazen-ness of the twentiethcentury to declare that man’s senses are superfluous.If you want to grasp fully the abysmal nature of that claim and, simultaneously,to grasp the origin of concepts and their dependence on sensory evidence, I willrefer you to a famous play. One might think that such a subject cannot bedramatized, but it has been—simply, eloquently, heartbreakingly—and it is not awork of fiction, but a dramatization of historical facts. It is The MiracleWorker by William Gibson and it tells the story of how Annie Sullivan broughtHelen Keller to grasp the nature of language.If you have seen the superlative performance of Patty Duke in the role of HelenKeller, in the stage or screen version of the play, you have seen the image ofman projected by “Science Without Experience”—or as near to it as a living humanbeing can come. Helen Keller was not that article’s ideal—a creature devoid ofall sensory contact with reality—but she came close to it: blind and deaf sinceinfancy, i.e., deprived of sight and hearing, she was left with nothing but thesense of touch to guide her (she retained also the senses of smell and taste,which are not of great cognitive value to a human being).Try to remember the incommunicable horror of that child’s state, communicated byPatty Duke: a creature who is neither human nor animal, with all the power of ahuman potential, but reduced to a sub-animal helplessness; a savage, violent,hostile creature fighting desperately for self-preservation in an unknowableworld, fighting to live somehow with a chronic state of terror and hopelessbewilderment; a human mind (proved later to be an unusually intelligent mind)struggling frantically, in total darkness and silence, to perceive, to grasp, tounderstand, but unable to understand its own need, goal or struggle.“Without being accompanied by sensations,” her “interpretative apparatus” didnot act; it did not act “as do all reflexes”; it did not produce any knowledgeat all, let alone any “theoretical knowledge.” “Knowledge,” that articledeclares, “can enter our brain without touching our senses.” None entered hers.Would she have been able to operate a computer? She was not able to learn to usea fork or to fold her napkin.Annie Sullivan, her young teacher (superlatively portrayed by Anne Bancroft), isfiercely determined to transform this creature into a human being, and she knowsthe only means that can do it: language, i.e., the development of the conceptualfaculty. But how does one communicate the nature and function of language to ablind-deaf-mute? The entire action of the play is concerned with this singlecentral issue: Annie’s struggle to make Helen’s mind grasp a word—not a signal,but a word.The form of the language is a code of tactile symbols, a touch alphabet by meansof which Annie keeps spelling words into Helen’s palm, always making her otherhand touch the objects involved. Helen catches on, in part, very rapidly: shelearns to repeat the signals into Annie’s palm, but with no relation to theobjects, she learns to spell many words, but she does not grasp the connectionof the signals to their referents, she thinks it is a game, she is merelymimicking motions at random, without any understanding. (At this stage, she islearning “language” as most of today’s college students are taught to use it—asa totally non-observational set of motions denoting nothing.)When Helen’s father compliments Annie on the fact that she has taught Helen therudiments of discipline, Annie, discouraged, answers: “. . . to do nothing butobey is—no gift, obedience without understanding is a—blindness, too.”Annie’s determination leads her through as heroic a struggle as has ever beenportrayed on the stage. She has to fight the doubts, the weary resignation, ofHelen’s parents; she has to fight their love and pity for the child, theiraccusations that she is treating Helen too severely; she has to fight Helen’sstubborn resistance and uncomprehending fear, which grows into obvious hatredfor the teacher; she has to fight her own doubts, the moments of discouragementwhen she wonders whether the achievement of the goal she has set herself ispossible: she does not know what to do, in the face of one disappointment afteranother, she does not know whether an arrested human mind can be reached andawakened—it has never been done before. Her only weapon is to go on, hour afterhour, day after day, endlessly pulling Helen’s hand to touch the objects theyencounter (to gain sensory evidence) and spelling into her palm “C-A-K-E . . .M-I-L-K . . . W-A-T-E-R . . .” over and over again, without any results.Helen’s older half-brother, James, skeptical of Annie’s efforts, remarks thatHelen might not want to learn, that maybe “there’s such a thing as—dullness ofheart. Acceptance. And letting go. Sooner or later we all give up, don’t we?“Annie. Maybe you all do. It’s my idea of the original sin.“James. What is?”“Annie. Giving up.“James. You won’t open her. Why can’t you let her be? Have some—pity on her, forbeing what she is—“Annie. If I’d ever once thought like that, I’d be dead!”In today’s world, many physically healthy but intellectually crippled people(particularly college students) need Annie Sullivan’s help, which they can useif they have retained the capacity to grasp (not merely look at and repeat, butgrasp) the full meaning of two statements of Annie Sullivan:Addressed to Helen’s father: “. . . words can be her eyes, to everything in theworld outside her, and inside too, what is she without words? With them she canthink, have ideas, be reached, there’s not a thought or fact in the world thatcan’t be hers. . . . And she has them already . . . eighteen nouns and threeverbs, they’re in her fingers now, I need only time to push one of them into hermind! One, and everything under the sun will follow.”Addressed to Helen, who cannot hear her: “I wanted to teach you—oh, everythingthe earth is full of, Helen, everything on it that’s ours for a wink and it’sgone, and what we are on it, the—light we bring to it and leave behind in—words,why, you can see five thousand years back in a light of words everything wefeel, think, know—and share, in words, so not a soul is in darkness, or donewith, even in the grave. And I know, I know, one word and I can—put the world inyour hand—and whatever it is to me, I won’t take less!”(“Words can cramp your style,” answers Look magazine.)To my knowledge, The Miracle Worker is the only epistemological play everwritten. It holds the viewer in tensely mounting suspense, not over a chase or abank robbery, but over the question of whether a human mind will come to life.Its climax is magnificent: after Annie’s crushing disappointment at Helen’sseeming retrogression, water from a pump spills over Helen’s hand, while Annieis automatically spelling “W-A-T-E-R” into her palm, and suddenly Helenunderstands. The two great moments of that climax are incommunicable exceptthrough the art of acting: one is the look on Patty Duke’s face when she graspsthat the signals mean the liquid—the other is the sound of Anne Bancroft’s voicewhen she calls Helen’s mother and cries: “She knows!”The quietly sublime intensity of that word—with everything it involves, connotesand makes possible—is what modern philosophy is out to destroy.I suggest that you read The Miracle Worker and study its implications. I am notacquainted with William Gibson’s other works; I believe that I would disagreewith many aspects of his philosophy (as I disagree with much of Helen Keller’sadult philosophy), but this particular play is an invaluable lesson in thefundamentals of a rational epistemology.I suggest that you consider Annie Sullivan’s titanic struggle to arouse achild’s conceptual faculty by means of a single sense, the sense of touch, thenevaluate the meaning, motive and moral status of the notion that man’sconceptual faculty does not require any sensory experience.I suggest that you consider what an enormous intellectual feat Helen Keller hadto perform in order to develop a full conceptual range (including a collegeeducation, which required more in her day than it does now), then judge thosenormal people who learn their first, perceptual-level abstractions without anydifficulty and freeze on that level, and keep the higher ranges of theirconceptual development in a chaotic fog of swimming, indeterminateapproximations, playing a game of signals without referents, as Helen Keller didat first, but without her excuse. Then check on whether you respect and howcarefully you employ your priceless possession: language.And, lastly, I suggest that you try to project what would have happened if,instead of Annie Sullivan, a sadist had taken charge of Helen Keller’seducation. A sadist would spell “water” into Helen’s palm, while making hertouch water, stones, flowers and dogs interchangeably; he would teach her thatwater is called “water” today, but “milk” tomorrow; he would endeavor to conveyto her that there is no necessary connection between names and things, that thesignals in her palm are a game of arbitrary conventions and that she’d betterobey him without trying to understand.If this projection is too monstrous to hold in one’s mind for long, rememberthat this is what today’s academic philosophers are doing to the young—to mindsas confused, as plastic and almost as helpless (on the higher conceptual levels)as Helen Keller’s mind was at her start."},{"pageContent":"10Causality Versus Duty1974 One of the most destructive anti-concepts in the history of moral philosophy isthe term “duty.”An anti-concept is an artificial, unnecessary and rationally unusable termdesigned to replace and obliterate some legitimate concept. The term “duty”obliterates more than single concepts; it is a metaphysical and psychologicalkiller: it negates all the essentials of a rational view of life and makes theminapplicable to man’s actions.The legitimate concept nearest in meaning to the word “duty” is “obligation.”The two are often used interchangeably, but there is a profound differencebetween them which people sense, yet seldom identify.The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged Edition, 1966)describes the difference as follows: “Duty, obligation refer to what one feelsbound to do. Duty is what one performs, or avoids doing, in fulfillment of thepermanent dictates of conscience, piety, right, or law: duty to one’s country;one’s duty to tell the truth, to raise children properly. An obligation is whatone is bound to do to fulfill the dictates of usage, custom, or propriety, andto carry out a particular, specific, and often personal promise or agreement:financial or social obligations.”From the same dictionary: “Dutiful—Syn. 1. respectful, docile, submissive . . .”An older dictionary is somewhat more open about it: “Duty—1. Conduct due toparents and superiors, as shown in obedience or submission . . .” “Dutiful—1.Performing, or ready to perform, the duties required by one who has the right toclaim submission, obedience, or deference . . .” (Webster’s InternationalDictionary, Second Edition, 1944.)The meaning of the term “duty” is: the moral necessity to perform certainactions for no reason other than obedience to some higher authority, withoutregard to any personal goal, motive, desire or interest.It is obvious that that anti-concept is a product of mysticism, not anabstraction derived from reality. In a mystic theory of ethics, “duty” standsfor the notion that man must obey the dictates of a supernatural authority. Eventhough the anti-concept has been secularized, and the authority of God’s willhas been ascribed to earthly entities, such as parents, country, State, mankind,etc., their alleged supremacy still rests on nothing but a mystic edict. Who inhell can have the right to claim that sort of submission or obedience? This isthe only proper form—and locality—for the question, because nothing and no onecan have such a right or claim here on earth.The arch-advocate of “duty” is Immanuel Kant; he went so much farther than othertheorists that they seem innocently benevolent by comparison. “Duty,” he holds,is the only standard of virtue; but virtue is not its own reward: if a reward isinvolved, it is no longer virtue. The only moral motivation, he holds, isdevotion to duty for duty’s sake; only an action motivated exclusively by suchdevotion is a moral action (i.e., an action performed without any concern for“inclination” [desire] or self-interest).“It is a duty to preserve one’s life, and moreover everyone has a directinclination to do so. But for that reason the often anxious care which most mentake of it has no intrinsic worth, and the maxim of doing so has no moralimport. They preserve their lives according to duty, but not from duty. But ifadversities and hopeless sorrow completely take away the relish for life, if anunfortunate man, strong in soul, is indignant rather than despondent or dejectedover his fate and wishes for death, and yet preserves his life without loving itand from neither inclination nor fear but from duty—then his maxim has a moralimport.” (Immanuel Kant, Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals, ed. R. P.Wolff, New York, Bobbs-Merrill, 1969, pp. 16-17.)And: “It is in this way, undoubtedly, that we should understand those passagesof Scripture which command us to love our neighbor and even our enemy, for loveas an inclination cannot be commanded. But beneficence from duty, when noinclination impels it and even when it is opposed by a natural and unconquerableaversion, is practical love, not pathological love; it resides in the will andnot in the propensities of feeling, in principles of action and not in tendersympathy; and it alone can be commanded.“[Thus the first proposition of morality is that to have moral worth an actionmust be done from duty.]” (Ibid., pp. 18-19; the sentence in brackets isWolff’s.)If one were to accept it, the anti-concept “duty” destroys the concept ofreality: an unaccountable, supernatural power takes precedence over facts anddictates one’s actions regardless of context or consequences.“Duty” destroys reason: it supersedes one’s knowledge and judgment, making theprocess of thinking and judging irrelevant to one’s actions.“Duty” destroys values: it demands that one betray or sacrifice one’s highestvalues for the sake of an inexplicable command—and it transforms values into athreat to one’s moral worth, since the experience of pleasure or desire castsdoubt on the moral purity of one’s motives.“Duty” destroys love: who could want to be loved not from “inclination,” butfrom “duty”?“Duty” destroys self-esteem: it leaves no self to be esteemed.If one accepts that nightmare in the name of morality, the infernal irony isthat “duty” destroys morality. A deontological (duty-centered) theory of ethicsconfines moral principles to a list of prescribed “duties” and leaves the restof man’s life without any moral guidance, cutting morality off from anyapplication to the actual problems and concerns of man’s existence. Such mattersas work, career, ambition, love, friendship, pleasure, happiness, values(insofar as they are not pursued as duties) are regarded by these theories asamoral, i.e., outside the province of morality. If so, then by what standard isa man to make his daily choices, or direct the course of his life?In a deontological theory, all personal desires are banished from the realm ofmorality; a personal desire has no moral significance, be it a desire to createor a desire to kill. For example, if a man is not supporting his life from duty,such a morality makes no distinction between supporting it by honest labor or byrobbery. If a man wants to be honest, he deserves no moral credit; as Kant wouldput it, such honesty is “praise-worthy,” but without “moral import.” Only avicious represser, who feels a profound desire to lie, cheat and steal, butforces himself to act honestly for the sake of “duty,” would receive arecognition of moral worth from Kant and his ilk.This is the sort of theory that gives morality a bad name.The widespread fear and/or resentment of morality—the feeling that morality isan enemy, a musty realm of suffering and senseless boredom—is not the product ofmystic, ascetic or Christian codes as such, but a monument to the ugliestrepository of hatred for life, man and reason: the soul of Immanuel Kant.(Kant’s theories are, of course, mysticism of the lowest order [of the“noumenal” order], but he offered them in the name of reason. The primitivelevel of men’s intellectual development is best demonstrated by the fact that hegot away with it.)If “genius” denotes extraordinary ability, then Kant may be called a genius inhis capacity to sense, play on and perpetuate human fears, irrationalities and,above all, ignorance. His influence rests not on philosophical but onpsychological factors. His view of morality is propagated by men who have neverheard of him—he merely gave them a formal, academic status. A Kantian sense of“duty” is inculcated by parents whenever they declare that a child must dosomething because he must. A child brought up under the constant battering ofcauseless, arbitrary, contradictory, inexplicable “musts” loses (or neveracquires) the ability to grasp the distinction between realistic necessity andhuman whims—and spends his life abjectly, dutifully obeying the second anddefying the first. In the full meaning of the term, he grows up without a cleargrasp of reality.As an adult, such a man may reject all forms of mysticism, but his Kantianpsycho-epistemology remains (unless he corrects it). He continues to regard anydifficult or unpleasant task as some inexplicable imposition upon him, as a dutywhich he performs, but resents; he believes that it is his “duty” to earn aliving, that it is his “duty” to be moral, and, in extreme cases, even that itis his “duty” to be rational.In reality and in the Objectivist ethics, there is no such thing as “duty.”There is only choice and the full, clear recognition of a principle obscured bythe notion of “duty”: the Law of Causality.The proper approach to ethics, the start from a metaphysically clean slate,untainted by any touch of Kantianism, can best be illustrated by the followingstory. In answer to a man who was telling her that she’s got to do something orother, a wise old Negro woman said: “Mister, there’s nothing I’ve got to doexcept die.”Life or death is man’s only fundamental alternative. To live is his basic act ofchoice. If he chooses to live, a rational ethics will tell him what principlesof action are required to implement his choice. If he does not choose to live,nature will take its course.Reality confronts man with a great many “musts,” but all of them areconditional; the formula of realistic necessity is: “You must, if—” and the “if”stands for man’s choice: “—if you want to achieve a certain goal.” You must eat,if you want to survive. You must work, if you want to eat. You must think, ifyou want to work. You must look at reality, if you want to think—if you want toknow what to do—if you want to know what goals to choose—if you want to know howto achieve them.In order to make the choices required to achieve his goals, a man needs theconstant, automatized awareness of the principle which the anti-concept “duty”has all but obliterated in his mind: the principle of causality—specifically, ofAristotelian final causation (which, in fact, applies only to a consciousbeing), i.e., the process by which an end determines the means, i.e., theprocess of choosing a goal and taking the actions necessary to achieve it.In a rational ethics, it is causality—not “duty”—that serves as the guidingprinciple in considering, evaluating and choosing one’s actions, particularlythose necessary to achieve a long-range goal. Following this principle, a mandoes not act without knowing the purpose of his action. In choosing a goal, heconsiders the means required to achieve it, he weighs the value of the goalagainst the difficulties of the means and against the full, hierarchical contextof all his other values and goals. He does not demand the impossible of himself,and he does not decide too easily which things are impossible. He never dropsthe context of the knowledge available to him, and never evades reality,realizing fully that his goal will not be granted to him by any power other thanhis own action, and, should he evade, it is not some Kantian authority that hecould be cheating, but himself.If he becomes discouraged by difficulties, he reminds himself of the goal thatrequires them, knowing that he is fully free to reconsider—to ask: “Is it worthit?”—and that no punishment is involved except the renunciation of the value hedesires. (One seldom gives up in such cases, unless one finds that it isrationally necessary.)In similar circumstances, a Kantian does not focus on his goal, but on his ownmoral character. His automatic reaction is guilt and fear—fear of failing his“duty,” fear of some weakness which “duty” forbids, fear of proving himselfmorally “unworthy.” The value of his goal vanishes from his mind, drowned in aflood of self-doubt. He might drive himself on in this cheerless fashion for awhile, but not for long. A Kantian seldom carries out or undertakes importantgoals: they are a threat to his self-esteem.This is one of the crucial psychological differences between the principle of“duty” and the principle of final causation. A disciple of causation looksoutward, he is value-oriented and action-oriented, which means:reality-oriented. A disciple of “duty” looks inward, he is self-centered, not inthe rational-existential, but in the psychopathological sense of the term, i.e.,concerned with a self cut off from reality; “self-centered” in this contextmeans: “self-doubt-centered.”There are many other differences between the two principles. A disciple ofcausation is profoundly dedicated to his values, knowing that he is able toachieve them. He is incapable of desiring contradictions, of relying on a“somehow,” of rebelling against reality. He knows that in all such cases, it isnot some Kantian authority that he would be defying and injuring, buthimself—and that the penalty would be not some mystic brand of “immorality,” butthe frustration of his own desires and the destruction of his values.A Kantian or even a semi-Kantian cannot permit himself to value anythingprofoundly, since an inexplicable “duty” may demand the sacrifice of his valuesat any moment, wiping out any long-range plan or struggle he might haveundertaken to achieve them. In the absence of personal goals, any task, such asearning a living, becomes a senseless drudgery, but he regards it as a“duty”—and he regards compliance with the requirements of reality as a “duty.”Then, in blind rebellion against “duty,” it is reality that he begins to resentand, ultimately, to escape, in search of some realm where wishes are grantedautomatically and ends are achieved without means. This is the subconsciousprocess by which Kant makes recruits for mysticism.The notion of “duty” is intrinsically anti-causal. In its origin, a “duty”defies the principle of efficient causation—since it is causeless (orsupernatural); in its effects, it defies the principle of final causation—sinceit must be performed regardless of consequences. This is the kind ofirresponsibility that a disciple of causation would not permit himself. He doesnot act without considering—and accepting—all the foreseeable consequences ofhis actions. Knowing the causal efficacy of his actions, seeing himself as acausal agent (and never seeking to get away with contradictions), he develops avirtue killed by Kantianism: a sense of responsibility.Accepting no mystic “duties” or unchosen obligations, he is the man who honorsscrupulously the obligations which he chooses. The obligation to keep one’spromises is one of the most important elements in proper human relationships,the element that leads to mutual confidence and makes cooperation possible amongmen. Yet observe Kant’s pernicious influence: in the dictionary descriptionquoted earlier, personal obligation is thrown in almost as a contemptuousfootnote; the source of “duty” is defined as “the permanent dictates ofconscience, piety, right, or law”; the source of “obligation,” as “the dictatesof usage, custom, or propriety”—then, as an afterthought: “and to carry out aparticular, specific, and often personal promise or agreement.” (Italics mine.)A personal promise or agreement is the only valid, binding obligation, withoutwhich none of the others can or do stand.The acceptance of full responsibility for one’s own choices and actions (andtheir consequences) is such a demanding moral discipline that many men seek toescape it by surrendering to what they believe is the easy, automatic,unthinking safety of a morality of “duty.” They learn better, often when it istoo late.The disciple of causation faces life without inexplicable chains, unchosenburdens, impossible demands or supernatural threats. His metaphysical attitudeand guiding moral principle can best be summed up by an old Spanish proverb:“God said: ‘Take what you want and pay for it.’ ” But to know one’s own desires,their meaning and their costs requires the highest human virtue: rationality."},{"pageContent":"11An Untitled Letter1973 The most appropriate title for this discussion would be “I told you so.” Butsince that would be in somewhat dubious taste, I shall leave this [issue of TheAyn Rand Letter] untitled.In Atlas Shrugged, and in many subsequent articles, I said that the advocates ofmysticism are motivated not by a quest for truth, but by hatred for man’s mind;that the advocates of altruism are motivated not by compassion for suffering,but by hatred for man’s life; that the advocates of collectivism are motivatednot by a desire for men’s happiness, but by hatred for man; that their threedoctrines come from the same root and blend into a single passion: hatred of thegood for being the good; and that the focus of that hatred, the target of itspassionate fury, is the man of ability.Those who thought that I was exaggerating have seen event after event confirm mydiagnosis. Reality has been providing me with references and footnotes,including explicit admissions by the advocates of those doctrines. Theadmissions are becoming progressively louder and clearer.The major ideological campaigns of the mystic-altruist-collectivist axis areusually preceded by trial balloons that test the public reaction to an attack oncertain fundamental principles. Today, a new kind of intellectual balloon isbeginning to bubble in the popular press—testing the climate for a large-scaleattack intended to obliterate the concept of justice.The new balloons acquire the mark of a campaign by carrying, like littleidentification tags, the code words: “A New Justice.” This does not mean thatthe campaign is consciously directed by some mysterious powers. It is aconspiracy, not of men, but of basic premises—and the power directing it islogic: if, at the desperate stage of a losing battle, some men point to a roadlogically necessitated by their basic premises, those who share the premiseswill rush to follow.Since my capacity for intellectual slumming is limited, I do not know whooriginated this campaign at this particular time (its philosophical roots areancient). The first instance that came to my attention was a brief news itemover a year ago. Dr. Jan Tinbergen from the Netherlands, who had received aNobel Prize in Economic Science, spoke at an international conference in NewYork City and suggested “that there be a tax on personal capabilities. ‘A modestfirst step might be a special tax on persons with high academic scores,’ hesaid.” We reprinted this item in the “Horror File” of The Objectivist (June1971). The reaction of my friends, when they read it, was an incredulouslyindignant amusement, with remarks such as: “He’s crazy!”But it is not amusing any longer when a news item in The New York Times (January2, 1973) announces that Pope Paul VI “issued a call today for a ‘new justice.’True justice recognizes that all men are in substance equal, the Pontiff said. .. . ‘The littler, the poorer, the more suffering, the more defenseless, even thelower a man has fallen, the more he deserves to be assisted, raised up, caredfor, and honored. We learn this from the Gospel.’ ”Observe the package-deal: to be “little,” “poor,” “suffering,” “defenseless” isnot necessarily to be immoral (it depends on the cause of these conditions). But“even the lower a man has fallen” implies, in this context, not misfortune butimmorality. Are we asked to absorb the notion that the lower a man’s vices, themore concern he deserves—and the more honor? Another package-deal: to be“assisted,” “raised up,” “cared for” obviously does not apply to those who aregreat, rich, happy or strong; they do not need it. But—“to be honored”? They arethe men who would have to do the assisting, the raising up, the caring for—butthey do not deserve to be honored? They deserve less honor than the man who issaved by their virtues and values?In Atlas Shrugged, exposing the meaning of altruism, John Galt says: “Whatpasskey admits you to the moral elite? The passkey is lack of value. Whateverthe value involved, it is your lack of it that gives you a claim upon those whodon’t lack it. . . . To demand rewards for your virtue is selfish and immoral;it is your lack of virtue that transforms your demand into a moral right.”What is an abstract ethical suggestion in the Pope’s message, becomes specificand political in a brief piece that appeared in the Times on January 20,1973—“The New Inequality” by Peregrine Worsthorne, a columnist for The SundayTelegraph of London. In addition to altruism, which is its base, this piece wasmade possible by two premises: 1. the refusal to recognize the differencebetween mind and force (i.e., between economic and political power); and 2. therefusal to recognize the difference between existence and consciousness (i.e.,between the metaphysical and the man-made). Those who ignore or evade thecrucial importance of these distinctions will find Mr. Peregrine Worsthorneready to welcome them at the end of their road.There was a time, Mr. Worsthorne begins, when “gross hereditary inequalities ofwealth, status and power were universally accepted as a divinely ordained factof life.” He is speaking of feudalism and of the British caste system. Butmodern man, he says, “finds this awfully difficult to understand. To him itseems absolutely axiomatic that each individual ought to be allowed to make hisgrade according to merit, regardless of the accident of birth. All positions ofpower, wealth and status should be open to talent. To the extent that this idealis achieved a society is deemed to be just.”If you think that this is a proclamation of individualism, think twice. Modernliberals, Mr. Worsthorne continues, “have tended to believe it to be fair enoughthat the man of merit should be on top and the man without merit should beunderneath.” On top—of what? Underneath—what? Mr. Worsthorne doesn’t say.Judging by the rest of the piece, his answer would be: on top ofanything—political power, self-made wealth, scientific achievement, artisticgenius, the status of earned respect or of a government-granted title ofnobility—anything anyone may ever want or envy.The current social “malaise,” he explains, is caused by “the increasing evidencethat this assumption [about a just society] should be challenged. The ideal of ameritocracy no longer commands such universal assent.”“Meritocracy” is an old anti-concept and one of the most contemptiblepackage-deals. By means of nothing more than its last five letters, that wordobliterates the difference between mind and force: it equates the men of abilitywith political rulers, and the power of their creative achievements withpolitical power. There is no difference, the word suggests, between freedom andtyranny: an “aristocracy” is tyranny by a politically established elite, a“democracy” is tyranny by the majority—and when a government protects individualrights, the result is tyranny by talent or “merit” (and since “to merit” means“to deserve,” a free society is ruled by the tyranny of justice).Mr. Worsthorne makes the most of it. His further package-dealing becomes easierand cruder. “It used to be considered manifestly unjust that a child should begiven an enormous head-start in life simply because he was the son of an earl,or a member of the landed gentry. But what about a child today born of affluent,educated parents whose family life gets him off to a head-start in theeducational ladder? Is he not the beneficiary of a form of hereditary privilegeno less unjust than that enjoyed by the aristocracy?”What about Thomas Edison, the Wright brothers, Commodore Vanderbilt, Henry Ford,Sr. or, in politics, Abraham Lincoln, and their “enormous head-start in life”?On the other hand, what about the Park Avenue hippies or the drug-eaten childrenof college-bred intellectuals and multi-millionaires?Mr. Worsthorne, it seems, had counted on “universal public education” to levelthings down, but it has disappointed him. “Family life,” he declares, “is moreimportant than school life in determining brain power. . . . Educationalqualifications are today what armorial quarterings were in feudal times. Yetaccess to them is almost as unfairly determined by accidents of birth as wasaccess to the nobility.” This, he says, defeats “any genuine faith in equalityof opportunity”—and “accounts for the current populist clamor to do away witheducational distinctions such as exams and diplomas, since they are seen as thelatest form of privilege which, in a sense, they are.”This means that if a young student (named, say, Thomas Hendricks), after daysand nights of conscientious study, proves that he knows the subject of medicine,and passes an exam, he is given an arbitrary privilege, an unfair advantage overa young student (named Lee Hunsacker) who spent his time in a drugged daze,listening to rock music. And if Hendricks gets a diploma and a job in ahospital, while Hunsacker does not, Hunsacker will scream that he could not helpit and that he never had a chance. Volitional effort? There is no such thing.Brain power? It’s determined by family life—and he couldn’t help it if Mom andPop did not condition him to be willing to study. He is entitled to a job in ahospital, and a just society would guarantee it to him. The fate of thepatients? He’s as good as any other fellow—“all men are in substance equal”—andthe only difference between him and the privileged bastards is a diploma grantedas unfairly as armorial quarterings! Equal opportunity? Don’t make him laugh!Socialists, Mr. Worsthorne remarks, have used “the ideal of equality ofopportunity” as “a way of moving in the right, that is to say the Left,direction.” They regarded it as “the thin end of the egalitarian wedge.”Then, suddenly, Mr. Worsthorne starts dispensing advice to the Right—which theLeft has always insisted on doing (and with good reason: any “rightist” whoaccepts it, deserves it). His advice, as usual, involves a threat and counts onfear. “But there is a problem here for the Right quite as much as for the Left.It seems to me certain that there will be a growing awareness in the comingdecades of the unfairness of existing society, of the new forms of arbitraryallocation of power, status and privilege. Resentment will build up against thenew meritocracy just as it built up against the old aristocracy and plutocracy.”The Right, he claims, must “devise new ways of disarming this resentment,without so curbing the high-flyers, so penalizing excellence, or so imposinguniformity as to destroy the spirit of a free and dynamic society.” Observe thathe permits himself to grasp and cynically to admit that such an issue as thepenalizing of excellence is involved, but he regards it as the Right’s concern,not his own—and he does not object to penalizing virtue for being virtue,provided the penalties do not go to extremes. This—in an article written as anappeal for justice.Mr. Worsthorne has a solution to offer to the Right—and here comes the fullflowering of altruism’s essence and purpose, spreading out its petals like ahideous jungle plant, the kind that traps insects and eats them. The purpose isnot to burn sacrificial victims, but to have them leap into the furnaces oftheir own free will: “What will be required of the new meritocracy is aformidably revived and reanimated spirit of noblesse oblige, rooted in therecognition that they are immensely privileged and must, as a class, behaveaccordingly, being prepared to pay a far higher social price, in terms oftaxation, in terms of service, for the privilege of exercising their talents.”Who granted them “the privilege of exercising their talents”? Those who have notalent. To whom must they “pay a higher social price”? To those who have nosocial value to offer. Who will impose taxation on their productive work? Thosewho have produced nothing. Whom do they have to serve? Those who would be unableto survive without them.“Did you want to know who is John Galt? I am the first man of ability whorefused to regard it as guilt. I am the first man who would not do penance formy virtues or let them be used as the tools of my destruction. I am the firstman who would not suffer martyrdom at the hands of those who wished me to perishfor the privilege of keeping them alive.” (Atlas Shrugged.)“This [the ‘social price’] is not an easy idea for a meritocracy to accept,” Mr.Worsthorne concludes. “They like to think that they deserve their privileges,having won them by their own efforts. But this is an illusion, or at any rate ahalf truth. The other half of the truth is that they are terribly lucky and iftheir luck is not to run out they must be prepared to pay much more for theirgood fortune than they had hoped or even feared.”I submit that any man who ascribes success to “luck” has never achieved anythingand has no inkling of the relentless effort which achievement requires. I submitthat a successful man who ascribes his own (legitimate) success in part to luckis either a modest, concrete-bound represser who does not understand theissue—or an appeaser who tries to mollify the resentment of enviousmediocrities. (For the nature of such resentment, see my article “The Age ofEnvy” in The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution.)Envy is a widespread sentiment in Europe, not in America. Most Americans admiresuccess: they know what it takes. They believe that one must pay for one’s sins,not for one’s virtues—and the monstrous notion of paying ransoms for goodfortune would not occur to them, nor would they take it seriously.Resentment against “meritocracy”? Our last Presidenital election [the landslideagainst McGovern] was a spectacular demonstration of America’s loyalty toachievement (on any level)—and of resentment against those egalitarianintellectuals who are trying to smuggle this country into a new caste systemproposed by their British mentors: a mediocracy.Politically, statism breeds a swarm of “little Caesars,” who are motivated bypower-lust. Culturally, statism breeds still lower a species: a swarm of “littleNeros,” who sing odes to depravity while the lives of their forced audiences goup in smoke.I have said repeatedly that American intellectuals, with rare exceptions, arethe slavish dependents and followers of Europe’s intellectual trends. The notionof a cultural aristocracy established and financed by the government is sogrotesque in this country that one wonders how an article such as Mr. PeregrineWorsthorne’s got published here. Can you see any group or class in Americaposturing about in the “spirit of noblesse oblige”? Can you see Americans bowingto, say, Sir Burrhus Frederic (Skinner) or Dame Jane (Fonda), thanking them fortheir charitable contributions? Yet this is the goal of Britain’s littleNeros—and of their American followers. I refer you to [The Ayn Rand Letter] ofJanuary 1, 1973, “To Dream the Non-Commercial Dream,” for a discussion of whysuch “aristocrats” would have a vested interest in altruism and why they wouldbe eager to pay a social price “for the privilege of exercising their talents.”If, by “meritocracy,” Mr. Worsthorne means a government-picked elite (forinstance, the B.B.C.), then it is true that such an elite owes its privileges toluck (and pull) more than to merit. If he means the men of ability whodemonstrate their merit in the free marketplace (of ideas or of material goods),then his notions are worse than false. Package-dealing is essential to theselling of such notions. Mr. Worsthorne’s technique consists in making nodistinction between these two kinds of “merit”—which means: in seeing nodifference between Homer and Nero.An article such as Mr. Worsthorne’s (and its various equivalents) would notappear in a newspaper, without some heavy academic-philosophical base.Newspapers are not published by or for theoretical innovators. Journalists donot venture to propagate an outrageous theory unless they know that they canrefer to some “reputable” source able, they hope, to explain the inexplicableand defend the indefensible. An enormous amount of unconscionable nonsense comesout of the academic world each year; most of it is stillborn. But when echoes ofa specific work begin to spurt in the popular press, they acquire significanceas an advance warning—as an indication of the fact that some group(s) has apractical interest in shooting these particular bubbles into the country’scultural arteries.In the case of the new egalitarianism, an academic source does exist. It may notbe the first book of that kind, but it is the one noticeably touted at present.It is A Theory of Justice by John Rawls, professor of philosophy at HarvardUniversity.The New York Times Book Review (December 3, 1972) lists it among “FiveSignificant Books of 1972” and explains: “Although it was published in 1971, itwas not widely reviewed until 1972, because critics needed time to get a grip onits complexities. In fact, it may not be properly understood until it has beenstudied for years. . . .” The Book Review itself did not review it until July16, 1972, at which time it published a front-page review written by MarshallCohen, professor of philosophy at the City University of New York. The fact thatthe timing of that review coincided with the period of George McGovern’scampaign may or may not be purely coincidental.Let me say that I have not read and do not intend to read that book. But sinceone cannot judge a book by its reviews, please regard the following discussionas the review of a review. Mr. Cohen’s remarks deserve attention in their ownright.According to the review, Rawls “is not an equalitarian, for he allows thatinequalities of wealth, power and authority may be just. He argues, however,that these inequalities are just only when they can reasonably be expected towork out to the advantage of those who are worst off. The expenses incurred [bywhom?] in training a doctor, like the rewards that encourage better performancefrom an entrepreneur, are permissible only if eliminating them, or reducing themfurther, would leave the worst off worse off still. If, however, permitting suchinequalities contributes to improving the health or raising the materialstandards of those who are least advantaged, the inequalities are justified. Butthey are justified only to that extent—never as rewards for ‘merit,’ never asthe just deserts of those who are born with greater natural advantages or intomore favorable social circumstances.”I assume that this is an accurate summary of Mr. Rawls’s thesis. The BookReview’s plug of December 3 offers corroboration: “The talented or sociallyadvantaged person hasn’t earned anything: ‘Those who have been favored bynature, whoever they are,’ he [Rawls] writes, ‘may gain from their good fortuneonly on terms that improve the situation of those who have lost out.’ ”(“. . . it is the parasites who are the moral justification for the existence ofthe producers, but the existence of the parasites is an end in itself. . . .”John Galt, analyzing altruism, in Atlas Shrugged.)Certain evils are protected by their own magnitude: there are people who,reading that quotation from Rawls, would not believe that it means what it says,but it does. It is not against social institutions that Mr. Rawls (and Mr.Cohen) rebels, but against the existence of human talent—not against politicalprivileges, but against reality—not against governmental favors, but againstnature (against “those who have been favored by nature,” as if such a term as“favor” were applicable here)—not against social injustice, but againstmetaphysical “injustice,” against the fact that some men are born with betterbrains and make better use of them than others are and do.The new “theory of justice” demands that men counteract the “injustice” ofnature by instituting the most obscenely unthinkable injustice among men:deprive “those favored by nature” (i.e., the talented, the intelligent, thecreative) of the right to the rewards they produce (i.e., the right to life)—andgrant to the incompetent, the stupid, the slothful a right to the effortlessenjoyment of the rewards they could not produce, could not imagine, and wouldnot know what to do with.Mr. Cohen would object to my formulation. “It is important to understand,” hewrites, “that according to Rawls it is neither just nor unjust that men are bornwith differing natural abilities into different social positions. These aresimply natural facts. [True, but if so, what is the purpose of the nextsentence?] To be sure, no one deserves his greater natural capacity or merits amore favorable starting point in society. The natural and social ‘lottery’ isarbitrary from a moral point of view. But it does not follow, as theequalitarian supposes, that we should eliminate these differences. There isanother way to deal with them. As we have seen, they can be put to work for thebenefit of all and, in particular, for the benefit of those who are worst off.”If a natural fact is neither just nor unjust, by what mental leap does it becomea moral problem and an issue of justice? Why should those “favored by nature” bemade to atone for what is not an injustice and is not of their making?Mr. Cohen does not explain. He continues: “What justice requires, then, is thatnatural chance and social fortune be treated as a collective resource and put towork for the common good. Justice does not require equality, but it does requirethat men share one another’s fate.” This is the conclusion that required readinga 607-page book and taking a year “to get a grip on its complexities.” That thisis regarded as a new theory, raises the question of where Mr. Rawls’s readersand admirers have been for the last two thousand years. There is more than thisto the book, but let us pause at this point for a moment.Observe that Mr. Cohen’s (and the egalitarians’) view of man is literally theview of a children’s fairy tale—the notion that man, before birth, is some sortof indeterminate thing, an entity without identity, something like a shapelesschunk of human clay, and that fairy godmothers proceed to grant or deny himvarious attributes (“favors”): intelligence, talent, beauty, rich parents, etc.These attributes are handed out “arbitrarily” (this word is preposterouslyinapplicable to the processes of nature), it is a “lottery” among pre-embryonicnon-entities, and—the supposedly adult mentalities conclude—since a winner couldnot possibly have “deserved” his “good fortune,” a man does not deserve or earnanything after birth, as a human being, because he acts by means of“undeserved,” “unmerited,” “unearned” attributes. Implication: to earn somethingmeans to choose and earn your personal attributes before you exist.Stuff of that kind has a certain value: it is a psychological confessionprojecting the enormity of that envy and hatred for the man of ability which arethe root of all altruistic theories. By preaching the basest variant of the oldaltruist tripe, Mr. Rawls’s book reveals altruism’s ultimate meaning—which maybe regarded as an ethical innovation. But A Theory of Justice is not primarily abook on ethics: it is a treatise on politics. And, believe it or not, it mightbe taken by some people as a way to save capitalism—since Mr. Rawls allegedlyoffers a “new” moral justification for the existence of social inequalities. Itis fascinating to observe against whom Mr. Rawls’s polemic is directed: againstthe utilitarians.Virtually all the defenders of capitalism, from the nineteenth century to thepresent, accept the ethics of utilitarianism (with its slogan “The greatesthappiness of the greatest number”) as their moral base and justification—evadingthe appalling contradiction between capitalism and the altruist-collectivistnature of the utilitarian ethics. Mr. Cohen points out that utilitarianism isincompatible with justice, because it endorses the sacrifice of minorities tothe interests of the majority. (I said this in 1946—see my old pamphlet Textbookof Americanism.) If the alleged defenders of capitalism insist on clinging toaltruism, Mr. Rawls is the retribution they have long since deserved: with fargreater consistency than theirs, he substitutes a new standard of ethics fortheir old, utilitarian one: “The greatest happiness for the least deserving.”His main purpose, however, is to revive, as a moral-political base, the theoryof social contract, which utilitarianism had replaced. In the opinion of JohnRawls, writes Mr. Cohen, “the social contract theory of Rousseau and Kant”(wouldn’t you know it?) provides an alternative to utilitarianism.Mr. Cohen proceeds to offer a summary of the way Mr. Rawls would proceed toestablish a “social contract.” Men would be placed in what he calls the“original position”—which is not a state of nature, but “a hypotheticalsituation that can be entered into at any time.” Justice would be ensured “byrequiring that the principles which are to govern society be chosen behind a‘veil of ignorance.’ This veil prevents those who occupy the ‘original position’from knowing their own natural abilities or their own positions in the socialorder. What they do not know they cannot turn to their own advantage; thisignorance guarantees that their choice will be fair. And since everyone in the‘original position’ is assumed to be rational [?!], everyone will be convincedby the same arguments [??!!]. In the social contract tradition the choice ofpolitical principles is unanimous.” No, Mr. Cohen does not explain or definewhat that “original position” is—probably, with good reason. As he goes on, heseems to hint that that “hypothetical situation” is the state of thepre-embryonic human clay.“Rawls argues that given the uncertainties that characterize the ‘originalposition’ (men do not know whether they are well- or ill-endowed, rich or poor)and given the fateful nature of the choice to be made (these are the principlesby which they will live) rational men would choose according to the ‘maximin’rules of game theory. This rule defines a conservative strategy—in making achoice among alternatives, we should choose that alternative whose worstpossible outcome is superior to the worst possible outcome of the others.” Andthus, men would “rationally” choose to accept Mr. Rawls’s ethical-politicalprinciples.Regardless of any Rube Goldberg complexities erected to arrive at thatconclusion, I submit that it is impossible for men to make any choice on thebasis of ignorance, i.e., using ignorance as a criterion: if men do not knowtheir own identities, they will not be able to grasp such things as “principlesto live by,” “alternatives” or what is a good, bad or worst “possible outcome.”Since in order to be “fair” they must not know what is to their own advantage,how would they be able to know which is the least advantageous (the “worstpossible”) outcome?As to the “maximin” rule of choice, I can annul Mr. Rawls’s social contract,which requires unanimity, by saying that in long-range issues I choose thatalternative whose best possible outcome is superior to the best possible outcomeof the others. “You seek escape from pain. We seek the achievement of happiness.You exist for the sake of avoiding punishment. We exist for the sake of earningrewards. Threats will not make us function; fear is not our incentive. It is notdeath that we wish to avoid, but life that we wish to live.” (Atlas Shrugged.)Mr. Cohen is not in full agreement with Mr. Rawls. He seems to think that Mr.Rawls is not egalitarian enough: “. . . one would like to be clearer about thesorts of inequalities that are in fact justified in order to ‘encourage’ betterperformance. And is it in fact legitimate for Rawls to exclude considerations ofwhat he calls envy from the calculations that are made in the ‘originalposition’? It is arguable that including them would lead to the choice of moreequalitarian principles.” Does this mean that pre-embryos without attributes areable to experience envy of other pre-embryos without attributes? Does this meanthat a just society must grind its best members down to the level of its worst,in order to pander to envy?I am inclined to guess that the answer is affirmative, because Mr. Cohencontinues as follows: “However that may be, I, for one, am inclined to arguethat once an adequate social minimum has been reached, justice requires theelimination of many economic and social inequalities, even if their eliminationinhibits a further raising of the minimum.” Is this motivated by the desire touplift the weak or to degrade the strong—to help the incompetent or to destroythe able? Is this the voice of love or of hatred—of compassion or of envy?What value would be gained by such a cerebrocidal atrocity? “I ought to forgosome economic benefits,” says Mr. Cohen, “if doing so will reduce the evils ofsocial distance, strengthen communal ties, and enhance the possibilities for afuller participation in the common life.” Whose life? In common with whom? Onwhose standard of value: the folks’ next door?—the corner louts’?—thehippies’?—the drug addicts’?“Dagny . . . I had seen . . . what it was that I had to fight for . . . I had tosave you . . . not to let you stumble the years of your life away, struggling onthrough a poisoned fog . . . struggling to find, at the end of your road, notthe towers of a city, but a fat, soggy, mindless cripple performing hisenjoyment of life by means of swallowing the gin your life had gone to pay for!”(Atlas Shrugged.)Mr. Cohen mentions that Mr. Rawls rejects “the perfectionistic doctrines ofAristotle.” (Wouldn’t you know that?) Mr. Rawls, by the way, is an American,educated in American universities, but he completed his education in GreatBritain, at Oxford, on a Fulbright Fellowship.What is the cause of today’s egalitarian trend? For over two hundred years,Europe’s predominantly altruist-collectivist intellectuals had claimed to be thevoice of the people—the champions of the downtrodden, disinherited masses and ofunlimited majority rule. “Majority” was the omnipotent word of theintellectuals’ theology. “Majority will” and “majority welfare” were their moralbase and political goal which—they claimed—permitted, vindicated and justifiedanything. With varying degrees of consistency, this belief was shared by most ofEurope’s social thinkers, from Marx to Bentham to John Stuart Mill (whose OnLiberty is the most pernicious piece of collectivism ever adopted by suicidaldefenders of liberty).In mid-twentieth century, the intellectuals were traumatized by seeing theiraxiomatic bedrock disintegrate into thin ice. The concept of “majority will”collapsed when they saw that the majority was not with them and did not sharetheir “ideals.” The concept of “majority welfare” collapsed when theydiscovered—through the experiences of communist Russia, Nazi Germany,welfare-state England, and sundry lesser socialist regimes—that only their hatedadversary, the free, selfish, individualistic system of capitalism, is able tobenefit the majority of the people (in fact, all of the people).Some intellectuals began to stumble toward the Right—a bankrupt Right, which hadnothing to offer. Some gave up, turning to drugs and astrology. Thevanguard—stripped of cover, of respect, of credibility, and of safely popularbromides—began to reveal their hidden motives in the open glare of verbalizedtheory.The cult of the “majority” has come to an end among the altruist-collectivists.They are not declaring any longer: “Why shouldn’t a minuscule elite of geniusesand millionaires be sacrificed to the broad masses of mankind?”—they aredeclaring that the broad masses of mankind should be sacrificed to a minusculeelite, not of gods, kings or heroes, but of congenital incompetents. They arenot declaring that greedy capitalists are exploiting and stifling men oftalent—they are declaring that men of talent should not be permitted tofunction. They are not declaring that capitalism is impeding technologicalprogress—they are declaring that technological progress should be retarded orabolished. They are not deriding the promise of “pie in the sky”—they aredemanding that pie on earth be forbidden. They are not promising to raise men’sstandard of living—they are proclaiming that it should be lowered. They are notseeking to redistribute wealth—they are seeking to wipe it out. What, then,remains of their former creed? Only one constant: sacrifice—which they are nowpreaching openly in the form they had always endorsed secretly: sacrifice forthe sake of sacrifice.“It is not your wealth that they’re after. Theirs is a conspiracy against themind, which means: against life and man.” (Atlas Shrugged.)Anyone who proposes to reduce mankind to the level of its lowest specimens,cannot claim benevolence as his motive. Anyone who proposes to deprive men ofaspiration, ambition or hope, and sentence them to stagnation for life, cannotclaim compassion as his motive. Anyone who proposes to forbid men’s progressbeyond the limit accessible to a cripple, cannot claim love for men as hismotive. Anyone who proposes to forbid to a genius any achievement which is notof value to a moron, cannot claim any motive but envy and hatred.Observe that it has never been possible to preach an evil notion on the basis ofreason, of facts, of this earth. The advocates of man-destroying theories havealways had to step outside reality, to seek a mystic base or sanction. Just asreligionists had to invoke the myth of Adam’s sin in order to propagate thenotion of man’s prenatal guilt—just as Kant had to rely on a noumenal world inorder to destroy the world that exists—just as Hegel had to call on the AbsoluteIdea, and Marx had to call on Hegel—so today, on the grubby scale of ourshrinking culture, those who want to deprive man of his right to life areproclaiming the rights of the fetus, and those who want to deny all rights tothe man of ability, are demanding that he atone for what he did not earn beforehe was a fetus and for nature’s prenatal unfairness to the Mongolian idiot nextdoor.Observe also that an honest theoretician does not try to present his ideas inthe guise of their opposites. But Kant’s philosophy is presented as “purereason”—altruism is presented as a doctrine of “love”—communism is presented as“liberation”—and egalitarianism is presented as “justice.”“Justice is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character ofmen as you cannot fake the character of nature . . . that every man must bejudged for what he is and treated accordingly . . . that to place any otherconcern higher than justice is to devaluate your moral currency and defraud thegood in favor of the evil . . . and that the bottom of the pit at the end ofthat road, the act of moral bankruptcy, is to punish men for their virtues andreward them for their vices. . . .” (Atlas Shrugged.)Mr. Rawls’s book is entitled A Theory of Justice, and yet, curiously enough, Mr.Cohen never mentions Mr. Rawls’s definition of “justice”—which, I suspect, maynot be Mr. Cohen’s fault.In Atlas Shrugged, in the sequence dealing with the tunnel catastrophe, I listthe train passengers who were philosophically responsible for it, inhierarchical order, from the less guilty to the guiltiest. The last one on thelist is a humanitarian who had said: “The men of ability? I do not care what orif they are made to suffer. They must be penalized in order to support theincompetent. Frankly, I do not care whether this is just or not. I take pride innot caring to grant any justice to the able, where mercy to the needy isconcerned.” Today, a “scientific” volume of 607 pages is devoted to claimingthat this constitutes justice.In Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, I wrote: “The moral justification ofcapitalism lies in the fact that it is the only system consonant with man’srational nature, that it protects man’s survival qua man, and that its rulingprinciple is: justice.” If capitalism and its moral-metaphysical base, man’srational nature, are to be destroyed, then it is the concept of justice that hasto be destroyed. Apparently, the egalitarians understand this; the utilitariandefenders of capitalism do not.Is A Theory of Justice likely to be widely read? No. Is it likely to beinfluential? Yes—precisely for that reason.If you wonder how so grotesquely irrational a philosophy as Kant’s came todominate Western culture, you are now witnessing an attempt to repeat thatprocess. Mr. Rawls is a disciple of Kant—philosophically andpsycho-epistemologically. Kant originated the technique required to sellirrational notions to the men of a skeptical, cynical age who have formallyrejected mysticism without grasping the rudiments of rationality. The techniqueis as follows: if you want to propagate an outrageously evil idea (based ontraditionally accepted doctrines), your conclusion must be brazenly clear, butyour proof unintelligible. Your proof must be so tangled a mess that it willparalyze a reader’s critical faculty—a mess of evasions, equivocations,obfuscations, circumlocutions, non sequiturs, endless sentences leading nowhere,irrelevant side issues, clauses, sub-clauses and sub-sub-clauses, a meticulouslylengthy proving of the obvious, and big chunks of the arbitrary thrown in asself-evident, erudite references to sciences, to pseudo-sciences, to thenever-to-be-sciences, to the untraceable and the improvable—all of it resting ona zero: the absence of definitions. I offer in evidence the Critique of PureReason.Mr. Cohen gives some indications that such is the style of Mr. Rawls’s book.E.g.: “. . . the boldness and simplicity of Rawls’s formulations depend on aconsidered, but questionable, looseness in his understanding of some fundamentalpolitical concepts.” (Emphasis added.) “Considered” means “deliberate.”Like any overt school of mysticism, a movement seeking to achieve a vicious goalhas to invoke the higher mysteries of an incomprehensible authority. An unreadand unreadable book serves this purpose. It does not count on men’sintelligence, but on their weaknesses, pretensions and fears. It is not a toolof enlightenment, but of intellectual intimidation. It is not aimed at thereader’s understanding, but at his inferiority complex.An intelligent man will reject such a book with contemptuous indignation,refusing to waste his time on untangling what he perceives to be gibberish—whichis part of the book’s technique: the man able to refute its arguments will not(unless he has the endurance of an elephant and the patience of a martyr). Ayoung man of average intelligence—particularly a student of philosophy or ofpolitical science—under a barrage of authoritative pronouncements acclaiming thebook as “scholarly,” “significant,” “profound,” will take the blame for hisfailure to understand. More often than not, he will assume that the book’stheory has been scientifically proved and that he alone is unable to grasp it;anxious, above all, to hide his inability, he will profess agreement, and theless his understanding, the louder his agreement—while the rest of the class aregoing through the same mental process. Most of them will accept the book’sdoctrine, reluctantly and uneasily, and lose their intellectual integrity,condemning themselves to a chronic fog of approximation, uncertainty, selfdoubt. Some will give up the intellect (particularly philosophy) and turnbelligerently into “pragmatic,” anti-intellectual Babbitts. A few will seethrough the game and scramble eagerly for the driver’s seat on the bandwagon,grasping the possibilities of a road to the mentally unearned.Within a few years of the book’s publication, commentators will begin to filllibraries with works analyzing, “clarifying” and interpreting its mysteries.Their notions will spread all over the academic map, ranging from the appeasers,who will try to soften the book’s meaning—to the glamorizers, who will ascribeto it nothing worse than their own pet inanities—to the compromisers, who willtry to reconcile its theory with its exact opposite—to the avant-garde, who willspell out and demand the acceptance of its logical consequences. Thecontradictory, antithetical nature of such interpretations will be ascribed tothe book’s profundity—particularly by those who function on the motto: “If Idon’t understand it, it’s deep.” The students will believe that the professorsknow the proof of the book’s theory, the professors will believe that thecommentators know it, the commentators will believe that the author knows it—andthe author will be alone to know that no proof exists and that none was offered.Within a generation, the number of commentaries will have grown to suchproportions that the original book will be accepted as a subject ofphilosophical specialization, requiring a lifetime of study—and any refutationof the book’s theory will be ignored or rejected, if unaccompanied by a fulldiscussion of the theories of all the commentators, a task which no one will beable to undertake.This is the process by which Kant and Hegel acquired their dominance. Manyprofessors of philosophy today have no idea of what Kant actually said. And noone has ever read Hegel (even though many have looked at every word on his everypage).This process has already begun in regard to Mr. Rawls’s book, in the form ofsuch manifestations as Mr. Peregrine Worsthorne’s “The New Inequality.” But theprocess is being forced by P.R. techniques; it is being pushed artificially andin the wrong direction: toward the popular press and the man in the street, who,in this country, is the least likely prospect for the role of sucker.Furthermore, Mr. Rawls is not in Kant’s league: he is a politically orientedlightweight, who has scrambled together the worst of the old philosophictraditions, adding nothing new. His two outstanding points of similarity to Kantare: the method—and the motive.The danger lies in the cultural similarity of Kant’s time and ours. An age ruledby skepticism and cynicism can be swayed by anyone, even Mr. Rawls. There is nointellectual opposition to anything today—as there was none to Kant. Kant’sopponents were men who shared all his fundamental premises (particularlyaltruism and mysticism), and merely engaged in nit-picking, thus hastening hisvictory. Today, the utilitarians, the religionists, and sundry other“conservatives” share all of Mr. Rawls’s fundamental premises (particularlyaltruism). If his book does not make them see the nature of altruism and itslogical consequences, if it does not make them realize that altruism is thedestroyer of man (and of reason, justice, morality, civilization), then nothingwill. When and if they get Mr. Rawls’s world, they will have deserved it. Sowill the “practical” men whose lard-encrusted souls feel that ideas areinnocuous playthings to be left to impractical intellectuals, and that any ideacan be circumvented by making a deal with the government.But it is only by default—by intellectual default—that theories such as Kant’sor Rawls’s can win. An intransigent, rational opposition could have stopped Kantin his time. Rawls is easier to defeat—particularly in this country, which isthe living monument to a diametrically opposite philosophy (he would have had abetter chance in Europe). If there is any spirit of rebellion on Americancampuses (and elsewhere), here is an evil to rebel against, to rebelintellectually, righteously, intransigently: any hint, touch, smell, or trialballoon of A Theory of Justice and of the egalitarian movement.If rational men do not rebel, the egalitarians will succeed. Succeed inestablishing a world of shoddy equality and brotherly stagnation? No—but this isnot their purpose. Just as Kant’s purpose was to corrupt and paralyze man’smind, so the egalitarians’ purpose is to shackle and paralyze the men of ability(even at the price of destroying the world).If you wish to know the actual motive behind the egalitarians’ theories—behindall their maudlin slogans, mawkish pleas, and ponderous volumes of verbalrat-traps—if you wish to grasp the enormity of the smallness of spirit for thesake of which they seek to immolate mankind, it can be presented in a few lines:“‘When a man thinks he’s good—that’s when he’s rotten. Pride is the worst of allsins, no matter what he’s done.’“‘But if a man knows that what he’s done is good?’“‘Then he ought to apologize for it.’“‘To whom?’“‘To those who haven’t done it.’ ” (Atlas Shrugged.)"},{"pageContent":"12Egalitarianism and Inflation1974 The classic example of vicious irresponsibility is the story of Emperor Nero whofiddled, or sang poetry, while Rome burned. An example of similar behavior maybe seen today in a less dramatic form. There is nothing imperial about theactors, they are not one single bloated monster, but a swarm of undernourishedprofessors, there is nothing resembling poetry, even bad poetry, in the soundsthey make, except for pretentiousness—but they are prancing around the fire and,while chanting that they want to help, are pouring paper refuse on the flames.They are those amorphous intellectuals who are preaching egalitarianism to aleaderless country on the brink of an unprecedented disaster.Egalitarianism is so evil—and so silly—a doctrine that it deserves no seriousstudy or discussion. But that doctrine has a certain diagnostic value: it is theopen confession of the hidden disease that has been eating away the insides ofcivilization for two centuries (or longer) under many disguises and cover-ups.Like the half-witted member of a family struggling to preserve a reputablefront, egalitarianism has escaped from a dark closet and is screaming to theworld that the motive of its compassionate, “humanitarian,” altruistic,collectivist brothers is not the desire to help the poor, but to destroy thecompetent. The motive is hatred of the good for being the good—a hatred focusedspecifically on the fountainhead of all goods, spiritual or material: the men ofability.The mental process underlying the egalitarians’ hope to achieve their goalconsists of three steps: 1. they believe that that which they refuse to identifydoes not exist; 2. therefore, human ability does not exist; and 3. therefore,they are free to devise social schemes which would obliterate this nonexistent.Of special significance to the present discussion is the egalitarians’ defianceof the Law of Causality: their demand for equal results from unequal causes—orequal rewards for unequal performance.As an example, I shall quote from a review by Bennett M. Berger, professor ofsociology at the University of California, San Diego (The New York Times BookReview, January 6, 1974). The review discusses a book entitled More Equality byHerbert Gans. I have not read and do not intend to read that book: it is thereviewer’s own notions that are particularly interesting and revealing.“[Herbert Gans] makes it clear from the start,” writes Mr. Berger, “that he’snot talking about equality of opportunity, which almost nobody seems to beagainst anymore, but about equality of ‘results,’ what used to be called‘equality of condition.’ . . . What he cares most about is reducing inequalitiesof income, wealth and political power. . . . More equality could be achieved,according to Gans, by income redistribution (mostly through a version of theCredit Income Tax) and by decentralizations of power ranging from more equalityin hierarchical organizations (e.g., corporations and universities) to a kind of‘community control’ that would provide to those minorities most victimized byinequality some insulation against being consistently outvoted by the relativelyaffluent majorities of the larger political constituencies.”If being consistently outvoted is a social injustice, what about bigbusinessmen, who are the smallest minority and would always be consistentlyoutvoted by other groups? Mr. Berger does not say, but since he consistentlyequates economic power with political power, and seems to believe that money canbuy anything, one can guess what his answer would be. And, in any case, he isnot an admirer of “democracy.”Mr. Berger reveals some of his motivation when he describes Herbert Gans as a“policy scientist” who suffers from a certain “malaise.” “Part of this malaiseis a nightmare in which ‘the policy scientist’—not poorly prepared, but in fullpossession of the facts, reasons and plans he needs to promote persuasively thechanges he advocates . . .—is frustrated, defeated, humiliated by Congressionalcommittees and executive staffs politically beholden to the constituencies andthe patrons who keep them in office.” In other words: they did not let him havehis way.Lest you think it is only material wealth that Mr. Berger is out to destroy,consider the following: “Decentralization of power, for example, doesn’tnecessarily produce more equality. . . . Even the direct democracy of the NewEngland town meeting . . . does very little to rid the local political communityof the excessive influence exercised by the more educated, the more articulate,the more politically hip.” This means that the educated and the ignorant, thearticulate and the incoherent, the politically active and the passive or inertshould have an equal influence and an equal power over everyone’s life. There isonly one instrument that can create an equality of this kind: a gun.Mr. Berger stresses that he agrees with Mr. Gans’s egalitarian goal, but hedoubts that it can be achieved by the open advocacy of more equality. And, withremarkably open cynicism, Mr. Berger suggests “another strategy”: “The advocacyof equality inevitably comes into conflict with other liberal values, such asindividualism and achievement. But . . . the advocacy of ‘citizenship’ does not,and the history of democracy is a history of political struggles to win more andmore ‘rights’ for more and more people to bring ever larger proportions of thepopulation to fully functioning citizenship. . . . in the 20th century therehave been struggles to remove racial and sexual impediments . . . to win rightsto decent housing, medical care, education—all on the grounds not of ‘equality,’but on the grounds that they are necessary conditions for citizens, equal bydefinition, to exercise their responsibility to govern themselves. Who knowswhat ‘rights’ lie over the horizon: a right to orgasm, to feel beautiful? Ithink these will make people better citizens.” In other words, he suggests thategalitarian goals can be achieved by blowing up the term “citizenship” into atotalitarian concept, i.e., a concept embracing all of life.If Mr. Berger is that open in advising the setting up of an ideological boobytrap, who are the boobs he expects to catch? The underendowed? The generalpublic? Or the intellectuals, whom he tempts with such bait as “a right toorgasm” in exchange for forgetting individualism and achievement? I hope yourguess is as good as mine.I will not argue against egalitarian doctrines by defending individualism,achievement, and the men of ability—not after writing Atlas Shrugged. I will letreality speak for me—it usually does.Under the heading of “Allende’s Legacy,” an article in The Wall Street Journal(April 19, 1974) offers some concrete, real-life examples of what happens whenincome, wealth and power are distributed equally among all men, regardless oftheir competence, character, knowledge, achievement, or brains.“By the time the military acted to overthrow the Allende government, prices hadsoared more than 1000 percent in two years and were climbing at the rate of 3percent a day at the very end. The national treasury was practically empty.” Thesocialist government had seized a number of American-owned industrial firms. Thenew military government invited the American managements to come back. Most ofthem accepted.Among them was the Dow Chemical Company, which owned a plastics plant in Chile.Bob G. Caldwell, Dow’s director of operations for South America, came with atechnical team to inspect the remains of their plant. “ ‘What we found wasunbelievable to us,’ he recalls. ‘The plant was still operable, but in anothersix months we wouldn’t have had any plant at all. They never checked anything.We found valves that hadn’t been maintained leaking corrosive chemicals thatwould have eventually eaten away practically everything.’ . . . Worse yet, thehighly inflammable chemicals handled at the plant were in imminent danger ofblowing up. ‘Safety went to pot,’ Mr. Caldwell says. ‘The fire-sprinkler systemwas disconnected and the valves taken away for some other use outside. Then theywere smoking in the most dangerous areas. They told us, “You didn’t have anyfires while you were here before, so it must not be as dangerous as you said.”’”I submit that the mentality represented by this last sentence, a mentalitycapable of functioning in this manner, is the loathsomely evil root of all humanevils.Apparently, some mentalities in the new Chilean government belong to the samecategory: they have the same range and scope, but the consequences of theiractions are not so immediately perceivable, though not much farther away. Inorder to avoid labor disputes, the new government has frozen all labor contractsin the form and on the terms established under the Allende regime. For example,the Dow Company’s contract includes a “requirement that all the plant’s plasticscrap be given to the union, which then sells it. ‘We hope to get that onechanged,’ a company official says, ‘because it’s a clear incentive to producealmost nothing but scrap.’ ”Then there is the case of a big Santiago textile firm. “Its contract with 1,300workers virtually guarantees bankruptcy. The textile firm’s employees get acertain amount of cloth free as part of their wages and can buy unlimitedquantities at a 37 percent discount; at those prices the firm loses money. UnderPresident Allende the workers sold the cloth on the black market at hugeprofits, and it was an important factor in assuring their backing for theAllende government.”How long can a company—or a country, or mankind—survive under a policy of thissort? Most people today do not see the answer, but some do. Material shortagesare the consequence of another, much more profound shortage, which is created byegalitarian governments and ignored by the public—until it is too late. “Chile’sexperiment with Marxism has also left the country with a shortage of engineersand technicians that could reach serious proportions. Thousands of them leftduring the Allende regime. Despite incentives offered by the junta, they haven’tbeen coming back, and many more key people continue to leave for higher-payingjobs abroad. . . . ‘Here in Chile [says a business executive] we must get usedto the fact that good people must be paid well.’ ”But here in the United States, we are told to get used to the idea that theymust not.There is no such thing as “good people,” cries Professor Berger—or ProfessorGans, or Professor Rawls—and if some are good, it’s because they’re exploitingthose who aren’t. There is no such thing as “key people,” says Professor Berger,we’re all equal by definition. No, says Professor Rawls, some were born withunfair advantages, such as intelligence, and should be made to atone for it tothose who weren’t. We want more equality, says Professor Gans, so that those whodevise sprinkler systems and those who smoke around inflammable chemicals wouldhave equal pay, equal influence, and an equal voice in the community control ofscience and production.The term “brain drain” is known the world over: it names a problem which variousgovernments are beginning to recognize, and are trying to solve by chaining themen of ability to their homelands—yet social theoreticians see no connectionbetween intelligence and production. The best among men are running—from everycorner and slave-pen of the globe—running in search of freedom. Their refusal tocooperate with slave drivers is the noblest moral action they could take—and,incidentally, the greatest service they could render mankind—but they don’t knowit. No voices are raised anywhere in their honor, in acknowledgment of theirvalue, in recognition of their importance. Those whose job it is to know—thosewho profess concern with the plight of the world—look on and say nothing. Theintellectuals turn their eyes away, refusing to know—the practical men do know,but keep silent.One can’t blame the dazed brutes of Chile, who swoop down on an industrial plantand cavort at a black-market fiesta, for not understanding that the plant cannotrun at a loss—if their social superiors tell them that they are entitled to moreequality. One can’t blame savages for not understanding that everything has itsprice, and what they steal, seize or extort today will be paid for by their ownstarvation tomorrow—if their social superiors, in management offices, inuniversity classrooms, in newspaper columns, in parliamentary halls, are afraidto tell them.What are all those people counting on? If a Chilean factory goes bankrupt, theequalizers will find another factory to loot. If that other factory startscrumbling, it will get a loan from the bank. If the bank has no money, it willget a loan from the government. If the government has no money, it will get aloan from a foreign government. If no foreign government has any money, all ofthem will get a loan from the United States.What they don’t know—and neither does this country—is that the United States isbroke.Justice does exist in the world, whether people choose to practice it or not.The men of ability are being avenged. The avenger is reality. Its weapon isslow, silent, invisible, and men perceive it only by its consequences—by thegutted ruins and the moans of agony it leaves in its wake. The name of theweapon is: inflation.Inflation is a man-made scourge, made possible by the fact that most men do notunderstand it. It is a crime committed on so large a scale that its size is itsprotection: the integrating capacity of the victims’ minds breaks down beforethe magnitude—and the seeming complexity—of the crime, which permits it to becommitted openly, in public. For centuries, inflation has been wrecking onecountry after another, yet men learn nothing, offer no resistance, andperish—not like animals driven to slaughter, but worse: like animals stampedingin search of a butcher.If I told you that the precondition of inflation is psycho-epistemological—thatinflation is hidden under perceptual illusions created by broken conceptuallinks—you would not understand me. That is what I propose to explain and toprove.Let us start at the beginning. Observe the fact that, as a human being, you arecompelled by nature to eat at least once a day. In a modern American city, thisis not a major problem. You can carry your sustenance in your pocket—in the formof a few coins. You can give it no thought, you can skip meals, and, when you’rehungry, you can grab a sandwich or open a can of food—which, you believe, willalways be there.But project what the necessity to eat would mean in nature, i.e., if you werealone in a primeval wilderness. Hunger, nature’s ultimatum, would make demandson you daily, but the satisfaction of the demands would not be availableimmediately: the satisfaction takes time—and tools. It takes time to hunt and tomake your weapons. You have other needs as well. You need clothing—it takes timeto kill a leopard and to get its skin. You need shelter—it takes time to build ahut, and food to sustain you while you’re building it. The satisfaction of yourdaily physical needs would absorb all of your time. Observe that time is theprice of your survival, and that it has to be paid in advance.Would it make any difference if there were ten of you, instead of one? If therewere a hundred of you? A thousand? A hundred thousand? Do not let the numbersconfuse you: in regard to nature, the facts will remain inexorably the same.Socially, the large numbers may enable some men to enslave others and to livewithout effort, but unless a sufficient number of men are able to hunt, all ofyou will perish and so will your rulers.The issue becomes much clearer when you discover agriculture. You can survivemore safely and comfortably by planting seeds and collecting a harvest monthslater—on condition that you comply with two absolutes of nature: you must saveenough of your harvest to feed you until the next harvest, and, above all, youmust save enough seeds to plant your next harvest. You may run short on your ownfood, you may have to skimp and go half-hungry, but, under penalty of death, youdo not touch your stock seed; if you do, you’re through.Agriculture is the first step toward civilization, because it requires asignificant advance in men’s conceptual development: it requires that they grasptwo cardinal concepts which the perceptual, concrete-bound mentality of thehunters could not grasp fully: time and savings. Once you grasp these, you havegrasped the three essentials of human survival: time-savings-production. Youhave grasped the fact that production is not a matter confined to the immediatemoment, but a continuous process, and that production is fueled by previousproduction. The concept of “stock seed” unites the three essentials and appliesnot merely to agriculture, but much, much more widely: to all forms ofproductive work. Anything above the level of a savage’s precarious,hand-to-mouth existence requires savings. Savings buy time.If you live on a self-sustaining farm, you save your grain: you need the savedharvest of your good years to carry you through the bad ones; you need yoursaved seed to expand your production—to plant a larger field. The safer yoursupply of food, the more time it buys for the upkeep or improvement of the otherthings you need: your clothing, your shelter, your water well, your livestockand, above all, your tools, such as your plow. You make a gigantic step forwardwhen you discover that you can trade with other farmers, which leads you all tothe discovery of the road to an advanced civilization: the division of labor.Let us say that there are a hundred of you; each learns to specialize in theproduction of some goods needed by all, and you trade your products by directbarter. All of you become more expert at your tasks—therefore, moreproductive—therefore, your time brings you better returns.On a self-sustaining farm, your savings consisted mainly of stored grain andfoodstuffs; but grain and foodstuffs are perishable and cannot be kept for long,so you ate what you could not save; your time-range was limited. Now, yourhorizon has been pushed immeasurably farther. You don’t have to expand thestorage of your food: you can trade your grains for some commodity which willkeep longer, and which you can trade for food when you need it. But whichcommodity? It is thus that you arrive at the next gigantic discovery: you devisea tool of exchange—money.Money is the tool of men who have reached a high level of productivity and along-range control over their lives. Money is not merely a tool of exchange:much more importantly, it is a tool of saving, which permits delayed consumptionand buys time for future production. To fulfill this requirement, money has tobe some material commodity which is imperishable, rare, homogeneous, easilystored, not subject to wide fluctuations of value, and always in demand amongthose you trade with. This leads you to the decision to use gold as money. Goldmoney is a tangible value in itself and a token of wealth actually produced.When you accept a gold coin in payment for your goods, you actually deliver thegoods to the buyer; the transaction is as safe as simple barter. When you storeyour savings in the form of gold coins, they represent the goods which you haveactually produced and which have gone to buy time for other producers, who willkeep the productive process going, so that you’ll be able to trade your coinsfor goods any time you wish.Now project what would happen to your community of a hundred hard-working,prosperous, forward-moving people, if one man were allowed to trade on yourmarket, not by means of gold, but by means of paper—i.e., if he paid you, notwith a material commodity, not with goods he had actually produced, but merelywith a promissory note on his future production. This man takes your goods, butdoes not use them to support his own production; he does not produce at all—hemerely consumes the goods. Then, he pays you higher prices for more goods—againin promissory notes—assuring you that he is your best customer, who expands yourmarket.Then, one day, a struggling young farmer, who suffered from a bad flood, wantsto buy some grain from you, but your price has risen and you haven’t much grainto spare, so he goes bankrupt. Then, the dairy farmer, to whom he owed money,raises the price of milk to make up for the loss—and the truck farmer, who needsthe milk, gives up buying the eggs he had always bought—and the poultry farmerkills some of his chickens, which he can’t afford to feed—and the alfalfagrower, who can’t afford the higher price of eggs, sells some of his stock seedand cuts down on his planting—and the dairy farmer can’t afford the higher priceof alfalfa, so he cancels his order to the blacksmith—and you want to buy thenew plow you have been saving for, but the blacksmith has gone bankrupt. Thenall of you present the promissory notes to your “best customer,” and youdiscover that they were promissory notes not on his future production, but onyours—only you have nothing left to produce with. Your land is there, yourstructures are there, but there is no food to sustain you through the comingwinter, and no stock seed to plant.Would it make any difference if that community consisted of a thousand farmers?A hundred thousand? A million? Two hundred and eleven million? The entire globe?No matter how widely you spread the blight, no matter what variety of productsand what incalculable complexity of deals become involved, this, dear readers,is the cause, the pattern, and the outcome of inflation.There is only one institution that can arrogate to itself the power legally totrade by means of rubber checks: the government. And it is the only institutionthat can mortgage your future without your knowledge or consent: governmentsecurities (and paper money) are promissory notes on future tax receipts, i.e.,on your future production.Now project the mentality of a savage, who can grasp nothing but the concretesof the immediate moment, and who finds himself transported into the midst of amodern, industrial civilization. If he is an intelligent savage, he will acquirea smattering of knowledge, but there are two concepts he will not be able tograsp: “credit” and “market.”He observes that people get food, clothes, and all sorts of objects simply bypresenting pieces of paper called checks—and he observes that skyscrapers andgigantic factories spring out of the ground at the command of very rich men,whose bookkeepers keep switching magic figures from the ledgers of one to thoseof another and another and another. This seems to be done faster than he canfollow, so he concludes that speed is the secret of the magic power of paper—andthat everyone will work and produce and prosper, so long as those checks arepassed from hand to hand fast enough. If that savage breaks into print with hisdiscovery, he will find that he has been anticipated by John Maynard Keynes.Then the savage observes that the department stores are full of wonderful goods,but people do not seem to buy them. “Why is that?” he asks a floorwalker. “Wedon’t have enough of a market,” the floorwalker tells him. “What is that?” heasks. “Well,” his new teacher answers, “goods are produced for people toconsume, it’s the consumers that make the world go ’round, but we don’t haveenough consumers.” “Is that so?” says the savage, his eyes flashing with thefire of a new idea. Next day, he obtains a check from a big educationalfoundation, he hires a plane, he flies away—and comes back, a while later,bringing his entire naked, barefoot tribe along. “You don’t know how good theyare at consuming,” he tells his friend, the floorwalker, “and there’s plentymore where these came from. Pretty soon you’ll get a raise in pay.” But thestore, pretty soon, goes bankrupt.The poor savage is unable to understand it to this day—because he had made surethat many, many people agreed with his idea, among them many noble tribalchiefs, such as Governor Romney, who sang incantations to “consumerism,” andwarrior Nader, who fought for the consumers’ rights, and big business chieftainswho recited formulas about serving the consumers, and chiefs who sat inCongress, and chiefs in the White House, and chiefs in every government inEurope, and many more professors than he could count.Perhaps it is harder for us to understand that the mentality of that savage hasbeen ruling Western civilization for almost a century.Trained in college to believe that to look beyond the immediate moment—to lookfor causes or to foresee consequences—is impossible, modern men have developedcontext-dropping as their normal method of cognition. Observing a bad,small-town shopkeeper, the kind who is doomed to fail, they believe—as hedoes—that lack of customers is his only problem; and that the question of thegoods he sells, or where these goods come from, has nothing to do with it. Thegoods, they believe, are here and will always be here. Therefore, they conclude,the consumer—not the producer—is the motor of an economy. Let us extend credit,i.e., our savings, to the consumers—they advise—in order to expand the marketfor our goods.But, in fact, consumers qua consumers are not part of anyone’s market; quaconsumers, they are irrelevant to economics. Nature does not grant anyone aninnate title of “consumer”; it is a title that has to be earned—by production.Only producers constitute a market—only men who trade products or services forproducts or services. In the role of producers, they represent a market’s“supply”; in the role of consumers, they represent a market’s “demand.” The lawof supply and demand has an implicit subclause: that it involves the same peoplein both capacities. When this subclause is forgotten, ignored or evaded—you getthe economic situation of today.A successful producer can support many people, e.g., his children, by delegatingto them his market power of consumer. Can that capacity be unlimited? How manymen would you be able to feed on a self-sustaining farm? In more primitivetimes, farmers used to raise large families in order to obtain farm labor, i.e.,productive help. How many non-productive people could you support by your owneffort? If the number were unlimited, if demand became greater than supply—ifdemand were turned into a command, as it is today—you would have to use andexhaust your stock seed. This is the process now going on in this country.There is only one institution that could bring it about: the government—with thehelp of a vicious doctrine that serves as a cover-up: altruism. The visibleprofiteers of altruism—the welfare recipients—are part victims, part windowdressing for the statist policies of the government. But no government couldhave got away with it, if people had grasped the other concept which the savagewas unable to grasp: the concept of “credit.”If you understand the function of stock seed—of savings—in a primitive farmcommunity, apply the same principle to a complex industrial economy.Wealth represents goods that have been produced, but not consumed. What would aman do with his wealth in terms of direct barter? Let us say a successful shoemanufacturer wants to enlarge his production. His wealth consists of shoes; hetrades some shoes for the things he needs as a consumer, but he saves a largenumber of shoes and trades them for building materials, machinery and labor tobuild a new factory—and another large number of shoes, for raw materials and forthe labor he will employ to manufacture more shoes. Money facilitates thistrading, but does not change its nature. All the physical goods and services heneeds for his project must actually exist and be available for trade—just as hispayment for them must actually exist in the form of physical goods (in thiscase, shoes). An exchange of paper money (or even of gold coins) would not doany good to any of the parties involved, if the physical things they needed werenot there and could not be obtained in exchange for the money.If a man does not consume his goods at once, but saves them for the future,whether he wants to enlarge his production or to live on his savings (which heholds in the form of money)—in either case, he is counting on the fact that hewill be able to exchange his money for the things he needs, when and as he needsthem. This means that he is relying on a continuous process of production—whichrequires an uninterrupted flow of goods saved to fuel further and furtherproduction. This flow is “investment capital,” the stock seed of industry. Whena rich man lends money to others, what he lends to them is the goods which hehas not consumed.This is the meaning of the concept “investment.” If you have wondered how onecan start producing, when nature requites time paid in advance, this is thebeneficent process that enables men to do it: a successful man lends his goodsto a promising beginner (or to any reputable producer)—in exchange for thepayment of interest. The payment is for the risk he is taking: nature does notguarantee man’s success, neither on a farm nor in a factory. If the venturefails, it means that the goods have been consumed without a productive return,so the investor loses his money; if the venture succeeds, the producer pays theinterest out of the new goods, the profits, which the investment enabled him tomake.Observe, and bear in mind above all else, that this process applies only tofinancing the needs of production, not of consumption—and that its success restson the investor’s judgment of men’s productive ability, not on his compassionfor their feelings, hopes or dreams.Such is the meaning of the term “credit.” In all its countless variations andapplications, “credit” means money, i.e., unconsumed goods, loaned by oneproductive person (or group) to another, to be repaid out of future production.Even the credit extended for a consumption purpose, such as the purchase of anautomobile, is based on the productive record and prospects of the borrower.Credit is not—as the savage believed—a magic piece of paper that reverses causeand effect, and transforms consumption into a source of production.Consumption is the final, not the efficient, cause of production. The efficientcause is savings, which can be said to represent the opposite of consumption:they represent unconsumed goods. Consumption is the end of production, and adead end, as far as the productive process is concerned. The worker who producesso little that he consumes everything he earns, carries his own weighteconomically, but contributes nothing to future production. The worker who has amodest savings account, and the millionaire who invests a fortune (and all themen in between), are those who finance the future. The man who consumes withoutproducing is a parasite, whether he is a welfare recipient or a rich playboy.An industrial economy is enormously complex: it involves calculations of time,of motion, of credit, and long sequences of interlocking contractual exchanges.This complexity is the system’s great virtue and the source of itsvulnerability. The vulnerability is psycho-epistemological. No human mind and nocomputer—and no planner—can grasp the complexity in every detail. Even to graspthe principles that rule it, is a major feat of abstraction. This is where theconceptual links of men’s integrating capacity break down: most people areunable to grasp the working of their home-town’s economy, let alone thecountry’s or the world’s. Under the influence of today’s mind-shrinking,anti-conceptual education, most people tend to see economic problems in terms ofimmediate concretes: of their paychecks, their landlords, and the corner grocerystore. The most disastrous loss—which broke their tie to reality—is the loss ofthe concept that money stands for existing, but unconsumed goods.The system’s complexity serves, occasionally, as a temporary cover for theoperations of some shady characters. You have all heard of some manipulator whodoes not work, but lives in luxury by obtaining a loan, which he repays byobtaining another loan elsewhere, which he repays by obtaining another loan,etc. You know that his policy can’t go on forever, that it catches up with himeventually and he crashes. But what if that manipulator is the government?The government is not a productive enterprise. It produces nothing. In respectto its legitimate functions—which are the police, the army, the law courts—itperforms a service needed by a productive economy. When a government stepsbeyond these functions, it becomes an economy’s destroyer.The government has no source of revenue, except the taxes paid by the producers.To free itself—for a while—from the limits set by reality, the governmentinitiates a credit con game on a scale which the private manipulator could notdream of. It borrows money from you today, which is to be repaid with money itwill borrow from you tomorrow, which is to be repaid with money it will borrowfrom you day after tomorrow, and so on. This is known as “deficit financing.” Itis made possible by the fact that the government cuts the connection betweengoods and money. It issues paper money, which is used as a claim check onactually existing goods—but that money is not backed by any goods, it is notbacked by gold, it is backed by nothing. It is a promissory note issued to youin exchange for your goods, to be paid by you (in the form of taxes) out of yourfuture production.Where does your money go? Anywhere and nowhere. First, it goes to establish analtruistic excuse and window dressing for the rest: to establish a system ofsubsidized consumption—a “welfare” class of men who consume without producing—agrowing dead end, imposed on a shrinking production. Then the money goes tosubsidize any pressure group at the expense of any other—to buy their votes—tofinance any project conceived at the whim of any bureaucrat or his friends—topay for the failure of that project, to start another, etc. The welfarerecipients are not the worst part of the producers’ burden. The worst part arethe bureaucrats—the government officials who are given the power to regulateproduction. They are not merely unproductive consumers: their jobs consist inmaking it harder and harder and, ultimately, impossible for the producers toproduce. (Most of them are men whose ultimate goal is to place all producers inthe position of welfare recipients.)While the government struggles to save one crumbling enterprise at the expenseof the crumbling of another, it accelerates the process of juggling debts,switching losses, piling loans on loans, mortgaging the future and the future’sfuture. As things grow worse, the government protects itself not by contractingthis process, but by expanding it. The process becomes global: it involvesforeign aid, and unpaid loans to foreign governments, and subsidies to otherwelfare states, and subsidies to the United Nations, and subsidies to the WorldBank, and subsidies to foreign producers, and credits to foreign consumers toenable them to consume our goods—while, simultaneously, the American producers,who are paying for it all, are left without protection, and their properties areseized by any sheik in any pesthole of the globe, and the wealth they havecreated, as well as their energy, is turned against them, as, for example, inthe case of Middle Eastern oil.Do you think a spending orgy of this kind could be paid for out of currentproduction? No, the situation is much worse than that. The government isconsuming this country’s stock seed—the stock seed of industrial production:investment capital, i.e., the savings needed to keep production going. Thesesavings were not paper, but actual goods. Under all the complexities of privatecredit, the economy was kept going by the fact that, in one form or another, inone place or another, somewhere within it, actual material goods existed to backits financial transactions. It kept going long after that protection wasbreached. Today, the goods are almost gone.A piece of paper will not feed you when there is no bread to eat. It will notbuild a factory when there are no steel girders to buy. It will not make shoeswhen there is no leather, no machines, no fuel. You have heard it said thattoday’s economy is afflicted by sudden, unpredictable shortages of variouscommodities. These are the advance symptoms of what is to come.You have heard economists say that they are puzzled by the nature of today’sproblem: they are unable to understand why inflation is accompanied byrecession—which is contrary to their Keynesian doctrines; and they have coined aridiculous name for it: “stagflation.” Their theories ignore the fact that moneycan function only so long as it represents actual goods—and that at a certainstage of inflating the money supply, the government begins to consume a nation’sinvestment capital, thus making production impossible.The value of the total tangible assets of the United States at present, wasestimated—in terms of 1968 dollars—at 3.1 trillion dollars. If governmentspending continues, that incredible wealth will not save you. You may be leftwith all the magnificent skyscrapers, the giant factories, the richfarmlands—but without fuel, without electricity, without transportation, withoutsteel, without paper, without seeds to plant the next harvest.If that time comes, the government will declare explicitly the premise on whichit has been acting implicitly: that its only “capital asset” is you. Since youwill not be able to work any longer, the government will take over and will makeyou work—on a slope descending to sub-industrial production. The only substitutefor technological energy is the muscular labor of slaves. This is the way aneconomic collapse leads to dictatorship—as it did in Germany and in Russia. Andif anyone thinks that government planning is a solution to the problems of humansurvival, observe that after half a century of total dictatorship, Soviet Russiais begging for American wheat and for American industrial “know-how.”A dictatorship would find it impossible to rule this country in the foreseeablefuture. What is possible is the blind chaos of a civil war.It is at a time like this, in the face of an approaching economic collapse, thatthe intellectuals are preaching egalitarian notions. When the curtailment ofgovernment spending is imperative, they demand more welfare projects. When theneed for men of productive ability is desperate, they demand more equality forthe incompetents. When the country needs the accumulation of capital, theydemand that we soak the rich. When the country needs more savings, they demand a“redistribution of income.” They demand more jobs and less profits—more jobs andfewer factories—more jobs and no fuel, no oil, no coal, no “pollution”—but,above all, more goods for free to more consumers, no matter what happens tojobs, to factories, or to producers.The results of their Keynesian economics are wrecking every industrial country,but they refuse to question their basic assumptions. The examples of SovietRussia, of Nazi Germany, of Red China, of Marxist Chile, of socialist Englandare multiplying around them, but they refuse to see and to learn. Today,production is the world’s most urgent need, and the threat of starvation isspreading through the globe; the intellectuals know the only economic systemthat can and did produce unlimited abundance, but they give it no thought andkeep silent about it, as if it had never existed. It is almost irrelevant toblame them for their default at the task of intellectual leadership: thesmallness of their stature is overwhelming.Is there any hope for the future of this country? Yes, there is. This countryhas one asset left: the matchless productive ability of its people. If, and tothe extent that, this ability is liberated, we might still have a chance toavoid a collapse. We cannot expect to reach the ideal overnight, but we must atleast reveal its name. We must reveal to this country the secret which all thoseposturing intellectuals of any political denomination, who clamor for opennessand truth, are trying so hard to cover up: that the name of that miraculousproductive system is Capitalism.As to such things as taxes and the rebuilding of a country, I will say that inhis goals, if not his methods, the best economist in Atlas Shrugged was RagnarDanneskjöld."},{"pageContent":"13The Stimulus and the Response1972THE STIMULUSThere are occasions when a worthless, insignificant book acquires significanceas a scrap of litmus paper exposing a culture’s intellectual state. Such a bookis Beyond Freedom and Dignity by B. F. Skinner.“Skinner is the most influential of living American psychologists . . .” saysTime magazine (September 20, 1971). “Skinner has remained a highly influentialfigure among U.S. college students for well over a decade,” says Newsweek(September 20, 1971). “Burrhus Frederic Skinner is the most influentialpsychologist alive today, and he is second only to Freud as the most importantpsychologist of all time. This, at least, is the feeling of 56 percent of themembers of the American Psychological Association, who were polled on thequestion. And it should be reason enough to make Dr. Skinner’s new book, BeyondFreedom and Dignity, one of the most important happenings in 20th-centurypsychology,” says Science News (August 7, 1971).One cannot evaluate the cultural significance of such statements until oneidentifies the nature of their object.The book itself is like Boris Karloff’s embodiment of Frankenstein’s monster: acorpse patched with nuts, bolts and screws from the junkyard of philosophy(Pragmatism, Social Darwinism, Positivism, Linguistic Analysis, with some nailsby Hume, threads by Russell, and glue by the New York Post). The book’s voice,like Karloff’s, is an emission of inarticulate, moaning growls—directed at aspecial enemy: “Autonomous Man.”“Autonomous Man” is the term used by Mr. Skinner to denote man’s consciousnessin all those aspects which distinguish it from the sensory level of an animal’sconsciousness—specifically: reason, mind, values, concepts, thought, judgment,volition, purpose, memory, independence, self-esteem. These, he asserts, do notexist; they are an illusion, a myth, a “prescientific” superstition. His termmay be taken to include everything we call “man’s inner world,” except that Mr.Skinner would never allow such an expression; whenever he has to refer to man’sinner world, he says: “Inside your skin.”“Inside his skin,” man is totally determined by his environment (and by hisgenetic endowment, which was determined by his ancestors’ environment), Mr.Skinner asserts, and totally malleable. By controlling the environment,“behavioral technologists” could—and should—control men inside out. If peoplewere brought to give up individual autonomy and to join Mr. Skinner inproclaiming: “To man qua man we readily say good riddance” (p. 201), thebehavioral technologists would create a new species and a perfect world. This isthe book’s thesis.One expects that an assertion of this kind would be supported by somedemonstration or indication of the methods these technologists will use in orderto manipulate those non-autonomous bipeds. Curiously enough, there is no suchindication in the book. I may be flattering Mr. Skinner, but it occurred to methat perhaps the book itself was intended to be a demonstration of the methodshe envisions.There are certain conditions which the book requires of its readers: (a) Beingout of focus. (b) Skimming. (c) Self-doubt. (d) The premise, when confrontedwith outrageous absurdity: “I don’t get it, but he must have reasons for sayingit.”These conditions will bring the reader to miss the main ingredients of thebook’s epistemological method, which are: 1. Equivocation. 2. Substitutingmetaphors for proof, and examples for definitions. 3. Setting up and knockingdown straw men. 4. Mentioning a given notion as controversial, following it upwith two or three pages of irrelevant small talk, then mentioning it again andtreating it as if it had been proved. 5. Raising valid questions (to indicatethat the author is aware of them) and, by the same technique, leaving themunanswered. 6. Overtalking and overloading the reader’s consciousness withoverelaborate discussions of trivia, then smuggling in enormous essentialswithout discussion, as if they were incontrovertible. 7. Assuming anauthoritarian tone to enunciate dogmatic absolutes—and the more dubious theabsolute, the more authoritarian the tone. 8. Providing a brief summary at theend of each chapter, which summary includes, as if they had been proved, notionsnot included or barely mentioned in the chapter’s text.All of this (and more) is done grossly, crudely, obviously, which leaves thebook pockmarked with gaping craters of contradictions, like a moon landscape andas lifelessly dull.In Atlas Shrugged, I discussed two variants of mysticism: the mystics of spiritand the mystics of muscle, “those who believe in consciousness without existenceand those who believe in existence without consciousness. Both demand thesurrender of your mind, one to their revelations, the other to their reflexes.”I said that their aims are alike: “in matter—the enslavement of man’s body, inspirit—the destruction of his mind.”Mr. Skinner is a mystic of muscle—so extreme, complete, all-out a mystic ofmuscle that one could not use him in fiction: he sounds like a caricature.At the start of his book, what he demands of his readers is: faith. “In whatfollows, these issues are discussed ‘from a scientific point of view,’ but thisdoes not mean that the reader will need to know the details of a scientificanalysis of behavior. A mere interpretation will suffice. . . . The instances ofbehavior cited in what follows are not offered as ‘proof’ of the interpretation.The proof is to be found in the basic analysis. The principles used ininterpreting the instances have a plausibility which would be lacking inprinciples drawn entirely from casual observation.” (Pp. 22-23.)This means: the proof of Mr. Skinner’s theory is inaccessible to laymen, whomust take him on faith, substituting “plausibility” for logic: if his“interpretation” sounds plausible, it means that he has valid (“non-casual”)reasons for expounding it. This is offered as scientific epistemology.(It must be noted that Mr. Skinner’s interpretations of the “scientific analysisof behavior” are rejected by a great many experts initiated into its highermysteries, not only by psychiatrists and by psychologists of different schools,but even by his own fellow-behaviorists.)As a cover against criticism, Mr. Skinner resorts to the mystics’ usualscapegoat: language. “The text will often seem inconsistent. English, like alllanguages, is full of prescientific terms . . . but the issues are important tothe nonspecialist and need to be discussed in a nontechnical fashion.” (Pp.23-24.) The mystics of spirit accuse language of being “materialistic”; Mr.Skinner accuses it of being “mentalistic.” Both regard their own theories asineffable, i.e., incommunicable in language.Many psychologists are envious of the prestige—and the achievements—of thephysical sciences, which they try not to emulate, but to imitate. Mr. Skinner isarchetypical in this respect: he is passionately intent on being accepted as a“scientist” and complains that only “Autonomous Man” stands in the way of suchacceptance (which, I am sure, is true). Mr. Skinner points out scornfully thatprimitive men, who were unable to see the difference between living beings andinanimate objects, ascribed the objects’ motions to conscious gods or demons,and that science could not begin until this belief was discarded. In the name ofscience, Mr. Skinner switches defiantly to the other side of the same basiccoin: accepting the belief that consciousness is supernatural, he refuses toaccept the existence of man’s mind.All human behavior, he asserts, is the product of a process called “operantconditioning”—and all the functions we ascribe to “Autonomous Man” are performedby a single agent called a “reinforcer.” In view of the omnipotence ascribed tothis agent throughout the book, a definition would have been very helpful, buthere is all we get: “When a bit of behavior is followed by a certain kind ofconsequence, it is more likely to occur again, and a consequence having thiseffect is called a reinforcer. Food, for example, is a reinforcer to a hungryorganism; anything the organism does that is followed by the receipt of food ismore likely to be done again whenever the organism is hungry. . . . Negativereinforcers are called aversive in the sense that they are the things organisms‘turn away from.’ ” (P. 27.)If you assume this means that a “reinforcer” is something which causes pleasureor pain, you will be wrong, because, on page 107, Mr. Skinner declares: “Thereis no important causal connection between the reinforcing effect of a stimulusand the feelings to which it gives rise. . . . What is maximized or minimized,or what is ultimately good or bad, are things, not feelings, and men work toachieve them or to avoid them not because of the way they feel but because theyare positive or negative reinforcers.” Then by what means or process do these“reinforcers” affect man’s actions? In the whole of the book, no answer isgiven.The only social difference between positive and negative “reinforcers” is thefact that the latter provoke “counterattack” or rebellion, and the former donot. Both are means of controlling man’s behavior. “Productive labor, forexample, was once the result of punishment: the slave worked to avoid theconsequences of not working. Wages exemplify a different principle: a person ispaid when he behaves in a given way so that he will continue to behave in thatway.” (P. 32.)From this bit of package-dealing, context-dropping, anddefinition-by-nonessentials, Mr. Skinner slides to the assertion thatslave-driving and wage-paying are both “techniques of control,” then to thegigantic equivocation which underlies most of the others in his book: that everyhuman relationship, every instance of men dealing with one another, is a form ofcontrol. You are “controlled” by the grocer across the street, because if hewere not there, you would shop elsewhere. You are controlled by the person whopraises you (praise is a “positive reinforcer”), and by the person who blamesyou (blame is an “aversive reinforcer”), etc., etc., etc.Here Mr. Skinner revives the ancient saw to the effect that volition is anillusion, because one is not free if one has reasons for one’s actions—and thattrue volition would consist in acting on whim, a causeless, unaccountable,inexplicable whim exercised in a vacuum, free of any contact with reality.From this, Mr. Skinner’s next step is easy: political freedom, he declares,necessitates the use of “aversive reinforcers,” i.e., punishment for evilbehavior. Since you are not free anyway, but controlled by everyone at alltimes, why not let specialists control you in a scientific way and design foryou a world consisting of nothing but “positive reinforcers”?What kind of world would that be? Here, Mr. Skinner seems to make a “Freudianslip”: he is surprisingly explicit. “. . . it should be possible to design aworld in which behavior likely to be punished seldom or never occurs. We try todesign such a world for those who cannot solve the problem of punishment forthemselves, such as babies, retardates, or psychotics, and if it could be donefor everyone, much time and energy would be saved.” (P. 66.)“. . . There is no reason,” he declares, “why progress toward a world in whichpeople may be automatically good should be impeded.” (P. 67.) No reason atall—provided you are willing to view yourself as a baby, a retardate or apsychotic.“Dignity” is Mr. Skinner’s odd choice of a designation for what is normallycalled “moral worth”—and he disposes of it by asserting that it consists ingaining the admiration of other people. Through a peculiar jumble of examples,which includes unrequited love, heroic deeds, and scientific (i.e.,intellectual) achievements, Mr. Skinner labors to convince us that: “. . . weare likely to admire behavior more as we understand it less” (P. 53), and: “. .. the behavior we admire is the behavior we cannot yet explain.” (P. 58.) It ismere vanity, he asserts, that makes our heroes cling to “dignity” and resist“scientific” analysis, because, once their achievements are explained, they willdeserve no greater admiration—and no greater credit—than anyone else.This last is the core, essence and purpose of his jumbled argument; the rest ofthe verbiage is merely a haphazard cover. There is a kind of veiled,subterranean intensity in Mr. Skinner’s tired prose whenever he stresses thepoint that men should be given no credit for their virtues or theirachievements. The behavior of a creative genius (my expression, not Mr.Skinner’s) is determined by “contingencies of reinforcement,” just like thebehavior of a criminal, and neither of them can help it, and neither should beadmired or blamed. Unlike other modern determinists, Mr. Skinner is notconcerned primarily with the elimination of blame, but with the elimination ofcredit.This sort of concern is almost self-explanatory. But I did find it surprisingthat Mr. Skinner includes achievement among the roots of moral worth (of“dignity”). He and I are probably the only two theoreticians who understand—fromopposite moral poles—how much depends on this issue.In reason, one would expect that so thorough a determinist as Mr. Skinner wouldnot deal with questions of morality; but his abolition of reason frees him fromconcern with contradictions. Beyond Freedom and Dignity is a normative tract,prescribing the actions men ought to take (even though they have no volition),and the motives and beliefs they ought to adopt (even though there are no suchthings).From the casual observation that “ethos and mores refer to the customarypractices of a group” (pp. 112- 113), Mr. Skinner slides to the assertion thatmorality is exclusively social, that moral principles are inculcated throughsocially designed contingencies of reinforcement “under which a person isinduced to behave for the good of others,” (p. 112)—then to the notion, smuggledin as an undiscussed absolute, that morality is behavior for the good ofothers—and then to the following remarkable passage: “The value or validity ofthe reinforcers used by other people and by organized agencies may bequestioned: ‘Why should I seek the admiration or avoid the censure of my fellowmen?’ ‘What can my government—or any government—really do to me?’ ‘Can a churchactually determine whether I am to be eternally damned or blessed?’ ‘What is sowonderful about money—do I need all the things it buys?’ ‘Why should I study thethings set forth in a college catalogue?’ In short, ‘Why should I behave “forthe good of others”?’ ” (Pp. 117-118.)Yes, read that quotation over again. I had to, before I realized what Mr.Skinner means: he means that the asking of such questions is a violation of thegood of others, because it challenges socially inculcated principles of behavior(so that even the pursuit of money or of a college education represents, notone’s own good, but the good of others). And wider: all principles of long-rangeaction, moral or practical, represent the good of others, because all principlesare a social product.This is supported by the statements immediately following the above quotation:“When the control exercised by others is thus evaded or destroyed, only thepersonal reinforcers are left. The individual turns to immediate gratification,possibly through sex or drugs.” (P. 118.) Just as altruism is the primeval moralcode of all mystics, of spirit or muscle, so this view of an individual’sself-interest is their primordial cliche. But Mr. Skinner adds someepistemological “explanations” of his own.Man, he asserts, is aware of nothing but the immediate moment: he has nocapacity to form abstractions, to act by intention, to project the future.“Behavior is shaped and maintained by its consequences” (p. 18), and: “Behaviorcannot really be affected by anything which follows it, but if a ‘consequence’is immediate, it may overlap the behavior.” (P. 120.) Evolution, he asserts, didthe rest. “The process of operant conditioning presumably evolved when thoseorganisms which were more sensitively affected by the consequences of theirbehavior were better able to adjust to the environment and survive.” (P. 120.)What is this “sensitivity” and through what organ or faculty docs it operate? Noanswer.Claiming that man’s first discoveries (such as banking a fire) were purelyaccidental (pp. 121-122), Mr. Skinner concludes that other men learned, somehow,to imitate those lucky practices. “One advantage in being a social animal isthat one need not discover practices for oneself.” (P. 122.) As to thetime-range of man’s awareness, Mr. Skinner asserts: “Probably no one plants inthe spring simply because he then harvests in the fall. Planting would not beadaptive or ‘reasonable’ if there were no connection with a harvest, but oneplants in the spring because of more immediate contingencies, most of themarranged by the social environment.” (P. 122.) How is this done by a socialenvironment consisting of men who are unable to think long-range? No answer.The phenomenon of language is a problem to a mystic of muscle. Mr. Skinner getsaround it semantically, by calling it “verbal behavior.” “Verbal behaviorpresumably arose under contingencies involving practical social interactions . ..” (P. 122.) How? No answer. “Verbal behavior” is a means of controlling men,because words, somehow, become associated with physical “reinforcers.” To beexact, one cannot use the word “words” in Mr. Skinner’s context: it is sounds ormarks on paper that acquire an associational link with the omnipotent“reinforcers” and stick inside a man’s skin, forming “a repertoire of verbalbehavior.” This would require an incredible feat of memorizing. But Mr. Skinnerdenies the existence of memory—he calls it “storage” and declares: “Evolutionaryand environmental histories change an organism, but they are not stored withinit.” (Pp. 195-196.) His view of the nature of language, therefore, is as simpleas the views of black-magic practitioners: verbal incantations have a mysticpower to effect physical changes in a living organism.“The verbal community” (i.e., society), Mr. Skinner asserts, is the source andcause of man’s self-awareness and introspection. How? This time an answer isgiven: “It [the verbal community] asks such questions as: What did you doyesterday? What are you doing now? What will you do tomorrow? Why did you dothat? Do you really want to do that? How do you feel about that? The answershelp people to adjust to each other effectively. And it is because suchquestions are asked that a person responds to himself and his behavior in thespecial way called knowing or being aware. Without the help of a verbalcommunity all behavior would be unconscious. Consciousness is a social product.”(P. 192; emphasis added.) But how did such questions occur to men who wereincapable of discovering introspection? No answer.Apparently to appease man’s defenders, Mr. Skinner offers the following: “Inshifting control from autonomous man to the observable environment we do notleave an empty organism. A great deal goes on inside the skin, and physiologywill eventually tell us more about it.” (P. 195.) This means: No, man is notempty, he is a solid piece of meat.Inexorably, like all mystics, Mr. Skinner reverts to a mystic dualism—to anequivalent of the mind-body split, which becomes a body-bodies split. In Mr.Skinner’s version, it is not a conflict between God and the Devil, but betweenman’s two conditioners: social environment and genetic endowment. The conflicttakes place inside man’s skin, in the form of two selves. “A self is arepertoire of behavior appropriate to a given set of contingencies.” (P. 199.)The conflict, therefore, is between two repertoires. “The controlling self (theconscience or superego) is of social origin, but the controlled self is morelikely to be the product of genetic susceptibilities to reinforcement (the id,or the Old Adam). The controlling self generally represents the interests ofothers, the controlled self the interests of the individual.” (P. 199.)Where have we heard this before, and for how many “prescientific” millennia?Mr. Skinner’s voice is loud and clear when he declares: “To be for oneself is tobe almost nothing.” (P. 123.) As proof, he revives another ancient saw: thecapacity of the human species to transmit knowledge deprives man of any claim toindividuality (or to individual achievement) because he has to start by learningfrom others. “The great individualists so often cited to show the value ofpersonal freedom have owed their successes to earlier social environments. Theinvoluntary individualism of a Robinson Crusoe and the voluntary individualismof a Henry David Thoreau show obvious debts to society. If Crusoe had reachedthe island as a baby, and if Thoreau had grown up unattended on the shores ofWalden Pond, their stories would have been different. We must all begin asbabies, and no degree of self-determination, self-sufficiency, or self-reliancewill make us individuals in any sense beyond that of single members of the humanspecies.” (Pp. 123-124.)This means: we all begin as babies and remain in that state; since a baby is notself-sufficient, neither is an adult; nothing has happened in between. Observealso the same method of setting up a straw man that was used in regard tovolition: setting it up outside of reality. E.g., in order to be an individual,Thomas A. Edison would have had to appear in the jungle by parthenogenesis, asan infant without human parents, then rediscover, all by himself, the entirecourse of the science of physics, from the first fire to the electric lightbulb. Since no one has done this, there is no such thing as individualism.From a foundation of this kind, Mr. Skinner proceeds to seek “justice orfairness” or a “reasonable balance” in the “exchange between the individual andhis social environment.” (P. 124.) But, he announces, such questions “cannot beanswered simply by pointing to what is personally good or what is good forothers. There is another kind of value to which we must now turn.” (P. 125.)Now we come to the payoff.A mystic code of morality demanding self-sacrifice cannot be promulgated orpropagated without a supreme ruler that becomes the collector of thesacrificing. Traditionally, there have been two such collectors: either God orsociety. The collector had to be inaccessible to mankind at large, and hisauthority had to be revealed only through an elite of special intermediaries,variously called “high priests,” “commissars,” “Gauleiters,” etc. Mr. Skinnerfollows the same pattern, but he has a new collector and supreme ruler to hoist:the culture.A culture, he explains, is “the customs, the customary behaviors of people.” (P.127.) “A culture, like a species, is selected by its adaptation to anenvironment: to the extent that it helps its members to get what they need andavoid what is dangerous, it helps them to survive and transmit the culture. Thetwo kinds of evolution are closely interwoven. The same people transmit both aculture and a genetic endowment—though in very different ways and for differentparts of their lives.” (P. 129.) “A culture is not the product of a creative‘group mind’ or the expression of a ‘general will.’ . . . A culture evolves whennew practices further the survival of those who practice them.” (Pp. 133-134.)Thus we owe our survival to the culture. Therefore, Mr. Skinner announces, tothe two values discussed—personal good and the good of others—“we must now add athird, the good of the culture.” (P. 134.)What is the good of a culture? Survival. Whose survival? Its own. A culture isan end in itself. “When it has become clear that a culture may survive orperish, some of its members may begin to act to promote its survival.” (P. 134.)Which members? By what means are they able to grasp such a goal? No answer.Mr. Skinner stresses repeatedly that the survival of a culture is a valuedifferent from, and superior to, the survival of its members, of oneself or ofothers—a value one ought to live and die for. Why? Mr. Skinner is suddenlyexplicit: “None of this will explain what we might call a pure concern for thesurvival of a culture, but we do not really need an explanation. . . . Thesimple fact is that a culture which for any reason induces its members to workfor its survival, or for the survival of some of its practices, is more likelyto survive. Survival is the only value according to which a culture iseventually to be judged, and any practice that furthers survival has survivalvalue by definition.” (P. 136.) Whose survival? No answer. Mr. Skinner lets itride on an equivocation of this kind.If survival “is the only value according to which a culture is eventually to bejudged,” then the Nazi culture, which lasted twelve years, had a certain degreeof value—the Soviet culture, which has lasted fifty-five years, has a highervalue—the feudal culture of the Middle Ages, which lasted five centuries, had astill higher value—but the highest value of all must be ascribed to the cultureof ancient Egypt, which, with no variations or motion of any kind, lastedunchanged for thirty centuries.A “culture,” in Mr. Skinner’s own terms, is not a thing, not an idea, not evenpeople, but a collection of practices, a “behavior,” a disembodied behavior thatsupersedes those who behave—i.e., a way of acting to which the actors must besacrificed. This is mysticism of a kind that makes God or society seem sensiblyrealistic rulers by comparison. It is also conservatism of a metaphysical kindthat makes political conservatism seem innocuously childish. It demands that welive, work and die not for ourselves or for others, but for the sake ofpreserving and transmitting to yet unborn generations and in perpetuity the waywe dress, the way we ride the subway, the way we get drunk, the way we deal withbaseball or religion or economics, etc.Thus Mr. Skinner, the arch-materialist, ends up as a worshipper of disembodiedmotion—and the arch-revolutionary, as a guardian of the status quo, any statusquo.In order to be induced to sacrifice for the good of the culture, the victims arepromised “deferred advantages” (indeterminately deferred). “But what is its [aneconomic system’s] answer to the question: ‘Why should I be concerned about thesurvival of a particular kind of economic system?’ The only honest answer tothat kind of question seems to be this: ‘There is no good reason why you shouldbe concerned, but if your culture has not convinced you that there is, so muchthe worse for your culture.’ ” (P. 137.) This means: in order to survive, aculture must convince its members that there is a good reason to be concernedwith its survival, even though there is none.This is Social Darwinism of a kind that Herbert Spencer would not dream of. Thenearest approach to an exponent in practice was Adolf Hitler who “reinforced”his followers by demanding sacrifices for the survival of the German Kultur.But Mr. Skinner envisions a grander scale. He advocates “a single culture forall mankind,” which, he admits, is difficult to explain to the sacrificialvictims. “We can nevertheless point to many reasons why people should now beconcerned for the good of all mankind. The great problems of the world today areall global. . . . But pointing to consequences is not enough. We [who?] mustarrange contingencies under which consequences have an effect.” (Pp. 137-138.)This “arranger of contingencies” is to be a single totalitarian world state,serving the survival of a single culture, ruling every cell of every man’s brainand every moment of his life.What are the “great problems” this state would solve? What are the “terrifyingpossibilities” from which we must be saved—at the price of giving up ourfreedom, dignity, reason, mind, values, self-esteem? Mr. Skinner answers:“Overpopulation, the depletion of resources, the pollution of the environment,and the possibility of a nuclear holocaust—these are the not-so-remoteconsequences of present courses of action.” (P. 138.)If lightning struck Mount Sinai, and Moses appeared on the mountaintop, carryingsacred tablets, and silenced the lost, frightened, desperate throng below inorder to read a revelation of divine wisdom, and read a third-rate editorialfrom a random tabloid—the dramatic, intellectual and moral effect would besimilar (except that Moses was less pretentious).Mr. Skinner’s book falls to pieces in its final chapters. The author’s “verbalbehavior” becomes so erratic that he sounds as if he has lost all interest inhis subject. Tangled in contradictions, equivocations and non sequiturs, heseems to stumble wearily in circles, seizing any rationalization at random—notto defend his thesis, but to attack his critics, throwing feeble little jabs,projecting an odd kind of stale, lethargic, perfunctory malice, almost a“reflex-malice.” He sounds like a man filling empty pages with something,anything, in order to circumvent the accumulated weight of unansweredquestions—or like a man who resents being questioned.Who will be the “designers” of his proposed global culture and the rulers ofmankind? He answers unequivocally: the “technologists of behavior.” Whatqualifies them for such a job? They are “scientists.” What is science? In thewhole of the book, no definition is given, as if the term were a self-evident,mystically hallowed primary.Since man, according to Mr. Skinner, is biologically unable to project a timespan of three months—from spring planting to fall harvest—how are thesetechnologists able to see the course and plan the future of a global culture? Noanswer. What sort of men are they? The closest approach to an answer is: “thosewho have been induced by their culture to act to further its survival. . . .”(P. 180.)It is futile to ask by what means and through what agencies the culture (i.e.,the behavior) of birdbrained creatures can accomplish such a feat, because herewe are obviously dealing with a standard requirement of mysticism: Mr. Skinneris establishing an opportunity for the high priesthood to “hear voices”—not thevoice of God or of the people, but the voice of the culture inducing them toact. But the culture “induces” a great many people to different courses ofaction, including the people who paint prophecies of doom on rocks by the sideof highways. How are the culture-designers (and the rest of us) to know thattheirs is the true voice of the culture? No answer. One must assume that theyfeel it.Now we come to the grand cashing-in on the book’s basic equivocation. Mr.Skinner keeps stressing that mankind needs “more controls, not less”; in apolemical passage, he quotes his critics asking: “Who is to control?”—andanswers them as follows: “The relation between the controller and the controlledis reciprocal. The scientist in the laboratory, studying the behavior of apigeon, designs contingencies and observes their effects. His apparatus exerts aconspicuous control on the pigeon, but we must not overlook the control exertedby the pigeon. The behavior of the pigeon has determined the design of theapparatus and the procedures in which it is used. Some such reciprocal controlis characteristic of all science. . . . [Here I omit one sentence, which is anunconscionable misuse of a famous statement.] The scientist who designs acyclotron is under the control of the particles he is studying. The behaviorwith which a parent controls his child, either aversively or through positivereinforcement, is shaped and maintained by the child’s responses. Apsychotherapist changes the behavior of his patient in ways which have beenshaped and maintained by his success in changing that behavior. A government orreligion prescribes and imposes sanctions selected by their effectiveness incontrolling citizen or communicant. An employer induces his employees to workindustriously and carefully with wage systems determined by their effects onbehavior. The classroom practices of the teacher are shaped and maintained bythe effects on his students. In a very real sense, then, the slave controls theslave driver, the child the parent, the patient the therapist, the citizen thegovernment, the communicant the priest, the employee the employer, and thestudent the teacher.” (P. 169.)To this, I shall add just one more example: the victim controls the torturer,because if the victim screams very loudly at a particular method of torture,this is the method the torturer will select to use.The above quotation is sufficient to convey the book’s intellectual stature, thelogic of its arguments, and the validity of its thesis.As far as one can judge the book’s purpose, the establishment of a dictatorshipdoes not seem to be Mr. Skinner’s personal ambition. If it were, he would havebeen more clever about it. His goal seems to be: 1. to clear the way for adictatorship by eliminating its enemies; 2. to see how much he can get awaywith.The book’s motive power is hatred of man’s mind and virtue (with everything theyentail: reason, achievement, independence, enjoyment, moral pride,self-esteem)—so intense and consuming a hatred that it consumes itself, and whatwe read is only its gray ashes, with feeble, snickering obscenities (such as thetitle) as a few last, smoking, stinking coals. To destroy “Autonomous Man”—tostrike at him, to punch, to stab, to jab, and, if all else fails, to spit athim—is the book’s apparent purpose, and it is precisely the long-range, culturalconsequences that the author does not seem to give a damn about.The passages dealing with the Global State are so rambling, incoherent anddiffuse, that they sound, not like a plan, but like a daydream—the kind ofdaydream Mr. Skinner, apparently, finds “reinforcing.” But he remains unoriginaleven in his fantasy: borrowing Plato’s notion of a philosopher-king, Mr. Skinnerfancies a world ruled by a psychologist-king—in terms which sound as if asmall-time manipulator were tempted by the image of a big shot.If only we would abolish “Autonomous Man”—Mr. Skinner declares with a kind ofgrowling wistfulness—we would be able to turn “from the miraculous to thenatural, from the inaccessible to the manipulable.” (P. 201; emphasis added.)This, I submit, is the secret behind the book—and behind the modernintellectuals’ response to it.In Les Misérables, describing the development of an independent young man,Victor Hugo wrote: “. . . and he blesses God for having given him these tworiches which many of the rich are lacking: work, which gives him freedom, andthought, which gives him dignity.”I doubt that B. F. Skinner ever did or could read Victor Hugo—he wouldn’t knowwhat it’s all about—but it is not a mere coincidence that made him choose thetitle of his book. Victor Hugo knew the two essentials that man’s life requires.B. F. Skinner knows the two essentials that have to be destroyed if man qua manis to be destroyed.THE RESPONSE“The attention lavished on Harvard psychologist B. F. Skinner and his new bookhas been nothing short of remarkable,” states The New York Times Book Review(October 24, 1971), in a special box on its front page. After citing a long listof Mr. Skinner’s press interviews and television appearances, the statementcontinues: “The American Psychological Association gave him its annual award inSeptember and hailed him as ‘a pioneer in psychological research, leader intheory, master in technology, who has revolutionized the study of behavior inour time. A superlative scholar, scientist, teacher and writer.’ ”Bear in mind the fact that the above testimonial was given to a theoreticianwhose theory consists in proclaiming that man is a mindless automaton—to atechnologist whose technology consists in urging people to accept totalitariancontrol—to a scholar who substitutes the oldest of old wives’ tales for aknowledge of philosophy—to a scientist who commits the kinds of logicalfallacies for which a freshman would be flunked.It would be unfair to assume that that testimonial represents the intellectuallevel of the entire psychological profession. Obviously, it does not—and we allknow how such testimonials (or resolutions or protests) are put over by aspecial clique on a busy, confused, indifferent majority. But which is worse: aprofession that actually subscribes to that testimonial—or a profession thatdoes not, yet permits this sort of thing to be issued in its name? I think thelatter is worse. Manipulators, such as Mr. Skinner’s clique, do not seek topersuade, but to put something over on people. The fact that Mr. Skinner gotaway with the mere title of the book (let alone its thesis) indicates that thecultural field is empty, that no serious opposition is to be expected, thatanything goes.To be exact, I would say: not quite anything and not quite yet, but the culturalprognosis is pretty bleak. Mr. Skinner’s trial balloon has been punctured bymany different people, including some able sharp-shooters, but if he studies theshreds, he will notice that only buckshot was used. The book deserves no heavierammunition; its thesis does.With a few exceptions, the superlatives hailing the book’s importance came frompress agents or blurb writers, not from reviewers. Most of the reviews weremixed or negative. As a whole, they conveyed an odd feeling, not the violence ofa storm, but the sadness of a steady drizzle, as if exhausted men were stillunable to accept the evil brazenly offered to them for appraisal, but unablewithout knowing why, their reasons long since forgotten, moved by some remnantof decency as by a faint echo from a very distant past. What deserved a screamof indignation, was received with a sigh.The two best—i.e., thoroughly unfavorable—reviews appear in The New Republic andThe New York Review of Books. The rest of them attack Mr. Skinner, but concedehis case. They accept him as an exponent of reason and science—and seize theopportunity to damn reason and science.The review in The New Republic (October 16, 1971) is quietly firm and civilized.Its primary target is Mr. Skinner’s—and behaviorism’s—view of man, which itdescribes as “psychology without a psyche.” As an example of its approach:Skinner’s argument “goes like this: physics used to attribute humancharacteristics to physical objects (such as growing more jubilant as theyapproached their natural places); only when it stopped doing this did scientificprogress follow. Would not scientific progress follow in psychology if we couldstop attributing human characteristics to human beings? He does not, naturally,put it quite in those terms, but I have given the structural essence of thematter.” As an example of its appraisal of other aspects: “. . . theargumentation is often sloppy, the sensibility often philistine, the languageoften eccentric.” As an apparent rebuke for Mr. Skinner’s expression “insideman’s skin”: “And something inside my skull is reluctant to accept the simple,unproblematic world that Skinner offers, not just because it doesn’t like it butbecause it thinks it all wrong for people whose skulls contain similarly complexapparatus.” In all the reviews I read, this is the only passage that defendsintelligence.A cautious little piece in the Saturday Review (October 9, 1971) praises thebook for the following: “First of all, Dr. Skinner pays admirable attention tosocial problems. . . . Skinner’s sharp critique of punishment as largelyineffectual control is pertinent to the pressing question of prisons.” In thecontext of the profound philosophical fundamentals that Mr. Skinner challenges,this sort of comment cannot even be classified as journalistic orrange-of-the-moment: this is range-of-the-split-second. After which, thereviewer proceeds gently to blame Mr. Skinner for “his lust to objectivizeeverything.” This, he complains, destroys the “mystery of man.” Therefore, heconcludes placatingly: “Another dream of reason has ended as a nightmare of aneminent psychologist, in this case perhaps the most influential of livingAmerican psychologists. But was it a good dream to begin with? Was it even anespecially rational one? [I.e.: Is it rational to use reason?] We all know someof the devastating results of following the old imperative to control and subduenature outside man, of adopting the dictum of Skinner’s spiritual forebear,Francis Bacon, that ‘knowledge is power.’ Are we about to try the sameexperiment with ‘manipulable man’?” This means that Mr. Skinner is a man ofreason and a great scientist, whose theory would lead us to triumphs asbrilliant as those achieved by the physical sciences, but we must not try it.The reviewer concludes sweetly: “Thus only if the views of this book are for themost part rejected will it really have a good effect on the social environment.”(I suppose, on prison reform.) This sort of mealy-mouthed insult is unfair toany book, even Mr. Skinner’s.The review in Psychotherapy & Social Science Review (January 1972) is of a muchhigher caliber. It blasts many aspects of Mr. Skinner’s notions, competently andeffectively—then blasts itself by the following indications of its ownviewpoint: “But what in individual terms may be a struggle between narcissismand object-love, between indulgence in self and love of others, in societalterms becomes a struggle between anarchy and overcontrol. It is hard to knowwhat the remedy should be.” The reviewer mentions “the vicissitudes of thepersonal and social super ego”—and “the slowly accumulating evidence that manwill always have to struggle with his dual and decisive nature” (which consistsof the capacity to think and to feel). He concludes: “But to pursue the lastpath, to attempt to turn pure instinct into pure reason is to fly in the face ofthe ambivalent nature of man . . .” (This means that Mr. Skinner is an advocateor representative of pure reason.) And: “Perhaps to be able to face theseunresolvable dilemmas and painful paradoxes without recourse to either impotenceor grandiosity may finally deserve the name of dignity.” If behaviorismdeclares, through Mr. Skinner: “I can resolve anything (somehow),” and its majorrival school of psychology, Freudianism, advises: “Resign yourself tounresolvable dilemmas,” behaviorism will win.The review in The Atlantic (October 1971) is a peculiar mixture. The reviewer(properly) condemns Mr. Skinner for his “love of power over others.” He attacksMr. Skinner on a crucial issue: the destruction of language and, therefore, ofjudgment. But observe the following statement: “Let us be clear: it is not thesublime dumbness of mysticism [?!] toward which Skinner’s idealism [?] moves. Itis rather closer to the societies of 1984 and their Newspeak—the atrophy ofconsciousness through the shriveling of language.” In his best paragraph, thereviewer states that Skinner’s “own gospel of environmental determinism is oneof the most serious threats conceivable to human survival. By eroding the senseof responsibility, it licenses people to shift the blame from themselves to ‘thesystem. ’ It provides universal exoneration for atrocity after atrocity, or forcompliance after compliance. It works to increase the amount of evil in theworld.” This is eminently true. But a few paragraphs earlier the reviewer said:“Determinism may be true, false, or both. But whatever it is, if it is used asSkinner uses it, the doom of conscious life is announced.” How else candeterminism “be used”? If a man cannot help what he does, how can he be heldresponsible for it? And if a given idea could be “true, false, or both” (at thesame time and in the same respect), what sort of conscious life would bepossible?The mystery of that reviewer’s stand is solved in his last paragraph: “Skinnerbelieves that we can survive only if we allow a gigantic simplification of life.By that he means—he must finally mean—the atrophy of consciousness. He does notthink that introspective, complex, self-doubting, self-torturing,self-indulgent, dissident, wordy people are efficient. He can set things up, heis sure, so that fewer such people occur. Does he not see that only silly geeselay golden eggs?” This means: Mr. Skinner represents reason, order, efficiency,but it is the emotion-ridden, contradiction-riddled, self-confessedly silly andsloppy souls who give value or meaning to life.The review in The New Leader (January 10, 1972) is cruder and more open. Itdeclares: “ ‘The reasonable man,’ Shaw said, ‘tries to adapt himself to theworld’ (certainly the behaviorist’s approach), ‘the unreasonable one persists intrying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on theunreasonable man.’ ” Also: “And behaviorism is still, thank God, a science, nota technology.” Also: “History, no less than behavioristic experiments, provesthat man is innately selfish. The manipulation of mankind is unacceptable notbecause man is a noble being, but precisely because he is not. Those with powerhave always used it for their own ends, and there is no reason to suppose thattheir selfish preoccupations will diminish.” (This means, one must assume, thatthe totalitarian control and manipulation of noble, selfless beings by noble,selfless beings would be all right.)Then there is a batch of small-fry reviews which echo similar sentiments or nosentiments at all, make feeble objections, carefully miss the point, and do notcommit themselves to anything. An astonishing one is a piece in Science News(August 7, 1971), which seems to be written by a teen-ager and makes aremarkable statement. Mr. Skinner’s new book, it announces, may be one of themost important of the century: “Not only because it represents the summation ofthe Harvard psychologist’s behavioristic approach to psychology, but because itgoes beyond psychology into philosophy. And because Dr. Skinner’s philosophywill probably be insulting to a great many people.” Further, this particularexpert declares that “Dr. Skinner makes [his] arguments logically and rationally. . .”After a collection of this kind, it is a relief to read the essay in The NewYork Review of Books (December 30, 1971), entitled “The Case Against B. F.Skinner.” The essay is neither apologetic nor sentimental. It is bright andforceful. It is a demolition job. What it demolishes is Mr. Skinner’s scientificpretensions—and, to this extent, it is a defense of science.“His [Skinner’s] speculations are devoid of scientific content and do not evenhint at general outlines of a possible science of human behavior.” In regard toSkinner’s claims: “Claims . . . must be evaluated according to the evidencepresented for them. In the present instance, this is a simple task, since noevidence is presented . . . In fact, the question of evidence is beside thepoint, since the claims dissolve into triviality or incoherence under analysis.”The reviewer employs one of the best methods of dealing with a false theory: hetakes it literally. “If Skinner’s thesis is false, then there is no point in hishaving written the book or our reading it. But if his thesis is true, then thereis also no point in his having written the book or our reading it. For the onlypoint could be to modify behavior, and behavior, according to the thesis, isentirely controlled by arrangement of reinforcers. Therefore reading the bookcan modify behavior only if it is a reinforcer, that is, if reading the bookwill increase the probability of the behavior that led to reading the book(assuming an appropriate state of deprivation). At this point, we seem to bereduced to gibberish.”There are many other notable passages in that review. But its author is NoamChomsky who, philosophically, is a Cartesian linguist advocating a theory to theeffect that man’s mental processes are determined by innate ideas—and who,politically, belongs to the New Left.I shall [discuss shortly] the two significant reviews that appeared in The NewYork Times. But the picture of our cultural devastation is clear. There are nodefenders of reason—in the country that was created not by historical accident,but by philosophical design. There are no defenders of freedom—in what had oncebeen the only moral social system on earth. There are no defenders of man’smind—in the world’s greatest scientific-technological civilization. All that isleft is a battle between the mystics of spirit and the mystics of muscle—betweenmen guided by their feelings and men guided by their reflexes.We are passengers on a plane flying at tremendous speed. One of these days, wewill discover that its cockpit is empty.Newspapers do not create a culture, they are its product. They are transmissionbelts that carry ideas from the universities to the general public. The New YorkTimes is one of the most influential newspapers in this country and a goodindicator of our cultural trends. It published two reviews of Mr. Skinner’sbook, which—in different ways—are the most objectionable ones of the lot.“There is just no gainsaying the profound importance of B. F. Skinner’s newbook, Beyond Freedom and Dignity. If you plan to read only one book this year,this is probably the one you should choose.” This is the opening of the reviewin the daily Times (September 22, 1971)—the only essentially favorable review Ihave found.“Dr. Skinner’s message is hard to take,” the reviewer claims, but warns that “itcannot be dismissed so frivolously . . .” Then, without protective evasions, hesummarizes accurately the brutal essentials of Mr. Skinner’s thesis, anddeclares: “All of which is logically unassailable . . .” (Emphasis added.)Attempting, apparently, to resist the thesis, he states that “one triesreviewing the traditional criticisms of behaviorism. But even here, Skinner isnot nearly so vulnerable as he once seemed. For he has confronted his manycritics with telling counterarguments. . . . To those who call his programtotalitarian, he replies that ‘the relation between the controller and thecontrolled is reciprocal’ . . .” This refers to the passage on page 169 of Mr.Skinner’s book, which is quoted [above, pages 202-203]. Please reread it inorder to judge whether that is a “telling counterargument.”“No, none of the familiar objections to behaviorism will suffice to demolishBeyond Freedom and Dignity,” the reviewer sighs. “. . . the book remainslogically tenable. I don’t like it, which is to say that it doesn’t reinforce mein the manner to which I am accustomed.” To make a concession of this kind is toconfess that one has no grounds for one’s convictions, and that one is not awareof one’s own mental processes. The concession is followed by an odd statement:“But for the moment the only retort that I can think of is that conceived byDostoyevsky’s ‘underground man’— to ‘deliberately go mad to prove’ that allbehavior cannot be predicted or controlled. But such a response might not provevery useful to me or the culture. . . . So we may indeed be trapped in aSkinnerian maze.” What is odd here is the fact that the quotation fromDostoyevsky’s “underground man” is not a retort the reviewer thought ofspontaneously: this very quotation is discussed by Mr. Skinner on pages 164-165of his book and is, properly, dismissed.At first glance, the review creates the impression that it was written by anearnest intellectual who struggled desperately against the necessity ofaccepting a totalitarian state, but failed to find counterarguments and gave in,reluctantly, to the power of unanswerable logic. After one has read the book,one asks: Is that the reviewer’s case? Or is it the case of a man eager toconvince us that Mr. Skinner’s thesis is unanswerable?The review in The New York Times Book Review (October 24, 1971) is different. Itis unfavorable. It declares that Skinner has a secret motive (a “hidden agenda”)which is unknown to him, but known to the reviewer. “The actual text ofSkinner’s new book reveals a man desperately in search of some way to preservethe old-fashioned virtues associated with 19th-century individualism in a worldwhere self-reliance no longer makes sense.” Which virtues? Hard work, believe itor not. “First, behavior control appears to him a way to get people hard at workagain in an age where indolence is rife.” If hard work is the essentialcharacteristic of individualism, then the Nazi and Soviet forced labor camps areexamples of individualism unmatched in the nineteenth or any other century. Butthere is no discussion or advocacy of “hard work” in Mr. Skinner’s book, andnothing to justify the allegation that this is his first concern.“This hidden agenda can first be detected in the way Skinner talks aboutcontrolling behavior. All his attention is centered on situations where oneperson is being controlled; he employs such phrases as ‘a person’s behavior’ or‘operant conditioning of the subject. ’ He seldom refers to different controlsfor different kinds of social groups.” Even Mr. Skinner does not deserve areviewer of this kind. Many people are unable to deal with metaphysicalquestions, but this one is militantly aggressive about it. He is so rabid acollectivist that he will not tolerate any concern with the individual, even forthe purpose of destroying him. He does not see that if his own beliefs are to beput into practice, it is Mr. Skinner who is laying the necessary foundation.If a doctor stated that man needs food, and were criticized as follows: ‘Whichman does he mean, Smith or Jones? Different men need different foods. And hehasn’t said anything about the poor, the black, the young, and the women”—theSkedunk Gazette would not publish it. Yet this type of mentality is published onthe front page of The New York Times Book Review. If you think I amexaggerating, judge the following. The reviewer picks on a passage in which Mr.Skinner attempts to teach us behaviorist language by describing a young man’semotional states in behaviorist terms—e.g., Mr. Skinner translates “he feelsuneasy or anxious” into “his behavior frequently has unavoidable aversiveconsequences which have emotional effects.” The reviewer’s comment: “ButProfessor, there’s a war on! Why aren’t you talking about the social cause ofhis behavior? Why do you treat him as if he lives in a vacuum?”Mr. Skinner is not only too individualistic, the reviewer claims, but also toorational. “While Heisenberg contemplated the unpredictable behavior of matter,Skinner insists that we must find unambiguous facts about human behavior; thedifference is between wanting to explore the world as it is and wanting topossess knowledge. The possession of knowledge, of hard facts you can act on, isan echo of 19th-century positivistic science, just as Skinner’s beliefs are anecho of that century’s small-town society.”If “the possession of knowledge” is unattainable, what do you acquire when you“explore the world as it is”—and why do you explore it? What is a “soft” fact?What do you act on, when you cannot act on knowledge or facts? (That review maybe an example of such action.) But I shall borrow a phrase from Noam Chomsky’sessay, and say that these are questions “which I happily leave to others todecode.”The daily Times reviewer may be taken as typical of the present—a frightenedliberal trying to convince us (and himself) that Mr. Skinner’s totalitarianstate is the wave of the future. But the Sunday Times reviewer is the future—thefuture of Mr. Skinner’s theories, their successful product and embodiment, whohas been molded by the “contingencies of reinforcement” in our universities, whosees reason, individualism and “autonomy” as incontrovertibly nonexistent, seesno point in arguing about them, sees nothing beyond the range of the immediatemoment, regards Mr. Skinner as old-fashioned, and goes on from there. If youhave read The Fountainhead, you will understand the relationship: he is the GusWebb to Mr. Skinner’s Ellsworth Toohey.The Times chose the publication of Beyond Freedom and Dignity as an occasion togo beyond B. F. Skinner. A different push in the same direction was provided byTime magazine. The headline on its cover (September 20, 1971) announced: “B. F.Skinner Says: WE CAN’T AFFORD FREEDOM”—not a very original statement, butregarded, apparently, as important or valuable enough to justify placing Mr.Skinner’s picture on the cover, and giving him a lengthy story. The story,however, is flattering only in its length; otherwise, it is noncommittal andempty, playing both sides of the fence in the “safe” modern manner, i.e.,praising Mr. Skinner, and insulting him by quoting his enemies.If you wonder what motives could bring Mr. Skinner to his theories, whatfrustration could lead him to so profound a hatred of mankind, and who would behis first victims, the Time story offers three passages that provide eloquentclues. The first is a quotation from Mr. Skinner’s novel Walden Two. Thespeaker, Time explains, “is T. E. Frazier, a character in Walden Two and thefictional founder of the Utopian community described in that novel. He is alsoan alter ego of the author . . .” The quotation: “I’ve had only one idea in mylife—a true idée fixe. To put it as bluntly as possible—the idea of having myown way. ‘Control!’ expresses it. The control of human behavior. In my earlyexperimental days it was a frenzied, selfish desire to dominate. I remember therage I used to feel when a prediction went awry. I could have shouted at thesubjects of my experiments, ‘Behave, damn you! Behave as you ought!’ ”The second passage deals with Mr. Skinner’s youth. In his college days, he wroteshort stories and “sent three of them to Robert Frost, who praised them warmly.That encouragement convinced Fred Skinner that he should become a writer. Thedecision, he says, was ‘disastrous.’ . . . In his own words, he ‘failed as awriter’ because he ‘had nothing important to say.’ ”The third passage is about Twin Oaks, a real-life commune founded on a farm inVirginia, and “governed by Skinner’s laws of social engineering.” “Privateproperty is forbidden, except for such things as books and clothing. . . . Noone is allowed to boast of individual accomplishments . . . What is consideredappropriate behavior—cooperating, showing affection, turning the other cheek andworking diligently—is, on the other hand, applauded, or ‘reinforced,’ by thegroup.” “The favorite sports are ‘cooperation volley-ball’ and skinny-dipping inthe South Anna River—false modesty is another of the sins that are notreinforced—and there is plenty of folk singing and dancing.” In regard to theconsequences: “After starting with only $35,000, Twin Oaks, four years later,still finds survival a struggle. The farm brings more emotional than monetaryrewards; members would find it cheaper to work at other jobs and buy their foodat the market. . . . Beyond economics, there are serious psychological problemsat Twin Oaks, and few members have stayed very long. [Emotional rewards?]Turnover last year was close to 70 percent. The ones who leave first, in fact,are often the most competent members, who still expect special recognition fortheir talents. ‘Competent people are hard to get along with,’ says RichardStutsman, one of Twin Oaks’ trained psychologists. ‘They tend to make demands,not requests. We cannot afford to reinforce ultimatum behavior, although werecognize our need for their competence. . . .’ When they leave, the communitynot only loses their skills but also sacrifices a potential rise in its standardof living.”For my comments on this, see Atlas Shrugged.The cultural establishment has pushed Beyond Freedom and Dignity to thebest-seller lists. The most dangerous part of its potential impact—particularlyon young readers—is not that the book is convincing or eloquent, but that it isso bad. If it were less crudely irrational and inept, a reader could give thebenefit of the doubt to those who were taken in by some trickily complexarguments. But if so evil a thesis as the advocacy of totalitarian dictatorshipis offered in such illogical, unconvincing terms, yet is acclaimed as“important,” what is one to think of the intellectual and moral state of ourculture? A rational reader may become paralyzed—not by fear, fear is not hispsychological danger—but by disgust, contempt, discouragement and, ultimately,withdrawal from the realm of the intellect (which, perhaps, is Mr. Skinner’shope).But before you draw the “malevolent-universe” conclusion that falsehood alwayswins over truth, or that men prefer irrationality to reason, and dictatorship tofreedom (and, therefore, “What’s the use?”)—consider the following. Human Events(January 15, 1972) reports that “the National Institute of Mental Health hadgranted $283,000 to Dr. B. F. Skinner . . .” which, apparently, financed thewriting of his book. The New Republic (January 28, 1972) gives some details: theSkinner grant “was one of 20 Senior Research Career Awards, that is, plums forscientific leaders in ‘mental health’ across the board rather than a uniquegrant. . . . The particular award was made for the purpose of ‘integrating andconsolidating’ Skinner’s findings and ‘considering the application of thescience of behavior to the problems of society’[!]. . . .”This is the way an “establishment” is formed and placed beyond the reach ofdissent. What chance would a beginner, a nonconformist, an opponent ofbehaviorism, have against the entrenched power of a clique supported bygovernment funds? This is not a free marketplace of ideas any longer. Evil,falsehood, irrationality are not winning in free competition with virtue, truth,reason. Today’s culture is ruled by intellectual pressure groups which havebecome intellectual monopolies backed, like all monopolies, by the government’sgun and the money of the victims.(The solution, of course, is not to censor research projects, but to abolish allgovernment subsidies in the field of the social sciences and, eventually, in allfields. But this is a different subject, which I shall discuss [in the nextchapter].)The significance of B. F. Skinner’s book lies in its eloquent demonstration ofthe results of philosophical collapse and governmental power: when theintellectual default of the victims permits the dead hand of the government toget a stranglehold on the field of ideas, a nation will necessarily be pushedbeyond freedom and dignity."},{"pageContent":"14The Establishing of an Establishment1972 Staleness is the dominant characteristic of today’s culture—and, at firstglance, it may appear to be a puzzling phenomenon.There is an air of impoverished drabness, of tired routine, of stagnant monotonyin all our cultural activities—from stage and screen, to literature and thearts, to the allegedly intellectual publications and discussions. There isnothing to see or to hear. Every thing produces the effect of déjà vu or déjàentendu. How long since you have read anything startling, different, fresh,unexpected?Intellectually, people are wearing paste jewelry copied from paste jewelry byartisans who have never seen the original gems. Originality is a forgottenexperience. The latest fads are withering at birth. The substitutes for daringand vitality—such as the screeching hippies—are mere camouflage, like too muchmake-up on the lined face of an aging slut.The symptoms of today’s cultural disease are: conformity, with nothing toconform to—timidity, expressed in a self-shrinking concern with trivia—a kind ofobsequious anxiety to please the unknown standards of some nonexistentauthority—and a pall of fear without object. Psychologically, this is thecultural atmosphere of a society living under censorship.But there is no censorship in the United States.I have said that the fundamental cause of a culture’s disintegration is thecollapse of philosophy, which leaves men without intellectual guidance. But thisis the fundamental cause; its consequences are not always direct or obvious, andits working may raise many questions. By what intermediary processes does thiscause affect men’s lives? Does it work only by psychological means, from within,or is it assisted, from without, by practical, existential measures? Whenphilosophy collapses, why are there no thinkers to step into the vacuum andrebuild a system of thought on a new foundation? Since there was nophilosophical unanimity, why did the collapse of falsehoods paralyze the men whohad never believed them? Why do the falsehoods linger on, unchallenged—like acloud of dust over the rubble? Philosophy affects education, and a falsephilosophy can cripple men’s minds in childhood; but it cannot cripple them all,nor does it cripple most men irreparably—so what becomes of those who manage tosurvive? Why are they not heard from? What—except physical force—can silenceactive minds?The answer to this last question is: nothing. Only the use of physical force canprotect falsehoods from challenge and perpetuate them. Only the intrusion offorce into the realm of the intellect—i.e., only the action of government—cansilence an entire nation. But then how does the cultural wreckage maintain itspower over the United States? There is no governmental repression or suppressionof ideas in this country.As a mixed economy, we are chained by an enormous tangle of government controls;but, it is argued, they affect our incomes, not our minds. Such a distinction isnot tenable; a chained aspect of a man’s—or a nation’s—activity will graduallyand necessarily affect the rest. But it is true that the government, so far, hasmade no overt move to repress or control the intellectual life of this country.Anyone is still free to say, write and publish anything he pleases. Yet men keepsilent—while their culture is perishing from an entrenched, institutionalizedepidemic of mediocrity. It is not possible that mankind’s intellectual staturehas shrunk to this extent. And it is not possible that all talent has vanishedsuddenly from this country and this earth.If you find it puzzling, the premise to check is the idea that governmentalrepression is the only way a government can destroy the intellectual life of acountry. It is not. There is another way: governmental encouragement.Governmental encouragement does not order men to believe that the false is true:it merely makes them indifferent to the issue of truth or falsehood.Bearing this preface in mind, let us consider an example of the methods,processes and results of that policy.In December 1971, Representative Cornelius E. Gallagher (D.-N.J.) declared inthe House that “the National Institute of Mental Health has granted to Dr. B. F.Skinner the sum of $283,000 for the purpose of writing Beyond Freedom andDignity.” On further inquiry, he discovered that “this merely represents the tipof the iceberg.” (Congressional Record, December 15, 1971, H12623.)Human Events (January 15, 1972) summarized his findings as follows: “WhenGallagher sought information about the Skinner grant and the scope and amount ofgovernment spending in the behavioral research field, the General AccountingOffice reported back that the task was virtually impossible. Agency officialsstated that there were tens of thousands of behavioral research projects beingfinanced by government agencies. A preliminary check turned up 70,000 grants andcontracts at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and 10,000 withinthe Manpower Administration of the Labor Department. Thousands of additionalbehavioral projects, costing millions of dollars, also are being financed by theDefense Department, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and theAtomic Energy Commission, according to the General Accounting Office’s survey.”In his speech to the House, Representative Gallagher declared: “The Congress hasauthorized and appropriated every single dollar in these grants and contractsyet, for the most part, we are unaware of how they are being spent.” Andfurther: “. . . the Federal grant and contract system has inextricablyintertwined colleges and universities with moneys authorized and appropriated bythe Congress. I mean to imply no suggestion of a lessening of academic freedomin the Nation, but I do suggest that the Congress should at the very least befully informed and, if need be, have the tools and expertise at our own disposalto counter antidemocratic thoughts launched with Federal funds.” (CongressionalRecord, H12624.)Mr. Gallagher stated that he believes in Dr. Skinner’s right to advocate hisideas. “But what I question is whether he should be subsidized by the FederalGovernment [—] especially since, in my judgment, he is advancing ideas whichthreaten the future of our system of government by denigrating the Americantraditions of individualism, human dignity, and self-reliance.” (Ibid., H12623.)If Mr. Gallagher were a consistent supporter of the American traditions hedescribes in the second half of his sentence, he would have stopped after itsfirst half. But, apparently, he was not aware of the contradiction, because hissolution was a proposal to create “a Select Committee on Privacy, Human Values,and Democratic Institutions . . . designed to deal specifically with the type ofthreats to our Constitution, our Congress, and our constituents which arecontained in the thoughts of B. F. Skinner.” (Ibid., H12624.)Nothing could be as dangerous a threat to our institutions as a proposal toestablish a government committee to deal with “antidemocratic thoughts” or B. F.Skinner’s thoughts or anyone’s thoughts. The liberal New Republic was quick tosense the danger and to protest (January 28, 1972). But, not questioning thepropriety of government grants, it merely expounded the other side of the samecontradiction: it objected to the notion of the government determining whichideas are right or acceptable and thus establishing a kind of intellectualorthodoxy.Yet both contentions are true: it is viciously improper for the government tosubsidize the enemies of our political system; it is also viciously improper forthe government to assume the role of an ideological arbiter. But neitherRepresentative Gallagher nor The New Republic chose to see the answer: thatthose evils are inherent in the vicious impropriety of the governmentsubsidizing ideas. Both chose to ignore the fact that any intrusion ofgovernment into the field of ideas, for or against anyone, withers intellectualfreedom and creates an official orthodoxy, a privileged elite. Today, it iscalled an “Establishment.”Ironically enough, it is The New Republic that offered an indication of themechanics by which an Establishment gets established—apparently, withoutrealizing the social implications of its own argument. Objecting to Gallagher’scontention that a deliberate policy may be favoring the behaviorist school ofpsychology, The New Republic stated: “The Gallagher account did not note thatthe Skinner grant was one of 20 Senior Research Career Awards, that is, plumsfor scientific leaders in ‘mental health’ across the board rather than a uniquegrant. No new awards of this kind have been made by NIMH since 1964, but 18 ofthem, which were originally for five years, have been renewed. Skinner’s wasrenewed in 1969, so his $283,000 amounts to $28,300 a year ending in 1974. . . .Skinner has continued to teach roughly one seminar a year at Harvard since 1964.In other words, his Harvard salary will be paid by the feds until [1974], abonanza perhaps more rewarding to Harvard than to him, since he could command atleast as large a salary . . . in a number of other places.”Consider the desperate financial plight of private universities, then askyourself what a “bonanza” of this kind will do to them. It is generally knownthat most universities now depend on government research projects as one oftheir major sources of income. The government grants to those “Senior”researchers establish every recipient as an unofficially official power. It ishis influence—his ideas, his theories, his preferences in faculty hiring—thatwill come to dominate the school, in a silent, unadmitted way. What debt-riddencollege administrator would dare antagonize the carrier of the bonanza?Now observe that these grants were given to senior researchers, that they were“plums”—as The New Republic calls them coyly and cynically—for “scientificleaders.” How would Washington bureaucrats—or Congressmen, for that matter—knowwhich scientist to encourage, particularly in so controversial a field as socialscience? The safest method is to choose men who have achieved some sort ofreputation. Whether their reputation is deserved or not, whether theirachievements are valid or not, whether they rose by merit, pull, publicity oraccident, are questions which the awarders do not and cannot consider. Whenpersonal judgment is inoperative (or forbidden), men’s first concern is not howto choose, but how to justify their choice. This will necessarily promptcommittee members, bureaucrats and politicians to gravitate toward “prestigiousnames.” The result is to help establish those already established—i.e., toentrench the status quo.The worst part of it is the fact that this method of selection is not confinedto the cowardly or the corrupt, that the honest official is obliged to use it.The method is forced on him by the terms of the situation. To pass an informed,independent judgment on the value of every applicant or project in every fieldof science, an official would have to be a universal scholar. If he consults“experts” in the field, the dilemma remains: either he has to be a scholar whoknows which experts to consult—or he has to surrender his judgment to mentrained by the very professors he is supposed to judge. The awarding of grantsto famous “leaders,” therefore, appears to him as the only fair policy—on thepremise that “somebody made them famous, somebody knows, even if I don’t.”(If the officials attempted to bypass the “leaders” and give grants to promisingbeginners, the injustice and irrationality of the situation would be so muchworse that most of them have the good sense not to attempt it. If universalscholarship is required to judge the value of the actual in every field, nothingshort of omniscience would be required to judge the value of the potential—asvarious privately sponsored contests to discover future talent, even in limitedfields, have amply demonstrated.)Furthermore, the terms of the situation actually forbid an honest official touse his own judgment. He is supposed to be “impartial” and “fair”—whileconsidering awards in the social sciences. An official who does not have someknowledge and some convictions in this field, has no moral right to be a publicofficial. Yet the kind of “fairness” demanded of him means that he must suspend,ignore or evade his own convictions (these would be challenged as “prejudices”or “censorship”) and proceed to dispose of large sums of public money, withincalculable consequences for the future of the country—without judging thenature of the recipients’ ideas, i.e., without using any judgment whatever.The awarders may hide behind the notion that, in choosing recognized “leaders,”they are acting “democratically” and rewarding men chosen by the public. Butthere is no “democracy” in this field. Science and the mind do not work by voteor by consensus. The best-known is not necessarily the best (nor is theleast-known, for that matter). Since no rational standards are applicable, theawarders’ method leads to concern with personalities, not ideas; pull, notmerit; “prestige,” not truth. The result is: rule by press agents.The profiteers of government grants are usually among the loudest protestersagainst “the tyranny of money”: science and the culture, they cry, must beliberated from the arbitrary private power of the rich. But there is thisdifference: the rich can neither buy an entire nation nor force one singleindividual. If a rich man chooses to support cultural activities, he can do soonly on a very limited scale, and he bears the consequences of his actions. Ifhe does not use his judgment, but merely indulges his irrational whims, heachieves the opposite of his intention: his projects and his protégés areignored or despised in their professions, and no amount of money will buy himany influence over the culture. Like vanity publishing, his venture remains aprivate waste without any wider significance. The culture is protected from himby three invincible elements: choice, variety, competition. If he loses hismoney in foolish ventures, he hurts no one but himself. And, above all: themoney he spends is his own; it is not extorted by force from unwilling victims.The fundamental evil of government grants is the fact that men are forced to payfor the support of ideas diametrically opposed to their own. This is a profoundviolation of an individual’s integrity and conscience. It is viciously wrong totake the money of rational men for the support of B. F. Skinner—or vice versa.The Constitution forbids a governmental establishment of religion, properlyregarding it as a violation of individual rights. Since a man’s beliefs areprotected from the intrusion of force, the same principle should protect hisreasoned convictions and forbid governmental establishments in the field ofthought.Socially, the most destructive consequences of tyranny are spread by anindeterminate, unofficial class of rulers: the officials’ favorites. In thehistories of absolute monarchies, it was the king’s favorites who perpetratedthe worst iniquities. Even an absolute monarch was restrained, to some minimalextent, by the necessity to pretend to maintain some semblance of justice, inorder to protect his image from the people’s indignation. But the recipients ofhis arbitrary, capricious favor held all the privileges of power without any ofthe restraints. It was among the scrambling, conniving, bootlicking,backstabbing climbers of a royal court that the worst exponents of power forpower’s sake were to be found. This holds true in any political system thatleaves an opportunity open to them: in an absolute monarchy, in a totalitariandictatorship, in a mixed economy.Today, what we see in this country’s intellectual field is one of the worstmanifestations of political power: rule by favorites, by the unofficiallyprivileged—by private groups with governmental power, but without governmentalresponsibility. They are shifting, switching groups, often feuding amongthemselves, but united against outsiders; they are scrambling to catch momentaryfavors, their precise status unknown to their members, their rivals, or theirparticular patrons among the hundreds of Congressmen and the thousands ofbureaucrats—who are now bewildered and intimidated by these Frankensteiniancreations. As in any other game devoid of objective rules, success and power inthis one depend on barkers (press agents) and bluff.Private cliques have always existed in the intellectual field, particularly inthe arts, but they used to serve as checks and balances on one another, so thata nonconformist could enter the field and rise without the help of a clique.Today, the cliques are consolidated into an Establishment.The term “Establishment” was not generally used or heard in this country untilabout a decade ago. The term originated in Great Britain, where it was appliedto the upper-class families which traditionally preempted certain fields ofactivity. The British aristocracy is a politically created caste—an institutionabolished and forbidden by the political system of the United States. The originof an aristocracy is the king’s power to confer on a chosen individual theprivilege of receiving an unearned income from the involuntary servitude of theinhabitants of a given district.Now, the same policy is operating in the United States—only the privileges aregranted not in perpetuity, but in a lump sum for a limited time, and theinvoluntary servitude is imposed not on a group of serfs in a specificterritory, but on all the citizens of the country. This does not change thenature of the policy or its consequences.Observe the character of our intellectual Establishment. It is about a hundredyears behind the times. It holds as dogma the basic premises fashionable at theturn of the century: the mysticism of Kant, the collectivism of Marx, thealtruism of street-corner evangelists. Two world wars, three monstrousdictatorships—in Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, Red China—plus every lesservariant of devastating socialist experimentation in a global spread of brutalityand despair, have not prompted modern intellectuals to question or revise theirdogma. They still think that it is daring, idealistic and unconventional todenounce the rich. They still believe that money is the root of all evil—exceptgovernment money, which is the solution to all problems. The intellectualEstablishment is frozen on the level of those elderly “leaders” who wereprominent when the system of governmental “encouragement” took hold. Bycontrolling the schools, the “leaders” perpetuated their dogma and graduallysilenced the opposition.Dissent still exists among the intellectuals, but it is a nit-picking dissentover trivia, which never challenges fundamental premises. This sort of dissentis permitted even in the Catholic Church, so long as it does not challenge thedogma—or in the “self-criticism” sessions of Soviet institutions, so long as itdoes not challenge the tenets of communism. A disagreement that does notchallenge fundamentals serves only to reinforce them. It is particularly in thisrespect that the collapse of philosophy and the growth of government power worktogether to entrench the Establishment.Rule by unofficially privileged private groups spreads a special kind of fear,like a slow poison injected into the culture. It is not fear of a specificruler, but of the unknown power of anonymous cliques, which grows into a chronicfear of unknowable enemies. Most people do not hold any firm convictions onfundamental issues; today, people are more confused and uncertain than ever—yetthe system demands of them a heroic kind of integrity, which they do notpossess: they are destroyed by means of fundamental issues which they are unableto recognize in seemingly inconsequential concretes. Many men are capable ofdying on the barricades for a big issue, but few—very few—are able to resist thegray suction of small, unheralded, day-by-day surrenders. Few want to starttrouble, make enemies, risk their position and, perhaps, their livelihood oversuch issues as a colleague’s objectionable abstract notions (which should beopposed, but are not), or the vaguely improper demands of a faculty clique(which should be resisted, but are not), or the independent attitude of atalented instructor (who should be hired, but is not). If a man senses that heought to speak up, he is stopped by the routine “Who am I to know?” of modernskepticism—to which another, paralyzing clause is added in his mind: “Whom wouldI displease?”Most men are quick to sense whether truth does or does not matter to theirsuperiors. The atmosphere of cautious respect for the recipients of undeservedgrants awarded by a mysterious governmental power, rapidly spreads theconviction that truth does not matter because merit does not matter, thatsomething takes precedence over both. (And the issue of grants is only one ofthe countless ways in which the same arbitrary power intrudes into men’s lives.)From the cynical notion: “Who cares about justice?” a man descends to: “Whocares about truth?” and then to: “Who cares?” Thus most men succumb to anintangible corruption, and sell their souls on the installment plan—by makingsmall compromises, by cutting small corners—until nothing is left of their mindsexcept the fear.In business, the rise of the welfare state froze the status quo, perpetuatingthe power of the big corporations of the pre-income-tax era, placing them beyondthe competition of the tax-strangled newcomers. A similar process took place inthe welfare state of the intellect. The results, in both fields, are the same.If you talk to a typical business executive or college dean or magazine editor,you can observe his special, modern quality: a kind of flowing or skippingevasiveness that drips or bounces automatically off any fundamental issue, agently noncommittal blandness, an ingrained cautiousness toward everything, asif an inner tape recorder were whispering: “Play it safe, don’tantagonize—whom?—anybody.”Whom would these men fear most, psychologically—and least, existentially? Thebrilliant loner—the beginner, the young man of potential genius and innocentlyruthless integrity, whose only weapons are talent and truth. They reject him“instinctively,” saying that “he doesn’t belong” (to what?), sensing that hewould put them on the spot by raising issues they prefer not to face. He mightget past their protective barriers, once in a while, but he is handicapped byhis virtues—in a system rigged against intelligence and integrity.We shall never know how many precociously perceptive youths sensed the evilaround them, before they were old enough to find an antidote—and gave up, inhelplessly indignant bewilderment; or how many gave in, stultifying their minds.We do not know how many young innovators may exist today and struggle to beheard—but we will not hear of them because the Establishment would prefer not torecognize their existence and not to take any cognizance of their ideas.So long as a society does not take the ultimate step into the abyss byestablishing censorship, some men of ability will always succeed in breakingthrough. But the price—in effort, struggle and endurance—is such that onlyexceptional men can afford it. Today, originality, integrity, independence havebecome a road to martyrdom, which only the most dedicated will choose, knowingthat the alternative is much worse. A society that sets up these conditions asthe price of achievement, is in deep trouble.The following is for the consideration of those “humanitarian” Congressmen (andtheir constituents) who think that a few public “plums” tossed to some oldprofessors won’t hurt anyone: it is the moral character of decent average menthat has no chance under the rule of entrenched mediocrity. The genius can andwill fight to the last. The average man cannot and does not.In Atlas Shrugged, I discussed the “pyramid of ability” in the realm ofeconomics. There is another kind of social pyramid. The genius who fights “everyform of tyranny over the mind of man” is fighting a battle for which lesser mendo not have the strength, but on which their freedom, their dignity, and theirintegrity depend. It is the pyramid of moral endurance."},{"pageContent":"15Censorship: Local and Express1973 I have been saying, for many years, that statism is winning by default—by theintellectual default of capitalism’s alleged defenders; that freedom andcapitalism have never had a firm, philosophical base; that today’s conservativesshare all the fundamental premises of today’s liberals and thus have paved, andare still paving, the road to statism. I have also said repeatedly that thebattle for freedom is primarily philosophical and cannot be won by any lessermeans—because philosophy rules human existence, including politics.But philosophy is a science that deals with the broadest abstractions and,therefore, many people do not know how to observe its influence in practice orhow to grasp the process by which it affects the conditions of their daily life.A recent event, however, offers a clear, striking illustration of that process.It shows philosophy’s influence in action, and reveals the essence (and thecontradictions) of both the conservative and the liberal ideologies. This eventis the decision of the Supreme Court in five recent “obscenity” cases.In [The Ayn Rand Letter] of November 20, 1972, I expressed hope in regard to thefour men appointed to the Supreme Court by President Nixon, even though it wastoo early to tell the exact nature of their views. “But,” I said, “if they liveup to their enormous responsibility, we may forgive Mr. Nixon a great many ofhis defaults: the Supreme Court is the last remnant of a philosophical influencein this country.” Today, less than a year later, the evidence is sufficient toindicate that there are no intellectual grounds left for forgiving Mr. Nixon.Since inconsistent premises lead to inconsistent actions, it is not impossiblethat the present Supreme Court may make some liberating decisions. For instance,the Court made a great contribution to justice and to the protection ofindividual rights when it legalized abortion. I am not in agreement with all ofthe reasoning given in that decision, but I am in enthusiastic agreement withthe result—i.e., with the recognition of a woman’s right to her own body. Butthe Court’s decision in regard to obscenity takes an opposite stand: it denies aman’s (or a woman’s) right to the exercise of his own mind—by establishing thelegal and intellectual base of censorship.Before proceeding to discuss that decision, I want to state, for the record, myown view of what is called “hard-core” pornography. I regard it as unspeakablydisgusting. I have not read any of the books or seen any of the current moviesbelonging to that category, and I do not intend ever to read or see them. Thedescriptions provided in legal cases, as well as the “modern” touches in“soft-core” productions, are sufficient grounds on which to form an opinion. Thereason of my opinion is the opposite of the usual one: I do not regard sex asevil—I regard it as good, as one of the most important aspects of human life,too important to be made the subject of public anatomical display. But the issuehere is not one’s view of sex. The issue is freedom of speech and of thepress—i.e., the right to hold any view and to express it.It is not very inspiring to fight for the freedom of the purveyors ofpornography or their customers. But in the transition to statism, everyinfringement of human rights has begun with the suppression of a given right’sleast attractive practitioners. In this case, the disgusting nature of theoffenders makes it a good test of one’s loyalty to a principle.In the five “obscenity” cases decided on June 21, 1973, the Court was dividedfive to four. In each case, the majority opinion was written by Chief JusticeBurger, joined by Justices Blackmun, Powell, Rehnquist (all four appointed byNixon) and Justice White (appointed by Kennedy); in each case, the dissentingopinion was written by Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Stewart and Marshall;Justice Douglas, in each case, wrote a separate dissenting opinion. The two mostimportant cases are Miller v. California and Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton.The Miller case involves a man who was convicted in California of mailingunsolicited, sexually explicit material, which advertised pornographic books. Itis in the Miller decision that Chief Justice Burger promulgated the new criteriafor judging whether a given work is obscene or not. They are as follows:“The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether ‘the averageperson, applying contemporary community standards’ would find that the work,taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest . . . (b) whether the workdepicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specificallydefined by the applicable state law, and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole,lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.”These criteria are based on previous Supreme Court decisions, particularly onRoth v. United States, 1957. Nine years later, in the case of Memoirs v.Massachusetts, 1966, the Supreme Court introduced a new criterion: “A bookcannot be proscribed unless it is found to be utterly without redeeming socialvalue.” This was bad enough, but the present decision emphatically rejects thatparticular notion and substitutes a horrendous criterion of its own: “whetherthe work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, orscientific value.”Morally, this criterion, as well as the rest of Chief Justice Burger’s decision,taken as a whole, is a proclamation of collectivism—not so much political asspecifically moral collectivism. The intellectual standard which is here set upto rule an individual’s mind—to prescribe what an individual may write, publish,read or see—is the judgment of an average person applying community standards.Why? No reason is given—which means that the will of the collective is heretaken for granted as the source, justification and criterion of value judgments.What is a community? No definition is given—it may, therefore, be a state, acity, a neighborhood, or just the block you live on. What are communitystandards ? No definition is given. In fact, the standards of a community, whenand if they can be observed as such, as distinguished from the standards of itsindividual citizens, are a product of chance, lethargy, hypocrisy,second-handedness, indifference, fear, the manipulations of local busybodies orsmall-time power-lusters—and, occasionally, the traditional acceptance of somedecent values inherited from some great mind of the past. But the great mind isnow to be outlawed by the ruling of the Supreme Court.Who is the average person? No definition is given. There is some indication thatthe term, in this context, means a person who is neither particularlysusceptible or sensitive nor totally insensitive in regard to sex. But to find asexually average person is a more preposterously impossible undertaking than tofind the average representative of any other human characteristic—and, besides,this is not what the Court decision says. It says simply “average”—which, in anissue of judgment, means intellectually average: average in intelligence, inability, in ideas, in feelings, in tastes, which means: a conformist or anonentity. Any proposition concerned with establishing a human “average”necessarily eliminates the top and the bottom, i.e., the best and the worst.Thus the standards of a genius and the standards of a moron are automaticallyeliminated, suppressed or prohibited—and both are ordered to subordinate theirown views to those of the average. Why is the average person to be granted soawesome a privilege? By reason of the fact that he possesses no specialdistinction. Nothing can justify such a notion, except the theory ofcollectivism, which is itself unjustifiable.The Court’s decision asserts repeatedly—just asserts—that this ruling appliesonly to hard-core pornography or obscenity, i.e., to certain ideas dealing withsex, not to any other kinds of ideas. Other kinds of ideas—it keepsasserting—are protected by the First Amendment, but ideas dealing with sex arenot. Apart from the impossibility of drawing a line between these two categories(which we shall discuss later), this distinction is contradicted and invalidatedright in the text of this same decision: the trial judges and juries areempowered to determine whether a work that contains sexual elements “lacksserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.”This means—and can mean nothing else—that the government is empowered to judgeliterary, artistic, political, and scientific values, and to permit or suppresscertain works accordingly.The alleged limits on that power, the conditions of when, where and by whom itmay be exercised, are of no significance—once the principle that the governmentholds such a power has been established. The rest is only a matter ofdetails—and of time. The present Supreme Court may seek to suppress only sexualmaterials; on the same basis (the will of the community), a future Court maysuppress “undesirable” scientific discussions; still another Court may suppresspolitical discussions (and a year later all discussions in all fields would besuppressed). The law functions by a process of deriving logical consequencesfrom established precedents.The “average person’s community standards” criterion, was set up in the Rothcase. But the Roth criterion, of “utterly without redeeming social value” wastoo vague to be immediately dangerous—anything may be claimed to have some sortof “social value.” So, logically, on the basis of that precedent, the presentCourt took the next step toward censorship. It gave to the government the powerof entry into four specific intellectual fields, with the power to judge whetherthe values of works in these fields are serious or not.“Serious” is an unserious standard. Who is to determine what is serious, towhom, and by what criterion? Since no definition is given, one must assume thatthe criterion to apply is the only one promulgated in those guidelines: what theaverage person would find serious. Do you care to contemplate the spectacle ofthe average person as the ultimate authority—the censor—in the field ofliterature? In the field of art? In the field of politics? In the field ofscience? An authority whose edict is to be imposed by force and is to determinewhat will be permitted or suppressed in all these fields? I submit that nopornographic movie can be as morally obscene as a prospect of this kind.No first-rate talent in any of those fields will ever be willing to work by theintellectual standards and under the orders of any authority, even if it were anauthority composed of the best brains in the world (who would not accept thejob), let alone an authority consisting of “average persons.” And the greaterthe talent, the less the willingness.As to those who would be willing, observe the moral irony of the fact that theydo exist today in large numbers and are generally despised: they are the hacks,the box-office chasers, who try to please what they think are the tastes—and thestandards—of the public, for the sake of making money. Apparently, intellectualprostitution is evil, if done for a “selfish” motive—but noble, if accepted inselfless service to the “moral purity” of the community.In another of the five “obscenity” cases (U.S. v. 12 200-Ft. Reels of Super 8mm.Film), but in a totally different context, Chief Justice Burger himselfdescribes the danger created by the logical implications of a precedent: “Theseductive plausibility of single steps in a chain of evolutionary development ofa legal rule is often not perceived until a third, fourth or fifth ‘logical’extension occurs. Each step, when taken, appeared a reasonable step in relationto that which preceded it, although the aggregate or end result is one thatwould never have been seriously considered in the first instance. This kind ofgestative propensity calls for the ‘line drawing’ familiar in the judicial, asin the legislative process: ‘thus far but not beyond.’ ”I would argue that since a legal rule is a principle, the development of itslogical consequences cannot be cut off, except by repealing the principle. Butassuming that such a cutoff were possible, no line of any sort is drawn in theMiller decision: the community standards of average persons are explicitlydeclared to be a sovereign power over sexual matters and over the works thatdeal with sexual matters.In the same Miller decision, Chief Justice Burger admits that no such line canbe drawn. “Nothing in the First Amendment requires that a jury must considerhypothetical and unascertainable ‘national standards’ when attempting todetermine whether certain materials are obscene as a matter of fact.” He quotesChief Justice Warren saying in an earlier case: “I believe that there is noprovable ‘national standard.’ . . . At all events, this Court has not been ableto enunciate one, and it would be unreasonable to expect local courts to divineone.”By what means are local courts to divine a local one? Actually, the onlyprovable standard of what constitutes obscenity would be an objective standard,philosophically proved and valid for all men. Such a standard cannot be definedor enforced in terms of law: it would require the formulation of an entirephilosophic system; but even this would not grant anyone the right to enforcethat standard on others. When the Court, however, speaks of a “provable nationalstandard,” it does not mean an objective standard; it substitutes the collectivefor the objective, and seeks to enunciate a standard held by all the averagepersons of the nation. Since even a guess at such a concept is patentlyimpossible, the Court concludes that what is impossible (and improper)nationally, is permissible locally—and, in effect, passes the buck to statelegislatures, granting them the power to enforce arbitrary (unprovable) localstandards.Chief Justice Burger’s arguments, in the Miller decision, are not verypersuasive. “It is neither realistic nor constitutionally sound to read theFirst Amendment as requiring that the people of Maine or Mississippi acceptpublic depiction of conduct found tolerable in Las Vegas, or New York City.” Iread the First Amendment as not requiring any person anywhere to accept anydepiction he does not wish to read or see, but forbidding him to abridge therights and freedom of those who do wish to read or see it.In another argument against a national standard of what constitutes obscenity,the decision declares: “People in different States vary in their tastes andattitudes, and this diversity is not to be strangled by the absolutism ofimposed uniformity.” What about the absolutism of imposed uniformity within astate? What about the non-conformists in that state? What about communicationbetween citizens of different states? What about the freedom of a nationalmarketplace of ideas? No answers are given.The following argument, offered in a footnote, is unworthy of a serioustribunal: “The mere fact juries may reach different conclusions as to the samematerial does not mean that constitutional rights are abridged. As this Courtobserved in Roth v. United States . . . ‘It is common experience that differentjuries may reach different results under any criminal statute. That is one ofthe consequences we accept under our jury system. . . .’ ” In a criminal case,the jury’s duty is only to determine whether a particular defendant committedthe crime which is clearly and specifically defined by the statute. Under thenew “obscenity” ruling, a jury is expected to determine whether the defendentcommitted an undefined crime and, simultaneously, to determine what that crimeis.Thus the Nixon Court’s notion of censorship-sharing by diffusing it at randomover the entire country, is as illusory as Nixon’s notion of returning power tothe states by means of revenue-sharing. While the public rides on the creakingtrain of local censorship, with delays, derailments and chaos at every whistlestop— the express of statism is flying full speed on an unobstructed track.Four of the Justices who handed down the Miller decision are regarded asconservatives; the fifth, Justice White, is regarded as middle-of-the-road. Onthe other hand, Justice Douglas is the most liberal or the most leftward-leaningmember of the Court. Yet his dissent in the Miller case is an impassioned cry ofprotest and indignation. He rejects the notion that the First Amendment allowsan implied exception in the case of obscenity. “I do not think it does and myviews on the issue have been stated over and over again.” He declares:“Obscenity—which even we cannot define with precision—is a hodge-podge. To sendmen to jail for violating standards they cannot understand, construe, and applyis a monstrous thing to do in a Nation dedicated to fair trials and dueprocess.”What about the antitrust laws, which are responsible for precisely this kind ofmonstrous thing? Justice Douglas does not mention them—but antitrust, as weshall see later, is a chicken that comes home to roost on both sides of thisissue.On the subject of censorship, however, Justice Douglas is eloquently consistent:“The idea that the First Amendment permits punishment for ideas that are‘offensive’ to the particular judge or jury sitting in judgment is astounding.No greater leveler of speech or literature has ever been designed. To give thepower to the censor, as we do today, is to make a sharp and radical break withthe traditions of a free society. The First Amendment was not fashioned as avehicle for dispensing tranquilizers to the people. Its prime function was tokeep debate open to ‘offensive’ as well as to ‘staid’ people. The tendencythroughout history has been to subdue the individual and to exalt the power ofgovernment. The use of the standard ‘offensive’ gives authority to governmentthat cuts the very vitals out of the First Amendment. As is intimated by theCourt’s opinion, the materials before us may be garbage. But so is much of whatis said in political campaigns, in the daily press, on TV or over the radio. Byreason of the First Amendment—and solely because of it—speakers and publishershave not been threatened or subdued because their thoughts and ideas may be‘offensive’ to some.”I can only say “Amen” to this statement.Observe that such issues as the individual against the State are never mentionedin the Supreme Court’s majority decision. It is Justice Douglas, thearch-liberal, who defends individual rights. It is the conservatives who speakas if the individual did not exist, as if the unit of social concern were thecollective—the “community.”A profound commitment to moral collectivism does not occur in a vacuum, as acauseless primary: it requires an epistemological foundation. The SupremeCourt’s majority decision in the case of Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton revealsthat foundation.This case involves two movie theaters in Atlanta, Georgia, which exhibitedallegedly obscene films, admitting only adults. The local trial court ruled thatthis was constitutionally permissible, but the Georgia Supreme Court reversedthe decision—on the grounds that hard-core pornography is not protected by theFirst Amendment. Thus the issue before the U.S. Supreme Court was whether it isconstitutional to abridge the freedom of consenting adults. The Court’s majoritydecision said: “Yes.”Epistemologically, this decision is a proclamation of non-objectivity: itsupports and defends explicitly the most evil of social phenomena: non-objectivelaw.The decision, written by Chief Justice Burger, declares: “we hold that there arelegitimate state interests at stake in stemming the tide of commercializedobscenity . . . These include the interest of the public in the quality of lifeand the total community environment, the tone of commerce in the great citycenters, and, possibly, the public safety itself.” (Emphasis added.) Try to finda single issue or action that would be exempt from this kind of “legitimate”state interest.Quoting a book by Professor Bickel, the decision declares: “A man may beentitled to read an obscene book in his room . . . But if he demands a right toobtain the books and pictures he wants in the market . . . then to grant him hisright is to affect the world about the rest of us, and to impinge on otherprivacies . . . what is commonly read and seen and heard and done intrudes uponus all, want it or not.” Which human activity would be exempt from a declarationof this kind? And what advocate of a totalitarian dictatorship would not endorsethat declaration?Mr. Burger concedes that “there is no scientific data which conclusivelydemonstrates that exposure to obscene materials adversely affects men and womenor their society.” But he rejects this as an argument against the suppression ofsuch materials. And there follows an avalanche of statements and of quotationsfrom earlier Court decisions—all claiming (in terms broader than the issue ofpornography) that scientific knowledge and conclusive proof are not required asa basis for legislation, that the State has the right to enact laws on thegrounds of what does or might exist.“Scientific data” (in the proper, literal sense of these words) means knowledgeof reality, reached by a process of reason; and “conclusive demonstration” meansthat the content of a given proposition is proved to be a fact of reality. It isreason and reality that are here being removed as a limitation on the power ofthe State. It is the right to legislate on the basis of any assumption, anyhypothesis, any guess, any feeling, any whim—on any grounds or none—that is herebeing conferred on the government.“We do not demand of legislatures ‘scientifically certain criteria oflegislation,’ ” the decision affirms. “Although there is no conclusive proof ofa connection between antisocial behavior and obscene material, the legislatureof Georgia could quite reasonably determine that such a connection does or mightexist. In deciding Roth, this Court implicitly accepted that a legislature couldlegitimately act on such a conclusion to protect ‘the social interest in orderand morality.’ ”If the notion that something might be a threat to the “social interest” issufficient to justify suppression, then the Nazi or the Soviet dictatorship isjustified in exterminating anyone who, in its belief, might be a threat to the“social interest” of the Nazi or the Soviet “community.”Whatever theory of government such a notion represents, it is not the theory ofAmerica’s Founding Fathers. Strangely enough, Chief Justice Burger seems to beaware of it, because he proceeds to call on a pre-American precedent. “From thebeginning of civilized societies, legislators and judges have acted on variousunprovable assumptions. Such assumptions underlie much lawful state regulationof commercial and business affairs.”This is preeminently true—and look at the results. Look at the history of allthe governments in the world prior to the birth of the United States. Ours wasthe first government based on and strictly limited by a written document—theConstitution—which specifically forbids it to violate individual rights or toact on whim. The history of the atrocities perpetrated by all the other kinds ofgovernments—unrestricted governments acting on unprovableassumptions—demonstrates the value and validity of the original political theoryon which this country was built. Yet here is the Supreme Court citing all thosebloody millennia of tyranny, as a precedent for us to follow.If this seems inexplicable, the very next sentence of Mr. Burger’s decisiongives a clue to the reasons—and a violently clear demonstration of the role ofprecedent in the development of law. That next sentence seems to unleash awhirling storm of feathers, as chickens come flying home from every direction toroost on everyone’s coop, perch or fence—in retribution for every evasion,compromise, injustice, and violation of rights perpetrated in past decades.That next sentence is: “The same [a basis of unprovable assumptions] is true ofthe federal securities, antitrust laws and a host of other federal regulations.”Formally, I would have to say: “Oh, Mr. Chief Justice!” Informally, I want tosay: “Oh, brother!”“On the basis of these assumptions,” Mr. Burger goes on, “both Congress andstate legislatures have, for example, drastically restricted associationalrights by adopting antitrust laws, and have strictly regulated public expressionby issuers of and dealers in securities, profit sharing ‘coupons,’ and ‘tradingstamps,’ commanding what they must and may not publish and announce. . . .Understandably those who entertain an absolutist view of the First Amendmentfind it uncomfortable to explain why rights of association, speech, and pressshould be severely restrained in the marketplace of goods and money, but not inthe marketplace of pornography.”On the collectivist premise, there is, of course, no answer. The only answer, intoday’s situation, is to check that premise and reject it—and start repealingall those catastrophically destructive violations of individual rights and ofthe Constitution. But this is not what the Court majority has decided.Forgetting his own warning about the “gestative propensity” of the judicial andlegislative processes, Chief Justice Burger accepts the precedent as anirrevocable absolute and pushes the country many steps further toward the abyssof statism.“Likewise,” the decision continues, “when legislatures and administrators act toprotect the physical environment from pollution and to preserve our resources offorests, streams and parks, they must act on such imponderables as the impact ofa new highway near or through an existing park or wilderness area. . . . Thusthe Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 . . . and the Department of TransportationAct of 1966 . . . have been described by Mr. Justice Black as ‘a solemndetermination of the highest law-making body of this Nation that beauty andhealth-giving facilities of our parks are not to be taken away for public roadswithout hearings, fact-findings, and policy determinations under the supervisionof a Cabinet officer. . . .’ The fact that a congressional directive reflectsunprovable assumptions about what is good for the people, including imponderableaesthetic assumptions, is not a sufficient reason to find that statuteunconstitutional.”Isn’t it? If it is not, then the imponderable aesthetic assumptions ofgovernment officials are entitled to invade the field of literature and art—asMr. Burger’s decision is inviting them to do.The ugly hand of altruism slithers into the decision, in a passage thatsideswipes the concept of free will. “We have just noted, for example, thatneither the First Amendment nor ‘free will’ precludes States from having ‘bluesky’ laws to regulate what sellers of securities may write or publish abouttheir wares. . . . Such laws are to protect the weak, the uninformed, theunsuspecting, and the gullible from the exercise of their own volition.” It isfor this kind of purpose that the rest of us—who are not weak, uninformed,unsuspecting, and gullible—are to be protected from our volition and deprived ofthe right to exercise it. So much for the relation of altruism to rights and tofreedom.Here is another chicken flying home: “States are told by some that they mustawait a ‘laissez-faire’ market solution to the obscenity-pornography problem,paradoxically ‘by people who have never otherwise had a kind word to say forlaissez-faire,’ particularly in solving urban, commercial, and environmentalpollution problems.”The decision contains many other homing chickens of this kind—an entire barnyardof them—many more than I have space to quote. But these are sufficient to giveyou the nature, style and spirit of that ruling.In his dissenting opinion, Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Stewart andMarshall, offers some good arguments to support the conclusion that censorshipin regard to consenting adults is unconstitutional. But he wavers, hesitates togo that far, and tries to compromise, to strike “a better balance between theguarantee of free expression and the States’ legitimate interests.”He concedes the notion that obscene material is not protected by the FirstAmendment, but expresses an anxious concern over the Court’s failure to draw aclear line between protected and unprotected speech. He cites the chaotic,contradictory record of the Court’s decisions in “obscenity” cases, butsidesteps the issue by saying, in a footnote: “Whether or not a class of‘obscene’ and thus entirely unprotected speech does exist, I am forced toconclude that the class is incapable of definition with sufficient clarity towithstand attack on vagueness grounds. Accordingly, it is on principles of thevoid-for-vagueness doctrine that this opinion exclusively relies.”Justice Brennan speaks eloquently about the danger of vague laws, and quotesChief Justice Warren, who said that “the constitutional requirement ofdefiniteness is violated by a criminal statute that fails to give a person ofordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden bythe statute.” But Justice Brennan does not mention the antitrust laws, which dojust that. He states: “The resulting level of uncertainty is utterlyintolerable, not alone because it makes ‘bookselling . . . a hazardousprofession,’ . . . but as well because it invites arbitrary and erraticenforcement of the law.” He deplores the fact that “obscenity” judgments are nowmade on “a case-by-case, sight-by-sight” basis. He observes that the Court hasbeen struggling “to fend off legislative attempts ‘to pass to the courts—andultimately to the Supreme Court—the awesome task of making case by case at oncethe criminal and the constitutional law.’ ” But he does not mention the livinghell of antitrust, the grim monument to law made case by case.However, a greater respect for principles and a greater understanding of theirconsequences are revealed in Justice Brennan’s dissenting opinion than in themajority decision. He declares that on the basis of that majority decision: “itis hard to see how state-ordered regimentation of our minds can ever beforestalled. For if a State may, in an effort to maintain or create a particularmoral tone, prescribe what its citizens cannot read or cannot see, then it wouldseem to follow that in pursuit of that same objective a State could decree thatits citizens must read certain books or must view certain films.”The best statement, however, is made again by Justice Douglas, who ends hisforceful dissent with the words: “But our society—unlike most in theworld—presupposes that freedom and liberty are in a frame of reference that makethe individual, not government, the keeper of his tastes, beliefs, and ideas.That is the philosophy of the First Amendment; and it is the article of faiththat sets us apart from most nations in the world.”I concur—except that it is not an “article of faith,” but a provable, rationalconviction.In the life of a nation, the law plays the same role as a decision-makingprocess of thought does in the life of an individual. An individual makesdecisions by applying his basic premises to a specific choice—premises which hecan change, but seldom does. The basic premises of a nation’s laws are set byits dominant political philosophy and implemented by the courts, whose task isto determine the application of broad principles to specific cases; in thistask, the equivalent of basic premises is precedent, which can be challenged,but seldom is.How far a loosely worded piece of legislation can go in the role of precedent,is horrifyingly demonstrated by the Supreme Court’s majority decision in anotherone of the five “obscenity” cases, U.S. v. Orito. This case involves a mancharged with knowingly transporting obscene material by common carrier ininterstate commerce.The clause giving Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce is one ofthe major errors in the Constitution. That clause, more than any other, was thecrack in the Constitution’s foundation, the entering wedge of statism, whichpermitted the gradual establishment of the welfare state. But I would venture tosay that the framers of the Constitution could not have conceived of what thatclause has now become. If, in writing it, one of their goals was to facilitatethe flow of trade and prevent the establishment of trade barriers among thestates, that clause has reached the opposite destination. You may now expectfifty different frontiers inside this country, with customs officials searchingyour luggage and pockets for books or magazines permitted in one state butprohibited in another.Chief Justice Burger’s decision declares, quoting an earlier Court decision:“The motive and purpose of a regulation of interstate commerce are matters forthe legislative judgment upon the exercise of which the Constitution places norestriction and over which the courts are given no control.” Such aninterpretation means that legislative judgment is given an absolute power,beyond the restraint of any principle, beyond the reach of any checks orbalances. This is an outrageous instance of context-dropping: the Constitution,taken as a whole, is a fundamental restriction on the power of the government,whether in the legislative or in any other branch.“It is sufficient to reiterate,” Mr. Burger declares, “the well-settledprinciple that Congress may impose relevant conditions and requirements on thosewho use the channels of interstate commerce in order that those channels willnot become the means of promoting or spreading evil, whether of a physical,moral or economic nature.” As if this were not clear enough, a footnote isadded: “Congress can certainly regulate interstate commerce to the extent offorbidding and punishing the use of such commerce as an agency to promoteimmorality, dishonesty, or the spread of any evil or harm to the people of otherstates from the state of origin.” Immorality, evil and harm—by what standard?The only rights which the five majority decisions leave you are the right toread and see what you wish in your own room, but not outside it—and the right tothink whatever you please in the privacy of your own mind. But this is a rightwhich even a totalitarian dictatorship is unable to suppress. (You are free tothink in Soviet Russia, but not to act on your thinking.) Again, JusticeDouglas’s dissent is the only voice raised in desperate protest: “Our wholeconstitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power tocontrol men’s minds.”The division between the conservative and the liberal viewpoints in the opinionsof the Supreme Court, is sharper and clearer than in less solemn writings or inpurely political debates. By the nature of its task, the Supreme Court has toand does become the voice of philosophy.The necessity to deal with principles makes the members of the Supreme Courtseem archetypical of the ideas—almost, of the soul—of the two political campsthey represent. They were not chosen as archetypes: in the undefined,indeterminate, contradictory chaos of political views loosely labeled“conservative” and “liberal,” it would be impossible to choose an essentialcharacteristic or a typical representative. Yet, as one reads the SupremeCourt’s opinions, the essential premises stand out with an oddly bright,revealing clarity—and one grasps that under all the lesser differences andinconsistencies of their followers, these are the basic premises of onepolitical camp or of the other. It is almost as if one were seeing not theseantagonists’ philosophy, but their sense of life.The subject of the five “obscenity” cases was not obscenity as such—which is amarginal and inconsequential matter—but a much deeper issue: the sexual aspectof man’s life. Sex is not a separate nor a purely physical attribute of man’scharacter: it involves a complex integration of all his fundamental values. Soit is not astonishing that cases dealing with sex (even in its ugliestmanifestations) would involve the influence of all the branches of philosophy.We have seen the influence of ethics, epistemology, politics, esthetics (thislast as the immediate victim of the debate). What about the fifth branch ofphilosophy, the basic one, the fundamental of the science of fundamentals:metaphysics? Its influence is revealed in—and explains—the inner contradictionsof each camp. The metaphysical issue is their view of man’s nature.Both camps hold the same premise—the mind-body dichotomy—but choose oppositesides of this lethal fallacy.The conservatives want freedom to act in the material realm; they tend to opposegovernment control of production, of industry, of trade, of business, ofphysical goods, of material wealth. But they advocate government control ofman’s spirit, i.e., man’s consciousness; they advocate the State’s right toimpose censorship, to determine moral values, to create and enforce agovernmental establishment of morality, to rule the intellect. The liberals wantfreedom to act in the spiritual realm; they oppose censorship, they opposegovernment control of ideas, of the arts, of the press, of education (note theirconcern with “academic freedom”). But they advocate government control ofmaterial production, of business, of employment, of wages, of profits, of allphysical property—they advocate it all the way down to total expropriation.The conservatives see man as a body freely roaming the earth, building sandpiles or factories—with an electronic computer inside his skull, controlled fromWashington. The liberals see man as a soul freewheeling to the farthest reachesof the universe—but wearing chains from nose to toes when he crosses the streetto buy a loaf of bread.Yet it is the conservatives who are predominantly religionists, who proclaim thesuperiority of the soul over the body, who represent what I call the “mystics ofspirit.” And it is the liberals who are predominantly materialists, who regardman as an aggregate of meat, and who represent what I call the “mystics ofmuscle.”This is merely a paradox, not a contradiction: each camp wants to control therealm it regards as metaphysically important; each grants freedom only to theactivities it despises. Observe that the conservatives insult and demean therich or those who succeed in material production, regarding them as morallyinferior—and that the liberals treat ideas as a cynical con game. “Control,” toboth camps, means the power to rule by physical force. Neither camp holdsfreedom as a value. The conservatives want to rule man’s consciousness; theliberals, his body.On that premise, neither camp has permitted itself to observe that force is akiller in both realms. The conservatives, frozen in their mystic dogmas, areparalyzed, terrified and impotent in the realm of ideas. The liberals, waitingfor the unearned, are paralyzed, terrified and, frequently, incompetent in orhostile to the realm of material production (observe the ecology crusade).Why do both camps cling to blind faith in the power of physical force? I quotefrom Atlas Shrugged: “Do you observe what human faculty that doctrine [themind-body dichotomy] was designed to destroy? It was man’s mind that had to benegated in order to make him fall apart.” Both camps, conservatives and liberalsalike, are united in their hatred of man’s mind—i.e., of reason. Theconservatives reject reason in favor of faith; the liberals, in favor ofemotions. The conservatives are either lethargically indifferent to intellectualissues, or actively anti-intellectual. The liberals are smarter in this respect:they use intellectual weapons to destroy and negate the intellect (they call it“to redefine”). When men reject reason, they have no means left for dealing withone another—except brute, physical force.I quote from Atlas Shrugged: “. . . the men you call materialists andspiritualists are only two halves of the same dissected human, forever seekingcompletion, but seeking it by swinging from the destruction of the flesh to thedestruction of the soul and vice versa . . . seeking any refuge against reality,any form of escape from the mind.” Since the two camps are only two sides of thesame coin—the same counterfeit coin—they are now moving closer and closertogether. Observe the fundamental similarity of their philosophical views: inmetaphysics—the mind-body dichotomy; in epistemology—irrationalism; inethics—altruism; in politics—statism.The conservatives used to claim that they were loyal to tradition—while theliberals boasted of being “progressive.” But observe that it is Chief JusticeBurger, a conservative, who propounds a militant collectivism, and formulatesgeneral principles that stretch the power of the State way beyond the issue ofpornography—and it is Justice Douglas, a liberal, who invokes “the traditions ofa free society” and pleads for “our constitutional heritage.”If someone had said in 1890 that antitrust laws for the businessmen would,sooner or later, lead to censorship for the intellectuals, no one would havebelieved it. You can see it today. When Chief Justice Burger declares to theliberals that they cannot explain why rights “should be severely restrained inthe marketplace of goods and money, but not in the marketplace of pornography,”I am tempted to feel that it serves them right—except that all of us are thevictims.If this censorship ruling is not revoked, the next step will be more explicit:it will replace the words “marketplace of pornography” with the words“marketplace of ideas.” This will serve as a precedent for the liberals,enabling them to determine which ideas they wish to suppress—in the name of the“social interest”—when their turn comes. No one can win a contest of thiskind—except the State.I do not know how the conservative members of the Supreme Court can bear to lookat the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, where his words are engraved in marble:“I have sworn . . . eternal hostility to every form of tyranny over the mind ofman.”Permit me to add without presumptuousness: “So have I.”"},{"pageContent":"16Fairness Doctrine for Education1972 The “Fairness Doctrine” is a messy little makeshift of the mixed economy, and apoor substitute for freedom of speech. It has, however, served as a minimalretarder of the collectivist trend: it has prevented the Establishment’s totaltakeover of the airwaves. For this reason—as a temporary measure in a gravenational emergency—the fairness doctrine should now be invoked in behalf ofeducation.The doctrine is a typical product of the socialist sentimentality that dreams ofcombining government ownership with intellectual freedom. As applied totelevision and radio broadcasting, the fairness doctrine demands that equalopportunity be given to all sides of a controversial issue—on the grounds of thenotion that “the people owns the airwaves” and, therefore, all factions of “thepeople” should have equal access to their communal property.The trouble with the fairness doctrine is that it cannot be applied fairly. Likeany ideological product of the mixed economy, it is a vague, indefinableapproximation and, therefore, an instrument of pressure-group warfare. Whodetermines which issues are controversial? Who chooses the representatives ofthe different sides in a given controversy? If there are too many conflictingviewpoints, which are to be given a voice and which are to be kept silent? Whois “the people” and who is not?It is clear that the individual’s views are barred altogether and that the“fairness” is extended only to groups. The formula employed by the televisionstations in New York declares that they recognize their obligation to provideequal time to “significant opposing viewpoints.” Who determines which viewpointis “significant”? Is the standard qualitative or quantitative? It is obviouslythis last, as one may observe in practice: whenever an answer is given to a TVeditorial, it is given by a representative of some group involved in the debatedsubject.The fairness doctrine (as well as the myth of public ownership) is based on thefavorite illusion of the mushy socialists, i.e., those who want to combine forceand freedom, as distinguished from the bloody socialists, i.e., the communistsand the fascists. That illusion is the belief that the people (“the masses”)would be essentially unanimous, that dissenting groups would be rare and easilyaccommodated, that a monolithic majority-will would prevail, and that anyinjustice done would be done only to recalcitrant individuals, who, in socialisttheory, do not count anyway. (For a discussion of why the airwaves should beprivate property, see “The Property Status of Airwaves” in my book Capitalism:The Unknown Ideal.)In practice, the fairness doctrine has led to the precarious rule of a“centrist” attitude: of timidity, compromise and fear (with the “center”slithering slowly, inexorably to the left)—i.e., control by the Establishment,limited only by the remnants of a tradition of freedom: by lip service to“impartiality,” by fear of being caught at too obvious an “unfairness,” and bythe practice of “window dressing,” which consists in some occasional moments ofair time tossed to some representatives of extreme and actually significantopposing viewpoints. Such a policy, by its very nature, is temporary.Nevertheless, this “window dressing” is the last chance that the advocates offreedom have, as far as the airwaves are concerned.There is no equivalent of the fairness doctrine in the field which is much moreimportant to a nation’s future than its airwaves—the field which determines acountry’s intellectual trends, i.e., the dominant ideas in people’s minds, inthe culture, in the Establishment, in the press and, ultimately, on the air: thefield of higher education.So long as higher education was provided predominantly by private colleges anduniversities, no problem of unfairness existed. A private school has the rightto teach any ideas of its owners’ choice, and to exclude all opposing ideas; butit has no power to force such exclusion on the rest of the country. Theopponents have the right to establish schools of their own and to teach theirideas or a wider spectrum of viewpoints, if they so choose. The competition ofthe free marketplace of ideas does the rest, determining every school’s successor failure—which, historically, was the course of the development of the greatprivate universities. But the growth of government power, of state universities,and of taxation brought the private universities under a growing control by anddependence on the government. (On this point, see also “Tax Credits forEducation,” in The Ayn Rand Letter of March 13, 1972.) The current billproviding Federal “aid” to higher education will make the control and dependenceall but total, thus establishing a governmental monopoly on education.The most ominously crucial question now hanging over this country’s future is:what will our universities teach at our expense and without our consent? Whatideas will be propagated or excluded? (This question applies to all public andsemi-public institutions of learning. By “semi-public” I mean those formerlyprivate institutions which are to be supported in part by public funds andcontrolled in full by the government.)The government has no right to set itself up as the arbiter of ideas and,therefore, its establishments—the public and semi-public schools—have no rightto teach a single viewpoint, excluding all others. They have no right to servethe beliefs of any one group of citizens, leaving others ignored and silenced.They have no right to impose inequality on the citizens who bear equally theburden of supporting them.As in the case of governmental grants to science, it is viciously wrong to forcean individual to pay for the teaching of ideas diametrically opposed to his own;it is a profound violation of his rights. The violation becomes monstrous if hisideas are excluded from such public teaching: this means that he is forced topay for the propagation of that which he regards as false and evil, and for thesuppression of that which he regards as true and good. If there is a viler formof injustice, I challenge any resident of Washington, D.C., to name it.Yet this is the form of injustice committed by the present policy of anoverwhelming majority of our public and semi-public universities.There is a widespread impression that television and the press are biased andslanted to the left. But they are models of impartiality and fairness comparedto the ferocious intolerance, the bias, the prejudices, the distortions, thesavage obscurantism now running riot in most of our institutions of higherlearning—in regard to matters deeper than mere politics. With rare exceptions,each of the various departments and disciplines is ruled by its own particularclique that gets in and virtually excludes the teaching of any theory orviewpoint other than its own. If a private school permits this, it has the rightto do so; a public or semi-public school has not.Controversy is the hallmark of our age; there is no subject, particularly in thehumanities, which is not regarded in fundamentally different ways by manydifferent schools of thought. (This is not to say that all of them are valid,but merely to observe that they exist.) Yet most university departments,particularly in the leading universities, offer a single viewpoint (camouflagedby minor variations) and maintain their monopoly by the simple means of evasion:by ignoring anything that does not fit their viewpoint, by pretending that noothers exist, and by reducing dissent to trivia, thus leaving fundamentalsunchallenged.Most of today’s philosophy departments are dominated by Linguistic Analysis (theunsuccessful product of crossbreeding between philosophy and grammar, a unionwhose offspring is less viable than a mule), with some remnants of its immediateprogenitors, Pragmatism and Logical Positivism, still clinging to its bandwagon.The more “broadminded” departments include an opposition—the other side of thesame Kantian coin, Existentialism. (One side claims that philosophy is grammar,the other that philosophy is feelings.)Psychology departments have a sprinkling of Freudians, but are dominated byBehaviorism, whose leader is B. F. Skinner. (Here the controversy is between theclaim that man is moved by innate ideas, and the claim that he has no ideas atall.)Economics departments are dominated by Marxism, which is taken straight or onthe rocks, in the form of Keynesianism.What the political science departments and the business administration schoolsare dominated by is best illustrated by the following example: in adistinguished Ivy League university, a dean of the School of Business recentlysuggested that it be renamed “School of Management,” explaining thatprofit-making is unpopular with students and that most of them want to work fornon-profit institutions, such as government or charities.Sociology departments are dominated by the fact that no one has ever definedwhat sociology is.English departments are dominated by The New York Times Book Review.I do not know the state of the various departments in the physical sciences, butwe have seen an indication of it: the “scientific” writings of the ecologists.As a result of today’s educational policies, the majority of college graduatesare virtually illiterate, in the literal and the wider sense of the word. Theydo not necessarily accept their teachers’ views, but they do not know that anyother views exist or have ever existed. There are philosophy majors who graduatewithout having taken a single course on Aristotle (except as part of generalsurveys). There are economics majors who have no idea of what capitalism is orwas, theoretically or historically, and not the faintest notion of the mechanismof a free market. There are literature majors who have never heard of VictorHugo (but have acquired a full vocabulary of four-letter words).So long as there were variations among university departments in the choice oftheir dominant prejudices—and so long as there were some distinguished survivorsof an earlier, freer view of education—non-conformists had some chance. But withthe spread of “unpolarized” unity and Federal “encouragement”—the spread of thesame gray, heavy-footed, deaf-dumb-and-blind, hysterically stagnant dogma—thatchance is vanishing. It is becoming increasingly harder for an independent mindto get or keep a job on a university faculty—or for the independent mind of astudent to remain independent.This is the logical result of generations of post-Kantian statist philosophy andof the vicious circle which it set up: as philosophy degenerates intoirrationalism, it promotes the growth of government power, which, in turn,promotes the degeneration of philosophy.It is a paradox of our age of skepticism—with its proliferations of bromides tothe effect that “Man can be certain of nothing,” “Reality is unknowable,” “Thereare no hard facts or hard knowledge—everything is soft [except the point of agun]”—that the overbearing dogmatism of university departments would make amedieval enforcer of religious dogma squirm with envy. It is a paradox but not acontradiction, because it is the necessary consequence—and purpose—ofskepticism, which disarms its opponents by declaring: “How can you be sure?” andthus enables its leaders to propound absolutes at whim.It is this kind of intellectual atmosphere and these types of cynical, bigoted,envy-ridden, decadent cliques that the Federal Government now proposes tosupport with public funds, and with the piously reiterated assurance that theprofiteering institutions will retain their full freedom to teach whatever theyplease, that there will be “no strings attached.”Well, there is one string which all the opponents of the intellectual status quonow have the right to expect and demand: the fairness doctrine.If the public allegedly owns universities, as it allegedly owns the airwaves,then for all the same reasons no specific ideology can be permitted to hold amonopoly in any department of any public or semi-public university. In all suchinstitutions, every “significant viewpoint” must be given representation. (By“ideology,” in this context, I mean a system of ideas derived from a theoreticalbase or frame of reference.)The same considerations that led to the fairness doctrine in broadcasting, applyto educational institutions, only more crucially, more urgently, moredesperately so, because much more is involved than some ephemeral electronicsounds or images, because the mind of the young and the future of humanknowledge are at stake.Would this doctrine work in regard to universities? It would work as well—and asbadly—as it has worked in broadcasting. It would work not as a motor of freedom,but as a brake on total regimentation. It would not achieve actual fairness,impartiality or objectivity. But it would act as a temporary impediment tointellectual monopolies, a retarder of the Establishment’s takeover, a breach inthe mental lethargy of the status quo, and, occasionally, an opening for abrilliant dissenter who would know how to make it count.Remember that dissenters, in today’s academic world, are not the advocates ofmysticism-altruism-collectivism, who are the dominant cliques, therepresentatives of the entrenched status quo. The dissenters are the advocatesof reason-individualism—capitalism. (If there are universities somewhere thatbar the teaching of overtly vicious theories, such as communism, the advocatesof these theories would be entitled to the protection of the fairness doctrine,so long as the university received government funds—because there are tax-payingcitizens who are communists. The protection would apply to the right to teachideas—not to criminal actions, such as campus riots or any form of physicalviolence.)Since the fairness doctrine cannot be defined objectively, its application tospecific cases would depend in large part on subjective interpretations, whichwould often be arbitrary and, at best, approximate. But there is no suchapproximation in the universities of Soviet Russia, as there was not in theuniversities of Nazi Germany. The purpose of the approximation is to preserve,to keep alive in men’s minds, the principle of intellectual freedom—until thetime when it can be implemented fully once more, in free, i.e., private,universities.The main function of the fairness doctrine would be a switch of the burden offear, from the victim to the entrenched gang—and a switch of moral right, fromthe entrenched gang to the victim. A dissenter would not have to be in theposition of a martyr facing the power of a vast Establishment with all theinter-lockings of unknowable cliques, with the mysterious lines of secret pullleading to omnipotent governmental authorities. He would have the protection ofa recognized right. On the other hand, the Establishment’s hatchet men wouldhave to be cautious, knowing that there is a limitation (at least, in principle)on the irresponsible power granted by the use of public funds “with no stringsattached.”But the fight for the fairness doctrine would require intellectual clarity,objectivity, and good, i.e., contextual, judgment—because the elements toconsider are extremely complex. For instance, the concept of “equal time” wouldnot be entirely relevant: an hour in the class of an able professor can undo theharm done by a semester in the classes of the incompetent ones. And it would beimpossible to burden the students with courses on every viewpoint in everysubject.There is no precise way to determine which professors’ viewpoints are theappropriate opposites of which—particularly in the midst of today’s prevalenteclecticism. The policy of lip service to impartiality and of window dressing ispracticed in many schools; and the eclecticism in some of the smaller collegesis such that no specific viewpoint can be discerned at all. It is the cases ofextremes, of ideological unity on the faculty and monopolistic monotony inteaching—particularly in the leading universities (which set the trends for allthe rest)—that require protest by an informed public opinion, by the dissentingfaculty members, and by the main victims: the students.Intellectual diversity and ideological opposites can be determined only in termsof essentials—but it is an essential of modern philosophy to deny the existenceor validity of essentials (which are called “oversimpli-fication”). The resultis that some advocates of a guaranteed minimum income are regarded as defendersof capitalism, advocates of theories of innate ideas are regarded as championsof reason, the tribal conformity of hippies is regarded as an expression ofindividualism, etc. And most college students have lost or never developed theability to think in terms of essentials.But—as in the case of political election campaigns, in which essentials areevaded more stringently than in modern universities—everyone knows implicitlywhich side he is for or against, though no public voices care to identify theissues explicitly. The consistency of such politicians’ or professors’ followersis remarkable for men who claim man’s inability to distinguish essentials.(Which is one clue to the motives of the advocates of the “non-simplified,”i.e., concrete-bound, approach.)The ability explicitly to identify the essentials of any subject he studies, isthe first requirement of a student who would want to fight for the fairnessdoctrine. Then, if he sees that he is offered only one viewpoint on a givenfundamental issue—and knows that other “significant” viewpoints exist—he canprotest, on the grounds of his right to know and to make an informed choice.“Significance,” in this context, should be gauged by one of two standards: thedegree of historical influence achieved by a given theory or, if the theory iscontemporary, its value in providing original answers to fundamental questions.As in the case of broadcasting, it would be impossible to present everyindividual’s viewpoint. But if the great historical schools of thought werepresented, the fairness doctrine would achieve its purpose (or perform its“trustbusting” function, if you will): the breakup of that one-sidedindoctrination which is the hallmark of government-controlled schools.In all fields that the government enters (outside of its proper sphere), twomotives—one vicious, the other virtuous—produce the same results. In the case ofschools, the vicious motive is power-lust, which prompts a teacher or aneducational bureaucrat to indoctrinate students with a single viewpoint (of thekind that disarms them mentally, stunts their critical faculty, and conditionsthem to the passive acceptance of memorized dogma). The virtuous motive is ateacher’s integrity: a man of integrity has firm convictions about what heregards as true; he teaches according to his convictions, and he does notpropagate or support the theories which he regards as false (though he is ableto present them objectively, when necessary). Such a teacher would be invaluablein a private university; but in a government-controlled school, his monopolisticposition makes him as tyrannical an indoctrinator as the power-luster. (Thesolution is not what the opponents of any firm convictions suggest: that thehonest teacher turn into a flexible pragmatist who’ll switch his ideas frommoment to moment, or into a skeptical pig who’ll eat anything.) The consequencesof any attempt to rule or to support intellectual activities by means of forcewill be evil, regardless of motives. (This does not mean that dissent isessential to intellectual freedom: the possibility of dissent, is.)Who would enforce the fairness doctrine in education? Not the executive branchof the government, which is the distributor of the funds and has a vestedinterest in uniformity, i.e., conformity. The doctrine has to be invoked andupheld by private individuals and groups. This is another opportunity for thosewho wish to take practical action against the growth of statism. This issuecould become the goal of an ad hoc movement, uniting all men of good will,appealing (in the name of intellectual justice) to whatever element ofnineteenth-century liberalism still exists in the minds of academic liberals—asdistinguished from the Marcuseans, who openly propose to drive all dissentersoff the university faculties. (Is the Marcuseans’ goal to be achieved at publicexpense and with government support?)If a fairness movement enlisted the talents of some intelligent young lawyers,it could conceivably find support in the courts of law, which are still supposedto protect an individual’s civil rights. The legal precedent for a fairnessdoctrine is to be found in the field of broadcasting. The practicalimplementation, i.e., the challenge to the Establishment in specific cases, isup to the voluntary effort, the dedication, and the persuasiveness ofindividuals.It must be remembered firmly that a fairness doctrine is not a string on theuniversities’ freedom, but a string on the government’s power to distributepublic funds. That power has already demonstrated its potential forfantastically evil and blatantly unconstitutional control over the universities.Under threat of withholding government funds and contracts, the Department ofHealth, Education and Welfare is now imposing racial and sexual quotas onuniversity faculties, demanding that some unspecified number of teachers consistof ethnic minority-members and women. To add insult to injury, HEW insists thatthis is not a demand for quotas, nor a demand to place racial considerationsabove merit, but a demand for “proof” that a university (e.g., Columbia) hasmade an effort “to find” teachers of equal merit among those groups. Try andprove it. Try and prove that you have “searched.” Try to measure and prove thevarious applicants’ merit—when no precise, objective standards of comparison aregiven or known. The result is that almost any female or minority-member is givenpreference over anyone else. The consequence is a growing anxiety about theirfuture among young teachers who are male and do not belong to an ethnicminority: they are now the victims of the most obscenely viciousdiscrimination—obscene, because perpetrated in the name of fightingdiscrimination.If the rights of various physiological minorities are so loudly claimed today,what about the rights of intellectual minorities?I have said that the fairness doctrine is a product of the mixed economy. Thewhole precarious structure of a mixed economy, in its transition from freedom tototalitarian statism, rests on the power of pressure groups. But pressure-groupwarfare is a game that two (or more) ideological sides can play as well as one.The disadvantage of the statists is the fact that up to the last minute (andeven beyond it) they have to play under cover of the slogans of individualrights and freedom. The advocates of freedom can beat them at their own game—bytaking them at their word, but playing it straight. The time is right for it.The Establishment is not very popular at present, neither politically norintellectually, neither with the country at large nor with many of its ownmembers. A movement of the serious students and of the better teachers,defending the rights of intellectual minorities and demanding a fairnessdoctrine for education, would have a good chance to grow and succeed. But takingpart in such a movement would be much more difficult and demanding (andrewarding) than chanting slogans and dancing ring-around-a-rosy on some campuslawn.If student minorities have succeeded in demanding that they be given courses onsuch subjects as Zen Buddhism, guerrilla warfare, Swahili, and astrology, thenan intellectual student minority can succeed in demanding courses on, forinstance, Aristotle in philosophy, von Mises in economics, Montessori ineducation, Hugo in literature. At the very least, such courses would save thestudents’ mind; potentially, they would save the culture.No, the fairness doctrine would not reform the universities’ faculties andadministrations. There would be a great deal of hypocrisy, of compromising, ofcheating, of hiring weak advocates to teach the unfashionable theories, of“tokenism,” of window dressing.But think of what one window can do for a sealed, airless, lightless room."},{"pageContent":"17What Can One Do?1972 This question is frequently asked by people who are concerned about the state oftoday’s world and want to correct it. More often than not, it is asked in a formthat indicates the cause of their helplessness: “What can one person do?”I was in the process of preparing this article when I received a letter from areader who presents the problem (and the error) still more eloquently: “How canan individual propagate your philosophy on a scale large enough to effect theimmense changes which must be made in every walk of American life in order tocreate the kind of ideal country which you picture?”If this is the way the question is posed, the answer is: he can’t. No one canchange a country single-handed. So the first question to ask is: why do peopleapproach the problem this way?Suppose you were a doctor in the midst of an epidemic. You would not ask: “Howcan one doctor treat millions of patients and restore the whole country toperfect health?” You would know, whether you were alone or part of an organizedmedical campaign, that you have to treat as many people as you can reach,according to the best of your ability, and that nothing else is possible.It is a remnant of mystic philosophy—specifically, of the mind-body split—thatmakes people approach intellectual issues in a manner they would not use to dealwith physical problems. They would not seek to stop an epidemic overnight, or tobuild a skyscraper single-handed. Nor would they refrain from renovating theirown crumbling house, on the grounds that they are unable to rebuild the entirecity. But in the realm of man’s consciousness, the realm of ideas, they stilltend to regard knowledge as irrelevant, and they expect to perform instantaneousmiracles, somehow—or they paralyze themselves by projecting an impossible goal.(The reader whose letter I quoted was doing the right things, but felt that somewider scale of action was required. Many others merely ask the question, but donothing.)If you are seriously interested in fighting for a better world, begin byidentifying the nature of the problem. The battle is primarily intellectual(philosophical), not political. Politics is the last consequence, the practicalimplementation, of the fundamental (metaphysical-epistemological-ethical) ideasthat dominate a given nation’s culture. You cannot fight or change theconsequences without fighting and changing the cause; nor can you attempt anypractical implementation without knowing what you want to implement.In an intellectual battle, you do not need to convert everyone. History is madeby minorities—or, more precisely, history is made by intellectual movements,which are created by minorities. Who belongs to these minorities? Anyone who isable and willing actively to concern himself with intellectual issues. Here, itis not quantity, but quality, that counts (the quality—and consistency—of theideas one is advocating).An intellectual movement does not start with organized action. Whom would oneorganize? A philosophical battle is a battle for men’s minds, not an attempt toenlist blind followers. Ideas can be propagated only by men who understand them.An organized movement has to be preceded by an educational campaign, whichrequires trained—self-trained—teachers (self-trained in the sense that aphilosopher can offer you the material of knowledge, but it is your own mindthat has to absorb it). Such training is the first requirement for being adoctor during an ideological epidemic—and the precondition of any attempt to“change the world.”“The immense changes which must be made in every walk of American life” cannotbe made singly, piecemeal or “retail,” so to speak; an army of crusaders wouldnot be enough to do it. But the factor that underlies and determines everyaspect of human life is philosophy; teach men the right philosophy—and their ownminds will do the rest. Philosophy is the wholesaler in human affairs.Man cannot exist without some form of philosophy, i.e., some comprehensive viewof life. Most men are not intellectual innovators, but they are receptive toideas, are able to judge them critically and to choose the right course, whenand if it is offered. There are also a great many men who are indifferent toideas and to anything beyond the concrete-bound range of the immediate moment;such men accept subconsciously whatever is offered by the culture of their time,and swing blindly with any chance current. They are merely social ballast—bethey day laborers or company presidents—and, by their own choice, irrelevant tothe fate of the world.Today, most people are acutely aware of our cultural-ideological vacuum; theyare anxious, confused, and groping for answers. Are you able to enlighten them?Can you answer their questions? Can you offer them a consistent case? Do youknow how to correct their errors? Are you immune from the fallout of theconstant barrage aimed at the destruction of reason—and can you provide otherswith antimissile missiles? A political battle is merely a skirmish fought withmuskets; a philosophical battle is a nuclear war.If you want to influence a country’s intellectual trend, the first step is tobring order to your own ideas and integrate them into a consistent case, to thebest of your knowledge and ability. This does not mean memorizing and recitingslogans and principles, Objectivist or otherwise: knowledge necessarily includesthe ability to apply abstract principles to concrete problems, to recognize theprinciples in specific issues, to demonstrate them, and to advocate a consistentcourse of action. This does not require omniscience or omnipotence; it is thesubconscious expectation of automatic omniscience in oneself and in others thatdefeats many would-be crusaders (and serves as an excuse for doing nothing).What is required is honesty—intellectual honesty, which consists in knowing whatone does know, constantly expanding one’s knowledge, and never evading orfailing to correct a contradiction. This means: the development of an activemind as a permanent attribute.When or if your convictions are in your conscious, orderly control, you will beable to communicate them to others. This does not mean that you must makephilosophical speeches when unnecessary and inappropriate. You need philosophyto back you up and give you a consistent case when you deal with or discussspecific issues.If you like condensations (provided you bear in mind their full meaning), I willsay: when you ask “What can one do?”—the answer is “SPEAK” (provided you knowwhat you are saying).A few suggestions: do not wait for a national audience. Speak on any scale opento you, large or small—to your friends, your associates, your professionalorganizations, or any legitimate public forum. You can never tell when yourwords will reach the right mind at the right time. You will see no immediateresults—but it is of such activities that public opinion is made.Do not pass up a chance to express your views on important issues. Write lettersto the editors of newspapers and magazines, to TV and radio commentators and,above all, to your Congressman (who depend on their constituents). If yourletters are brief and rational (rather than incoherently emotional), they willhave more influence than you suspect.The opportunities to speak are all around you. I suggest that you make thefollowing experiment: take an ideological “inventory” of one week, i.e., notehow many times people utter the wrong political, social and moral notions as ifthese were self-evident truths, with your silent sanction. Then make it a habitto object to such remarks—no, not to make lengthy speeches, which are seldomappropriate, but merely to say: “I don’t agree.” (And be prepared to explainwhy, if the speaker wants to know.) This is one of the best ways to stop thespread of vicious bromides. (If the speaker is innocent, it will help him; if heis not, it will undercut his confidence the next time.) Most particularly, donot keep silent when your own ideas and values are being attacked.Do not “proselytize” indiscriminately, i.e., do not force discussions orarguments on those who are not interested or not willing to argue. It is notyour job to save everyone’s soul. If you do the things that are in your power,you will not feel guilty about not doing—“somehow”—the things that are not.Above all, do not join the wrong ideological groups or movements, in order to“do something.” By “ideological” (in this context), I mean groups or movementsproclaiming some vaguely generalized, undefined (and, usually, contradictory)political goals. (E.g., the Conservative Party, which subordinates reason tofaith, and substitutes theocracy for capitalism; or the “libertarian” hippies,who subordinate reason to whims, and substitute anarchism for capitalism.) Tojoin such groups means to reverse the philosophical hierarchy and to sell outfundamental principles for the sake of some superficial political action whichis bound to fail. It means that you help the defeat of your ideas and thevictory of your enemies. (For a discussion of the reasons, see “The Anatomy ofCompromise” in my book Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.)The only groups one may properly join today are ad hoc committees, i.e., groupsorganized to achieve a single, specific, clearly defined goal, on which men ofdiffering views can agree. In such cases, no one may attempt to ascribe hisviews to the entire membership, or to use the group to serve some hiddenideological purpose (and this has to be watched very, very vigilantly).I am omitting the most important contribution to an intellectualmovement—writing—because this discussion is addressed to men of everyprofession. Books, essays, articles are a movement’s permanent fuel, but it isworse than futile to attempt to become a writer solely for the sake of a“cause.” Writing, like any other work, is a profession and must be approached assuch.It is a mistake to think that an intellectual movement requires some specialduty or self-sacrificial effort on your part. It requires something much moredifficult: a profound conviction that ideas are important to you and to your ownlife. If you integrate that conviction to every aspect of your life, you willfind many opportunities to enlighten others.The reader whose letter I quoted, indicates the proper pattern of action: “As ateacher of astronomy, for several years, I have been actively engaged indemonstrating the power of reason and the absolutism of reality to my students .. . I have also made an effort to introduce your works to my associates,following their reading with discussion when possible; and have made it a pointto insist on the use of reason in all of my personal dealings.”These are some of the right things to do, as often and as widely as possible.But that reader’s question implied a search for some shortcut in the form of anorganized movement. No shortcut is possible.It is too late for a movement of people who hold a conventional mixture ofcontradictory philosophical notions. It is too early for a movement of peoplededicated to a philosophy of reason. But it is never too late or too early topropagate the right ideas—except under a dictatorship.If a dictatorship ever comes to this country, it will be by the default of thosewho keep silent. We are still free enough to speak. Do we have time? No one cantell. But time is on our side—because we have an indestructible weapon and aninvincible ally (if we learn how to use them): reason and reality."},{"pageContent":"18Don’t Let It Go1971 In order to form a hypothesis about the future of an individual, one mustconsider three elements: his present course of action, his consciousconvictions, and his sense of life. The same elements must be considered informing a hypothesis about the future of a nation.A sense of life is a pre-conceptual equivalent of metaphysics, an emotional,subconsciously integrated appraisal of man and of existence. It represents anindividual’s unidentified philosophy (which can be identified—and corrected, ifnecessary); it affects his choice of values and his emotional responses,influences his actions, and, frequently, clashes with his conscious convictions.(For a detailed discussion, see “Philosophy and Sense of Life” in my book TheRomantic Manifesto.)A nation, like an individual, has a sense of life, which is expressed not in itsformal culture, but in its “life style”—in the kinds of actions and attitudeswhich people take for granted and believe to be self-evident, but which areproduced by complex evaluations involving a fundamental view of man’s nature.A “nation” is not a mystic or supernatural entity: it is a large number ofindividuals who live in the same geographical locality under the same politicalsystem. A nation’s culture is the sum of the intellectual achievements ofindividual men, which their fellow-citizens have accepted in whole or in part,and which have influenced the nation’s way of life. Since a culture is a complexbattleground of different ideas and influences, to speak of a “culture” is tospeak only of the dominant ideas, always allowing for the existence ofdissenters and exceptions.(The dominance of certain ideas is not necessarily determined by the number oftheir adherents: it may be determined by majority acceptance, or by the greateractivity and persistence of a given faction, or by default, i.e., the failure ofthe opposition, or—when a country is free—by a combination of persistence andtruth. In any case, ideas and the resultant culture are the product and activeconcern of a minority. Who constitutes this minority? Whoever chooses to beconcerned.)Similarly, the concept of a nation’s sense of life does not mean that everymember of a given nation shares it, but only that a dominant majority shares itsessentials in various degrees. In this matter, however, the dominance isnumerical: while most men may be indifferent to cultural-ideological trends, noman can escape the process of subconscious integration which forms his sense oflife.A nation’s sense of life is formed by every individual child’s early impressionsof the world around him: of the ideas he is taught (which he may or may notaccept) and of the way of acting he observes and evaluates (which he mayevaluate correctly or not). And although there are exceptions at both ends ofthe psychological spectrum—men whose sense of life is better (truerphilosophically) or worse than that of their fellow-citizens—the majoritydevelop the essentials of the same subconscious philosophy. This is the sourceof what we observe as “national characteristics.”A nation’s political trends are the equivalent of a man’s course of action andare determined by its culture. A nation’s culture is the equivalent of a man’sconscious convictions. Just as an individual’s sense of life can clash with hisconscious convictions, hampering or defeating his actions, so a nation’s senseof life can clash with its culture, hampering or defeating its political course.Just as an individual’s sense of life can be better or worse than his consciousconvictions, so can a nation’s. And just as an individual who has nevertranslated his sense of life into conscious convictions is in terrible danger—nomatter how good his subconscious values—so is a nation.This is the position of America today.If America is to be saved from destruction—specifically, from dictatorship—shewill be saved by her sense of life.As to the two other elements that determine a nation’s future, one (ourpolitical trend) is speeding straight to disaster, the other (culture) isvirtually nonexistent. The political trend is pure statism and is moving towarda totalitarian dictatorship at a speed which, in any other country, would havereached that goal long ago. The culture is worse than nonexistent: it isoperating below zero, i.e., performing the opposite of its function. A cultureprovides a nation’s intellectual leadership, its ideas, its education, its moralcode. Today, the concerted effort of our cultural “Establishment” is directed atthe obliteration of man’s rational faculty. Hysterical voices are proclaimingthe impotence of reason, extolling the “superior power” of irrationality,fostering the rule of incoherent emotions, attacking science, glorifying thestupor of drugged hippies, delivering apologies for the use of brute force,urging mankind’s return to a life of rolling in primeval muck, with grunts andgroans as means of communication, physical sensations as means of inspiration,and a club as means of argumentation.This country, with its magnificent scientific and technological power, is leftin the vacuum of a pre-intellectual era, like the wandering hordes of the DarkAges—or in the position of an adolescent before he has fully learned toconceptualize. But an adolescent has his sense of life to guide his choices. Sohas this country.What is the specifically American sense of life?A sense of life is so complex an integration that the best way to identify it isby means of concrete examples and by contrast with the manifestations of adifferent sense of life.The emotional keynote of most Europeans is the feeling that man belongs to theState, as a property to be used and disposed of, in compliance with his natural,metaphysically determined fate. A typical European may disapprove of a givenState and may rebel, seeking to establish what he regards as a better one, likea slave who might seek a better master to serve—but the idea that he is thesovereign and the government is his servant, has no emotional reality in hisconsciousness. He regards service to the State as an ultimate moral sanction, asan honor, and if you told him that his life is an end in itself, he would feelinsulted or rejected or lost. Generations brought up on statist philosophy andacting accordingly, have implanted this in his mind from the earliest, formativeyears of his childhood.A typical American can never fully grasp that kind of feeling. An American is anindependent entity. The popular expression of protest against “being pushedaround” is emotionally unintelligible to Europeans, who believe that to bepushed around is their natural condition. Emotionally, an American has noconcept of service (or of servitude) to anyone. Even if he enlists in the armyand hears it called “service to his country,” his feeling is that of a generousaristocrat who chose to do a dangerous task. A European soldier feels that he isdoing his duty.“Isn’t my money as good as the next fellow’s?” used to be a popular Americanexpression. It would not be popular in Europe: a fortune, to be good, must beold and derived by special favor from the State; to a European, money earned bypersonal effort is vulgar, crude or somehow disreputable.Americans admire achievement; they know what it takes. Europeans regardachievement with cynical suspicion and envy. Envy is not a widespread emotion inAmerica (not yet); it is an overwhelmingly dominant emotion in Europe.When Americans feel respect for their public figures, it is the respect ofequals; they feel that a government official is a human being, just as they are,who has chosen this particular line of work and has earned a certaindistinction. They call celebrities by their first names, they refer toPresidents by their initials (like “F.D.R.” or “J.F.K.”), not in insolence oregalitarian pretentiousness, but in token of affection. The custom of addressinga person as “Herr Doktor Doktor Schmidt” would be impossible in America. InEngland, the freest country of Europe, the achievement of a scientist, abusinessman or a movie star is not regarded as fully real until he has beenclunked on the head with the State’s sword and declared to be a knight.There are practical consequences of these two different attitudes.An American economist told me the following story. He was sent to England by anAmerican industrial concern, to investigate its European branch: in spite of thelatest equipment and techniques, the productivity of the branch in England keptlagging far behind that of the parent-factory in the U.S. He found the cause: arigidly circumscribed mentality, a kind of psychological caste system, on allthe echelons of British labor and management. As he explained it: in America, ifa machine breaks down, a worker volunteers to fix it, and usually does; inEngland, work stops and people wait for the appropriate department to summon theappropriate engineer. It is not a matter of laziness, but of a profoundlyingrained feeling that one must keep one’s place, do one’s prescribed duty, andnever venture beyond it. It does not occur to the British worker that he is freeto assume responsibility for anything beyond the limits of his particular job.Initiative is an “instinctive” (i.e., automatized) American characteristic; inan American consciousness, it occupies the place which, in a European one, isoccupied by obedience.As to the differences in the social atmosphere, here is an example. An elderlyEuropean woman, a research biochemist from Switzerland, on a visit to New York,told me that she wanted to buy some things at the five-and-ten. Since she couldbarely speak English, I offered to go with her; she hesitated, lookingastonished and disturbed, then asked: “But wouldn’t that embarrass you?” Icouldn’t understand what she meant: “Embarrass—how?” “Well,” she explained, “youare a famous person, and what if somebody sees you in the five-and-ten?” Ilaughed. She explained to me that in Switzerland, by unwritten law, there aredifferent stores for different classes of people, and that she, as aprofessional, has to shop in certain stores, even though her salary is modest,that better goods at lower prices are available in the workingmen’s stores, butshe would lose social status if she were seen shopping there. Can you conceiveof living in an atmosphere of that kind? (We did go to the five-and-ten.)A European, on any social level, lives emotionally in a world made by others (henever knows clearly by whom), and seeks or accepts his place in it. The Americanattitude is best expressed by a line from a poem: “The world began when I wasborn and the world is mine to win.” (“The Westerner” by Badger Clark.)Years ago, at a party in Hollywood, I met Eve Curie, a distinguishedFrenchwoman, the daughter of Marie Curie. Eve Curie was a best-selling author ofnon-fiction books and, politically, a liberal; at the time, she was on a lecturetour of the United States. She stressed her astonishment at American audiences.“They are so happy,” she kept repeating, “so happy. . . .” She was saying itwithout disapproval and without admiration, with only the faintest touch ofamusement; but her astonishment was genuine. “People are not like that inEurope. . . . Everybody is happy in America—except the intellectuals. Oh, theintellectuals are unhappy everywhere.”This incident has remained in my mind because she had named, unwittingly, thenature of the breach between the American people and the intellectuals. Theculture of a worn, crumbling Europe—with its mysticism, its lethargicresignation, its cult of suffering, its notion that misery and impotence areman’s fate on earth, and that unhappiness is the hallmark of a sensitivespirit—of what use could it be to a country like America?It was a European who discovered America, but it was Americans who were thefirst nation to discover this earth and man’s proper place in it, and man’spotential for happiness, and the world which is man’s to win. What they failedto discover is the words to name their achievement, the concepts to identify it,the principles to guide it, i.e., the appropriate philosophy and itsconsequence: an American culture.America has never had an original culture, i.e., a body of ideas derived fromher philosophical (Aristotelian) base and expressing her profound differencefrom all other countries in history.American intellectuals were Europe’s passive dependents and poor relativesalmost from the beginning. They lived on Europe’s drying crumbs and discardedfashions, including even such hand-me-downs as Freud and Wittgenstein. America’ssole contribution to philosophy—Pragmatism—was a bad recycling ofKantian-Hegelian premises.America’s best minds went into science, technology, industry—and reachedincomparable heights of achievement. Why did they neglect the field of ideas?Because it represented Augean stables of a kind no joyously active man wouldcare to enter. America’s childhood coincided with the rise of Kant’s influencein European philosophy and the consequent disintegration of European culture.America was in the position of an eager, precocious child left in the care of ascruffy, senile, decadent guardian. The child had good reason to play hooky.An adolescent can ride on his sense of life for a while. But by the time hegrows up, he must translate it into conceptual knowledge and consciousconvictions, or he will be in deep trouble. A sense of life is not a substitutefor explicit knowledge. Values which one cannot identify, but merely sensesimplicitly, are not in one’s control. One cannot tell what they depend on orrequire, what course of action is needed to gain and/or keep them. One can loseor betray them without knowing it. For close to a century, this has beenAmerica’s tragic predicament. Today, the American people is like a sleepwalkinggiant torn by profound conflicts. (When I speak of “the American people,” inthis context, I mean every group, including scientists and businessmen—exceptthe intellectuals, i.e., those whose professions deal with the humanities. Theintellectuals are a country’s guardians.)Americans are the most reality-oriented people on earth. Their outstandingcharacteristic is the childhood form of reasoning: common sense. It is theironly protection. But common sense is not enough where theoretical knowledge isrequired: it can make simple, concrete-bound connections—it cannot integratecomplex issues, or deal with wide abstractions, or forecast the future.For example, consider the statist trend in this country. The doctrine ofcollectivism has never been submitted explicitly to the American voters; if ithad been, it would have sustained a landslide defeat (as the various socialistparties have demonstrated). But the welfare state was put over on Americanspiecemeal, by degrees, under cover of some undefined “Americanism”—culminatingin the absurdity of a President’s declaration that America owes its greatness to“the willingness for self-sacrifice.” People sense that something has gonewrong; they cannot grasp what or when. This is the penalty they pay forremaining a silent (and deaf) majority.Americans are anti-intellectual (with good grounds, in view of currentspecimens), yet they have a profound respect for knowledge and education (whichis being shaken now). They are self-confident, trusting, generous, enormouslybenevolent and innocent. “. . . that celebrated American ‘innocence’ [is] aquality which in philosophical terms is simply an ignorance of how questionablea being man really is and which strikes the European as alien . . .” declares anexistentialist (William Barrett, Irrational Man). The word “questionable” is aeuphemism for miserable, guilty, impotent, groveling, evil—which is the Europeanview of man. Europeans do believe in Original Sin, i.e., in man’s innatedepravity; Americans do not. Americans see man as a value—as clean, free,creative, rational. But the American view of man has not been expressed orupheld in philosophical terms (not since the time of our first Founding Father,Aristotle; see his description of the “magnanimous man”).Barrett continues: “Sartre recounts a conversation he had with an American whilevisiting in this country. The American insisted that all international problemscould be solved if men would just get together and be rational; Sartre disagreedand after a while discussion between them became impossible. ‘I believe in theexistence of evil,’ says Sartre, ‘and he does not.’ ” This, again, is aeuphemism: it is not merely the existence but the power of evil that Europeansbelieve in. Americans do not believe in the power of evil and do not understandits nature. The first part of their attitude is (philosophically) true, but thesecond makes them vulnerable. On the day when Americans grasp the cause ofevil’s impotence—its mindless, fear-ridden, envy-eaten smallness—they will befree of all the man-hating manipulators of history, foreign and domestic.So far, America’s protection has been a factor best expressed by a sayingattributed to con men: “You can’t cheat an honest man.” The innocence and commonsense of the American people have wrecked the plans, the devious notions, thetricky strategies, the ideological traps borrowed by the intellectuals from theEuropean statists, who devised them to fool and rule Europe’s impotent masses.There have never been any “masses” in America: the poorest American is anindividual and, subconsciously, an individualist. Marxism, which has conqueredour universities, is a dismal failure as far as the people are concerned:Americans cannot be sold on any sort of class war; American workers do not seethemselves as a “proletariat,” but are among the proudest of property owners. Itis professors and businessmen who advocate cooperation with SovietRussia—American labor unions do not.The enormous propaganda effort to make Americans fear fascism but not communism,has failed: Americans hate them both. The terrible hoax of the United Nationshas failed. Americans were never enthusiastic about that institution, but theygave it the benefit of the doubt for too long. The current polls, however,indicate that the majority have turned against the U.N. (better late thannever).The latest assault on human life—the ecology crusade—will probably end in defeatfor its ideological leadership: Americans will enthusiastically clean theirstreets, their rivers, their backyards, but when it comes to giving up progress,technology, the automobile, and their standard of living, Americans will provethat the man-haters “ain’t seen nothing yet.”The sense-of-life emotion which, in Europe, makes people uncertain, malleableand easy to rule, is unknown in America: fundamental guilt. No one, so far, hasbeen able to infect America with that contemptible feeling (and I doubt thatanyone ever will). Americans cannot begin to grasp the kind of corruptionimplied and demanded by that feeling.But an honest man can cheat himself. His trusting innocence can lead him toswallow sugar-coated poisons—the deadliest of which is altruism. Americansaccept it—not for what it is, not as a vicious doctrine of self-immolation—butin the spirit of a strong, confident man’s overgenerous desire to relieve thesuffering of others, whose character he does not understand. When such a manawakens to the betrayal of his trust—to the fact that his generosity has broughthim within reach of a permanent harness which is about to be slipped on him byhis sundry beneficiaries—the consequences are unpredictable.There are two ways of destroying a country: dictatorship or chaos, i.e.,immediate rigor mortis or the longer agony of the collapse of all civilizedinstitutions and the breakup of a nation into roving armed gangs fighting andlooting one another, until some one Attila conquers the rest. This means: chaosas a prelude to tyranny—as was the case in Western Europe in the Dark Ages, orin the three hundred years preceding the Romanoff dynasty in Russia, or underthe war lords regime in China.A European is disarmed in the face of a dictatorship: he may hate it, but hefeels that he is wrong and, metaphysically, the State is right. An Americanwould rebel to the bottom of his soul. But this is all that his sense of lifecan do for him: it cannot solve his problems.Only one thing is certain: a dictatorship cannot take hold in America today.This country, as yet, cannot be ruled—but it can explode. It can blow up intothe helpless rage and blind violence of a civil war. It cannot be cowed intosubmission, passivity, malevolence, resignation. It cannot be “pushed around.”Defiance, not obedience, is the American’s answer to overbearing authority. Thenation that ran an underground railroad to help human beings escape fromslavery, or began drinking on principle in the face of Prohibition, will not say“Yes, sir,” to the enforcers of ration coupons and cereal prices. Not yet.If America drags on in her present state for a few more generations (which isunlikely), dictatorship will become possible. A sense of life is not a permanentendowment. The characteristically American one is being eroded daily all aroundus. Large numbers of Americans have lost it (or have never developed it) and arecollapsing to the psychological level of Europe’s worst rabble.This is prevalent among the two groups that are the main supporters of thestatist trend: the very rich and the very poor—the first, because they want torule; the second, because they want to be ruled. (The leaders of the trend arethe intellectuals, who want to do both.) But this country has never had anunearned, hereditary “elite.” America is still the country of self-made men,which means: the country of the middle class—the most productive and exploitedgroup in any modern society.The academia-jet set coalition is attempting to tame the American character bythe deliberate breeding of helplessness and resignation—in those incubators oflethargy known as “Progressive” schools, which are dedicated to the task ofcrippling a child’s mind by arresting his cognitive development. (See “TheComprachicos” in my book The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution.) Itappears, however, that the “progressive” rich will be the first victims of theirown social theories: it is the children of the well-to-do who emerge fromexpensive nursery schools and colleges as hippies, and destroy the remnants oftheir paralyzed brains by means of drugs.The middle class has created an antidote which is perhaps the most helpfulmovement of recent years: the spontaneous, unorganized, grass-roots revival ofthe Montessori system of education—a system aimed at the development of achild’s cognitive, i.e., rational, faculty. But that is a long-range prospect.At present, even so dismal a figure as President Nixon is a hopefulsign—precisely because he is so dismal. If any other country were in asdesperately precarious a state of confusion as ours, a dozen flamboyant Führerswould have sprung up overnight to take it over. It is to America’s credit thatno such Führer has appeared, and if any did, it is doubtful that he would have achance.Can this country achieve a peaceful rebirth in the foreseeable future? By allprecedents, it is not likely. But America is an unprecedented phenomenon. In thepast, American perseverance became, on occasion, too long-bearing a patience.But when Americans turned, they turned. What may happen to the welfare state iswhat happened to the Prohibition Amendment.Is there enough of the American sense of life left in people—under the constantpressure of the cultural-political efforts to obliterate it? It is impossible totell. But those of us who hold it, must fight for it. We have no alternative: wecannot surrender this country to a zero—to men whose battle cry is mindlessness.We cannot fight against collectivism, unless we fight against its moral base:altruism. We cannot fight against altruism, unless we fight against itsepistemological base: irrationalism. We cannot fight against anything, unless wefight for something—and what we must fight for is the supremacy of reason, and aview of man as a rational being.These are philosophical issues. The philosophy we need is a conceptualequivalent of America’s sense of life. To propagate it, would require thehardest intellectual battle. But isn’t that a magnificent goal to fight for?"},{"pageContent":"IndexABORTIONABSOLUTISMABSTRACTIONSANTI-CONCEPTUAL MENTALITYEVALUATION OFACHIEVEMENTSCREDIT FORACTIONSACTIVE MIND“AGE OF ENVY,
