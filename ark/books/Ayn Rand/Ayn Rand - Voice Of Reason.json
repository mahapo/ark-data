It may be regarded as the best of the non-anthologized Ayn Rand. Noneof the pieces (with one exception) has appeared before in book form.Some of these twenty-six pieces are brief comments addressed to readers of hernewspaper column in the Los Angeles Times or of her own magazines. Others arelonger articles from her magazines, or lectures delivered to various kinds ofaudiences. The material spans a period of twenty years, from 1961, when she gavethe first of her annual talks at the Ford Hall Forum in Boston, to 1981, whenshe gave what was to be her last talk, to a businessmen’s group in New Orleans.I have also included six essays written after Miss Rand’s death in 1982: fiveare the Ford Hall Forum talks I have been giving in her stead in recent years.The sixth is an article by Peter Schwartz, editor of The Intellectual Activist,a publication that covers current events from an Objectivist viewpoint.The contents of this book vary widely in scope and subject matter. As thesubtitle indicates, however, all are “essays in Objectivist thought.” That is,all take as their frame of reference Ayn Rand’s unique philosophy ofObjectivism. Objectivism upholds capitalism in politics, on the basis of egoismin ethics, on the basis of reason in epistemology. Everything in this book,accordingly, is an application of this last tenet, which is the root and essenceof Objectivism. If one accepts reason—in its full, philosophical definition andimplications—all the rest follows. Thus the title of the present collection.The culture of our time, a legacy of two centuries of Kantian-ism, is shaped bythe opposite ideas; it is a product of mysticism, altruism, collectivism. Allaround us we see rebels against the Enlightenment, who openly avow their disdainfor the mind—in favor of brain-drowning drugs or obedience to the State or cultsurging “back to nature” or “back to the Bible.” In this kind of era, there isonly one true rebel: the man or woman who challenges the root of the evilsweeping the world, i.e., the radical who champions reason.Reason is man’s faculty of integrating sensory data into concepts, and therebyof expanding incalculably the power of his consciousness. Such integration isman’s distinctive method of cognition and the source of all his achievements: itis his only means of understanding and dealing with the facts of reality. Themind, in other words, is a practical attribute, the most practical one wepossess. Reason is man’s basic means of survival.A faculty so vital cannot be compromised or sabotaged with impunity. It cannotperform its life-sustaining function if it is treated as an occasionalindulgence alternating with bouts of divine revelation or the equivalent. Itmust be identified as the essential principle of human existence, then upheld asan absolute.Human virtue, in the Objectivist approach, consists not in faith or socialconformity or arbitrary emotion, but in thought, objectivity, rationality, therelentless exercise of one’s intelligence in the task of achieving the values,spiritual and material, which human life requires. Thus Ayn Rand’s ethics ofrational self-interest. If such rationality is to be possible, however, theindividual must be treated as a sovereign agent and left unmolested by physicalforce; he must be left free to think and then to act on his own best judgment.Thus Ayn Rand’s defense of the original American system of government, thesystem founded on the recognition of man’s inalienable individual rights.Ayn Rand came to the United States from Soviet Russia in 1926, at the age oftwenty-one. The founding principles of the United States, she thought, made itthe greatest country in history and the exact opposite of Russia, which shehated. In many ways the United States lived up to her expectations. She foundhere the freedom to write and speak; she became famous as a champion ofindividualism; she met her husband, Frank O‘Connor, whom she loved for fiftyyears. Intellectually, however, the United States was a disappointment. When shearrived, the intellectuals were on the threshold of what is now called the RedDecade. They were increasingly skeptical about the efficacy of reason, and theywere, to her, astonishingly anti-American. At first, she could hardly believethat in the bastion of capitalism (as she had imagined it to be), she washearing everywhere the same fundamental ideas that she had heard in Russia, thevery ideas from which she had run for her life.She had no choice but to fight the trend. She had seen what it led to, includingthe expropriation of her father’s business under Lenin and, later, the death ofher family under Stalin. She proceeded with every fiber of her being to fightfor man’s mind and his liberty, and all the major intellectual groups reacted bydenouncing her: the liberals attacked her as a reactionary; the conservatives,as a radical; the Communists, as a pro-capitalist; the Church, as an atheist(which she was). By her own choice and conviction, she was miles outside theintellectual mainstream—she was fighting to reverse that mainstream—and therewas no influential group anywhere to act as her ally.No group perhaps, but the American people, from whom she received an outpouringof admiration. I have read her fan mail through the years, from soldiers andphysicians and dancers and CEO’s and truck drivers and countless solemnteenagers and even some professors and priests—all struggling to thank her forthe vision of man and life presented in her novels, a vision that gave them thecourage to carry on their own lives at a moment when they desperately needed it.I have seen her being mobbed by students feeling the same response at dozens ofcollege campuses, from Harvard, Yale and Princeton on down. I have seen thelines of people waiting in the sometimes bitter Boston cold for ten hours ormore until the doors to the lecture hall would open and her Ford Hall speechbegin. Ayn Rand offered people something they could not get elsewhere, and inreturn they gave her love, awe, wealth. From the intellectuals, however, sheevoked for the most part the opposite: hatred.There were a few distinguished exceptions, among the most prominent of which wasthe Ford Hall Forum, a Boston organization that annually invites a series ofnationally known speakers to discuss current issues and then submit toquestioning from an audience. Like the rest of our intellectual establishment,the Forum professes to be fair; it claims to be open to all viewpoints. Unlikemost of our colleges and media, however, the Forum is not an exercise inhypocrisy; it is fair. It actually says to real dissenters on fundamentalissues: “Come and tell us what you think. We will not necessarily agree, but wewill listen.” I have observed few other examples of such fairness in thethirty-five years I have lived in this country. The Boston Globe a few years agodescribed the Forum as “fiercely independent, so far uncorrupted and radical,”and added that it “has never allowed itself to be co-opted, diluted, or rendered‘cautious’ and uncontroversial.” The Forum’s treatment of Ayn Rand proves thatthis tribute is not rhetoric, but simple truth.When Miss Rand was first invited to speak in 1961, she was reluctant to accept.She did not know the Forum’s distinguished history, and expected a group ofunruly antagonists; but she went anyway, with misgivings—and she loved it. Theaudience that evening did not agree with her, but they listened, then pepperedher with intelligent questions, the kind she always enjoyed answering. “TheForum,” she told me later, “sponsors many speakers with whom I disagree totally.But it is honest. Since it is open to new ideas, it truly is an intellectualorganization and it deserves to be supported.” Accordingly, she agreed to returnyear after year, and her admirers came to expect it; they started to gatherevery April in Boston from all over the country (and then the world). The NewYork Times once described these gatherings as the “Objectivist Easter.” I acceptthe term, since the word “Easter” comes from Eos, the Greek goddess of the dawn,and means, symbolically, the festival celebrating the rebirth of light after thedarkness of winter.I want to thank the Ford Hall Forum for making these Easter gatherings—and alongwith them, ten of the longest chapters in this book—possible. (Many of MissRand’s other Ford Hall talks have been reprinted in other anthologies of hers.)In particular, I want to salute the guiding spirit of the Forum, Frances Smith.Her sense of intellectual honor and rigor, her scrupulous objectivity, herauthentic enthusiasm for ideas and for philosophy—all this, in our age, is arare value, for which the citizens of Boston should be (and I think are) deeplygrateful.Now let me explain the structure and contents of the present anthology.Part I, Philosophy, consists of pieces that elaborate on the Objectivistphilosophy. It includes a brief overview of the Objectivist viewpoint (Chapter1), an indication of its kinship with the ideas of Aristotle (Chapter 2), andseveral important new discussions of ethics. These focus on the need ofobjectivity in ethics (Chapters 3 and 4), on the crucial distinction betweenpsychological diagnosis and moral judgment (Chapter 5), and on the non-objectivenature of the ethics of altruism (Chapters 6 and 7). Part I concludes with adenunciation of religion, which Objectivism regards as the rejection of reason(Chapters 8 and 9).Part II, Culture, begins with a discussion of the bankruptcy of today’sintellectuals (Chapter 10), then turns to some of this bankruptcy’s most ominousmanifestations: today’s cultural vacuum (Chapter 11), and the worldwide “ethnic”upsurge (Chapter 12). There follows a more specific consideration of the flawsof three groups: liberal pragmatists (Chapter 13), conservatives (Chapter 14),and businessmen, whom Miss Rand regards as being the unwitting financiers oftheir own destroyers, the universities (Chapter 15). Two eloquent culturalevents are then analyzed. One is tragic: the death of Marilyn Monroe (Chapter16); the other is exultant: the flight of Apollo 11 (Chapter 17). This lastpiece, one of Ayn Rand’s personal favorites, is her eyewitness account of themoon rocket’s lift-off; it conveys the sensory reality, the emotional resonance,and the deepest philosophical cause of an historic event; it is the kind ofreportage possible only to a great thinker who is at the same time a literaryartist. The end of the Apollo program is the subject of Chapter 18. Part 11 endswith a pair of my lectures on the American educational system. One documents theanti-Americanism rampant in our universities (Chapter 19); the other, theanti-conceptual methodology that is wrecking our grade schools (Chapter 20).Part III, Politics, considers a number of political issues from the standpointof an advocate of laissez-faire capitalism. It includes attacks on the quotasystem (Chapter 21), public TV (Chapter 22), antitrust legislation (Chapter 24),foreign aid (Chapter 25), and socialized medicine (Chapters 29 and 30). It alsooffers a practical proposal to break up the government’s monopoly in the fieldof education (Chapter 23); a discussion of the role of wealth in an industrialeconomy (Chapter 27); an identification of the cause of world hunger (Chapter28); and an explanation of Ayn Rand’s view that a rational woman would notdesire to serve as president of the United States (Chapter 26). Part IIIconcludes with a penetrating analysis by Peter Schwartz of the politicalmovement known as Libertarianism. Ayn Rand was always opposed to Libertarianism,regarding it as the opposite of her philosophy. The Schwartz piece explains why.The epilogue to this book—“My Thirty Years With Ayn Rand: An IntellectualMemoir”—is my report on the mental processes of a genius. Until a full-scale,authorized biography of Miss Rand is completed (which will be years from now),this lecture is my answer to the question: “What was Ayn Rand really like?”Now a few words about editorial matters. I have begun each chapter with asentence or two indicating the original source of the article or lecture. Asidefrom minor copy editing, mainly involving the removal of some commas, MissRand’s pieces are reproduced unchanged. Occasionally I have inserted into hertext, using brackets, an historical explanation or an unavoidable change inwording. (Please note that brackets within a quotation or parentheses are MissRand‘s, and represent her own interpolations.) As a rule, I have followed MissRand’s practice of leaving footnote references in brackets within the textitself, except in a few cases where this would be cumbersome; in such cases,references are numbered and collected at the end of the chapter.I want to thank a dedicated assistant, Diane LeMont, for her cheerfulness underpressure, and for her patient, meticulous work in helping to prepare themanuscript.The selection I have made for the present volume is, to a real extent,arbitrary. There are many excellent articles by Ayn Rand and her associates thatI have been forced by space limitations to omit.

I regret that owing to the thousands of inquirieswe receive, personal replies to such letters are not possible. But in due courseinquirers will receive literature from several sources indicating the directionto pursue if they wish to investigate Ayn Rand’s ideas further.—LEONARD PEIKOFFSouth Laguna, CaliforniaFebruary 1988"},{"pageContent":"Part One:Philosophy"},{"pageContent":"1Introducing Objectivismby Ayn RandThis is the first of Ayn Rand’s newspaper columns. It appeared in the LosAngeles Times on June 17, 1962.At a sales conference at Random House, preceding the publication of AtlasShrugged, one of the book salesmen asked me whether I could present the essenceof my philosophy while standing on one foot. I did, as follows:1. Metaphysics: Objective Reality2. Epistemology: Reason3. Ethics: Self-interest4. Politics: CapitalismIf you want this translated into simple language, it would read: 1. “Nature, tobe commanded, must be obeyed” or “Wishing won’t make it so.” 2. “You can’t eatyour cake and have it, too.” 3. “Man is an end in himself.” 4. “Give me libertyor give me death.”If you held these concepts with total consistency, as the base of yourconvictions, you would have a full philosophical system to guide the course ofyour life. But to hold them with total consistency—to understand, to define, toprove, and to apply them—requires volumes of thought. Which is why philosophycannot be discussed while standing on one foot—nor while standing on two feet onboth sides of every fence. This last is the predominant philosophical positiontoday, particularly in the field of politics.In the space of a column, I can give only the briefest summary of my position,as a frame of reference for all my future columns. My philosophy, Objectivism,holds that:1. Reality exists as an objective absolute—facts are facts, independent of man’sfeelings, wishes, hopes, or fears.2. Reason (the faculty which identifies and integrates the material provided byman’s senses) is man’s only means of perceiving reality, his only source ofknowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic means of survival.3. Man—every man—is an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others. Hemust exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others norsacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational self-interest andof his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life.4. The ideal political—economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is asystem where men deal with one another, not as victims and executioners, nor asmasters and slaves, but as traders, by free, voluntary exchange to mutualbenefit. It is a system where no man may obtain any values from others byresorting to physical force, and no man may initiate the use of physical forceagainst others. The government acts only as a policeman that protects man’srights; it uses physical force only in retaliation and only against those whoinitiate its use, such as criminals or foreign invaders. In a system of fullcapitalism, there should be (but, historically, has not yet been) a completeseparation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons asthe separation of state and church.Capitalism was the system originated in the United States. Its success, itsprogress, its achievements are unprecedented in human history. America’spolitical philosophy was based on man’s right to his own life, to his ownliberty, to the pursuit of his own happiness, which means: on man’s right toexist for his own sake. That was America’s implicit moral code, but it had notbeen formulated explicitly. This was the flaw in her intellectual armor, whichis now destroying her. America and capitalism are perishing for lack of a moralbase.The destroyer is the morality of altruism.Altruism holds that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service toothers is the only moral justification of his existence, and that self-sacrificeis his highest moral duty. The political expression of altruism is collectivismor statism, which holds that man’s life and work belong to the state—to society,to the group, the gang, the race, the nation—and that the state may dispose ofhim in any way it pleases for the sake of whatever it deems to be its owntribal, collective good.“From her start, America was torn by the clash of her political system with thealtruist morality. Capitalism and altruism are incompatible; they cannot coexistin the same man or in the same society. Today, the conflict has reached itsultimate climax ; the choice is clear-cut: either a new morality of rationalself-interest, with its consequences of freedom, justice, progress and man’shappiness on earth—or the primordial morality of altruism, with its consequencesof slavery, brute force, stagnant terror, and sacrificial furnaces.” [For theNew Intellectual]You may observe the practical results of altruism and statism all around us intoday’s world—such as the slave-labor camps of Soviet Russia, where twenty-onemillion political prisoners work on the construction of government projects anddie of planned malnutrition, human life being cheaper than food—or the gaschambers and mass slaughter of Nazi Germany—or the terror and starvation of RedChina—or the hysteria of Cuba where the government offers men for sale—or thewall of East Berlin, where human beings leap from roofs or crawl through sewersin order to escape, while guards shoot at fleeing children.Observe these atrocities, then ask yourself whether any of it would be possibleif men had not accepted the idea that man is a sacrificial animal to beimmolated for the sake of the “public good.” Read the speeches of thosecountries’ political leaders and ask yourself what arguments would be left tothem if the word “sacrifice” were regarded not as a moral ideal, but as theanti-human evil which it is.And then, listen to the speeches of our present [Kennedy] Administration—and askyourself the same question."},{"pageContent":"2Review of Randall’s Aristotleby Ayn RandJohn Herman Randall’s book on Aristotle was published by Columbia UniversityPress in 1960. This review appeared in The Objectivist Newsletter, May 1963.If there is a philosophical Atlas who carries the whole of Western civilizationon his shoulders, it is Aristotle. He has been opposed, misinterpreted,misrepresented, and—like an axiom—used by his enemies in the very act of denyinghim. Whatever intellectual progress men have achieved rests on his achievements.Aristotle may be regarded as the cultural barometer of Western history. Wheneverhis influence dominated the scene, it paved the way for one of history’sbrilliant eras; whenever it fell, so did mankind. The Aristotelian revival ofthe thirteenth century brought men to the Renaissance. The intellectualcounterrevolution turned them back toward the cave of his antipode: Plato.There is only one fundamental issue in philosophy: the cognitive efficacy ofman’s mind. The conflict of Aristotle versus Plato is the conflict of reasonversus mysticism. It was Plato who formulated most of philosophy’s basicquestions—and doubts. It was Aristotle who laid the foundation for most of theanswers. Thereafter, the record of their duel is the record of man’s longstruggle to deny and surrender or to uphold and assert the validity of hisparticular mode of consciousness.Today, philosophy has sunk below the level of Aristotle versus Plato, down tothe primitive gropings of Parmenides versus Heraclitus, whose disciples wereunable to reconcile the concept of intellectual certainty with the phenomenon ofchange: the Eleatics, who claimed that change is illogical, that in any clashbetween mind and reality, reality is dispensable and, therefore, change is anillusion—versus the Heraclitean Sophists, who claimed that mind is dispensable,that knowledge is an illusion and nothing exists but change. Or: consciousnesswithout existence versus existence without consciousness. Or: blind dogmatismversus cynical subjectivism. Or: Rationalism versus Empiricism.Aristotle was the first man who integrated the facts of identity and change,thus solving that ancient dichotomy. Or rather, he laid the foundation andindicated the method by which a full solution could be reached. In order toresurrect that dichotomy thereafter, it was necessary to ignore and evade hisworks. Ever since the Renaissance, the dichotomy kept being resurrected, in oneform or another, always aimed at one crucial target: the concept ofidentity—always leading to some alleged demonstration of the deceptiveness, thelimitations, the ultimate impotence of reason.It took several centuries of misrepresenting Aristotle to turn him into a strawman, to declare the straw man invalidated, and to release such a torrent ofirrationality that it is now sweeping philosophy away and carrying us back pastthe pre-Socratics, past Western civilization, into the prehistorical swamps ofthe Orient, via Existentialism and Zen Buddhism.Today, Aristotle is the forgotten man of philosophy. Slick young men go aboutdroning the wearisome sophistries of the fifth century B.C., to the effect thatman can know nothing, while unshaven young men go about chanting that they doknow by means of their whole body from the neck down.It is in this context that one must evaluate the significance of an unusual bookappearing on such a scene—Aristotle by John Herman Randall, Jr.Let me hasten to state that the above remarks are mine, not Professor Randall’s.He does not condemn modern philosophy as it deserves—he seems to share some ofits errors. But the theme of his book is the crucial relevance and importance ofAristotle to the philosophical problems of our age. And his book is an attemptto bring Aristotle’s theories back into the light of day—of our day—from underthe shambles of misrepresentation by medieval mystics and by modern Platonists.“Indeed,” he writes, “[Aristotle‘s] may well be the most passionate mind inhistory: it shines through every page, almost every line. His crabbed documentsexhibit, not ’cold thought,‘ but the passionate search for passionless truth.For him, there is no ’mean,‘ no moderation, in intellectual excellence. The’theoretical life’ is not for him the life of quiet ‘contemplation,’ serene andunemotional, but the life of nous, of theoria, of intelligence, burning,immoderate, without bounds or limits.”Indicating that the early scientists had discarded Aristotle in rebellionagainst his religious interpreters, Professor Randall points out that theirscientific achievements had, in fact, an unacknowledged Aristotelian base andwere carrying out the implications of Aristotle’s theories.Blaming the epistemological chaos of modern science on the influence of Newton’smechanistic philosophy of nature, he writes:It is fascinating to speculate how, had it been possible in the seventeenthcentury to reconstruct rather than abandon Aristotle, we might have been savedseveral centuries of gross confusion and error.... Where we are often stillgroping, Aristotle is frequently clear, suggestive, and fruitful. This holdstrue of many of his analyses: his doctrine of natural teleology; his view ofnatural necessity as not simple and mechanical but hypothetical; his conceptionof the infinite as potential, not actual; his notion of a finite universe; hisdoctrine of natural place; his conception of time as not absolute, but rather adimension, a system of measurement ; his conception that place is a coordinatesystem, and hence relative. On countless problems, from the standpoint of ourpresent theory, Aristotle was right, where the nineteenth-century Newtonianphysicists were wrong.Objecting to “the structureless world of Hume in which ‘anything may be followedby anything,’ ” Professor Randall writes:To such a view, which he found maintained by the Megarians, Aristotle answers,No! Every process involves the operation of determinate powers. There is nothingthat can become anything else whatsoever. A thing can become only what it hasthe specific power to become, only what it already is, in a sense, potentially.And a thing can be understood only as that kind of thing that has that kind of aspecific power; while the process can be understood only as the operation, theactualization, the functioning of the powers of its subject or bearer.To read a concise, lucid presentation of Aristotle’s system, written by adistinguished modern philosopher—written in terms of basic principles and broadfundamentals, as against the senseless “teasing” of trivia by today’s allegedthinkers—is so rare a value that it is sufficient to establish the importance ofProfessor Randall’s book, in spite of its flaws.Its flaws, unfortunately, are numerous. Professor Randall describes his book as“a philosopher’s delineation of Aristotle.” Since there are many contradictoryelements and many obscure passages in Aristotle’s own works (including, in somecases, the question of their authenticity), it is a philosopher’s privilege(within demonstrable limits) to decide which strands of a badly torn fabric hechooses to present as significantly “Aristotelian.” But nothing—particularly notAristotle—is infinite and indeterminate. And while Professor Randall tries toseparate his presentation from his interpretation, he does not always succeed.Some of his interpretations are questionable; some are stretched beyond thelimit of the permissible.For instance, he describes Aristotle’s approach to knowledge as follows:“Knowing is for him an obvious fact.... The real question, as he sees it, is,‘In what kind of a world is knowing possible?’ What does the fact of knowingimply about our world?” This is a form of “the prior certainty ofconsciousness”—the notion that one can first possess knowledge and then proceedto discover what that knowledge is of, thus making the world a derivative ofconsciousness—a Cartesian approach which would have been inconceivable toAristotle and which Professor Randall himself is combating throughout his book.Most of the book’s flaws come from the same root: from Professor Randall’sinability or unwillingness to break with modern premises, methods, andterminology. The perceptiveness he brings to his consideration of Aristotle’sideas seems to vanish whenever he attempts to equate Aristotle with moderntrends. To claim, as he does, that: “In modern terms, Aristotle can be viewed asa behaviorist, an operationalist, and a con textualist” (and, later, as a“functionalist” and a “relativist”), is either inexcusable or so looselygeneralized as to rob those terms of any meaning.Granted that those terms have no specific definitions and are used, like most oftoday’s philosophical language, in the manner of “mobiles” which connote ratherthan denote—even so, their accepted “connotations” are so anti-Aristotelian thatone is forced, at times, to wonder whether Professor Randall is trying to putsomething over on the moderns or on Aristotle. There are passages in the book tosupport either hypothesis.On the one hand, Professor Randall writes: “That we can know things as they are,that such knowledge is possible, is the fact that Aristotle is trying toexplain, and not, like Kant and his followers, trying to deny and explain away.”And: “Indeed, any construing of the fact of ‘knowledge,’ whether Kantian,Hegelian, Deweyan, Positivistic, or any other, seems to be consistent andfruitful, and to avoid the impasses of barren self-contradiction, and insolubleand meaningless problems, only when it proceeds from the Aristotelian approach,and pushes Aristotle’s own analyses further ... only, that is, in the measurethat it is conducted upon an Aristotelian basis.” (Though one wonders whatexactly would be left of Kant, Hegel, Dewey, or the Positivists if they werestripped of their non-Aristotelian elements.)On the other hand, Professor Randall seems to turn Aristotle into some foggycombination of a linguistic analyst and a Heraclitean, as if language andreality could be understood as two separate, unconnected dimensions—in suchpassages as: “When [Aristotle] goes on to examine what is involved in ‘being’anything ... he is led to formulate two sets of distinctions: the one setappropriate to understanding any ’thing’ or ousia as a subject of discourse, theother set appropriate to understanding any ‘thing’ or ousia as the outcome of aprocess, as the operation or functioning of powers, and ultimately as sheerfunctioning, activity.”It is true that Aristotle holds the answer to Professor Randall’s“structuralism-functionalism” dichotomy and that his answer is vitally importanttoday. But his answer eliminates that dichotomy altogether—and one cannot solveit by classifying him as a “functionalist” who believed that things are “sheerprocess.”The best parts of Professor Randall’s book are Chapters VIII, IX, and XI,particularly this last. In discussing the importance of Aristotle’s biologicaltheory and “the biological motivation of Aristotle’s thought,” he brings out anaspect of Aristotle which has been featured too seldom in recent discussions andwhich is much more profound than the question of Aristotle’s “functionalism”:the central place given to living entities, to the phenomenon of life, inAristotle’s philosophy.For Aristotle, life is not an inexplicable, supernatural mystery, but a fact ofnature. And consciousness is a natural attribute of certain living entities,their natural power, their specific mode of action—not an unaccountable elementin a mechanistic universe, to be explained away somehow in terms of inanimatematter, nor a mystic miracle incompatible with physical reality, to beattributed to some occult source in another dimension. For Aristotle, “living”and “knowing” are facts of reality; man’s mind is neither unnatural norsupernatural, but natural—and this is the root of Aristotle’s greatness, of theimmeasurable distance that separates him from other thinkers.Life—and its highest form, man’s life—is the central fact in Aristotle’s view ofreality. The best way to describe it is to say that Aristotle’s philosophy is“biocentric.”This is the source of Aristotle’s intense concern with the study of livingentities, the source of the enormously “pro-life” attitude that dominates histhinking. In some oddly undefined manner, Professor Randall seems to share it.This, in spite of all his contradictions, seems to be his real bond withAristotle.“Life is the end of living bodies,” writes Professor Randall, “since they existfor the sake of living.” And: “No kind of thing, no species is subordinated tothe purposes and interests of any other kind. In biological theory, the endserved by the structure of any specific kind of living thing is thegood—ultimately, the ‘survival’—of that kind of thing.” And, discussing the endsand conclusions of natural processes: “Only in human life are these ends andconclusions consciously intended, only in men are purposes found. For Aristotle,even God has no purpose, only man!”The blackest patch in this often illuminating book is Chapter XII, which dealswith ethics and politics. Its contradictions are apparent even without referenceto Aristotle’s text. It is astonishing to read the assertion: “Aristotle’sethics and politics are actually his supreme achievement.” They are not, even intheir original form—let alone in Professor Randall’s version, which transformsthem into the ethics of pragmatism.It is shocking to read the assertion that Aristotle is an advocate of the“welfare state.” Whatever flaws there are in Aristotle’s political theory—andthere are many—he does not deserve that kind of indignity.Professor Randall, who stresses that knowledge must rest on empirical evidence,should take cognizance of the empirical fact that throughout history theinfluence of Aristotle’s philosophy (particularly of his epistemology) has ledin the direction of individual freedom, of man’s liberation from the power ofthe state—that Aristotle (via John Locke) was the philosophical father of theConstitution of the United States and thus of capitalism—that it is Plato andHegel, not Aristotle, who have been the philosophical ancestors of alltotalitarian and welfare states, whether Bismarck‘s, Lenin’s, or Hitler’s.An “Aristotelian statist” is a contradiction in terms—and this, perhaps, is aclue to the conflict that mars the value of Professor Randall’s book.But if read critically, this book is of great value in the study of Aristotle’sphilosophy. It is a concise and comprehensive presentation which many peopleneed and look for, but cannot find today. It is of particular value to collegestudents: by providing a frame of reference, a clear summary of the whole, itwill help them to grasp the meaning of the issues through the fog of thefragmentary, unintelligible manner in which most courses on Aristotle are taughttoday.Above all, this book is important culturally, as a step in the right direction,as a recognition of the fact that the great physician needed by our dyingscience of philosophy is Aristotle—that if we are to emerge from theintellectual shambles of the present, we can do it only by means of anAristotelian approach.“Clearly,” writes Professor Randall, “Aristotle did not say everything; thoughwithout what he first said, all words would be meaningless, and when it isforgotten they usually are.”"},{"pageContent":"3To Young Scientistsby Ayn RandThese remarks were delivered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology inMarch 1962. They were addressed to “the students who are to be America‘s futurescientists.” Reprinted from an edited version in The Objectivist Newsletter,October 1962.We are living in an age when every social group is struggling frantically todestroy itself—and doing it faster than any of its rivals or enemies could hopefor—when every man is his own most dangerous enemy, and the whole of mankind isrolling, at supersonic speed, back to the Dark Ages, with a nuclear bomb in onehand and a rabbit’s foot in the other.The most terrible paradox of our age is the fact that the destruction of man’smind, of reason, of logic, of knowledge, of civilization, is being accomplishedin the name and with the sanction of science.It took centuries and volumes of writing to bring our culture to its presentstate of bankruptcy—and volumes would have to be written to expose, counteract,and avert the disaster of a total intellectual collapse. But of all the deadlytheories by means of which you are now being destroyed, I would like to warn youabout one of the deadliest and most crucial: the alleged dichotomy of scienceand ethics.You have heard that theory so often and from so many authorities that most ofyou now take it for granted, as an axiom, as the one absolute taught to you bythose who proclaim that there are no absolutes. It is the doctrine that man’sscience and ethics—or his knowledge and values, or his body and soul—are twoseparate, antagonistic aspects of his existence, and that man is caught betweenthem, as a precarious, permanent traitor to their conflicting demands.Science, they tell you, is the province of reason—but ethics, they say, is theprovince of a higher power, which man’s impotent, fallible intellect must not beso presumptuous as to challenge. What power? Why, feelings.Before you accept that doctrine, identify concretely and specifically what itmeans. (Remember that ethics is a code of values to guide man’s choices andactions, the choices and actions that determine the purpose and course of hislife.) It means that you, as scientists, are competent to discover newknowledge—but not competent to judge for what purpose that knowledge is to beused. Your judgment is to be ,disqualified, if, when, and because it isrational—while human purposes are to be determined by the representatives ofnonreason. You are to create the means—but they are to choose the ends. You areto work and think and strain all the power, energy and ingenuity of your mind toits utmost logical best, and produce great achievements—but those “superior”others will dispose of your achievements, by the grace and guidance of theirfeelings. Your mind is to be the tool and servant of their whims. You are tocreate the H-bomb—but a blustering Russian anthropoid will decide when he feelslike dropping it and on whom. Yours is not to reason why—yours is just to do andprovide the ammunition for others to die.From Plato’s Republic onward, all statist-collectivists have looked longingly upat an anthill as at a social ideal to be reached. An anthill is a society ofinterdependent insects, where each particular kind or class is physiologicallyable to perform only one specific function: some are milch cows, some are toilers, a few are rulers. Collectivist planners have dreamed for a long time ofcreating an ideal society by means of eugenics—by breeding men into variouscastes physiologically able to perform only one specific function. Your place,in such a society, would be that of toiling milch-brains, of human computers whowould produce anything on demand and would be biologically incapable ofquestioning the orders of the anthropoid who’d throw them their food rations.Does your self-esteem accept such a prospect?No, I am not saying that that dream will ever be achieved physiologically. But Iam saying that it has already been achieved politically and intellectually:politically, among your so-called colleagues in Soviet Russia—intellectually, inthe mind of any man who accepts the science-ethics dichotomy.I believe that many of you were attracted to the field of science precisely byreason of that dichotomy: in order to escape from the hystericalmystic-subjectivist-emotionalist shambles to which philosophers have reduced thefield of ethics—and in order to find a clean, intelligible, rational, objectiverealm of activity.You have not found it—not because it doesn’t exist, but because it cannot befound without the help of a clean, intelligible, rational, objective philosophy,part of which is ethics. It cannot be found until you realize that man cannotexist as half-scientist, half-brute—that all the aspects of his existence are,can be, and should be subject to the study and the judgment of his intellect—andthat of all human disciplines, it is ethics, the discipline which sets hisgoals, that should be elevated into a science.No man and no class of men can live without a code of ethics. But if there aredegrees of urgency, I would say that it is you, the scientists, who need it mosturgently. The nature of your power and of your responsibility is too obvious toneed restatement. You can read it in every newspaper headline. It is obvious whyyou should know—before you start out—to what purpose and service you choose todevote the power of your mind.If you do not care to know—well, I would like to say that there is a characterin Atlas Shrugged who was dedicated to you as a warning, with the sincere hopethat it would not be necessary. His name is Dr. Robert Stadler.Many things have happened [in recent months] to demonstrate the ultimateconsequences of the science—ethics dichotomy.If a professional soldier were to accept a job with Murder, Inc. and claim thathe is merely practicing his trade, that it is not his responsibility to know whois using his services or for what purpose—he would be greeted by a storm ofindignation and regarded as a moral psychopath. Yet at his bloodiest worst, hecould not perpetrate a fraction of the horrors achieved by any haughty asceticof science who merely places a slip of paper with some mathematical computationsinto the hands of Khrushchev or Mao Tse-tung or any of their imitators inAmerica, and, having read no newspapers since 1914, declares himself to be“above the battle.”It is thus that the world reached the nightmare spectacle which surpasses anyhorror story of science fiction: two Soviet capsules circling in “outer space,”as the alleged triumph of an advanced science—while here on earth, a young boylies bleeding to death and screaming for help, at the foot of the wall in EastBerlin, shot for attempting to escape and left there by the prehistoricalmonsters from twenty thousand centuries deep: the Soviet rulers.No, this is not the worst evil on today’s earth; there is one still worse: theconscience of those Western scientists who are still willing to associate oncivilized terms with those colleagues of theirs who champion unilateraldisarmament.If you are now starting on a career in science, you do not have to share theguilt of those men, but you do have to reclaim the field and the honor ofscience.There is only one way to do it: by accepting the moral principle that one doesnot surrender one’s mind into blind servitude to thugs, and one does not acceptthe job of munitions maker for Attila’s conquest of the world; not for anyAttila, actual or potential, foreign or domestic.There is only one way to implement that principle. Throughout history, with onlya few exceptions, governments have claimed the “right” to rule men by means ofphysical force, that is: by terror and destruction. When the potential of terrorand destruction reaches today’s scale, it should convince every human being thatif mankind is to survive, Attila’s concept of government must be discarded,along with the alleged “right” of any men to impose their ideas or wishes onothers by initiating the use of physical force. This means that men mustestablish a free, noncoercive society, where the government is only a policemanprotecting individual rights, where force is used only in retaliation andself-defense, where no gang can seize the legalized power to unleash a reign ofterror. Such a society does not have to be invented: it had existed, though notfully. Its name is capitalism.Needless to say, capitalism does not force individuals or nations into thecollectivist slave pen of a world government. The so-called One World is merely“one neck ready for one leash.” Capitalism leaves men free for self-defense, butgives no one the political means to initiate force or war.This—not physical but political disarmament, the renunciation of legalized bruteforce as a way of life—is the only means of saving the world from nucleardestruction."},{"pageContent":"4Who Is the Final Authority in Ethics?by Ayn RandWritten in answer to a reader’s question, this article appeared in the“Intellectual Ammunition Department” of The Objectivist Newsletter, February1965.There are certain questions that must be questioned—that is, challenged at theirroot—because they consist of smuggling a false premise into the mind of acareless listener. “Who created the universe?” is one such question. “Do youstill beat your wife?” is another. And so is the question above.It comes up in many different ways, directly and indirectly. It is usually askedin some formulation such as: “Who decides what is right or wrong?”Students of Objectivism are not likely to ask this question, but they may hearit from others and fail to understand its nature. I was astonished, however, tofind it addressed to this department, in the following form: “Is it intellectualplagiarism to accept and even to use philosophical principles and valuesdiscovered by someone else?”It may not appear to be the same question, but it is—in the sense that it comesfrom the same fundamental error.The nature of the error will become apparent if one applies that question to thephysical sciences: “Who decides what is right or wrong in electronics?” Or: “Isit scientific plagiarism to accept and even to use medical principles andtherapeutic techniques discovered by someone else?”It is obvious that the root of such questions is a certain kind of conceptualvacuum: the absence of the concept of objectivity in the questioner’s mind.Objectivity is both a metaphysical and an epistemological concept. It pertainsto the relationship of consciousness to existence. Metaphysically, it is therecognition of the fact that reality exists independent of any perceiver’sconsciousness. Epistemologically, it is the recognition of the fact that aperceiver’s (man’s) consciousness must acquire knowledge of reality by certainmeans (reason) in accordance with certain rules (logic). This means thatalthough reality is immutable and, in any given context, only one answer istrue, the truth is not automatically available to a human consciousness and canbe obtained only by a certain mental process which is required of every man whoseeks knowledge—that there is no substitute for this process, no escape from theresponsibility for it, no shortcuts, no special revelations to privilegedobservers—and that there can be no such thing as a final “authority” in matterspertaining to human knowledge. Metaphysically, the only authority is reality;epistemologically—one’s own mind. The first is the ultimate arbiter of thesecond.The concept of objectivity contains the reason why the question, “Who decideswhat is right or wrong?” is wrong. Nobody “decides.” Nature does not decide—itmerely is; man does not decide, in issues of knowledge, he merely observes thatwhich is. When it comes to applying his knowledge, man decides what he choosesto do, according to what he has learned, remembering that the basic principle ofrational action in all aspects of human existence, is: “Nature, to be commanded,must be obeyed.” This means that man does not create reality and can achieve hisvalues only by making his decisions consonant with the facts of reality.Who “decides” what is the right way to make an automobile, to cure an illness orto live one’s life? Any man who cares to acquire the appropriate knowledge andto judge, at and for his own risk and sake. What is his criterion of judgment?Reason. What is his ultimate frame of reference? Reality. If he errs or evades,who penalizes him? Reality.It took centuries (and the influence of Aristotle) for men to acquire aprecarious hold on the concept of objectivity in regard to the physicalsciences. How precarious that hold actually is, can be observed in the fact thatmost men are incapable of extending that concept to all human knowledgeincluding the so-called humanities, the sciences dealing with man. In regard tothe humanities, consciously or subconsciously, explicitly or implicitly, mostpeople revert to the epistemology of prehistorical savages, i.e., tosubjectivism.Subjectivism is the belief that reality is not a firm absolute, but a fluid,plastic, indeterminate realm which can be altered, in whole or in part, by theconsciousness of the perceiver—i.e., by his feelings, wishes or whims. It is thedoctrine which holds that man—an entity of a specific nature, dealing with auniverse of a specific nature—can, somehow, live, act, and achieve his goalsapart from and/or in contradiction to the facts of reality, i.e., apart fromand/or in contradiction to his own nature and the nature of the universe. (Thisis the “mixed,” moderate or middle-of-the-road version of subjectivism. Pure or“extreme” subjectivism does not recognize the concept of identity, i.e., thefact that man or the universe or anything possesses a specific nature.)Morality has been the monopoly of mystics, i.e., of subjectiv ists, forcenturies—a monopoly reinforced and reaffirmed by the neo-mystics of modernphilosophy. The clash between the two dominant schools of ethics, the mysticaland the social, is only a clash between personal subjectivism and socialsubjectivism: one substitutes the supernatural for the objective, the othersubstitutes the collective for the objective. Both are savagely united againstthe introduction of objectivity into the realm of ethics.Most men, therefore, find it particularly difficult to regard ethics as ascience and to grasp the concept of a rational, objective ethics that leaves noroom for anyone’s arbitrary “decision.”Subjectivism is the smuggled premise at the root of both variants of thequestion under discussion. Superficially, the two variants may appear to comefrom opposite motives. Actually, they are two sides of the same subjectivistcoin.The man who asks: “Who decides what is right or wrong?” is obviously asubjectivist who believes that reality is ruled by human whims and who seeks toescape from the responsibility of independent judgment by one of two means:either by cynicism or by blind faith, either by negating the validity of allmoral standards or by looking for an “authority” to obey.But the man who asks: “Is it intellectual plagiarism to accept and even to usephilosophical principles and values discovered by someone else?” is not asovereign consciousness seeking independence from others, as he wants to makehimself appear. He has no better grasp of objectivity than the first man; he isa subjectivist who sees reality as a contest of whims and wants it to be ruledby his whims—which he proposes to accomplish by discarding as false everythingdiscovered by others. His primary concern, in regard to philosophicalprinciples, is not: “Is it true or false?” but: “Who discovered it?”On such a premise, he would have to make fire by rubbing sticks together (if hediscovers that much), since he is not Edison and cannot accept electric light.He would have to maintain that the earth is flat, since Columbus beat him to thedemonstration of its shape. He would have to advocate statism, since he is notAdam Smith. And he would have to discard the laws of logic, since he isobviously not Aristotle.The division of labor in the pursuit of knowledge—the fact that men can transmitknowledge and learn from one another’s discoveries—is one of man’s greatadvantages over all other living species. Only a subjectivist, who equates factswith arbitrary assertions, could imagine that to “learn” means to “accept onfaith”—as this questioner seems to imply.It is also possible that the motive of such a mentality is the wish not todiscard the ideas of others, but to appropriate them. “Plagiarism” is a conceptthat pertains, not to the acceptance, but to the authorship of an idea. Needlessto say, to accept someone’s idea and then to pose as its originator isplagiarism of the lowest order. But this has nothing to do with a legitimate,rational process of learning. The truth of an idea and its authorship are twoseparate issues, which are not difficult to keep apart.This particular variant of the question was worth noting only as an extremeexample of subjectivism—of the degree to which ideas have no reality and noconnection to reality in a subjectivist’s mind. It is an illustration of theextent to which the concept of objectivity is still alien to a great many men,and of the extent to which mankind needs it.Observe that most modern collectivists—the alleged advocates of humanbrotherhood, benevolence, and cooperation—are committed to subjectivism in thehumanities. Yet reason—and, therefore, objectivity—is the only common bond amongmen, the only means of communication, the only universal frame of reference andcriterion of justice. No understanding, communication, or cooperation ispossible to men on the basis of unintelligible feelings and subjective “urges”;nothing is possible but a contest of whims resolved by the rule of brute force.In politics, the subjectivist question of “Who ‘decides’?” comes up in manyforms. It leads many alleged champions of freedom to the notion that “the willof the people” or of the majority is the ultimate sanction of a free society,which is a contradiction in terms, since such a sanction represents the doctrineof unlimited majority rule.The answer, here as in all other moral-intellectual problems, is that nobody“decides.” Reason and reality are the only valid criteria of political theories.Who determines which theory is true? Any man who can prove it.Theories, ideas, discoveries are not created collectively; they are the productsof individual men. In politics, as in every other field of human endeavor, agroup can only accept or reject a product (or a theory); it cannot, qua group,participate in its creation. The participants are those who choose thatparticular field of activity, each to the extent of his ability and ambition.And when men are free, irrational theories can win only temporarily and onlythrough the errors or the default of the thinkers, i.e., of those who do seekthe truth.In politics, as in every other field, the men who do not care to think aremerely ballast: they accept, by default, whatever the intellectual leaders ofthe moment have to offer. To the extent to which men do think, they follow theman who offers the best (i.e., the most rational) idea. This does not happeninstantaneously or automatically or in every specific case and detail, but thisis the way knowledge spreads among men, and this has been the pattern ofmankind’s progress. The best proof of the power of ideas—the power of reason formen of all levels of intelligence—is the fact that no dictatorship was ever ableto last without establishing censorship.The number of its adherents is irrelevant to the truth or falsehood of an idea.A majority is as fallible as a minority or as an individual man. A majority voteis not an epistemological validation of an idea. Voting is merely a properpolitical device—within a strictly, constitutionally delimited sphere ofaction—for choosing the practical means of implementing a society’s basicprinciples. But those principles are not determined by vote. By whom, then, arethey determined? By the facts of reality—as identified by those thinkers whochose the field of political philosophy. This was the pattern of the greatestpolitical achievement in history: the American Revolution.In this connection, it is important to note the epistemological significance ofa free society. In a free society, the pursuit of truth is protected by the freeaccess of any individual to any field of endeavor he may choose to enter. (Afree access does not mean a guarantee of success, or of financial support, or ofanyone’s acceptance and agreement—it means the absence of any forcedrestrictions or legal barriers.) This prevents the formation of any coercive“elite” in any profession—it prevents the legalized enforcement of a “monopolyon truth” by any gang of power seekers—it protects the free market place ofideas—it keeps all doors open to man’s inquiring mind.Who “decides”? In politics, in ethics, in art, in science, in philosophy—in theentire realm of human knowledge—it is reality that sets the terms, through thework of those men who are able to identify its terms and to translate them intoobjective principles."},{"pageContent":"5The Psychology of Psychologizingby Ayn RandThis article was published in The Objectivist, March 1971.In certain passages of Atlas Shrugged, I touched briefly on issues which Iwanted to discuss theoretically at a later date and at greater length.One such passage is the scene in which Hank Rearden, struggling to understandhis wife’s behavior, wonders whether the motive of her constant, spitefulsarcasm is “not a desire to make him suffer, but a confession of her own pain, adefense for the pride of an unloved wife, a secret plea—so that the subtle, thehinted, the evasive in her manner, the thing begging to be understood, was notthe open malice, but the hidden love.”Struggling to be just, he gives her the benefit of the doubt and suppresses thewarning of his own mind. “He felt a dim anger, like a voice he tried to choke, avoice crying in revulsion: Why should I deal with her rotten, twisted lying?—whyshould I accept torture for the sake of pity?—why is it I who should have totake the hopeless burden of trying to spare a feeling she won’t admit, a feelingI can’t know or understand or try to guess?—if she loves me, why doesn’t thedamn coward say so and let us both face it in the open?”Rearden was the innocent victim of a widespread game that has many variants andramifications, none of them innocent, a game that could be called a racket. Itconsists, in essence, of substituting psychology for philosophy.Today, many people use psychology as a new form of mysticism: as a substitutefor reason, cognition and objectivity, as an escape from the responsibility ofmoral judgment, both in the role of the judge and the judged.Mysticism requires the notion of the unknowable, which is revealed to some andwithheld from others; this divides men into those who feel guilt and those whocash in on it. The two groups are interchangeable, according to circumstances.When being judged, a mystic cries: “I couldn’t help it!” When judging others, hedeclares: “You can’t know, but I can.” Modern psychology offers him bothopportunities.Once, the power superseding and defeating man’s mind was taken to bepredetermined fate, supernatural will, original sin, etc.; now it is one’s ownsubconscious. But it is still the same old game: the notion that the wishes, thefeelings, the beliefs—and, today, the malfunction—of a human consciousness canabsolve a man from the responsibility of cognition.Just as reasoning, to an irrational person, becomes rationalizing, and moraljudgment becomes moralizing, so psychological theories become psychologizing.The common denominator is the corruption of a cognitive process to serve anulterior motive.Psychologizing consists in condemning or excusing specific individuals on thegrounds of their psychological problems, real or invented, in the absence of orcontrary to factual evidence.As a science, psychology is barely making its first steps. It is still in theanteroom of science, in the stage of observing and gathering material from whicha future science will come. This stage may be compared to the pre-Socraticperiod in philosophy; psychology has not yet found a Plato, let alone anAristotle, to organize its material, systematize its problems, and define itsfundamental principles.A conscientious psychotherapist, of almost any school, knows that the task ofdiagnosing a particular individual’s problems is extremely complex anddifficult. The same symptom may indicate different things in different men,according to the total context and interaction of their various premises. A longperiod of special inquiry is required to arrive even at a valid hypothesis.This does not stop the amateur psychologizers. Armed with a smattering not ofknowledge, but of undigested slogans, they rush, unsolicited, to diagnose theproblems of their friends and acquaintances. Pretentiousness andpresumptuousness are the psychologizer’s invariable characteristics: he notmerely invades the privacy of his victims’ minds, he claims to understand theirminds better than they do, to know more than they do about their own motives.With reckless irresponsibility, which an old-fashioned mystic oracle wouldhesitate to match, he ascribes to his victims any motivation that suits hispurpose, ignoring their denials. Since he is dealing with the great“unknowable”—which used to be life after death or extrasensory perception, butis now man’s subconscious—all rules of evidence, logic, and proof are suspended,and anything goes (which is what attracts him to his racket).The harm he does to his victims is incalculable. People who have psychologicalproblems are confused and suggestible; unable to understand their own innerstate, they often feel that any explanation is better than none (which is a verygrave error). Thus the psychologizer succeeds in implanting new doubts in theirminds, augmenting their sense of guilt and fear, and aggravating their problems.The unearned status of an “authority,” the chance to air arbitrarypronouncements and frighten people or manipulate them, are some of thepsychologizer’s lesser motives. His basic motive is worse. Observe that heseldom discovers any virtuous or positive elements hidden in his victims’subconscious; what he claims to discover are vices, weaknesses, flaws. What heseeks is a chance to condemn—to pronounce a negative moral judgment, not on thegrounds of objective evidence, but on the grounds of some intangible, unprovableprocesses in a man’s subconscious untranslated into action. This means: a chanceto subvert morality.The basic motive of most psychologizers is hostility. Caused by a profoundself-doubt, self-condemnation, and fear, hostility is a type of projection thatdirects toward other people the hatred which the hostile person feels towardhimself. Blaming the evil of others for his own shortcomings, he feels a chronicneed to justify himself by demonstrating their evil, by seeking it, by huntingfor it—and by inventing it. The discovery of actual evil in a specificindividual is a painful experience for a moral person. But observe the almosttriumphant glee with which a psychologizer discovers some ineffable evil in somebewildered victim.The psychologizer’s subversion of morality has another, corollary aspect: byassuming the role of a kind of moral Grand Inquisitor responsible for thepsychological purity of others, he deludes himself into the belief that he isdemonstrating his devotion to morality and can thus escape the necessity ofapplying moral principles to his own actions.This is his link to another, more obvious, and, today, more fashionable type ofpsychologizer who represents the other side of the same coin: the humanitariancynic. The cynic turns psychology into a new, “scientific” version ofdeterminism and—by means of unintelligible jargon derived from fantasticallyarbitrary theories—declares that man is ruled by the blind forces of hissubconscious, which he can neither know nor control, that he can’t help it, thatnobody can help what he does, that nobody should be judged or condemned, thatmorality is a superstition and anything goes.This type has many subvariants, ranging from the crude cynic, who claims thatinnately all men are swine, to the compassionate cynic, who claims that anythingmust be forgiven and that the substitute for morality is love.Observe that both types of psychologizers, the Inquisitor and the cynic, switchroles according to circumstances. When the Inquisitor is called to account forsome action of his own, he cries: “I couldn’t help it!” When the humanitariancynic confronts an unforgiving, moral man, he vents as virulent a stream ofdenunciations, hostility, and hatred as any Inquisitor—forgetting that the moralman, presumably, can’t help it.The common denominator remains constant: escape from cognition and, therefore,from morality.Psychologizing is not confined to amateurs acting in private. Some professionalpsychologists have set the example in public. As an instance of the Inquisitortype of psychologizing, there was the group of psychiatrists who libeled SenatorBarry Goldwater [in 1964], permitting themselves the outrageous impertinence ofdiagnosing a man they had never met. (Parenthetically, Senator Goldwaterexhibited a magnificent moral courage in challenging them and subjecting himselfto their filthy malice in the ordeal of a trial, which he won. The SupremeCourt, properly, upheld the verdict.) [Goldwater v. Ginzburg et al. 396 U.S.1049]As an example of the cynic type of psychologizing, there are the psychologistswho rush to the defense of any murderer (such as Sirhan Sirhan), claiming thathe could not help it, that the blame rests on society or environment or hisparents or poverty or war, etc.These notions are picked up by amateurs, by psychologizing commentators whooffer them as excuses for the atrocities committed by “political” activists,bombers, college-campus thugs, etc. The notion that poverty is the psychologicalroot of all evil is a typical piece of psychologizing, whose proponents ignorethe fact that the worst atrocities are committed by the children of thewell-to-do.As examples of eclectic mixtures, there are the psychologizing biographies ofhistorical figures that interpret the motives of men who died centuries ago—bymeans of a crude, vulgarized version of the latest psychological theories, whichare false to begin with. And there are the countless psychologizing movies thatexplain a murderer’s actions by showing that his domineering mother did not kisshim good night at the age of six—or account for a girl’s frigidity by revealingthat she once broke a doll representing her father.Then there is the renowned playwright who was asked in a television interviewwhy his plays always had unhappy endings, and who answered: “I don’t know. Askmy psychiatrist.”While the racket of the philosophizing mystics rested on the claim that man isunable to know the external world, the racket of the psychologizing mysticsrests on the claim that man is unable to know his own motivation. The ultimategoal is the same: the undercutting of man’s mind.Psychologizers do not confine themselves to any one school of psychology. Theysnatch parts of any and all psychological theories as they see fit. They sneakalong on the fringes of any movement. They exist even among alleged students ofObjectivism.The psychologizers’ victims are not always innocent or unwilling. The“liberation” from the responsibility of knowing one’s own motives is tempting tomany people. Many are eager to switch the burden of judging their own moralstature to the shoulders of anyone willing to carry it. Men who do not acceptthe judgment of others as a substitute for their own in regard to the externalworld, turn into abject secondhanders in regard to their inner state. They wouldnot go to a quack for a medical diagnosis of their physical health, but theyentrust their mental health to any psychologizer who comes along. The innocentpart of their reasons is their failure of introspection and the painful chaos oftheir psychological conflicts; the non-innocent part is fear of moralresponsibility.Both the psychologizers and their victims ignore the nature of consciousness andof morality.An individual’s consciousness, as such, is inaccessible to others ; it can beperceived only by means of its outward manifestations. It is only when mentalprocesses reach some form of expression in action that they become perceivable(by inference) and can be judged. At this point, there is a line of demarcation,a division of labor, between two different sciences.The task of evaluating the processes of man’s subconscious is the province ofpsychology. Psychology does not regard its subject morally, but medically—i.e.,from the aspect of health or malfunction (with cognitive competence as theproper standard of health).The task of judging man’s ideas and actions is the province of philosophy.Philosophy is concerned with man as a conscious being; it is for consciousbeings that it prescribes certain principles of action, i.e., a moral code.A man who has psychological problems is a conscious being; his cognitive facultyis hampered, burdened, slowed down, but not destroyed. A neurotic is not apsychotic. Only a psychotic is presumed to suffer from a total break withreality and to have no control over his actions or the operations of hisconsciousness (and even this is not always true). A neurotic retains the abilityto perceive reality, and to control his consciousness and his actions (thiscontrol is merely more difficult for him than for a healthy person). So long ashe is not psychotic, this is the control that a man cannot lose and must notabdicate.Morality is the province of philosophical judgment, not of psychologicaldiagnosis. Moral judgment must be objective, i.e., based on perceivable,demonstrable facts. A man’s moral character must be judged on the basis of hisactions, his statements, and his conscious convictions—not on the basis ofinferences (usually spurious) about his subconscious.A man is not to be condemned or excused on the grounds of the state of hissubconscious. His psychological problems are his private concern which is not tobe paraded in public and not to be made a burden on innocent victims or ahunting ground for poaching psychologizers. Morality demands that one treat andjudge men as responsible adults.This means that one grants a man the respect of assuming that he is conscious ofwhat he says and does, and one judges his statements and actionsphilosophically, i.e., as what they are—not psychologically, i.e., as leads orclues to some secret, hidden, unconscious meaning. One neither speaks norlistens to people in code.If a man’s consciousness is hampered by malfunction, it is the task of apsychologist to help him correct it—just as it is the task of a doctor to helpcorrect the malfunction of a man’s body. It is not the task of anastronaut-trainer or a choreographer to adjust the techniques of space flying orof ballet dancing to the requirements of the physically handicapped. It is notthe task of philosophy to adjust the principles of proper action (i.e., ofmorality) to the requirements of the psychologically handicapped—nor to allowpsychologizers to transform such handicaps into a moral issue, one way or theother.It is not man’s subconscious, but his conscious mind that is subject to hisdirect control—and to moral judgment. It is a specific individual’s consciousmind that one judges (on the basis of objective evidence) in order to judge hismoral character.Every kind of psychologizing involves the false dichotomy whose extremes arerepresented by the Inquisitor and the cynic. The alternative is not: rash,indiscriminate moralizing or cowardly, evasive moral neutrality—i.e.,condemnation without knowledge or the refusal to know in order not to condemn.These are two interchangeable variants of the same motive: escape from theresponsibility of cognition and of moral judgment.In dealing with people, one necessarily draws conclusions about theircharacters, which involves their psychology, since every character judgmentrefers to a man’s consciousness. But it is a man’s subconscious and hispsychopathology that have to be left alone, particularly in moral evaluations.A layman needs some knowledge of medicine in order to know how to take care ofhis own body—and when to call a doctor. The same principle applies topsychology: a layman needs some knowledge of psychology in order to understandthe nature of a human consciousness; but theoretical knowledge does not qualifyhim for the extremely specialized job of diagnosing the psy chopathologicalproblems of specific individuals. Even self-diagnosis is often dangerous: thereis such a phenomenon as psychological hypochondriacs, who ascribe to themselvesevery problem they hear or read about.Allowing for exceptions in special cases, it is not advisable to discuss one’spsychological problems with one’s friends. Such discussions can lead todisastrously erroneous conclusions (since two amateurs are no better than one,and sometimes worse) —and they introduce a kind of medical element thatundercuts the basis of friendship. Friendship presupposes two firm, independent,reliable, and responsible personalities. (This does not mean that one has tolie, put on an act and hide from one’s friends the fact that one has problems;it means simply that one does not turn a friend into a therapist.)The above applies to psychological discussions between two honest persons. Theopportunities such discussions offer to the dishonest are obvious: they are aninvitation for every type of psychologizer to pounce upon. The Inquisitor willuse them to frighten and manipulate a victim. The cynic will use them to attractattention to himself, to evoke pity, to wheedle special privileges. The old ladywho talks about her operation is a well-known bore; she is nothing compared tothe youngish lady who talks on and on and on about her psychological problems,with a lameness of imagination that prevents them from being good fiction.Psychological problems as such are not a disgrace; it is what a person doesabout them that frequently is.Since a man’s psychological problems hamper his cognitive judgment (particularlythe problems created by a faulty psycho-epistemology), it is his responsibilityto delimit his problems as much as possible, to think with scrupulous precisionand clarity before taking an action, and never to act blindly on the spur of anemotion (it is emotions that distort cognition in all types of psychologicalproblems). In regard to other men, it is his responsibility to preserve theprinciple of objectivity, i.e., to be consistent and intelligible in hisbehavior, and not to throw his neurosis at others, expecting them to untangleit, which none of them can or should do.This brings us to the lowest type of psychologizing, exemplified by LillianRearden.Though her behavior was a calculated racket, the same policy is practiced bymany people, in many different forms, to varying extents, moved by variousmixtures of cunning, inertia, and irresponsibility. The common denominator isthe conscious flouting of objectivity—in the form of the self-admitted inabilityand/or unwillingness to explain one’s own actions. The pattern goes as follows:“Why did you do this?” “I don’t know.” “What were you after?” “I don’t know.”“Since I can’t understand you, what do you expect me to do?” “I don’t know.”This policy rests on the notion that the content of one’s consciousness need notbe processed.It is only a newborn infant that could regard itself as the helplessly passivespectator of the chaotic sensations which are the content of its consciousness(but a newborn infant would not, because its consciousness is intensely busyprocessing its sensations). From the day of his birth, man’s development andgrowth to maturity consists in his mastery of the skill of processing hissensory-perceptual material, of organizing it into concepts, of integratingconcepts, of identifying his feelings, of discovering their relation to thefacts of reality. This processing has to be performed by a man’s own mind. Noone can perform it for him. If he fails to perform it, he is mentally defective.It is only on the assumption that he has performed it that one treats him as aconscious being.The evil of today’s psychologizing culture—fostered particularly by Progressiveeducation—is the notion that no such processing is necessary.The result is the stupor and lethargy of those who are neither infants noradults, but miserable sleepwalkers unwilling to wake up. Anything can enter thespongy mess inside their skulls, nothing can come out of it. The signals itemits are chance regurgitations of any chance splatter.They have abdicated the responsibility for their own mental processes, yet theycontinue to act, to speak, to deal with people—and to expect some sort ofresponse. This means that they throw upon others the burden of the task on whichthey defaulted, and expect others to understand the unintelligible.The number of people they victimize, the extent of the torture they impose onmerciful, conscientious men who struggle to understand them, the despair ofthose whom they drive to the notion that life is incomprehensible andirrational, cannot be computed.It should not be necessary to say it, but today it is: anyone who wants to beunderstood, has to make damn sure that he has made himself intelligible.This is the moral principle that Hank Rearden glimpsed and should have actedupon at once.It is only with a person’s conscious mind that one can deal, and it is only withhis conscious mind that one can be concerned. The unprocessed chaos inside hisbrain, his unidentified feelings, his unnamed urges, his unformulated wishes,his unadmitted fears, his unknown motives, and the entire cesspool he has madeof his stagnant subconscious are of no interest, significance, or concern toanyone outside a therapist’s office.The visible image of an “unprocessed” mentality is offered by non-objective art.Its practitioners announce that they have failed to digest their perceptualdata, that they have failed to reach the conceptual or fully conscious level ofdevelopment, and that they offer you the raw material of their subconscious,whose mystery is for you to interpret.There is no great mystery about it.The mind is a processing organ; so is the stomach. If a stomach fails in itsfunction, it throws up; its unprocessed material is vomit.So is the unprocessed material emitted by a mind."},{"pageContent":"6Altruism as Appeasementby Ayn RandThis article was published in The Objectivist, January 1966.In March 1962, on the occasion of giving a lecture at M.I.T., I met a youngstudent who was earnestly, intelligently concerned with opposing the trend tocollectivism. I asked him his views on why so many of today’s youngintellectuals were becoming “liberals.” He could not give me a full answer. Buta few weeks later, he wrote me a remarkable letter.He explained that he had given a great deal of thought to my question and hadreached certain conclusions. The majority of college students, he wrote, do notchoose to think; they accept the status quo, conform to the prescribed code ofvalues, and evade the responsibility of independent thought. “In adopting thisattitude, they are encouraged by teachers who inspire imitation, rather thancreation.”But there are a few who are not willing to renounce their rational faculty.“They are the intellectuals—and they are the outsiders. Their willingness tothink makes them shine forth as a threat to the stagnant security of thelevelers in which they are immersed. They are teased and rejected by theirschool-mates. An immense amount of faith in oneself and a rational philosophicalbasis are required to set oneself against all that society has ever taught....The man who preaches individual integrity, pride, and self-esteem is todayvirtually nonexistent. Far more common is the man who, driven by the youngadult’s driving need for acceptance, has compromised. And here is the key—[theresult of] the compromise is the liberal.“The man who sets himself against society by seeking to be rational is almostcertain to succumb to the extent of accepting a strong guilt complex. He isdeclared ‘guilty’ by his rejection of the omnipresent ’equality in mediocrity’doctrine of today.... So the intellectual, to atone for a false guilt, becomestoday’s liberal. He proclaims loudly the brotherhood of all men. He seeks toserve his escapist brothers by guaranteeing them their desire for socialsecurity. He sanctions their mediocrity, he works for their welfare, above allhe essentially seeks their approval—to atone for the guilt that they have thrustupon him in the guise of an absolute moral system which is not open toquestion.”This young man deserves credit for an extraordinary psychologicalperceptiveness. But the situation he describes is not new; it is as old asaltruism; nor is it confined to “liberals.”Shortly after receiving that letter, I met a distinguished historian, a man ofgreat intellect and scholarship, an advocate of capitalism, who was then in hislate seventies. I had been puzzled by the fact that in his many works, therigorous logic of his arguments was inexplicably contradicted and undercut byhis acceptance of “the common good” as the criterion of morality—and I asked himhis reasons. “Oh, one must say that to the masses,” he answered, “otherwise,they won’t accept capitalism.”Between these two extremes of age—from college years to the culmination of alifetime’s struggle—lies a silent psychological horror story. It is the story ofmen who spend their lives apologizing for their own intelligence.The following pattern does not enmesh all men of superior mental endowment; somemanage to escape it; but in our anti-rational culture, it strangles too many ofthem.By the time he reaches college, a bright, sensitive, precociously observantyouth has acquired the sense of being trapped in a nightmare universe where heis resented not for his flaws, but for his greatest attribute: his intelligence.It is merely a sense, not a firm conviction; no teenager can draw such aconclusion with certainty or fully believe so enormous an evil. He senses onlythat he is “different,” in some way which he cannot define—that he does not getalong with people, for some reason which he cannot name—that he wants tounderstand things and issues, big issues, about which no one else seems to care.His first year in college is, usually, his psychological killer. He had expectedcollege to be a citadel of the intellect where he would find answers, knowledge,meaning, and, above all, some companions to share his interest in ideas. Hefinds none of it. One or two teachers may live up to his hope (though they aregrowing rarer year by year). But as to intellectual companionship, he finds thesame gang he had met in kindergarten, in playgrounds, and in vacant lots: aleering, screeching, aggressively mindless gang playing the same games, with alatinized jargon replacing the mud pies and baseball bats.There are many wrong decisions he can make at this cross-roads, but thedeadliest—psychologically, intellectually, and morally—is the attempt to jointhe gang at the price of selling his soul to uninterested buyers. It is anattempt to apologize for his intellectual concerns and to escape from theloneliness of a thinker by professing that his thinking is dedicated to somesocial-altruistic goal. It is an attempt that amounts to the wordless equivalentof the plea: “I’m not an outsider! I’m your friend! Please forgive me for usingmy mind—I’m using it only in order to serve you!”Whatever remnants of personal value he may preserve after a deal of that kind,self-esteem is not one of them.Such decisions are seldom, if ever, made consciously. They are made gradually,by subconscious emotional motivation and semiconscious rationalization. Altruismoffers an arsenal of such rationalizations: if an unformed adolescent can tellhimself that his cowardice is humanitarian love, that his subservience isunselfishness, that his moral treason is spiritual nobility, he is hooked. Bythe time he is old enough to know better, the erosion of his self-esteem is suchthat he dares not face or reexamine the issue.Some degree of social metaphysics [secondhandedness] is almost always involvedin the psychology of such a man, but it is hard to tell whether it led to orresulted from his surrender. In either case, his basic motivation is differentand, in a certain sense, worse. Basically, a social metaphysician is motivatedby the desire to escape the responsibility of independent thought, and hesurrenders the mind he is afraid to use, preferring to follow the judgments ofothers. But an intellectual appeaser surrenders morality, the realm of values,in order to be permitted to use his mind. The degree of self-abasement isgreater; the implicit view of values—as irrelevant to the mind—is disastrous;the implicit view of the mind—as functioning by permission of the mindless—isunspeakable. (Nor does the appeaser often care to speak about it.)There are as many variants of the consequences as there are men who commit thisparticular type of moral treason. But certain scars of psychological deformitycan be observed in most of them as their common symptoms.Humanitarian love is what the altruist-appeaser never achieves. Instead, hissalient characteristic is a mixture of bitter contempt and intense, profoundhatred for mankind, a hatred impervious to reason. He regards men as evil bynature, he complains about their congenital stupidity, mediocrity, depravity—yetslams his mind ferociously shut to any argument that challenges his estimate.His view of the people at large is a nightmare image—the image of a mindlessbrute endowed with some inexplicably omnipotent power—and he lives in terror ofthat image, yet resists any attempt to revise it.If questioned, he can give no grounds for his view. Intellectually, he admitsthat the average man is not a murderous brute ready to attack him at any moment;emotionally, he keeps feeling the brute’s presence behind every corner.An accomplished young scientist once told me that he was not afraid ofgangsters, but waiters and gas-station attendants filled him with terror, eventhough he could not say what it was he expected them to do to him. An elderly,extremely successful businessman told me that he divided people into threeclasses according to their intelligence: the above average, the average, and thebelow average; he did not mind the first two classes, but those of below averageintelligence threw him into uncontrollable panic. He had spent his lifeexpecting a bloody uprising of brutes who would seize, loot, wreck, andslaughter everything in sight; no, he was not a “conservative”; he was a“liberal.”There is an element of truth in that image of the brute: not factual truth, butpsychological truth, not about people at large, but about the man who fearsthem. The brute is the frozen embodiment of mankind as projected by the emotionsof an adolescent appeaser. The brute’s omnipotent power to perpetrate someunimaginable horror is merely an adult’s rationalization; physical violence isnot what he fears. But his terror is real: a monster that had the power to makehim surrender his mind is, indeed, a terrifying evil. And the deepest, theunconfessed source of his terror lies in the fact that the surrender was notdemanded or extorted—that the monster was the victim’s own creation.This is the reason why the appeaser has a vested interest in maintaining hisbelief in the brute’s existence: even a life of terror, with the excuse that hecould not help it, is preferable to facing the full enormity of the fact that hewas not robbed of self-esteem, but threw it away—and that his chronic sense ofguilt does not come from the spurious sin of possessing intelligence, but fromthe actual crime of having betrayed it.A corollary symptom, in most intellectual appeasers, is the “elite” premise—thedogmatic, unshakable belief that “the masses don’t think,” that men areimpervious to reason, that thinking is the exclusive prerogative of a small,“chosen” minority.In the field of politics, this leads the more aggressive type of appeasers, the“liberals,” to the belief in rule by physical force, to the doctrine that peopleare unfit for freedom and should be ruled—“for their own good”—by a dictatorshipof the “elite.” Hence the craving of such “liberals” for governmentalrecognition, and their extreme susceptibility to bribes by any strong-armgovernment, foreign or domestic, in the form of minor jobs, loud titles,official honors or simply dinner invitations. Hence the tolerant sympathy ofsuch “liberals” for the regimes of Soviet Russia or Red China, and theirappalling indifference to the wholesale atrocities of those countries.The more timorous type of appeasers, the “conservatives,” take a different line:they share the notion of an intellectual “elite” and, therefore, they discardintellectuality as numerically unimportant, and they concentrate on cajoling thebrute (“the masses”) with baby talk—with vapid slogans, flattering bromides,folksy speeches in two-syllable words, on the explicit premise that reason doesnot work, that the brute must be won through appeals to his emotions and must,somehow, be fooled or cheated into taking the right road.Both groups believe that dictatorships are “practical”—the “liberals” boldly andopenly, the “conservatives” fearfully. Behind the ineffectual, half-hearted,apologetic attempts of the “conservatives” to defend freedom, lies the oftenconfessed belief that the struggle is futile, that free enterprise is doomed.Why? The unconfessed answer is: Because men are brutes.Moral cowardice is the necessary consequence of discarding morality asinconsequential. It is the common symptom of all intellectual appeasers. Theimage of the brute is the symbol of an appeaser’s belief in the supremacy ofevil, which means—not in conscious terms, but in terms of his quaking, cringingblinding panic—that when his mind judges a thing to be evil, his emotionsproclaim its power, and the more evil, the more powerful.To an appeaser, the self-assertive confidence of the good is a reproach, athreat to his precarious pseudo-self-esteem, a disturbing phenomenon from auniverse whose existence he cannot permit himself to acknowledge—and hisemotional response is a nameless resentment. The self-assertive confidence ofthe evil is a metaphysical confirmation, the sign of a universe in which hefeels at home—and his emotional response is bitterness, but obedience. Somedictators—who boastfully stress their reign of terror, such as Hitler andStalin—count on this kind of psychology. There are people on whom it works.Moral cowardice is fear of upholding the good because it is good, and fear ofopposing the evil because it is evil. The next step leads to opposing the goodin order to appease the evil, and rushing out to seek the evil’s favor. Butsince no mind can fully hide this policy from itself, and no form ofpseudo-self-esteem can disguise it for long, the next step is to pounce uponevery possible or impossible chance to blacken the nature of the good and towhitewash the nature of the evil.Such is the relationship of mind to values—and such is the fate of those whosought to preserve their intellect by dispensing with morality.The appeaser’s inner state is revealed in the field of esthetics. His sense oflife dominates modern art and literature: the cult of depravity—the monotonousprojection of cosmic terror, guilt, impotence, misery, doom—the compulsivepreoccupation with the study of homicidal maniacs, a preoccupation resemblingthe mentality of a superstitious savage who fashions a voodoo doll in the beliefthat to reproduce is to master.This does not mean that all the practitioners of modern art or modern politicsare men who betrayed their own intelligence: most of them had nothing to betray.But it does mean that such practices would not have spread without the sanctionof the intellectual traitors—and that they brought their own nightmare universeinto reality by creating a cultural bandwagon for pretentious mediocrities andworse.Not all of the intellectual appeasers reach the public arena. A great many ofthem perish on the way, torn by their inner conflicts, paralyzed by aninsufficient capacity to evade, peter ing out in hopeless lethargy after abrilliantly promising start. A great many others drag themselves on, by anexcruciating psychological effort, functioning at a small fraction of theirpotential. The cost of this type of appeasement—in frustrated, hampered,crippled, or stillborn talent—can never be computed.An appeaser’s professional success or failure, as well as the degree of hisprecarious psychological adjustment, depends on the slowness or speed of aprocess common to all appeasers: the erosion of his sense of values. Therenunciation of values—the acceptance of an irrational morality—was the specificform of his surrender. The pretense at any belief in altruism vanishes from hismind in a very few years, and there is nothing left to replace it: hisindependent capacity to value has been repressed—and his fear of the brute makesthe pursuit of values seem hopelessly impractical. What sets in, thereafter, isthe dry rot of cynicism—like a kind of premature senility of the spirit—a thincoating of belligerent amorality over a swamp of lifeless resignation. Theresult is a muted, impoverished, extinguished personality, the impersonalpersonality of a man with an ever shrinking range of concern, with nothing toseek, to achieve, to admire or oppose, and—since self-assertion is the assertionof one’s values—with no self to assert. One of the bitter penalties of theappeasers is that even the most brilliant of them turn out, as persons, to beconventional, empty, dull.If their initial crime was the desire to be “one of the boys,” this is the wayin which they do succeed.Their ultimate penalty is still worse. A wrong premise does not merely fail, itachieves its own opposite. After years of intellectual faking, diluting,corner-cutting—in order to smuggle his ideas past an imaginary censor, in orderto placate irrationality, stupidity, dishonesty, prejudice, malice, orvulgarity—the appeaser’s own mind assumes the standards of those he professes todespise. A mind cannot maintain a double standard of judgment indefinitely (ifat all). Any man who is willing to speak or write “down,” i.e., to thinkdown—who distorts his own ideas in order to accommodate the mindless, whosubordinates truth to fear—becomes eventually indistinguishable from the hackswho cater to an alleged “public taste.” He joins the hordes who believe that themind is impotent, that reason is futile, that ideas are only means of foolingthe masses (i.e., that ideas are important to the unthinking, but the thinkersknow better)—the vast, stagnant underworld of anti-intellectuality. Such is thedead end of the road he has chosen to take, he who had started out as aself-sacrificial priest of the intellect.Hatred for reason is hatred for intelligence; today’s culture is saturated withboth. It is the ultimate product of generations of appeasers, past andpresent—of men who, fearing an imaginary brute, upheld and perpetuated theirrational, inhuman, brutalizing morality of altruism.No, men are not brutes; neither are they all independent thinkers. The majorityof men are not intellectual initiators or originators; they accept what theculture offers them. It is not that they don’t think; it is that they don’tsustain their thinking consistently, as a way of life, and that their abstractrange is limited. To what extent they are stunted by the anti-rationalinfluences of our cultural traditions, is hard to say; what is known, however,is that the majority of men use only a small part of their potentialintellectual capacity.The truly and deliberately evil men are a very small minority; it is theappeaser who unleashes them on mankind; it is the appeaser’s intellectualabdication that invites them to take over. When a culture’s dominant trend isgeared to irrationality, the thugs win over the appeasers. When intellectualleaders fail to foster the best in the mixed, unformed, vacillating character ofpeople at large, the thugs are sure to bring out the worst. When the ablest menturn into cowards, the average men turn into brutes.No, the average man is not morally innocent. But the best proof of hisnon-brutality, of his helpless, confused, inarticulate longing for truth, for anintelligible, rational world—and of his response to it, when given a chance hecannot create on his own—is the fact that no dictatorship has ever lastedwithout establishing censorship.No, it is not the intelligent man’s moral obligation to serve as the leader orteacher of his less endowed brothers. His foremost moral obligation is topreserve the integrity of his mind and of his self-esteem—which means: to beproud of his intelligence—regardless of their approval or disapproval. No matterhow hard this might be in a corrupt age like ours, he has, in fact, noalternative. It is his only chance at a world where intelligence can function,which means: a world where he—and, incidentally, they—can survive."},{"pageContent":"7The Question of Scholarshipsby Ayn RandThis article was published in The Objectivist, June 1966.Many students of Objectivism are troubled by a certain kind of moral dilemmaconfronting them in today’s society. [I am] frequently asked the questions: “Isit morally proper to accept scholarships, private or public?” and: “Is itmorally proper for an advocate of capitalism to accept a government researchgrant or a government job?”I shall hasten to answer: “Yes”—then proceed to explain and qualify it. Thereare many confusions on these issues, created by the influence and implicationsof the altruist morality.1. There is nothing wrong in accepting private scholarships. The fact that a manhas no claim on others (i.e., that it is not their moral duty to help him andthat he cannot demand their help as his right) does not preclude or prohibitgood will among men and does not make it immoral to offer or to acceptvoluntary, non-sacrificial assistance.It is altruism that has corrupted and perverted human benevolence by regardingthe giver as an object of immolation and the receiver as a helplessly miserableobject of pity who holds a mortgage on the lives of others—a doctrine which isextremely offensive to both parties, leaving men no choice but the roles ofsacrificial victim or moral cannibal. A man of self-esteem can neither offerhelp nor accept it on such terms.As a consequence, when people need help, the best of them (those who need itthrough no fault of their own) often prefer to starve rather than acceptassistance—while the worst of them (the professional parasites) run riot andcash in on it to the full. (For instance, the student “activists” who, notsatisfied with free education, demand ownership of the university as well.)To view the question in its proper perspective, one must begin by rejectingaltruism’s terms and all of its ugly emotional aftertaste—then take a fresh lookat human relationships. It is morally proper to accept help, when it is offerednot as a moral duty, but as an act of good will and generosity, when the givercan afford it (i.e., when it does not involve self-sacrifice on his part), andwhen it is offered in response to the receiver’s virtues, not in response to hisflaws, weaknesses, or moral failures, and not on the ground of his need as such.Scholarships are one of the clearest categories of this proper kind of help.They are offered to assist ability, to reward intelligence, to encourage thepursuit of knowledge, to further achievement—not to support incompetence.If a brilliant child’s parents cannot send him through college (or if he has noparents), it is not a moral default on their part or his. It is not the fault of“society,” of course, and he cannot demand the right to be educated at someoneelse’s expense; he must be prepared to work his way through school, ifnecessary. But this is the proper area for voluntary assistance. If some privateperson or organization offers to help him, in recognition of his ability, andthus to save him years of struggle—he has the moral right to accept.The value of scholarships is that they offer an ambitious youth a gift of timewhen he needs it most: at the beginning.(The fact that in today’s moral atmosphere, those who give or distributescholarships are often guilty of injustices and of altruistic motives, does notalter the principle involved. It represents their failure to live up to theprinciple; their integrity is not the recipient’s responsibility and does notaffect his right to accept the scholarship in good faith.)2. A different principle and different considerations are involved in the caseof public (i.e., governmental) scholarships. The right to accept them rests onthe right of the victims to the property (or some part of it) which was takenfrom them by force.The recipient of a public scholarship is morally justified only so long as heregards it as restitution and opposes all forms of welfare statism. Those whoadvocate public scholarships have no right to them; those who oppose them have.If this sounds like a paradox, the fault lies in the moral contradictions ofwelfare statism, not in its victims.Since there is no such thing as the right of some men to vote away the rights ofothers, and no such thing as the right of the government to seize the propertyof some men for the unearned benefit of others—the advocates and supporters ofthe welfare state are morally guilty of robbing their opponents, and the factthat the robbery is legalized makes it morally worse, not better. The victims donot have to add self-inflicted martyrdom to the injury done to them by others;they do not have to let the looters profit doubly, by letting them distributethe money exclusively to the parasites who clamored for it. Whenever thewelfare-state laws offer them some small restitution, the victims should takeit.It does not matter, in this context, whether a given individual has or has notpaid an amount of taxes equal to the amount of the scholarship he accepts.First, the sum of his individual losses cannot be computed; this is part of thewelfare-state philosophy, which treats everyone’s income as public property.Second, if he has reached college age, he has undoubtedly paid—in hiddentaxes—much more than the amount of the scholarship. Or, if his parents cannotafford to pay for his education, consider what taxes they have paid, directly orindirectly, during the twenty years of his life—and you will see that ascholarship is too pitifully small even to be called a restitution.Third—and most important—the young people of today are not responsible for theimmoral state of the world into which they were born. Those who accept thewelfare-statist ideology assume their share of the guilt when they do so. Butthe anti-collectivists are innocent victims who face an impossible situation: itis welfare statism that has almost destroyed the possibility of working one’sway through college. It was difficult but possible some decades ago; today, ithas become a process of close-to-inhuman torture. There are virtually nopart-time jobs that pay enough to support oneself while going to school; thealternative is to hold a full-time job and to attend classes at night—whichtakes eight years of unrelenting twelve-to-sixteen-hour days, for a four-yearcollege course. If those responsible for such conditions offer the victim ascholarship, his right to take it is incontestable—and it is too pitifully smallan amount even to register on the scales of justice, when one considers all theother, the nonmaterial, nonamendable injuries he has suffered.The same moral principles and considerations apply to the issue of acceptingsocial security, unemployment insurance, or other payments of that kind. It isobvious, in such cases, that a man receives his own money which was taken fromhim by force, directly and specifically, without his consent, against his ownchoice. Those who advocated such laws are morally guilty, since they assumed the“right” to force employers and unwilling coworkers. But the victims, who opposedsuch laws, have a clear right to any refund of their own money—and they wouldnot advance the cause of freedom if they left their money, unclaimed, for thebenefit of the welfare-state administration.3. The same moral principles and considerations apply to the issue of governmentresearch grants.The growth of the welfare state is approaching the stage where virtually theonly money available for scientific research will be government money. (Thedisastrous effects of this situation and the disgraceful state ofgovernment-sponsored science are apparent already, but that is a differentsubject. We are concerned here only with the moral dilemma of scientists.)Taxation is destroying private resources, while government money is flooding andtaking over the field of research.In these conditions, a scientist is morally justified in accepting governmentgrants—so long as he opposes all forms of welfare statism. As in the case ofscholarship recipients, a scientist does not have to add self-martyrdom to theinjustices he suffers. And he does not have to surrender science to the Dr.Floyd Ferrises [this refers to a villain in Atlas Shrugged who is a governmentscientist].Government research grants, for the most part, have no strings attached, i.e.,no controls over the scientist’s intellectual and professional freedom (atleast, not yet). When and if the government attempts to control the scientificand/or political views of the recipients of grants, that will be the time formen of integrity to quit. At present, they are still free to work—but, more thanany other professional group, they should be on guard against the gradual,insidious growth of pressures to conform and of tacit control-by-intimidation,which are implicit in such conditions.4. The same moral principles and considerations apply to the issue of takinggovernment jobs.The growth of government institutions has destroyed an incalculable number ofprivate jobs and opportunities for private employment. This is more apparent insome professions (as, for instance, teaching) than in others, but the octopus ofthe “public sector” is choking and draining the “private sector” in virtuallyevery line of work. Since men have to work for a living, the opponents of thewelfare state do not have to condemn themselves to the self-martyrdom of aself-restricted labor market—particularly when so many private employers are inthe vanguard of the advocates and profiteers of welfare statism.There is, of course, a limitation on the moral right to take a government job:one must not accept any job that demands ideological services, i.e., any jobthat requires the use of one’s mind to compose propaganda material in support ofwelfare statism—or any job in a regulatory administrative agency enforcingimproper, non-objective laws. The principle here is as follows: it is proper totake the kind of work which is not wrong per se, except that the governmentshould not be doing it, such as medical services; it is improper to take thekind of work that nobody should be doing, such as is done by the F.T.C., theF.C.C., etc.But the same limitation applies to a man’s choice of private employment: a manis not responsible for the moral or political views of his employers, but hecannot accept a job in an undertaking which he considers immoral, or in whichhis work consists specifically of violating his own convictions, i.e., ofpropagating ideas he regards as false or evil.5. The moral principle involved in all the above issues consists, in essence, ofdefining as clearly as possible the nature and limits of one’s ownresponsibility, i.e., the nature of what is or is not in one’s power.The issue is primarily ideological, not financial. Minimizing the financialinjury inflicted on you by the welfare-state laws, does not constitute supportof welfare statism (since the purpose of such laws is to injure you) and is notmorally reprehensible. Initiating, advocating, or expanding such laws is.In a free society, it is immoral to denounce or oppose that from which onederives benefits—since one’s associations are voluntary. In a controlled ormixed economy, opposition becomes obligatory—since one is acting under force,and the offer of benefits is intended as a bribe.So long as financial considerations do not alter or affect your convictions, solong as you fight against welfare statism (and only so long as you fight it) andare prepared to give up any of its momentary benefits in exchange for repeal andfreedom—so long as you do not sell your soul (or your vote)—you are morally inthe clear. The essence of the issue lies in your own mind and attitude.It is a hard problem, and there are many situations so ambiguous and so complexthat no one can determine what is the right course of action. That is one of theevils of welfare statism: its fundamental irrationality and immorality force meninto contradictions where no course of action is right.The ultimate danger in all these issues is psychological: the danger of lettingyourself be bribed, the danger of a gradual, imperceptible, subconsciousdeterioration leading to compromise, evasion, resignation, submission. Intoday’s circumstances, a man is morally in the clear only so long as he remainsintellectually incorruptible. Ultimately, these problems are a test—a hardtest—of your own integrity. You are its only guardian. Act accordingly."},{"pageContent":"8Of Living Deathby Ayn RandThis lecture on the July 29, 1968 papal encyclical Humanae Vitae was deliveredat the Ford Hall Forum on December 8, 1968. Because The Objectivist was behindschedule at the time, the lecture was published in the issues datedSeptember-November 1968.Those who wish to observe the role of philosophy in human existence may see itdramatized on a grand (and gruesome) scale in the conflict splitting theCatholic church today.Observe, in that conflict, men’s fear of identifying or challengingphilosophical fundamentals: both sides are willing to fight in silent confusion,to stake their beliefs, their careers, their reputations on the outcome of abattle over the effects of an unnamed cause. One side is composed predominantlyof men who dare not name the cause; the other, of men who dare not discover it.Both sides claim to be puzzled and disappointed by what they regard as acontradiction in the two recent encyclicals of Pope Paul VI. The so-calledconservatives (speaking in religious, not political, terms) were dismayed by theencyclical Populorum Progressio (On the Development of Peoples)—which advocatedglobal statism—while the so-called liberals hailed it as a progressive document.Now the conservatives are hailing the encyclical Humanae Vitae (Of HumanLife)—which forbids the use of contraceptives—while the liberals are dismayed byit. Both sides seem to find the two documents inconsistent. But theinconsistency is theirs, not the pontiff’s. The two encyclicals are strictly,flawlessly consistent in respect to their basic philosophy and ultimate goal:both come from the same view of man’s nature and are aimed at establishing thesame conditions for his life on earth. The first of these two encyclicalsforbade ambition, the second forbids enjoyment; the first enslaved man to thephysical needs of others, the second enslaves him to the physical capacities ofhis own body; the first damned achievement, the second damns love.The doctrine that man’s sexual capacity belongs to a lower or animal part of hisnature has had a long history in the Catholic church. It is the necessaryconsequence of the doctrine that man is not an integrated entity, but a beingtorn apart by two opposite, antagonistic, irreconcilable elements: his body,which is of this earth, and his soul, which is of another, supernatural realm.According to that doctrine, man’s sexual capacity—regardless of how it isexercised or motivated, not merely its abuses, not unfastidious indulgence orpromiscuity, but the capacity as such—is sinful or depraved.For centuries, the dominant teaching of the church held that sexuality is evil,that only the need to avoid the extinction of the human species grants sex thestatus of a necessary evil and, therefore, only procreation can redeem or excuseit. In modern times, many Catholic writers have denied that such is the church’sview. But what is its view? They did not answer.Let us see if we can find the answer in the encyclical Humanae Vitae.Dealing with the subject of birth control, the encyclical prohibits all forms ofcontraception (except the so-called “rhythm method”). The prohibition is total,rigid, unequivocal. It is enunciated as a moral absolute.Bear in mind what this subject entails. Try to hold an image of horror spreadacross space and time—across the entire globe and through all the centuries—theimage of parents chained, like beasts of burden, to the physical needs of agrowing brood of children—young parents aging prematurely while fighting alosing battle against starvation—the skeletal hordes of unwanted children bornwithout a chance to live—the unwed mothers slaughtered in the unsanitary dens ofincompetent abortionists—the silent terror hanging, for every couple, over everymoment of love. If one holds this image while hearing that this nightmare is notto be stopped, the first question one will ask is: Why? In the name of humanity,one will assume that some inconceivable, but crucially important reason mustmotivate any human being who would seek to let that carnage go on uncontested.So the first thing one will look for in the encyclical, is that reason, ananswer to that Why?“The problem of birth,” the encyclical declares, “like every other problemregarding human life, is to be considered ... in the light of an integral visionof man and of his vocation, not only his natural and earthly, but also hissupernatural and eternal, vocation.” [Paragraph 7]And:A reciprocal act of love, which jeopardizes the responsibility to transmit lifewhich God the Creator, according to particular laws, inserted therein, is incontradiction with the design constitutive of marriage, and with the will of theauthor of life. To use this divine gift, destroying, even if only partially, itsmeaning and its purpose, is to contradict the nature both of man and of womanand of their most intimate relationship, and therefore it is to contradict alsothe plan of God and His will. [13]And this is all. In the entire encyclical, this is the only reason given (butrepeated over and over again) why men should transform their highest experienceof happiness—their love—into a source of lifelong agony. Do so—the encyclicalcommands—because it is God’s will.I, who do not believe in God, wonder why those who do would ascribe to him sucha sadistic design, when God is supposed to be the archetype of mercy, kindness,and benevolence. What earthly goal is served by that doctrine? The answer runslike a hidden thread through the encyclical’s labyrinthian convolutions,repetitions, and exhortations.In the darker corners of that labyrinth, one finds some snatches of argument, inalleged support of the mystic axiom, but these arguments are embarrassinglytransparent equivocations. For instance:... to make use of the gift of conjugal love while respecting the laws of thegenerative process means to acknowledge oneself not to be the arbiter of thesources of human life, but rather the minister of the design established by theCreator. In fact, just as man does not have unlimited dominion over his body ingeneral, so also, with particular reason, he has no such dominion over hiscreative faculties as such, because of their intrinsic ordination toward raisingup life, of which God is the principle. [13]What is meant here by the words “man does not have unlimited dominion over hisbody in general”? The obvious meaning is that man cannot change the metaphysicalnature of his body; which is true. But man has the power of choice in regard tothe actions of his body—specifically, in regard to “his creative faculties,” andthe responsibility for the use of these particular faculties is most cruciallyhis. “To acknowledge oneself not to be the arbiter of the sources of human life”is to evade and to default on that responsibility. Here again, the sameequivocation or package deal is involved. Does man have the power to determinethe nature of his procreative faculty? No. But granted that nature, is he thearbiter of bringing a new human life into existence? He most certainly is, andhe (with his mate) is the sole arbiter of that decision—and the consequences ofthat decision affect and determine the entire course of his life.This is a clue to that paragraph’s intention: if man believed that so crucial achoice as procreation is not in his control, what would it do to his controlover his life, his goals, his future?The passive obedience and helpless surrender to the physical functions of one’sbody, the necessity to let procreation be the inevitable result of the sexualact, is the natural fate of animals, not of men. In spite of its concern withman’s higher aspirations, with his soul, with the sanctity of married love—it isto the level of animals that the encyclical seeks to reduce man’s sex life, infact, in reality, on earth. What does this indicate about the encyclical’s viewof sex?Anticipating certain obvious objections, the encyclical declares:Now, some may ask: In the present case, is it not reasonable in manycircumstances to have recourse to artificial birth control if, thereby, wesecure the harmony and peace of the family, and better conditions for theeducation of children already born? To this question it is necessary to replywith clarity: The church is the first to praise and recommend the interventionof intelligence in a function which so closely associates the rational creaturewith his Creator; but she affirms that this must be one with respect for theorder established by God. [16]To what does this subordinate man’s intelligence? If intelligence is forbiddento consider the fundamental problems of man’s existence, forbidden to alleviatehis suffering, what does this indicate about the encyclical’s view of man—and ofreason?History can answer this particular question. History has seen a period ofapproximately ten centuries, known as the Dark and Middle Ages, when philosophywas regarded as “the handmaiden of theology,” and reason as the humblesubordinate of faith. The results speak for themselves.It must not be forgotten that the Catholic church has fought the advance ofscience since the Renaissance: from Galileo’s astronomy, to the dissection ofcorpses, which was the start of modern medicine, to the discovery of anesthesiain the nineteenth century, the greatest single discovery in respect to theincalculable amount of terrible suffering it has spared mankind. The Catholicchurch has fought medical progress by means of the same argument: that theapplication of knowledge to the relief of human suffering is an attempt tocontradict God’s design. Specifically in regard to anesthesia during childbirth,the argument claimed that since God intended woman to suffer while giving birth,man has no right to intervene. (!)The encyclical does not recommend unlimited procreation. It does not object toall means of birth control—only to those it calls “artificial” (i.e.,scientific). It does not object to man “contradicting God’s will” nor to manbeing “the arbiter of the sources of human life,” provided he uses the means itendorses: abstinence.Discussing the issue of “responsible parenthood,” the encyclical states: “Inrelation to physical, economic, psychological and social conditions, responsibleparenthood is exercised, either by the deliberate and generous decision to raisea numerous family, or by the decision, made for grave motives and with duerespect for the moral law, to avoid for the time being, or even for anindeterminate period, a new birth.” [10] To avoid—by what means? By abstainingfrom sexual intercourse.The lines preceding that passage are: “In relation to the tendencies of instinctor passion, responsible parenthood means the necessary dominion which reason andwill must exercise over them.” [10] How a man is to force his reason to obey anirrational injunction and what it would do to him psychologically, is notmentioned.Further on, under the heading “Mastery of Self,” the encyclical declares:To dominate instinct by means of one’s reason and free will undoubtedly requiresascetic practices ... Yet this discipline which is proper to the purity ofmarried couples, far from harming conjugal love, rather confers on it a higherhuman value. It demands continual effort yet, thanks to its beneficentinfluence, husband and wife fully develop their personalities, being enrichedwith spiritual values.... Such discipline ... helps both parties to drive outselfishness, the enemy of true love: and deepens their sense of responsibility.[21]If you can bear that style of expression being used to discuss suchmatters—which I find close to unbearable—and if you focus on the meaning, youwill observe that the “discipline,” the “continual effort,” the “beneficentinfluence,” the “higher human value” refer to the torture of sexual frustration.No, the encyclical does not say that sex as such is evil; it merely says thatsexual abstinence in marriage is “a higher human value.” What does this indicateabout the encyclical’s view of sex—and of marriage?Its view of marriage is fairly explicit. “[Conjugal] love is first of all fullyhuman, that is to say, of the senses and of the spirit at the same time. It isnot, then, a simple transport of instinct and sentiment, but also, andprincipally, an act of the free will, intended to endure and to grow by means ofthe joys and sorrows of daily life, in such a way that husband and wife becomeone only heart and one only soul, and together attain their human perfection.“Then this love is total; that is to say, it is a very special form of personalfriendship, in which husband and wife generously share everything, without unduereservations or selfish calculations.” [9]To classify the unique emotion of romantic love as a form of friendship is toobliterate it: the two emotional categories are mutually exclusive. The feelingof friendship is asexual; it can be experienced toward a member of one’s ownsex.There are many other indications of this kind scattered through the encyclical.For instance: “These acts, by which husband and wife are united in chasteintimacy and by means of which human life is transmitted, are, as the councilrecalled, ‘noble and worthy.’ ” [11] It is not chastity that one seeks in sex,and to describe it this way is to emasculate the meaning of marriage.There are constant references to a married couple’s duties, which have to beconsidered in the context of the sexual act—“duties toward God, towardthemselves, toward the family and toward society.” [10] If there is any oneconcept which, when associated with sex, would render a man impotent, it is theconcept of “duty.”To understand the full meaning of the encyclical’s view of sex, I shall ask youto identify the common denominator—the common intention—of the followingquotations:[The church‘s] teaching, often set forth by the Magisterium, is founded upon theinseparable connection, willed by God and unable to be broken by man on his owninitiative, between the two meanings of the conjugal act: the unitive meaningand the procreative meaning. Indeed, by its intimate structure, the conjugalact, while most closely uniting husband and wife, capacitates them for thegeneration of new lives. [12]“[The conjugal acts] do not cease to be lawful if, for causes independent of thewill of husband and wife, they are foreseen to be infecund.” [11, emphasisadded.]The church forbids: “every action which, either in anticipation of the conjugalact or its accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences,proposes, whether as an end or as a means, to render procreation impossible.”[14]The church does not object to “an impediment to procreation” which might resultfrom the medical treatment of a disease, “provided such impediment is not, forwhatever motive, directly willed.” [15, emphasis added.]And finally, the church “teaches that each and every marriage act (‘quilibetmatrimonii usus,’) must remain open to the transmission of life.” [11]What is the common denominator of these statements? It is not merely the tenetthat sex as such is evil, but deeper: it is the commandment by means of whichsex will become evil, the commandment which, if accepted, will divorce sex fromlove, will castrate man spiritually and will turn sex into a meaninglessphysical indulgence. That commandment is: man must not regard sex as an end initself, but only as a means to an end.Procreation and “God’s design” are not the major concern of that doctrine; theyare merely primitive rationalizations to which man’s self-esteem is to besacrificed. If it were otherwise, why the stressed insistence on forbidding manto impede procreation by his conscious will and choice? Why the tolerance of theconjugal acts of couples who are infecund by nature rather than by choice? Whatis so evil about that choice? There is only one answer: that choice rests on acouple’s conviction that the justification of sex is their own enjoyment. Andthis is the view which the church’s doctrine is intent on forbidding at anyprice.That such is the doctrine’s intention, is supported by the church’s stand on theso-called “rhythm method” of birth control, which the encyclical approves andrecommends.The church is coherent with herself when she considers recourse to the infecundperiods to be licit, while at the same time condemning, as being always illicit,the use of means directly contrary to fecundation, even if such use is inspiredby reasons which may appear honest and serious.... It is true that, in the oneand the other case, the married couple are concordant in the positive will ofavoiding children for plausible reasons, seeking the certainty that offspringwill not arrive; but it is also true that only in the former case are they ableto renounce the use of marriage in the fecund periods when, for just motives,procreation is not desirable, while making use of it during infecund periods tomanifest their affection and to safeguard their mutual fidelity. By so doing,they give proof of a truly and integrally honest love. [16]On the face of it, this does not make any kind of sense at all—and the churchhas often been accused of hypocrisy or compromise because it permits this veryunreliable method of birth control while forbidding all others. But examine thatstatement from the aspect of its intention, and you will see that the church isindeed “coherent with herself,” i.e., consistent.What is the psychological difference between the “rhythm method” and other meansof contraception? The difference lies in the fact that, using the “rhythmmethod,” a couple cannot regard sexual enjoyment as a right and as an end initself. With the help of some hypocrisy, they merely sneak and snatch somepersonal pleasure, while keeping the marriage act “open to the transmission oflife,” thus acknowledging that childbirth is the only moral justification of sexand that only by the grace of the calendar are they unable to comply.This acknowledgment is the meaning of the encyclical’s peculiar implication that“to renounce the use of marriage in the fecund periods” is, somehow, a virtue (arenunciation which proper methods of birth control would not require). What elsebut this acknowledgment can be the meaning of the otherwise unintelligiblestatement that by the use of the “rhythm method” a couple “give proof of a trulyand integrally honest love”?There is a widespread popular notion to the effect that the Catholic church’smotive in opposing birth control is the desire to enlarge the Catholicpopulation of the world. This may be superficially true of some people’smotives, but it is not the full truth. If it were, the Catholic church wouldforbid the “rhythm method” along with all other forms of contraception. And,more important, the Catholic church would not fight for anti-birth-controllegislation all over the world: if numerical superiority were its motive, itwould forbid birth control to its own followers and let it be available to otherreligious groups.The motive of the church’s doctrine on this issue is, philosophically, muchdeeper than that and much worse; the goal is not metaphysical or political orbiological, but psychological: if man is forbidden to regard sexual enjoyment asan end in itself, he will not regard love or his own happiness as an end initself; if so, then he will not regard his own life as an end in itself; if so,then he will not attain self-esteem.It is not against the gross, animal, physicalistic theories or uses of sex thatthe encyclical is directed, but against the spiritual meaning of sex in man’slife. (By “spiritual” I mean pertaining to man’s consciousness.) It is notdirected against casual, mindless promiscuity, but against romantic love.To make this clear, let me indicate, in brief essentials, a rational view of therole of sex in man’s existence.Sex is a physical capacity, but its exercise is determined by man’s mind—by hischoice of values, held consciously or subconsciously. To a rational man, sex isan expression of self-esteem—a celebration of himself and of existence. To theman who lacks self-esteem, sex is an attempt to fake it, to acquire itsmomentary illusion.Romantic love, in the full sense of the term, is an emotion possible only to theman (or woman) of unbreached self-esteem: it is his response to his own highestvalues in the person of another—an integrated response of mind and body, of loveand sexual desire. Such a man (or woman) is incapable of experiencing a sexualdesire divorced from spiritual values.I quote from Atlas Shrugged: “The men who think that wealth comes from materialresources and has no intellectual root or meaning, are the men who think—for thesame reason—that sex is a physical capacity which functions independently ofone’s mind, choice or code of values.... But, in fact, a man’s sexual choice isthe result and the sum of his fundamental convictions.... Sex is the mostprofoundly selfish of all acts, an act which [man] cannot perform for any motivebut his own enjoyment—just try to think of performing it in a spirit of selflesscharity!—an act which is not possible in self-abasement, only inself-exaltation, only in the confidence of being desired and being worthy ofdesire.... Love is our response to our highest values—and can be nothingelse.... Only the man who extols the purity of a love devoid of desire, iscapable of the depravity of a desire devoid of love.”In other words, sexual promiscuity is to be condemned not because sex as such isevil, but because it is good—too good and too important to be treated casually.In comparison to the moral and psychological importance of sexual happiness, theissue of procreation is insignificant and irrelevant, except as a deadlythreat—and God bless the inventors of the Pill!The capacity to procreate is merely a potential which man is not obligated toactualize. The choice to have children or not is morally optional. Nature endowsman with a variety of potentials—and it is his mind that must decide whichcapacities he chooses to exercise, according to his own hierarchy of rationalgoals and values. The mere fact that man has the capacity to kill does not meanthat it is his duty to become a murderer; in the same way, the mere fact thatman has the capacity to procreate does not mean that it is his duty to commitspiritual suicide by making procreation his primary goal and turning himselfinto a stud-farm animal.It is only animals that have to adapt themselves to their physical backgroundand to the biological functions of their bodies. Man adapts his physicalbackground and the use of his biological faculties to himself—to his own needsand values. That is his distinction from all other living species.To an animal, the rearing of its young is a matter of temporary cycles. To man,it is a lifelong responsibility—a grave responsibility that must not beundertaken causelessly, thoughtlessly, or accidentally.In regard to the moral aspects of birth control, the primary right involved isnot the “right” of an unborn child, or of the family, or of society, or of God.The primary right is one which—in today’s public clamor on the subject—few, ifany, voices have had the courage to uphold: the right of man and woman to theirown life and happiness—the right not to be regarded as the means to any end.Man is an end in himself. Romantic love—the profound, exalted, lifelong passionthat unites his mind and body in the sexual act—is the living testimony to thatprinciple.This is what the encyclical seeks to destroy; or, more precisely, to obliterate,as if it does not and cannot exist.Observe the encyclical’s contemptuous references to sexual desire as “instinct”or “passion,” as if “passion” were a pejorative term. Observe the falsedichotomy offered; man’s choice is either mindless, “instinctual” copulation—ormarriage, an institution presented not as a union of passionate love, but as arelationship of “chaste intimacy,” of “special personal friendship,” of“discipline proper to purity,” of unselfish duty, of alternating bouts withfrustration and pregnancy, and of such unspeakable,Grade-B-movie-folks-next-door kind of boredom that any semi-living man wouldhave to run, in self-preservation, to the nearest whorehouse.No, I am not exaggerating. I have reserved—as my last piece of evidence on thequestion of the encyclical’s view of sex—the paragraph in which the coils andveils of euphemistic equivocation got torn, somehow, and the naked truth showsthrough.It reads as follows:Upright men can even better convince themselves of the solid grounds on whichthe teaching of the church in this field is based, if they care to reflect uponthe consequences of methods of artificial birth control. Let them consider,first of all, how wide and easy a road would thus be opened up toward conjugalinfidelity and the general lowering of morality. Not much experience is neededin order to know human weakness, and to understand that men—especially theyoung, who are so vulnerable on this point—have need of encouragement to befaithful to the moral law, so that they must not be offered some easy means ofeluding its observance. It is also to be feared that the man, growing used tothe employment of anticonceptive practices, may finally lose respect for thewoman and, no longer caring for her physical and psychological equilibrium, maycome to the point of considering her as a mere instrument of selfish enjoyment,and no longer as his respected and beloved companion. [17]I cannot conceive of a rational woman who does not want to be precisely aninstrument of her husband’s selfish enjoyment. I cannot conceive of what wouldhave to be the mental state of a woman who could desire or accept the positionof having a husband who does not derive any selfish enjoyment from sleeping withher. I cannot conceive of anyone, male or female, capable of believing thatsexual enjoyment would destroy a husband’s love and respect for his wife—butregarding her as a brood mare and himself as a stud, would cause him to love andrespect her.Actually, this is too evil to discuss much further.But we must also take note of the first part of that paragraph. It states that“artificial” contraception would open “a wide and easy road toward conjugalinfidelity.” Such is the encyclical’s actual view of marriage: that maritalfidelity rests on nothing better than fear of pregnancy. Well, “not muchexperience is needed in order to know” that that fear has never been much of adeterrent to anyone.Now observe the inhuman cruelty of that paragraph’s reference to the young.Admitting that the young are “vulnerable on this point,” and declaring that theyneed “encouragement to be faithful to the moral law,” the encyclical forbidsthem the use of contraceptives, thus making it cold-bloodedly clear that itsidea of moral encouragement consists of terror—the sheer, stark terror of youngpeople caught between their first experience of love and the primitive brutalityof the moral code of their elders. Surely the authors of the encyclical cannotbe ignorant of the fact that it is not the young chasers or the teenage slutswho would be the victims of a ban on contraceptives, but the innocent young whorisk their lives in the quest for love—the girl who finds herself pregnant andabandoned by her boyfriend, or the boy who is trapped into a premature, unwantedmarriage. To ignore the agony of such victims—the countless suicides, the deathsat the hands of quack abortionists, the drained lives wasted under the doubleburden of a spurious “dishonor” and of an unwanted child—to ignore all that inthe name of “the moral law” is to make a mockery of morality.Another, and truly incredible mockery, leers at us from that same paragraph 17.As a warning against the use of contraceptives, the encyclical states:Let it be considered also that a dangerous weapon would thus be placed in thehands of those public authorities who take no heed of moral exigencies.... Whowill stop rulers from favoring, from even imposing upon their peoples, if theywere to consider it necessary, the method of contraception which they judge tobe most efficacious? In such a way men, wishing to avoid individual, family orsocial difficulties encountered in the observance of the divine law, would reachthe point of placing at the mercy of the intervention of public authorities themost personal and most reserved sector of conjugal intimacy.No public authorities have attempted—and no private groups have urged them toattempt—to force contraception on Catholics. But when one remembers that it isthe Catholic church that has initiated anti-birth-control legislation the worldover and thus has placed “at the mercy of the intervention of public authoritiesthe most personal and most reserved sector of conjugal intimacy”—that statementbecomes outrageous. Were it not for the politeness one should preserve towardthe papal office, one would call that statement a brazen effrontery.This leads us to the encyclical’s stand on the issue of abortion, and to anotherexample of inhuman cruelty. Compare the coiling sentimentality of theencyclical’s style when it speaks of “conjugal love” to the clear, brusque,military tone of the following: “We must once again declare that the directinterruption of the generative process already begun, and, above all, directlywilled and procured abortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to beabsolutely excluded as licit means of regulating birth.” [14, emphasis added.]After extolling the virtue and sanctity of motherhood, as a woman’s highestduty, as her “eternal vocation,” the encyclical attaches a special risk of deathto the performance of that duty—an unnecessary death, in the presence of doctorsforbidden to save her, as if a woman were only a screaming huddle of infectedflesh who must not be permitted to imagine that she has the right to live.And this policy is advocated by the encyclical’s supporters in the name of theirconcern for “the sanctity of life” and for “rights”—the rights of the embryo.(!)I suppose that only the psychological mechanism of projection can make itpossible for such advocates to accuse their opponents of being “anti-life.”Observe that the men who uphold such a concept as “the rights of an embryo,” arethe men who deny, negate, and violate the rights of a living human being.An embryo has no rights. Rights do not pertain to a potential, only to an actualbeing. A child cannot acquire any rights until it is born. The living takeprecedence over the not yet living (or the unborn).Abortion is a moral right—which should be left to the sole discretion of thewoman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to beconsidered. Who can conceivably have the right to dictate to her whatdisposition she is to make of the functions of her own body? The Catholic churchis responsible for this country’s disgracefully barbarian anti-abortion laws,which should be repealed and abolished.The intensity of the importance that the Catholic church attaches to itsdoctrine on sex may be gauged by the enormity of the indifference to humansuffering expressed in the encyclical. Its authors cannot be ignorant of thefact that man has to earn his living by his own effort, and that there is nocouple on earth—on any level of income, in any country, civilized or not—whowould be able to support the number of children they would produce if theyobeyed the encyclical to the letter.If we assume the richest couple and include time off for the periods of“purity,” it will still be true that the physical and psychological strain oftheir “vocation” would be so great that nothing much would be left of them,particularly of the mother, by the time they reached the age of forty.Consider the position of an average American couple. What would be their life,if they succeeded in raising, say, twelve children, by working from morning tillnight, by running a desperate race with the periodic trips to maternity wards,with rent bills, grocery bills, clothing bills, pediatricians’ bills,strained-vegetables bills, school book bills, measles, mumps, whooping cough,Christmas trees, movies, ice cream cones, summer camps, party dresses, dates,draft cards, hospitals, colleges—with every salary raise of the industrious,hardworking father mortgaged and swallowed before it is received—what would theyhave gained at the end of their life except the hope that they might be able topay their cemetery bills, in advance?Now consider the position of the majority of mankind, who are barely able tosubsist on a level of prehistorical poverty. No strain, no backbreaking effortof the ablest, most conscientious father can enable him properly to feed onechild—let alone an open-end progression. The unspeakable misery of stunted,disease-eaten, chronically undernourished children, who die in droves before theage of ten, is a matter of public record. Pope Paul VI—who closes his encyclicalby mentioning his title as earthly representative of “the God of holiness andmercy”—cannot be ignorant of these facts; yet he is able to ignore them.The encyclical brushes this issue aside in a singularly irresponsible manner:We are well aware of the serious difficulties experienced by public authoritiesin this regard, especially in the developing countries. To their legitimatepreoccupations we devoted our encyclical letter Populorum Progressio.... Theonly possible solution to this question is one which envisages the social andeconomic progress both of individuals and of the whole of human society, andwhich respects and promotes true human values.Neither can one, without grave injustice, consider Divine Providence to beresponsible for what depends, instead, on a lack of wisdom in government, on aninsufficient sense of social justice, on selfish monopolization or again onblameworthy indolence in confronting the efforts and the sacrifices necessary toinsure the raising of living standards of a people and of all its sons. [23]The encyclical Populorum Progressio advocated the abolition of capitalism andthe establishment of a totalitarian, socialist-fascist, global state—in whichthe right to “the minimum essential for life” is to be the ruling principle and“all other rights whatsoever, including those of property and of free commerce,are to be subordinated to this principle.” (For a discussion of that encyclical,see my article “Requiem for Man” in [Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal].)If, today, a struggling, desperate man, somewhere in Peru or China or Egypt orNigeria, accepted the commandments of the present encyclical and strove to bemoral, but saw his horde of children dying of hunger around him, the onlypractical advice the encyclical would give him is: Wait for the establishment ofa collectivist world state. What, in God’s name, is he to do in the meantime?Philosophically, however, the reference to the earlier encyclical, PopulorumProgressio, is extremely significant: it is as if Pope Paul VI were pointing tothe bridge between the two documents and to their common base.The global state advocated in Populorum Progressio is a nightmare utopia whereall are enslaved to the physical needs of all; its inhabitants are selflessrobots, programmed by the tenets of altruism, without personal ambition, withoutmind, pride, or self-esteem. But self-esteem is a stubborn enemy of all utopiasof that kind, and it is doubtful whether mere economic enslavement would destroyit wholly in men’s souls. What Populorum Progressio was intended to achieve fromwithout, in regard to the physical conditions of man’s existence, Humanae Vitaeis intended to achieve from within, in regard to the devastation of man’sconsciousness.“Don’t allow men to be happy,” said Ellsworth Toohey in The Fountainhead.“Happiness is self-contained and self-sufficient.... Happy men are free men. Sokill their joy in living.... Make them feel that the mere fact of a personaldesire is evil.... Unhappy men will come to you. They’ll need you. They’ll comefor consolation, for support, for escape. Nature allows no vacuum. Empty man’ssoul—and the space is yours to fill.”Deprived of ambition, yet sentenced to endless toil; deprived of rewards, yetordered to produce; deprived of sexual enjoyment, yet commanded to procreate;deprived of the right to live, yet forbidden to die—condemned to this state ofliving death, the graduates of the encyclical Humanae Vitae will be ready tomove into the world of Populorum Progressio; they will have no other place togo.“If some man like Hugh Akston,” said Hank Rearden in Atlas Shrugged, “had toldme, when I started, that by accepting the mystics’ theory of sex I was acceptingthe looters’ theory of economics, I would have laughed in his face. I would notlaugh at him now.”It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that in the subconscious hierarchy ofmotives of the men who wrote these two encyclicals, the second, Humanae Vitae,was merely the spiritual means to the first, Populorum Progressio, which was thematerial end. The motives, I believe, were the reverse: Populorum Progressio wasmerely the material means to Humanae Vitae, which was the spiritual end.“... with our predecessor Pope John XXIII,” says Pope Paul VI in Humanae Vitae,“we repeat: no solution to these difficulties is acceptable ‘which does violenceto man’s essential dignity’ and is based only ’on an utterly materialisticconception of man himself and of his life.‘ ” [23, emphasis added.] They meanit—though not exactly in the way they would have us believe.In terms of reality, nothing could be more materialistic than an existencedevoted to feeding the whole world and procreating to the limit of one’scapacity. But when they say “materialistic,” they mean pertaining to man’s mindand to this earth; by “spiritual,” they mean whatever is anti-man, anti-mind,anti-life, and, above all, anti-possibility of human happiness on earth.The ultimate goal of these encyclicals’ doctrine is not the material advantagesto be gained by the rulers of a global slave state; the ultimate goal is thespiritual emasculation and degradation of man, the extinction of his love oflife, which Humanae Vitae is intended to accomplish, and Populorum Progressiomerely to embody and perpetuate.The means of destroying man’s spirit is unearned guilt.What I said in “Requiem for Man” about the motives of Populorum Progressioapplies as fully to Humanae Vitae, with only a minor paraphrase pertaining toits subject. “But, you say, the encyclical’s ideal will not work? It is notintended to work. It is not intended to [achieve human chastity or sexualvirtue]; it is intended to induce guilt. It is not intended to be accepted andpracticed; it is intended to be accepted and broken—broken by man’s ‘selfish’desire to [love], which will thus be turned into a shameful weakness. Men whoaccept as an ideal an irrational goal which they cannot achieve, never lifttheir heads thereafter—and never discover that their bowed heads were the onlygoal to be achieved.”I said, in that article, that Populorum Progressio was produced by the sense oflife not of an individual, but of an institution—whose driving power anddominant obsession is the desire to break man’s spirit. Today, I say it, withclearer evidence, about the encyclical Humanae Vitae.This is the fundamental issue which neither side of the present conflict iswilling fully to identify.The conservatives or traditionalists of the Catholic church seem to know, nomatter what rationalizations they propound, that such is the meaning andintention of their doctrine. The liberals seem to be more innocent, at least inthis issue, and struggle not to have to face it. But they are the supporters ofglobal statism and, in opposing Humanae Vitae, they are merely fighting theright battle for the wrong reasons. If they win, their social views will stilllead them to the same ultimate results.The rebellion of the victims, the Catholic laymen, has a touch of healthyself-assertiveness; however, if they defy the encyclical and continue topractice birth control, but regard it as a matter of their own weakness andguilt, the encyclical will have won: this is precisely what it was intended toaccomplish.The American bishops of the Catholic church, allegedly struggling to find acompromise, issued a pastoral letter declaring that contraception is anobjective evil, but individuals are not necessarily guilty or sinful if theypractice it—which amounts to a total abdication from the realm of morality andcan lead men only to a deeper sense of guilt.Such is the tragic futility of attempting to fight the existential consequencesof a philosophical issue, without facing and challenging the philosophy thatproduced them.This issue is not confined to the Catholic church, and it is deeper than theproblem of contraception; it is a moral crisis approaching a climax. The core ofthe issue is Western civilization’s view of man and of his life. The essence ofthat view depends on the answer to two interrelated questions: Is man (man theindividual) an end in himself?—and: Does man have the right to be happy on thisearth?Throughout its history, the West has been torn by a profound ambivalence onthese questions: all of its achievements came from those periods when men actedas if the answer were “Yes”—but, with exceedingly rare exceptions, theirspokesmen, the philosophers, kept proclaiming a thunderous “No,” in countlessforms.Neither an individual nor an entire civilization can exist indefinitely with anunresolved conflict of that kind. Our age is paying the penalty for it. And itis our age that will have to resolve it."},{"pageContent":"9Religion Versus Americaby Leonard PeikoffThis lecture was delivered at the Ford Hall Forum on April 20, 1986, andpublished in The Objectivist Forum, June 1986.Aspecter is haunting America—the specter of religion. This, borrowing KarlMarx’s literary style, is my theme tonight.Where do I see religion? The outstanding political fact of the 1980s is the riseof the New Right, and its penetration of the Republican party under PresidentReagan. The bulk of the New Right consists of Protestant Fundamentalists,typified by the Moral Majority. These men are frequently allied on basic issueswith other religiously oriented groups, including conservative Catholics of theWilliam F. Buckley ilk and neoconservative Jewish intellectuals of theCommentary magazine variety.All these groups observed the behavior of the New Left awhile back andconcluded, understandably enough, that the country was perishing. They saw theliberals’ idealization of drugged hippies and nihilistic yippies; they saw theproliferation of pornography, of sexual perversion, of noisy Lib and Power gangsrunning to the Democrats to demand ever more outrageous handouts and quotas;they heard the routine leftist deprecation of the United States and the routinecounsel to appease Soviet Russia—and they concluded, with good reason, that whatthe country was perishing from was a lack of values, of ethical absolutes, ofmorality.Values, the Left retorted, are subjective; no lifestyle (and no country) isbetter or worse than any other; there is no absolute right or wronganymore—unless, the liberals added, you believe in some outmoded ideology likereligion. Precisely, the New Rightists reply; that is our whole point. There areabsolute truths and absolute values, they say, which are the key to thesalvation of our great country; but there is only one source of such values: notman or this earth or the human brain, but the Deity as revealed in scripture.The choice we face, they conclude, is the skepticism, decadence, and statism ofthe Democrats, or morality, absolutes, Americanism, and their only possiblebase: religion—old-time, Judeo-Christian religion.“Religious America is awakening, perhaps just in time for our country’s sake,”said Mr. Reagan in 1980. “In a struggle against totalitarian tyranny,traditional values based on religious morality are among our greateststrengths.”1 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en1]“Religious views,” says Congressman Jack Kemp, “lie at the heart of ourpolitical system. The ‘inalienable rights’ to life, liberty, and the pursuit ofhappiness are based on the belief that each individual is created by God and hasa special value in His eyes.... Without a common belief in the one God whocreated us, there could be no freedom and no recourse if a majority were to seekto abrogate the rights of the minority.”2[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en2]Or, as Education Secretary William Bennett sums up this viewpoint: “Our valuesas a free people and the central values of the Judeo-Christian tradition areflesh of the flesh and blood of the blood.”3[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en3]Politicians in America have characteristically given lip service to theplatitudes of piety. But the New Right is different. These men seem to meantheir religiosity, and they are dedicated to implementing their religious creedspolitically; they seek to make these creeds the governing factor in the realm ofour personal relations, our art and literature, our clinics and hospitals, andthe education of our youth. Whatever else you say about him, Mr. Reagan hasdelivered handsomely on one of his campaign promises: he has given the adherentsof religion a prominence in setting the national agenda that they have not hadin this country for generations.This defines our subject for tonight. It is the new Republican inspiration andthe deeper questions it raises. Is the New Right the answer to the New Left?What is the relation between the Judeo-Christian tradition and the principles ofAmericanism? Are Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp, as their admirers declare, leadingus to a new era of freedom and capitalism—or to something else?In discussing these issues, I am not going to say much about the New Right assuch; its specific beliefs are widely known. Instead, I want to examine themovement within a broader, philosophical context. I want to ask: what isreligion? and then: how does it function in the life of a nation, any nation,past or present? These, to be sure, are very abstract questions, but they areinescapable. Only when we have considered them can we go on to judge therelation between a particular religion, such as Christianity, and a particularnation, such as America.Let us begin with a definition. What is religion as such? What is the essencecommon to all its varieties, Western and Oriental, which distinguishes it fromother cultural phenomena?Religion involves a certain kind of outlook on the world and a consequent way oflife. In other words, the term “religion” denotes a type (actually, a precursor)of philosophy. As such, a religion must include a view of knowledge (which isthe subject matter of the branch of philosophy called epistemology) and a viewof reality (metaphysics). Then, on this foundation, a religion builds a code ofvalues (ethics). So the question becomes: what type of philosophy constitutes areligion?The Oxford English Dictionary defines “religion” as “a particular system offaith and worship,” and goes on, in part: “Recognition on the part of man ofsome higher unseen power as having control of his destiny, and as being entitledto obedience, reverence, and worship.”The fundamental concept here is “faith.” “Faith” in this context means belief inthe absence of evidence. This is the essential that distinguishes religion fromscience. A scientist may believe in entities which he cannot observe, such asatoms or electrons, but he can do so only if he proves their existencelogically, by inference from the things he does observe. A religious man,however, believes in “some higher unseen power” which he cannot observe andcannot logically prove. As the whole history of philosophy demonstrates, nostudy of the natural universe can warrant jumping outside it to a supernaturalentity. The five arguments for God offered by the greatest of all religiousthinkers, Thomas Aquinas, are widely recognized by philosophers to be logicallydefective; they have each been refuted many times, and they are the bestarguments that have ever been offered on this subject.Many philosophers indeed now go further: they point out that God not only is anarticle of faith, but that this is essential to religion. A God susceptible ofproof, they argue, would actually wreck religion. A God open to human logic, toscientific study, to rational understanding, would have to be definable,delimited, finite, amenable to human concepts, obedient to scientific law, andthus incapable of miracles. Such a thing would be merely one object among otherswithin the natural world; it would be merely another datum for the scientist,like some new kind of galaxy or cosmic ray, not a transcendent power running theuniverse and demanding man’s worship. What religion rests on is a true God,i.e., a God not of reason, but of faith.If you want to concretize the idea of faith, I suggest that you visit, of allplaces, the campuses of the Ivy League, where, according to The New York Times,a religious revival is now occurring. Will you find students eagerly discussingproofs or struggling to reinterpret the ancient myths of the Bible into somekind of consistency with the teachings of science? On the contrary. Thestudents, like their parents, are insisting that the Bible be accepted asliteral truth, whether it makes logical sense or not. “Students today are morereconciled to authority,” one campus religious official notes. “There is lessneed for students to sit on their own mountaintop”—i.e., to exercise their ownindependent minds and judgment. Why not? They are content simply to believe. AtColumbia University, for instance, a new student group gathers regularly not toanalyze, but “to sing, worship, and speak in tongues.” “People are coming backto religion in a way that some of us once went to the counterculture,” says achaplain at Columbia.4 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en4] This isabsolutely true. And note what they are coming back to: not reason or logic, butfaith.“Faith” names the method of religion, the essence of its epistemology; and, asthe Oxford English Dictionary states, the belief in “some higher unseen power”is the basic content of religion, its distinctive view of reality, itsmetaphysics. This higher power is not always conceived as a personal God; somereligions construe it as an impersonal dimension of some kind. The commondenominator is the belief in the supernatural—in some entity, attribute, orforce transcending and controlling this world in which we live.According to religion, this supernatural power is the essence of the universeand the source of all value. It constitutes the realm of true reality and ofabsolute perfection. By contrast, the world around us is viewed as onlysemi-real and as inherently imperfect, even corrupt, in any event metaphysicallyunimportant. According to most religions, this life is a mere episode in thesoul’s journey to its ultimate fulfillment, which involves leaving behindearthly things in order to unite with Deity. As a pamphlet issued by a Catholicstudy group expresses this point: Man “cannot achieve perfection or truehappiness in this life here on earth. He can only achieve this in the eternityof the next life after death.... Therefore ... what a person has or lacks interms of worldly possessions, privileges or advantages is not important.”5[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en5] In New Delhi a few months ago,expressing this viewpoint, Pope John Paul II urged on the Indians a life of“asceticism and renunciation.” In Quebec some time earlier, he decried “thefascination the modern world feels for productivity, profit, efficiency, speed,and records of physical strength.” Too many men, he explained in Luxembourg,“consciously organize their way of life merely on the basis of the realities ofthis world without any heed for God and His wishes.”6[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en6]This brings us to religious ethics, the essence of which also involves faith,faith in God’s commandments. Virtue, in this view, consists of obedience. Virtueis not a matter of achieving your desires, whatever they may be, but of seekingto carry out God’s; it is not the pursuit of egoistic goals, whether rational ornot, but the willingness to renounce your own goals in the service of the Lord.What religion counsels is the ethics of self-transcendence, self-abnegation,self-sacrifice.What single attitude most stands in the way of this ethics, according toreligious writers? The sin of pride. Why is pride a sin? Because man, in thisview, is a metaphysically defective creature. His intellect is helpless in thecrucial questions of life. His will has no real power over his existence, whichis ultimately controlled by God. His body lusts after all the temptations of theflesh. In short, man is weak, ugly, and low, a typical product of the low,unreal world in which he lives. Your proper attitude toward yourself, therefore,as to this world, should be a negative one. For earthly creatures such as youand I, “Know thyself” means “Know thy worthlessness”; simple honesty entailshumility, self-castigation, even self-disgust.Religion means orienting one’s existence around faith, God, and a life ofservice—and correspondingly of downgrading or condemning four key elements:reason, nature, the self, and man. Religion cannot be equated with values ormorality or even philosophy as such; it represents a specific approach tophilosophic issues, including a specific code of morality.What effect does this approach have on human life? We do not have to answer bytheoretical deduction, because Western history has been a succession ofreligious and unreligious periods. The modern world, including America, is aproduct of two of these periods: of Greco-Roman civilization and of medievalChristianity. So, to enable us to understand America, let us first look at thehistorical evidence from these two periods; let us look at their stand onreligion and at the practical consequences of this stand. Then we will have notrouble grasping the base and essence of the United States.Ancient Greece was not a religious civilization, not on any of the counts Imentioned. The gods of Mount Olympus were like a race of elder brothers to man,mischievous brothers with rather limited powers; they were closer to StevenSpielberg’s ExtraTerrestrial visitor than to anything we would call “God.” Theydid not create the universe or shape its laws or leave any message ofrevelations or demand a life of sacrifice. Nor were they taken very seriously bythe leading voices of the culture, such as Plato and Aristotle. From start tofinish, the Greek thinkers recognized no sacred texts, no infallible priesthood,no intellectual authority beyond the human mind; they allowed no room for faith.Epistemologically, most were staunch individualists who expected each man tograsp the truth by his own powers of sensory observation and logical thought.For details, I refer you to Aristotle, the preeminent representative of theGreek spirit.Metaphysically, as a result, Greece was a secular culture. Men generallydismissed or downplayed the supernatural; their energies were devoted to thejoys and challenges of life. There was a shadowy belief in immortality, but thedominant attitude to it was summed up by Homer, who has Achilles declare that hewould rather be a slave on earth than “bear sway among all the dead that bedeparted.”The Greek ethics followed from this base. All the Greek thinkers agreed thatvirtue is egoistic. The purpose of morality, in their view, is to enable a manto achieve his own fulfillment, his own happiness, by means of a properdevelopment of his natural faculties—above all, of his cognitive faculty, hisintellect. And as to the Greek estimate of man—look at the statues of the Greekgods, made in the image of human strength, human grace, human beauty; and readAristotle’s account of the virtue—yes, the virtue—of pride.I must note here that in many ways Plato was an exception to the generalirreligion of the Greeks. But his ideas were not dominant until much later. WhenPlato’s spirit did take over, the Greek approach had already died out. Whatreplaced it was the era of Christianity.Intellectually speaking, the period of the Middle Ages was the exact opposite ofclassical Greece. Its leading philosophic spokesman, Augustine, held that faithwas the basis of man’s entire mental life. “I do not know in order to believe,”he said, “I believe in order to know.” In other words, reason is nothing but ahandmaiden of revelation; it is a mere adjunct of faith, whose task is toclarify, as far as possible, the dogmas of religion. What if a dogma cannot beclarified? So much the better, answered an earlier Church father, Tertullian.The truly religious man, he said, delights in thwarting his reason; that showshis commitment to faith. Thus Tertullian’s famous answer, when asked about thedogma of God’s self-sacrifice on the cross: “Credo quia absurdum” (“I believe itbecause it is absurd”).As to the realm of physical nature, the medievals characteristically regarded itas a semi-real haze, a transitory stage in the divine plan, and a troublesomeone at that, a delusion and a snare—a delusion because men mistake it forreality, a snare because they are tempted by its lures to jeopardize theirimmortal souls. What tempts them is the prospect of earthly pleasure.What kind of life, then, does the immortal soul require on earth? Self-denial,asceticism, the resolute shunning of this temptation. But isn’t it unfair to askmen to throw away their whole enjoyment of life? Augustine’s answer is: whatelse befits creatures befouled by original sin, creatures who are, as he put it,“crooked and sordid, bespotted and ulcerous”?What were the practical results—in the ancient world, then in the medieval—ofthese two opposite approaches to life?Greece created philosophy, logic, science, mathematics, and a magnificent,man-glorifying art; it gave us the base of modern civilization in every field;it taught the West how to think. In addition, through its admirers in ancientRome, which built on the Greek intellectual base, Greece indirectly gave us therule of law and the first idea of man’s rights (this idea was originated by thepagan Stoics). Politically, the ancients never conceived a society offull-fledged individual liberty; no nation achieved that before the UnitedStates. But the ancients did lay certain theoretical bases for the concept ofliberty; and in practice, both in some of the Greek city-states and inrepublican Rome, large numbers of men at various times were at least relativelyfree. They were incomparably more free than their counterparts ever had been inthe religious cultures of ancient Egypt and its equivalents.What were the practical results of the medieval approach? The Dark Ages weredark on principle. Augustine fought against secular philosophy, science, art; heregarded all of it as an abomination to be swept aside; he cursed science inparticular as “the lust of the eyes.” Unlike many Americans today, who drive tochurch in their Cadillac or tape their favorite reverend on the VCR so as not tointerrupt their tennis practice, the medievals took religion seriously. Theyproceeded to create a society that was antimaterialistic and anti-intellectual.I do not have to remind you of the lives of the saints, who were the heroes ofthe period, including the men who ate only sheep’s gall and ashes, quenchedtheir thirst with laundry water, and slept with a rock for their pillow. Thesewere men resolutely defying nature, the body, sex, pleasure, all the snares ofthis life—and they were canonized for it, as, by the essence of religion, theyshould have been. The economic and social results of this kind of value codewere inevitable: mass stagnation and abject poverty, ignorance and massilliteracy, waves of insanity that swept whole towns, a life expectancy in theteens. “Woe unto ye who laugh now,” the Sermon on the Mount had said. Well, theywere pretty safe on this count. They had precious little to laugh about.What about freedom in this era? Study the existence of the feudal serf tied forlife to his plot of ground, his noble overlord, and the all-encompassing decreesof the Church. Or, if you want an example closer to home, jump several centuriesforward to the American Puritans, who were a medieval remnant transplanted to avirgin continent, and who proceeded to establish a theocratic dictatorship incolonial Massachusetts. Such a dictatorship, they declared, was necessitated bythe very nature of their religion. You are owned by God, they explained to anypotential dissenter; therefore, you are a servant who must act as your Creator,through his spokesmen, decrees. Besides, they said, you are innately depraved,so a dictatorship of the elect is necessary to ride herd on your viciousimpulses. And, they said, you don’t really own your property either; wealth,like all values, is a gift from Heaven temporarily held in trust, to becontrolled, like all else, by the elect. And if all this makes you unhappy, theyended up, so what? You’re not supposed to pursue happiness in this life anyway.There can be no philosophic breach between thought and action. The consequenceof the epistemology of religion is the politics of tyranny. If you cannot reachthe truth by your own mental powers, but must offer obedient faith to acognitive authority, then you are not your own intellectual master; in such acase, you cannot guide your behavior by your own judgment, either, but must besubmissive in action as well. This is the reason why, historically—as Ayn Randhas pointed out—faith and force are always corollaries; each requires the other.The early Christians did contribute some good ideas to the world, ideas thatproved important to the cause of future freedom. I must, so to speak, give theangels their due. In particular, the idea that man has value as anindividual—that the individual soul is precious—is essentially a Christianlegacy to the West; its first appearance was in the form of the idea that everyman, despite original sin, is made in the image of God (as against thepre-Christian notion that a certain group or nation has a monopoly on humanvalue, while the rest of mankind are properly slaves or mere barbarians). Butnotice a crucial point: this Christian idea, by itself, was historicallyimpotent. It did nothing to unshackle the serfs or stay the Inquisition or turnthe Puritan elders into Thomas Jeffersons. Only when the religious approach lostits power—only when the idea of individual value was able to break free from itsChristian context and become integrated into a rational, secular philosophy—onlythen did this kind of idea bear practical fruit.What—or who—ended the Middle Ages? My answer is: Thomas Aquinas, who introducedAristotle, and thereby reason, into medieval culture. In the thirteenth century,for the first time in a millennium, Aquinas reasserted in the West the basicpagan approach. Reason, he said in opposition to Augustine, does not rest onfaith; it is a self-contained, natural faculty, which works on sense experience.Its essential task is not to clarify revelation, but rather, as Aristotle hadsaid, to gain knowledge of this world. Men, Aquinas declared forthrightly, mustuse and obey reason; whatever one can prove by reason and logic, he said, istrue. Aquinas himself thought that he could prove the existence of God, and hethought that faith is valuable as a supplement to reason. But this did not alterthe nature of his revolution. His was the charter of liberty, the moral andphilosophical sanction, which the West had desperately needed. His message tomankind, after the long ordeal of faith, was in effect: “It is all right. Youdon’t have to stifle your mind anymore. You can think.”The result, in historical short order, was the revolt against the authority ofthe Church, the feudal breakup, the Renaissance. Renaissance means “rebirth,”the rebirth of reason and of man’s concern with this world. Once again, as inthe pagan era, we see secular philosophy, natural science, man-glorifying art,and the pursuit of earthly happiness. It was a gradual, tortuous change, witheach century becoming more worldly than the preceding, from Aquinas to theRenaissance to the Age of Reason to the climax and end of this development: theeighteenth century, the Age of Enlightenment. This was the age in whichAmerica’s founding fathers were educated and in which they created the UnitedStates.The Enlightenment represented the triumph (for a short while anyway) of thepagan Greek, and specifically of the Aristotelian, spirit. Its basic principlewas respect for man’s intellect and, correspondingly, the wholesale dismissal offaith and revelation. Reason the Only Oracle of Man, said Ethan Allen ofVermont, who spoke for his age in demanding unfettered free thought and inridiculing the primitive contradictions of the Bible. “While we are under thetyranny of Priests,” he declared in 1784, “... it ever will be their interest,to invalidate the law of nature and reason, in order to establish systemsincompatible therewith.”7 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en7]Elihu Palmer, another American of the Enlightenment, was even more outspoken.According to Christianity, he writes, God “is supposed to be a fierce,revengeful tyrant, delighting in cruelty, punishing his creatures for the verysins which he causes them to commit; and creating numberless millions ofimmortal souls, that could never have offended him, for the express purpose oftormenting them to all eternity.” The purpose of this kind of notion, he sayselsewhere, “the grand object of all civil and religious tyrants ... has been tosuppress all the elevated operations of the mind, to kill the energy of thought,and through this channel to subjugate the whole earth for their own specialemolument.” “It has hitherto been deemed a crime to think,” he observes, but atlast men have a chance—because they have finally escaped from the “long anddoleful night” of Christian rule, and have grasped instead “the unlimited powerof human reason”—“reason, which is the glory of our nature.”8[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en8]Allen and Palmer are extreme representatives of the Enlightenment spirit,granted; but they are representatives. Theirs is the attitude which was new inthe modern world, and which, in a less inflammatory form, was shared by all thefounding fathers as their basic, revolutionary premise. Thomas Jefferson statesthe attitude more sedately, with less willful provocation to religion, but it isthe same essential attitude. “Fix reason firmly in her seat,” he advises anephew, “and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion. Question withboldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must moreapprove of the homage of reason, than that of blindfolded fear.”9[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en9] Observe the philosophic priorities inthis advice: man’s mind comes first; God is a derivative, if you can prove him.The absolute, which must guide the human mind, is the principle of reason; everyother idea must meet this test. It is in this approach—in this fundamentalrejection of faith—that the irreligion of the Enlightenment lies.The consequence of this approach was the age’s rejection of all the otherreligious priorities. In metaphysics: this world once again was regarded asreal, as important, and as a realm not of miracles, but of impersonal, naturallaw. In ethics: success in this life became the dominant motive; the venerationof asceticism was swept aside in favor of each man’s pursuit of happiness—hisown happiness on earth, to be achieved by his own effort, by self-reliance andself-respect leading to self-made prosperity. But can man really achievefulfillment on earth? Yes, the Enlightenment answered; man has the means, thepotent faculty of intellect, necessary to achieve his goals and values. Man maynot yet be perfect, people said, but he is perfectible; he must be so, becausehe is the rational animal.Such were the watchwords of the period: not faith, God, service, but reason,nature, happiness, man.Many of the founding fathers, of course, continued to believe in God and to doso sincerely, but it was a vestigial belief, a leftover from the past which nolonger shaped the essence of their thinking. God, so to speak, had been kickedupstairs. He was regarded now as an aloof spectator who neither responds toprayer nor offers revelations nor demands immolation. This sort of viewpoint,known as deism, cannot, properly speaking, be classified as a religion. It is astage in the atrophy of religion; it is the step between Christianity andoutright atheism.This is why the religious men of the Enlightenment were scandalized and evenpanicked by the deist atmosphere. Here is the Rev. Peter Clark of Salem, Mass.in 1739: “The former Strictness in Religion, that ... Zeal for the Order andOrdinances of the Gospel, which was so much the Glory of our Fathers, is verymuch abated, yea disrelished by too many: and a Spirit of Licentiousness, andNeutrality in Religion ... so opposite to the Ways of God’s People, doexceedingly prevail in the midst of us.”10[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en10] And here, fifty years later, is theRev. Charles Backus of Springfield, Mass. The threat to divine religion, hesays, is the “indifference which prevails” and the “ridicule.” Mankind, hewarns, is in “great danger of being laughed out of religion.”11[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en11] This was true; these preachers werenot alarmists; their description of the Enlightenment atmosphere is correct.This was the intellectual context of the American Revolution. Point for point,the founding fathers’ argument for liberty was the exact counterpart of thePuritans’ argument for dictatorship—but in reverse, moving from the oppositestarting point to the opposite conclusion. Man, the founding fathers said inessence (with a large assist from Locke and others), is the rational being; noauthority, human or otherwise, can demand blind obedience from such a being—notin the realm of thought or, therefore, in the realm of action, either. By hisvery nature, they said, man must be left free to exercise his reason and then toact accordingly, i.e., by the guidance of his best rational judgment. Becausethis world is of vital importance, they added, the motive of man’s action shouldbe the pursuit of happiness. Because the individual, not a supernatural power,is the creator of wealth, a man should have the right to private property, theright to keep and use or trade his own product. And because man is basicallygood, they held, there is no need to leash him; there is nothing to fear insetting free a rational animal.This, in substance, was the American argument for man’s inalienable rights. Itwas the argument that reason demands freedom. And this is why the nation ofindividual liberty, which is what the United States was, could not have beenfounded in any philosophically different century. It required what theEnlightenment offered: a rational, secular context.When you look for the source of an historic idea, you must consider philosophicessentials, not the superficial statements or errors that people may offer you.Even the most well-meaning men can misidentify the intellectual roots of theirown attitudes. Regrettably, this is what the founding fathers did in one crucialrespect. All men, said Jefferson, are endowed “by their Creator” with certainunalienable rights, a statement that formally ties individual rights to thebelief in God. Despite Jefferson’s eminence, however, his statement (along withits counterparts in Locke and others) is intellectually unwarranted. Theprinciple of individual rights does not derive from or depend on the idea of Godas man’s creator. It derives from the very nature of man, whatever his source ororigin; it derives from the requirements of man’s mind and his survival. Infact, as I have argued, the concept of rights is ultimately incompatible withthe idea of the supernatural. This is true not only logically, but alsohistorically. Through all the centuries of the Dark and Middle Ages, there wasplenty of belief in a Creator; but it was only when religion began to fade thatthe idea of God as the author of individual rights emerged as an historical,nation-shaping force. What then deserves the credit for the new development—theage-old belief or the new philosophy? What is the real intellectual root andprotector of human liberty—God or reason?My answer is now evident. America does rest on a code of values and morality—inthis, the New Right is correct. But, by all the evidence of philosophy andhistory, it does not rest on the values or ideas of religion. It rests on theiropposite.You are probably wondering here: “What about Communism? Isn’t it a logical,scientific, atheistic philosophy, and yet doesn’t it lead straight tototalitarianism?” The short answer to this is: Communism is not an expression oflogic or science, but the exact opposite. Despite all its anti-religiousposturings, Communism is nothing but a modern derivative of religion: it agreeswith the essence of religion on every key issue, then merely gives that essencea new outward veneer or cover-up.The Communists reject Aristotelian logic and Western science in favor of a“dialectic” process; reality, they claim, is a stream of contradictions which isbeyond the power of “bourgeois” reason to understand. They deny the veryexistence of man’s mind, claiming that human words and actions reflect nothingbut the alogical, predetermined churnings of blind matter. They do reject God,but they replace him with a secular stand-in, Society or the State, which theytreat not as an aggregate of individuals, but as an unperceivable, omnipotent,supernatural organism, a “higher unseen power” transcending and dwarfing allindividuals. Man, they say, is a mere social cog atom, whose duty is to reverethis power and to sacrifice every thing in its behalf. Above all, they say, nosuch cog has the right to think for himself; every man must accept the decreesof Society’s leaders, he must accept them because that is the voice of Society,whether he understands it or not. Fully as much as Tertullian, Communism demandsfaith from its followers and subjects, “faith” in the literal, religious senseof the term. On every count, the conclusion is the same: Communism is not a new,rational philosophy; it is a tired, slavishly imitative heir of religion.This is why, so far, Communism has been unable to win out in the West. Unlikethe Russians, we have not been steeped enough in religion—in faith, sacrifice,humility and, therefore, in servility. We are still too rational, toothis-worldly, and too individualistic to submit to naked tyranny. We are stillbeing protected by the fading remnants of our Enlightenment heritage.But we will not be so for long if the New Right has its way.Philosophically, the New Right holds the same fundamental ideas as the NewLeft—its religious zeal is merely a variant of irrationalism and the demand forself-sacrifice—and therefore it has to lead to the same result in practice:dictatorship. Nor is this merely my theoretical deduction. The New Rightiststhemselves announce it openly. While claiming to be the defenders ofAmericanism, their distinctive political agenda is pure statism.The outstanding example of this fact is their insistence that the state prohibitabortion even in the first trimester of pregnancy. A woman, in this view, has noright to her own body or even, the most consistent New Rightists add, to her ownlife; instead, she should be made to sacrifice at the behest of the state, tosacrifice her desires, her life goals, and even her existence in the name of amass of protoplasm which is at most a potential human being, not an actual one.“Abortion,” says Paul Weyrich, Executive Director of the Committee for theSurvival of a Free Congress, “is wrong in all cases. I believe that if you haveto choose between new life and existing life, you should choose new life. Theperson who has had an opportunity to live at least has been given that gift byGod and should make way for a new life on earth.”12[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en12]Another example: men and women, the New Right tells us, should not be free toconduct their sexual or romantic lives in private, in accordance with their ownchoice and values; the law should prohibit any sexual practices condemned byreligion. And: children, we are told, should be indoctrinated withstate-mandated religion at school. For instance, biology texts should berewritten under government tutelage to present the Book of Genesis as ascientific theory on a par with or even superior to the theory of evolution.And, of course, the ritual of prayer must be forced down the children’s throats.Is this not, contrary to the Constitution, a state establishment of religion,and of a controversial, intellectual viewpoint? Not at all, says Jack Kemp. “Ifa prayer is said aloud,” he explains, “it need be no more than a generalacknowledgment of the existence, power, authority, and love of God, theCreator.”13 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en13] That’s all—nothingcontroversial or indoctrinating about that!And: when the students finally do leave school, after all the indoctrination,can they then be trusted to deal with intellectual matters responsibly? No, saysthe New Right. Adults should not be free to write, to publish, or to read,according to their own judgment; literature should be censored by the stateaccording to a religious standard of what is fitting as against obscene.Is this a movement in behalf of Americanism and individual rights? Is it amovement consistent with the principles of the Constitution?“The Constitution established freedom for religion,” says Mr. Kemp, “not fromit”—a sentiment which is shared by President Reagan and by the whole NewRight.14 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en14] What then becomes ofintellectual freedom? Are meetings such as this evening’s deprived ofConstitutional protection, since the viewpoint I am propounding certainly doesnot come under “freedom for religion” ? And what happens when one religious sectconcludes that the statements of another are subversive of true religion? Whodecides which, if either, should be struck down by the standard of “freedom forreligion, not from it”? Can you predict the fate of free thought, and of “life,liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” if Mr. Kemp and associates ever gettheir hands fully on the courts and the Congress?What we are seeing is the medievalism of the Puritans all over again, butwithout their excuse of ignorance. We are seeing it on the part of modernAmericans, who live not before the founding fathers’ heroic experiment inliberty, but after it.The New Right is not the voice of Americanism. It is the voice of thoughtcontrol attempting to take over in this country and pervert and undo the actualAmerican revolution.But, you may say, aren’t the New Rightists at least champions of property rightsand capitalism, as against the economic statism of the liberals? They are not.Capitalism is the separation of state and economics, a condition that none ofour current politicians or pressure groups even dreams of advocating. The NewRight, like all the rest on the political scene today, accepts the welfare-statemixed economy created by the New Deal and its heirs; our conservatives nowmerely haggle on the system’s fringes about a particular regulation or handoutthey happen to dislike. In this matter, the New Right is moved solely by thepower of tradition. These men do not want to achieve any change of basic course,but merely to slow down the march to socialism by freezing the economic statusquo. And even in regard to this highly limited goal, they are disarmed anduseless.If you want to know why, I refer you to the published first drafts of the [1986]pastoral letter of the U.S. Catholic bishops, men who are much more consistentand philosophical than anyone in the New Right. The bishops recommend a giantstep in the direction of socialism. They ask for a vast new government presencein our economic life, overseeing a vast new redistribution of wealth in order toaid the poor, at home and abroad. They ask for it on a single basic ground:consistency with the teachings of Christianity.Some of you may wonder here: “But if the bishops are concerned with the poor,why don’t they praise and recommend capitalism, the great historical engine ofproductivity, which makes everyone richer?” If you think about it, however, youwill see that, valid as this point may be, the bishops cannot accept it.Can they praise the profit motive—while extolling selflessness? Can they commendthe passion to own material property—while declaring that worldly possessionsare not important? Can they urge men to practice the virtues of productivenessand long-range planning—while upholding as the human model the lilies of thefield? Can they celebrate the self-assertive risk taking of theentrepreneur—while teaching that the meek shall inherit the earth? Can theyglorify and liberate the creative ingenuity of the human mind, which is the realsource of material wealth—while elevating faith above reason? The answers areobvious. Regardless of the unthinking pretenses of the New Right, no religion,by its nature, can appeal to or admire the capitalist system; not if thereligion is true to itself. Nor can any religion liberate man’s power to createnew wealth. If, therefore, the faithful are concerned about poverty—as the Bibledemands they be—they have no alternative but to counsel a redistribution ofwhatever wealth already happens to have been produced. The goods, they have tosay, are here. How did they get here? God, they reply, has seen to that; now letmen make sure that His largesse is distributed fairly. Or, as the bishops putit: “The goods of this earth are common property and ... men and women aresummoned to faithful stewardship rather than to selfish appropriation orexploitation of what was destined for all.”15[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#en15]For further details on this point, I refer you to the bishops’ letter; giventheir premises, their argument is unanswerable. If, as the New Right claims,there is scriptural warrant for state control of men’s sexual activities, thenthere is surely much more such warrant for state control of men’s economicactivities. The idea of the Bible (or the “Protestant ethic”) as the base ofcapitalism is ludicrous, both logically and historically.Economically, as in all other respects, the New Right is leading us, admittedlyor not, to the same end as its liberal opponents. By virtue of the movement’sessential premises, it is supporting and abetting the triumph of statism in thiscountry—and, therefore, of Communism in the world at large. When a free nationbetrays its own heritage, it has no heart left, no conviction by means of whichto stand up to foreign aggressors.There was a flaw in the intellectual foundations of America from the start: theattempt to combine the Enlightenment approach in politics with theJudeo-Christian ethics. For a while, the latter element was on the defensive,muted by the eighteenth-century spirit, so that America could gain a foothold,grow to maturity, and become great. But only for a while. Thanks to ImmanuelKant, as I have discussed in my book The Ominous Parallels, the base ofreligion—faith and self-sacrifice--was reestablished at the turn of thenineteenth century. Thereafter, all of modern philosophy embraced collectivism,in the form of socialism, Fascism, Communism, welfare statism. By now, thedistinctive ideas at the base of America have been largely forgotten or sweptaside. They will not be brought back by an appeal to religion.What then is the solution? It is not atheism as such—and I say this even thoughas an Objectivist I am an atheist. “Atheism” is a negative; it means notbelieving in God—which leaves wide open what you do believe in. It is futile tocrusade merely for a negative; the Communists, too, call themselves atheists.Nor is the answer “secular humanism,” about which we often hear today. This termis used so loosely that it is practically contentless; it is compatible with awide range of conflicting viewpoints, including, again, Communism. To combat thedoctrines that are destroying our country, out-of-context terms and ideas suchas these are useless. What we need is an integrated, consistent philosophy inevery branch, and especially in the two most important ones: epistemology andethics. We need a philosophy of reason and of rational self-interest, aphilosophy that would once again release the power of man’s mind and the energyinherent in his pursuit of happiness. Nothing less will save America orindividual rights.There are many good people in the world who accept religion, and many of themhold some good ideas on social questions. I do not dispute that. But theirreligion is not the solution to our problem; it is the problem. Do I saytherefore that there should only be “freedom for atheism”? No, I am not Mr.Kemp. Of course, religions must be left free; no philosophic viewpoint, right orwrong, should be interfered with by the state. I do say, however, that it istime for patriots to take a stand—to name publicly what America does depend on,and why that is not Judaism or Christianity.There are men today who advocate freedom and who recognize what ideas lie at itsbase, but who then counsel “practicality.” It is too late, they say, to educatepeople philosophically; we must appeal to what they already believe; we mustpretend to endorse religion on strategic grounds, even if privately we don’t.This is a counsel of intellectual dishonesty and of utter impracticality. It istoo late indeed, far too late for a strategy of deception which by its naturehas to backfire and always has, because it consists of affirming and supportingthe very ideas that have to be uprooted and replaced. It is time to tell peoplethe unvarnished truth: to stand up for man’s mind and this earth, and againstany version of mysticism or religion. It is time to tell people: “You mustchoose between unreason and America. You cannot have both. Take your pick.”If there is to be any chance for the future, this is the only chance there is.NOTES1 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#Ref-en1] Quoted in Conservative Digest,Sept. 1980.2 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#Ref-en2] From a symposium on “Sex and Godin American Politics,” Policy Review, Summer 1984.3 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#Ref-en3] Quoted in The New York Times,Aug. 8, 1985.4 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#Ref-en4] The New York Times, Dec. 25, 1985& Jan. 5, 1986.5 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#Ref-en5] “What the Catholic Church TeachesAbout Socialism, Communism, and Marxism.” The Catholic Study Council,Washington, DC.6 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#Ref-en6] The New York Times, Feb. 2, 1986,Sept. 11, 1984, & May 17, 1985.7 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#Ref-en7] From Reason the Only Oracle ofMan (Bennington: 1784), p. 457.8 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c09_r1.html#Ref-en8] The Examiners Examined: Being aDefence of the Age of Reason (New York: 1794), pp. 9-10.

It wasdelivered on March 26, 1961.I am speaking here today on the assumption that I am addressing an audienceconsisting predominantly of “liberals” —that is: of my antagonists. Therefore, Imust begin by explaining why I chose to do it.The briefest explanation is to tell you that in the 1930s I envied the“liberals” for the fact that their leaders entered political campaigns armed notwith worn-out bromides, but with intellectual arguments. I disagreed witheverything they said, but I would have fought to the death for the method bywhich they said it: for an intellectual approach to political problems.Today, I have no cause to envy the “liberals” any longer.For many decades, the “liberals” had been the representatives of the intellectin America, if not in the content of their ideas, then at least in form, method,and professed epistemology. They claimed that their views were based on reason,logic, science; and even though they were glorifying collectivism, theyprojected a manner of confident, distinguished intellectuality—while most of theso-called “conservatives,” allegedly devoted to the defense of individualism andcapitalism, went about apologetically projecting such a cracker-barrel sort offolksiness that Li‘l Abner would have found it embarrassing; the monument towhich may still be seen in the corridors of the New York Stock Exchange, in acostly display of statistical charts and models proudly entitled: THE PEOPLE’SCAPITALISM.Today, the two camps are moving closer and merging. Just as the Republican andDemocratic parties are becoming indistinguishable, so are their respectiveintellectual spokesmen. And while the “conservatives” are lumbering toward theMiddle Ages, in quest of a philosophical base for their views—the “liberals,”always the avant-garde, have outdistanced them and are now galloping, on thesame quest, toward India of the fifth century B.C., the original source of ZenBuddhism.What social or political group today is the home of those who are and still wishto be the men of the intellect? None. The intellectuals—in the strict, literalsense of the word, as distinguished from the mystics and the neo-mysties—are nowhomeless refugees, left behind by a silent collapse they have not had thecourage to identify. They are the displaced persons of our culture, who areafraid to discover that they have been displaced by the monster whom theythemselves had released: by the primordial proponents of brute force.As an advocate of reason, freedom, individualism, and capitalism, I seek toaddress myself to the men of the intellect—wherever such may still be found—andI believe that more of them may be found among the former “liberals” than amongthe present “conservatives.” I may be wrong; I am willing to find out.The terms “liberal” and “conservative” are two of the emptiest sounds in today’spolitical vocabulary: they have become rubber words that can be stretched to fitany meaning anyone cares to give them—words that can be used safely by anyspeaker who wants to be misunderstood in the greatest number of ways by thegreatest number of people. Yet at the same time, everyone seems to understandthese two words in some foggy, sub-verbal manner, as if they were the codesignals of a dark, secret guilt, hiding an issue no one cares to face.When an entire culture is guilty of evasion on so enormous a scale, the firstthing to do, if one does not choose to be an evader, is to identify the issuethat people are afraid to see. What is it that the terms “liberal” and“conservative” have now come to hide?Well, observe a curious sequence in our intellectual trends. In the popular,political usage of today, the term “liberal” is generally understood to mean anadvocate of greater government control over the country’s economy, or, loosely,an advocate of socialism—while the term “conservative” is generally understoodto mean an opponent of government controls, or an advocate of capitalism. Butthis was not the original, historical meaning of the two terms, or their use inthe nineteenth century. Originally, the term “liberal” meant an advocate ofindividual rights, of political freedom, of laissez-faire capitalism, and anopponent of the authoritarian state—while the term “conservative” meant anadvocate of the state’s authority, of tradition, of the established politicalorder, of the status quo, and an opponent of individual rights. It has beenobserved many times that the term “liberal” today means the opposite of itsnineteenth-century meaning. This would not have been too disastrousintellectually if the two terms had been merely reversed and had exchanged theiroriginal meanings. But what is significant—ominously significant—is the factthat certain groups are now attempting to switch the term “conservative” back toits nineteenth-century meaning, to palm it off on the public by imperceptibledegrees, never bringing the issue fully into the open, hoping that people willgradually come to believe that a “conservative” is an advocate of authority, butof traditional authority. If semantic corruption becomes accepted on that wide ascale, if the political switch pulled on us becomes a choice betweentwentieth-century statist “liberals” and nineteenth-century statist“conservatives,” what political system will be silently obliterated by thatswitch? What political system is being destroyed by stealth, without lettingpeople discover that it is being destroyed? Capitalism.It is the very scale and virulence of the evasion that should make everyrational person pause and consider the issue. Those who do, will discover thatthe historical, political, and economic case for capitalism has never beenrefuted—and that the only way the statists can hope to win is by never allowingit to be discussed.This is the issue hidden under the foggy sloppiness of today’s political terms.Most people are not consciously aware of it; what they do sense, however, isthat they haven’t a leg to stand on as far as their political views areconcerned, whether they’re “liberals” or “conservatives”—that they have nophilosophical base, no moral justification, no principles to uphold, no policyto offer.Observe the intellectual disintegration of today’s political discussions, theshrinking of issues and debates to the level of single, isolated, superficialconcretes, with no context, with no reference to any fundamental principles, nomention of basic issues, no proofs, no arguments, nothing but arbitraryassertions of “for” or “against.” As an example, observe the level on which thelast presidential campaign was fought [Kennedy vs. Nixon in 1960]. Did thecandidates discuss foreign policy? No—just the fate of Quemoy and Matsu [twoislands between China and Taiwan]. Did they discuss socialized medicine? No—justthe cost and the procedure of medical aid to the aged. Did they discussgovernment control of education? No—just who should pay the teachers’ salaries:the federal government or the states.What most people are evading today is the realization that under the lip servicethey are paying to an anti-totalitarian crusade, they have accepted all thebasic premises of a totalitarian philosophy—and the rest is only a matter oftime and degree. They do not know how they came to accept it—and most of them donot want to accept it—but they see no alternative and they are too frightened,too bitterly discouraged to seek it.Whose job is it to offer an alternative? Who provides a country with ideas, withknowledge, with political theories? The intellectuals. But it is theintellectuals who have brought us to this state—and are now deserting underfire; that is, giving up the task of intellectual leadership at a time when theyare needed most.When intellectual disintegration reaches such absurd extremes as, on one side,the claim of some “conservatives” that the United States of America was theproduct of tradition worship, and, on the other side, the use of a politicaldesignation such as “a totalitarian liberal”—it is time to stop and to realizethat there are no intellectual sides any longer, no philosophical camps and nopolitical theories, nothing but an undifferentiated mob of trembling statistswho haggle only over how fast or how slowly we are to collapse into atotalitarian dictatorship, whose gang will do the dictating, and who will besacrificed to whom.It is the “non-totalitarian liberals” and the “non-traditional conservatives”that I seek to address. Both are homeless refugees today, because neither had afirm philosophical foundation under his political home. Those homes werejerry-built astride a deadly fissure; the fissure has opened wide and hasswallowed all the cheap little platform planks. Let them go—and let us startrebuilding the foundations.The fissure had many philosophical names: soul versus body—mind versusheart—liberty versus equality—the practical versus the moral. But all of thesefalse dichotomies are merely secondary consequences derived by the mystics fromone real, basic issue: reason versus mysticism—or, in political terms, reasonand freedom versus faith and force.Let me define my terms: reason is the faculty which perceives, identifies, andintegrates the material provided by man’s senses; mysticism is the claim to somenon-sensory, non-rational, non-definable, supernatural means of knowledge.Only three brief periods of history were culturally dominated by a philosophy ofreason: ancient Greece, the Renaissance, the nineteenth century. These threeperiods were the source of mankind’s greatest progress in all fields ofintellectual achievement—and the eras of greatest political freedom. The rest ofhuman history was dominated by mysticism of one kind or another; that is, by thebelief that man’s mind is impotent, that reason is futile or evil or both, andthat man must be guided by some irrational “instinct” or feeling or intuition orrevelation, by some form of blind, unreasoning faith. All the centuriesdominated by mysticism were the eras of political tyranny and slavery, of ruleby brute force—from the primitive barbarism of the jungle—to the pharaohs ofEgypt—to the emperors of Rome—to the feudalism of the Dark and Middle Ages—tothe absolute monarchies of Europe—to the modern dictatorships of Soviet Russia,Nazi Germany, and all their lesser carbon copies.The Industrial Revolution, the United States of America, and thepolitico-economic system of capitalism were the product and result of theintellectual liberation achieved by the Renaissance and of a predominantlyAristotelian philosophical influence, which lasted, in spite of a Platonistcounterrevolution, through the centuries known as the Age of Reason and the Ageof Enlightenment. With so illustrious a start, how did the United States descendto its present level of intellectual bankruptcy?I want to recommend to your attention a very interesting book, which providesthe material, the historical evidence, for the answer to that question. I hastento state that the conclusions I have drawn are my own, not the author‘s, that Idisagree with the author’s viewpoint and I believe that he would probablydisagree with mine. But the book is a remarkable, scholarly, well-documentedrecord of the history of America’s intellectual life. One may disagree with awriter’s interpretation of the facts, but first one must know the facts—and inthis respect, the book is of enormous value. This book is The Decline ofAmerican Liberalism by Professor Arthur A. Ekirch, Jr.Professor Ekirch himself is a “liberal”—though not of the totalitarian variety.He offers no solution for the present state of liberalism and no explanation ofits decline. His thesis is only that liberalism is declining and that ourculture is moving toward “an increasingly illiberal future.”Let me give you Professor Ekirch’s definition of liberalism:Perhaps it is best if we think of liberalism not as a well-defined political oreconomic system, but as a collection of ideas or principles which go to make upan attitude or ‘habit of mind.’ But within this liberal climate of opinion,however broadly or narrowly it may be defined, it is necessary to include theconcept of limited representative government and the widest possible freedom ofthe individual—both intellectually and economically.Professor Ekirch is an historian and has given an accurate description. But whata philosopher would observe is that that description holds a clue to thedisaster which has wrecked Western civilization and its intellectuals. Observethat the “liberals”—in the nineteenth century as well as today—held “acollection of ideas or principles” which had never been translated into a“well-defined political or economic system.” This means that they held certainvalues and goals, with no knowledge of how to implement them in reality, with nounderstanding of what practical actions would achieve or defeat their goals.With so vulnerable an intellectual equipment, could they be a match for theprimordial forces of totalitarian mysticism? They could not and were not. It isthey, the intellectuals, who betrayed their own liberal ideals, defeated theirown goals, paved the way for their own destroyers—and did not know it, until itwas too late.They did not know that the political and economic system they had neverdefined—the only system that could achieve a limited representative government,as well as the intellectual and economic freedom of the individual—the idealsystem—was laissez-faire capitalism.The guilt of the intellectuals, in the nineteenth century, was that they neverdiscovered capitalism—and they have not discovered it to this day.If you want to know the philosophical and psychological causes of theintellectuals’ treason against capitalism, I will refer you to the title essayof my book For the New Intellectual. In the brief space of today’s discussion, Ihave to confine myself to a mere indication of the nature and the consequencesof that treason.The fundamental principle of capitalism is the separation of State andEconomics—that is: the liberation of men’s economic activities, of productionand trade, from any form of intervention, coercion, compulsion, regulation, orcontrol by the government. This is the essence of capitalism, which is implicitin its theory and in the operation of a free market—but this is not the way mostof its advocates saw it, and it is not the way it was translated into practice.The term “laissez-faire capitalism,” which one has to use today in order to beunderstood, is actually a redundancy: only an economy of total “laissez faire”is capitalism; anything else is a “mixed economy,” that is, a mixture, invarying degrees, of freedom and controls, of voluntary choice and governmentcompulsion, of individualism and collectivism.A full, perfect system of capitalism has never yet existed in history. Variousdegrees of government intervention and control remained in all the mixed,semi-free economies of the nineteenth century, undercutting, hampering,distorting, and ultimately destroying the operations of a free market. Butduring the nineteenth century, mankind came close to economic freedom, for thefirst and only time in history. Observe the results. Observe also that thedegree of a country’s freedom from government control was the degree of itsprogress. America was the freest and achieved the most.When two opposite principles are operating in any issue, the scientific approachto their evaluation is to study their respective performances, trace theirconsequences in full, precise detail, and then pronounce judgment on theirrespective merits. In the case of a mixed economy, the first duty of any thinkeror scholar is to study the historical record and to discover which developmentswere caused by the free enterprise of private individuals, by free productionand trade in a free market—and which developments were caused by governmentintervention into the economy. It might shock you to hear that no such study hasever been made. To my knowledge, no book dealing with this issue is available.If one wants to study this question, one has to gather information from randompassages and references in books on other subjects, or from the unstatedimplications of known but unanalyzed facts.Those who undertake such a study will discover that all the economic evilspopularly ascribed to capitalism were caused, necessitated, and made possiblenot by private enterprise, not by free trade on a free market, but by governmentintervention into the economy, by government controls, favors, subsidies,franchises, and special privileges.The villains were not the private businessmen who made fortunes by productiveability and free trade, but the bureaucrats and their friends, the men who madefortunes by political pull and government favor. Yet it is the privatebusinessmen, the victims, who took the blame, while the bureaucrats and theirintellectual spokesmen used their own guilt as an argument for the extension oftheir power. Those of you who have read Atlas Shrugged will recognize thedifference between a businessman such as Hank Rearden, the representative ofcapitalism, and a businessman such as Orren Boyle, the typical product of amixed economy. If you want an historical example, consider the career of JamesJerome Hill, who built the Great Northern Railroad without a penny of federalhelp, who was responsible, practically single-handedly, for the development ofthe entire American Northwest, and who was persecuted by the government all hislife, under the Sherman Act, for allegedly being a monopolist. Consider it, thencompare it to the career of the famous California businessmen known as “The BigFour,” who built the Central Pacific Railroad on federal subsidies, causingdisastrous consequences and dislocations in the country’s economy, and who helda thirty-year monopoly on railroad transportation in California, by means ofspecial privileges granted by the state legislature which made it legallyimpossible for any competing railroad to exist in the state.The difference between these two types of business career has never beenidentified in the generally accepted view of capitalism. By imperceptibledegrees—first, through the default of capitalism’s alleged defenders, thenthrough the deliberate misrepresentations and falsifications of its enemies—thegradual rewriting of our economic history has brought us to the stage wherepeople believe that all the economic evils of the last two centuries were causedby the free-enterprise element, the so-called “private sector,” of our mixedeconomy, while the economic progress of these two centuries was the result ofthe government’s actions and interventions. People are now told that America’sspectacular industrial achievements, unmatched in any period of history or inany part of the globe, were due not to the productive genius of free men, but tothe special privileges handed to them by a paternalistic government. The factthat much more autocratic governments, with much wider privilege-dispensingpowers and policies, did not achieve the same results anywhere else on earth isblanked out by the proponents of this theory.The only counterpart of this theory’s grotesque inversion and monstrousinjustice is the mystics’ doctrine that man must give credit to God for all hisvirtues, but must place the blame for all his sins upon himself. Incidentally,the philosophical motive and purpose in both these instances is the same.If you want a contemporary demonstration of the respective merits andperformances of a free economy and of a controlled economy—a demonstration thatcomes as close to an historical laboratory experiment as one could hope tosee—take a look at the condition of West Germany and of East Germany.No politico-economic system in history had proved its value so eloquently or hadbenefited mankind so greatly as capitalism—and none has ever been attacked sosavagely and blindly. Why did the majority of the intellectuals turn againstcapitalism from the start? Why did their victims, the businessmen, bear theirattacks in silence? The cause of it is that primordial evil which, to this day,men are afraid to challenge: the morality of altruism.Altruism has been men’s ruling moral code through most of mankind’s history. Ithas had many forms and variations, but its essence has always remained the same:altruism holds that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service toothers is the only justification of his existence, and that self-sacrifice ishis highest moral duty, virtue, and value.The philosophical conflict which, since the Renaissance, has been tearingWestern civilization and which has reached its ultimate climax in our age is theconflict between capitalism and the altruist morality. Capitalism and altruismare philosophical opposites; they cannot coexist in the same man or in the samesociety.The moral code which is implicit in capitalism had never been formulatedexplicitly. The basic premise of that code is that man—every man—is an end inhimself, not the means to the ends of others, that man must exist for his ownsake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself,and that men must deal with one another as traders, by voluntary choice tomutual benefit. This, in essence, is the moral premise on which the UnitedStates of America was based: the principle of man’s right to his own life, tohis own liberty, to the pursuit of his own happiness.This is what the philosophers and the intellectuals of the nineteenth centurydid not and could not choose to identify, so long as they remained committed tothe mystics’ morality of altruism. If the good, the virtuous, the morally idealis suffering and self-sacrifice—then, by that standard, capitalism had to bedamned as evil. Capitalism does not tell men to suffer, but to pursue enjoymentand achievement, here, on earth—capitalism does not tell men to serve andsacrifice, but to produce and profit—capitalism does not preach passivity,humility, resignation, but independence, self-confidence, self-reliance—and,above all, capitalism does not permit anyone to expect or demand, to give or totake the unearned. In all human relationships—private or public, spiritual ormaterial, social or political or economic or moral—capitalism requires that menbe guided by a principle which is the antithesis of altruism: the principle ofjustice.So long as the intellectuals of the nineteenth century held altruism as theirmoral code, they had to evade the actual nature and meaning of capitalism—andthus come gradually to lose and to betray all of their initial goals and ideals.There were two crucial errors—or evasions—in the liberals’ view of capitalism,from which all the rest of their debacle proceeded. One was their attitudetoward the businessman; the other, their attitude toward the use of physicalforce.Since wealth, throughout all the centuries of stagnation preceding the birth ofcapitalism, had been gained by conquest, by physical force, by political power,the intellectuals took it as their axiom that wealth can be acquired only byforce—and refused to break up their mental package deal, to differentiatebetween a businessman and a feudal baron.I quote from my book For the New Intellectual: “Evading the difference betweenproduction and looting, they called the businessman a robber. Evading thedifference between freedom and compulsion, they called him a slave driver.Evading the difference between reward and terror, they called him an exploiter.Evading the difference between paychecks and guns, they called him an autocrat.Evading the difference between trade and force, they called him a tyrant. Themost crucial issue they had to evade was the difference between the earned andthe unearned.”The intellectuals refused to identify the fact that the source of industrialwealth is man’s mind, that the fortunes made in a free economy are the productof intelligence, of ability. This led them to the modern version of the ancientsoul-body dichotomy: to the contradiction of upholding the freedom of the mind,while denying it to the most active exponents of creative intelligence, thebusinessmen—the contradiction of promising to liberate man’s mind by enslavinghis body. It led them to regard the businessman as a “vulgar materialist” or abrute or a Babbitt [this is a reference to Sinclair Lewis’s novel], as some sortof inferior species born to serve them—and to regard themselves as some sort ofelite born to rule him, to control his life, and dispose of his product. Theshabby monument to this premise was the idea of divorcing production fromdistribution, of assuming the right to distribute that which one has notproduced. The only way to implement an idea of that kind, the next step in theirmoral descent, was the intellectuals’ alliance with the thug, with the advocateof rule by brute force: the totalitarian collectivist.The intellectuals’ second error—their attitude toward the use of force—is acorollary of the first. So long as they refused to identify the nature of freetrade and of a social system based on voluntary, uncoerced, unforced,non-sacrificial relationships among men, so long as the moral cannibalism of thealtruist code permitted them to believe that it is virtuous and right tosacrifice some men for the sake of others—the intellectuals had to embrace thepolitical creed of collectivism, the dream of establishing a perfect altruistsociety at the point of a gun. They projected a society where all would besacrificed to that conveniently undefinable idol “the public good,” withthemselves in the role of judges of what that “good” might be and of who wouldbe “the public” at any given moment—an ideal society to be achieved by means ofphysical force; that is, by means of the political power of the state, by meansof a totalitarian dictatorship.The rest is history—the shameful, sordid, ugly history of the intellectualdevelopment of the last hundred and fifty years.In the realm of political theory, the switch from the liberalism of thenineteenth century to the collectivism of the twentieth was accomplished whenpeople began to accept the Marxist view of the nature of government—the viewthat a government is and has to be the agent of the economic interests of someclass or another, and that the sole political issue is: which class will seizecontrol of the government to force its own interests on all other groups orclasses. Thus capitalism came to be regarded as an economic system in whichgovernment coercion is used for the benefit of the businessmen, the employers,or the rich in general. This served as a justification for the “liberals,” thesocialists, or any other collectivists when they proposed to use governmentcoercion for the benefit of the workers, the employees, or the poor in general.And thus the existence, the possibility, the historical record, and even thetheory of a noncoercive society were wiped out of people’s minds and out ofpublic discussion.In the early years of American capitalism, the government’s intervention intothe country’s economy was minimal; the government’s role was predominantlyconfined to its proper function: that of a policeman and arbiter charged withthe task of protecting the individual citizen’s rights and property. (The mostnotorious exception to that rule existed only in the agrarian, non-industrial,non-capitalist states of the South, where the state governments upheld theinstitution of slavery.) The attempts to obtain special economic privileges fromthe government were begun by businessmen, not by workers, but by businessmen whoshared the intellectuals’ view of the state as an instrument of “positive”power, serving “the public good,” and who invoked it to claim that the publicgood demanded canals or railroads or subsidies or protective tariffs. It is notthe great industrialists of America, not men like J. J. Hill, who ran togovernment for special favors, but random adventurers with political pull or,later, those pretentious types, indoctrinated by the intellectuals, who dreamedof statism as a “manifest destiny.”It was not the businessmen or the industrialists or the workers or the laborunions that began the revolt against freedom, the demand for greater and greatergovernment power and, ultimately, for the return to an absolute, totalitarianstate; it was the intellectuals. For a detailed history of the steps by whichthe intellectuals of Germany led it toward totalitarianism, culminating in theestablishment of the Nazi dictatorship, I will refer you to a brilliant bookentitled Omnipotent Government by Professor Ludwig von Mises. For a detailedhistory of the intellectuals’ role in America, I will refer you to The Declineof American Liberalism by Professor Arthur A. Ekirch, Jr., which I mentionedearlier.Professor Ekirch shares many of the errors of the “liberals.” He seems to regardcapitalism as a system of government coercion for the benefit of the rich; heseems to ascribe America’s progress to government intervention into the economy;he does not question the government’s right to initiate the use of physicalforce for an alleged “good purpose”; he certainly does not challenge themorality of altruism. But he is too honest and conscientious an observer not tobe disturbed by certain symptoms of the totalitarian spirit in the history ofthe “liberals”—and he offers the evidence, without identifying its full,philosophical implications.For example, he offers the following quotation from The Promise of American Lifeby Herbert Croly, a book published in 1909, which attacked the theory of laissezfaire and had an enormous influence on the so-called progressives of the time—onTheo- dore Roosevelt, among others:The Promise of American Life is to be fulfilled—not merely by a maximum amountof economic freedom, but by a certain measure of discipline; not merely by theabundant satisfaction of individual desires, but by a large measure ofindividual subordination and self-denial.... The automatic fulfillment of theAmerican national Promise is to be abandoned, if at all, precisely because thetraditional American confidence in individual freedom has resulted in a morallyand socially undesirable distribution of wealth.If you doubt the role of altruism in the destruction of capitalism, you mayobserve it in that quotation. And if you doubt the hatred of collectivists forthe men of ability, observe it in the following passage from the same book byCroly: “The national government must step in and discriminate; but it mustdiscriminate, not on behalf of liberty and the special individual, but on behalfof equality and the average man.”If you have been ascribing the policy of imperialism to the “selfish”individualistic ideology of capitalism and to its “greed” for conquests, here isa quotation from Ideals and Self-Interest in America’s Foreign Relations by R.E. Osgood: “The spirit of imperialism was an exaltation of duty above rights, ofcollective welfare above individual self-interest, the heroic values as opposedto materialism, action instead of logic, the natural impulse rather than thepallid intellect.”If you have accepted the Marxist doctrine that capitalism leads to wars, readProfessor Ekirch’s account of how Woodrow Wilson, the “liberal” reformer, pushedthe United States into World War I. “He seemed to feel that the United Stateshad a mission to spread its institutions—which he conceived as liberal anddemocratic—to the more benighted areas of the world.” It was not the “selfishcapitalists,” or the “tycoons of big business,” or the “greedy munitions-makers”who helped Wilson to whip up a reluctant, peace-loving nation into the hysteriaof a military crusade—it was the altruistic “liberals” of the magazine The NewRepublic edited by that same Herbert Croly. What sort of arguments did they use?Here is a sample from Croly: “The American nation needs the tonic of a seriousmoral adventure.”If you still wonder about the singular recklessness with which allegedhumanitarians treat such issues as force, violence, expropriation, enslavement,bloodshed—perhaps the following passage from Professor Ekirch’s book will giveyou some clue to their motives: “Stuart Chase rushed into print late in 1932with a popular work on economics entitled A New Deal. ‘Why,’ Chase asked withreal envy at the close of the book, ‘should Russia have all the fun of remakinga world?’ ”Apparently, Mr. Stuart Chase objects to the “tyranny of words,” but not to thetyranny of men.The record speaks for itself. Starting out as advocates of limitedrepresentative government, the “liberals” end as champions of unlimited,totalitarian dictatorship. Starting out as defenders of individual rights, theyend as apologists for the bloody slaughterhouse of Soviet Russia. Starting outas apostles of human welfare, who beg for a few temporary controls to relievethe emergency of people’s poverty, they end with J. K. Galbraith, who demandscontrols for the sake of controls and a permanent cut of everybody’s income, notbecause people are too poor, but because they are too affluent. Starting out asbrave champions of freedom, they end crawling on their stomachs to Moscow, withBertrand Russell, pleading: “Give me slavery, but please don’t give me death.”Starting out as advocates of reason, confident of man’s power to achievewell-being and fulfillment on earth, they end hunched in the darkest corners ofthe oldest cellar, muttering that reason is impotent, and fumbling through mustypages for the occult guidance of Zen Buddhism.Such is the end result of the altruist morality.Now I will ask you to consider the following. The intellectual trend that hasbrought us to this state—the mysticism-collectivism-altruism axis—has beengaining momentum since the nineteenth century, has been winning victory aftervictory, and is, at present, our dominant cultural power. If truth and realitywere on its side, if it represented the right philosophy for men to live by, onewould expect to see a gradual improvement in the state of the world with everysuccessive victory, one would expect an atmosphere of growing confidence,liberation, energy, vitality, and joy of living. Is this what we have seen inthe past decades? Is this what we see around us today? Today, in the moment oftheir almost total triumph, the voices of the mystic-collectivist-altruist axisare rising in a single wail of despair, proclaiming that existence on earth isevil, that futility is the essence of life, that disaster is man’s metaphysicaldestiny, that man is a miserable failure depraved by nature and unfit to exist.This was not the way that the reason-individualism-capitalism axis greeted itstriumphs in the nineteenth century—and this was not the view of man or the senseof life that it brought to mankind.I quote from my book For the New Intellectual: “The professional businessman andthe professional intellectual came into existence together, as brothers born ofthe Industrial Revolution. Both are the sons of capitalism—and if they perish,they will perish together. The tragic irony will be that they will havedestroyed each other; and the major share of the guilt will belong to theintellectual.”Those of you who may still be “liberals,” in the original sense of that word,and who may have abandoned everything except loyalty to reason—now is the timeto check your premises. If you do, you will find that the ideal society had oncebeen almost within men’s reach. It was the intellectuals who destroyed it—andwho committed suicide in the process—but the future belongs to a new type ofintellectual, a new radical: the fighter for capitalism."},{"pageContent":"11Our Cultural Value-Deprivationby Ayn RandThis lecture was delivered at the Ford Hall Forum on April 10, 1966, andpublished in The Objectivist, April 1966.In the years 1951 to 1954, a group of scientists at McGill University conducteda series of experiments that attracted a great deal of attention, led to manyfurther inquiries, and became famous under the general title of “sensorydeprivation.”The experiments consisted of observing the behavior of a man in conditions ofisolation which eliminated or significantly reduced the sensations of sight,hearing, and touch. The subject was placed in a small, semi-sound-proofedcubicle, he wore translucent goggles which admitted only a diffuse light, hewore heavy gloves and cardboard cuffs over his hands, and he lay in bed for twoto three days, with a minimum of motion.The results varied from subject to subject, but certain general observationscould be made: the subjects found it exceedingly difficult or impossible toconcentrate, to maintain a systematic process of thought; they lost their senseof time, they felt disoriented, dissociated from reality, unable to tell thedifference between sleeping and waking; many subjects experiencedhallucinations. Most of them spoke of feeling as if they were losing control oftheir consciousness. These effects disappeared shortly after the termination ofthe experiments.The scientists pursuing these inquiries state emphatically that no theoreticalconclusions can yet be drawn from these and other, similar experiments, becausethey involve too many variables, as well as undefined differences in thepsychological character of the subjects, which led to significant differences intheir reactions. But certain general indications can be observed: theexperiments seem to indicate that man’s consciousness requires constantactivity, a constant stream of changing sensory stimuli, and that monotony orinsufficient stimulation impairs its efficiency.Even though man ignores and, to a large extent, shuts out the messages of hissenses when he is concentrating on some specific intellectual task—his sensesare his contact with reality, that contact is not stagnant, but is maintained bya constant active process, and when that process is slowed down artificially tosubnormal levels, his mind slows down as well.Man’s consciousness is his least known and most abused vital organ. Most peoplebelieve that consciousness as such is some sort of indeterminate faculty whichhas no nature, no specific identity, and, therefore, no requirements, no needs,no rules for being properly or improperly used. The simplest example of thisbelief is people’s willingness to lie or cheat, to fake reality on the premisethat “I’m the only one who’ll know” or “It’s only in my mind”—without anyconcern for what this does to one’s mind, what complex, untraceable, disastrousimpairments it produces, what crippling damage may result.The loss of control over one’s consciousness is the most terrifying of humanexperiences: a consciousness that doubts its own efficacy is in a monstrouslyintolerable state. Yet men abuse, subvert, and starve their consciousness in amanner they would not dream of applying to their hair, toenails, or stomachs.They know that these things have a specific identity and specific requirements,and if one wishes to preserve them, one must comb one’s hair, trim one’stoenails, and refrain from swallowing rat poison. But one’s mind? Aw, it needsnothing and can swallow anything. Or so most people believe. And they go onbelieving it while they toss in agony on a psychologist’s couch, screaming thattheir mind keeps them in a state of chronic terror for no reason whatever.One valuable aspect of the sensory-deprivation experiments is that they callattention to and dramatize a fact which neither laymen nor psychologists arewilling fully to accept: the fact that man’s consciousness possesses a specificnature with specific cognitive needs, that it is not infinitely malleable andcannot be twisted, like a piece of putty, to fit any private evasions or anypublic “conditioning.”If sensory deprivation has such serious consequences, what are the consequencesof “conceptual deprivation”? This is a question untouched by psychologists, sofar, since the majority of today’s psychologists do not recognize thesignificance of the fact that man’s consciousness requires a conceptual mode offunctioning—that thinking is the process of cognition appropriate to man. Theravages of “conceptual deprivation” can be observed all around us. Twointeracting aspects of this issue must be distinguished: the primary cause isindividual, but the contributory cause is social.The choice to think or not is volitional. If an individual’s choice ispredominantly negative, the result is his self-arrested mental development, aself-made cognitive malnutrition, a stagnant, eroded, impoverished,anxiety-ridden inner life. A social environment can neither force a man to thinknor prevent him from thinking. But a social environment can offer incentives orimpediments; it can make the exercise of one’s rational faculty easier orharder; it can encourage thinking and penalize evasion or vice versa. Today, oursocial environment is ruled by evasion—by entrenched, institutionalizedevasion—while reason is an outcast and almost an outlaw.The brashly aggressive irrationality and anti-rationality of today’s cultureleaves an individual in an intellectual desert. He is deprived of conceptualstimulation and communication; he is unable to understand people or to beunderstood. He is locked in the equivalent of an experimental cubicle—only thatcubicle is the size of a continent—where he is given the sensory stimulation ofscreeching, screaming, twisting, jostling throngs, but is cut off from ideas:the sounds are unintelligible, the motions incomprehensible, the pressuresunpredictable. In such conditions, only the toughest intellectual giants willpreserve the unimpaired efficiency of their mind, at the price of anexcruciating effort. The rest will give up—usually, in college—and will collapseinto hysterical panic (the “activists”) or into sluggish lethargy (theconsensus-followers); and some will suffer from conceptual hallucinations (theexistentialists).The subject of “conceptual deprivation” is too vast to cover in one lecture andcan merely be indicated. What I want to discuss today is one particular aspectof it: the question of value-deprivation.A value is that which one acts to gain and/or keep. Values are the motivatingpower of man’s actions and a necessity of his survival, psychologically as wellas physically.Man’s values control his subconscious emotional mechanism, which functions likea computer adding up his desires, his experiences, his fulfillments andfrustrations—like a sensitive guardian watching and constantly assessing hisrelationship to reality. The key question which this computer is programmed toanswer is: What is possible to me?There is a certain similarity between the issue of sensory perception and theissue of values. Discussing “The Cognitive Consequences of Early SensoryDeprivation,” Dr. Jerome S. Bruner writes: “One may suggest that one of theprime sources of anxiety is a state in which one’s conception or perception ofthe environment with which one must deal does not ‘fit’ or predict thatenvironment in a manner that makes action possible.” [Sensory Deprivation, asymposium at Harvard Medical School, edited by Philip Solomon et al., Cambridge:Harvard University Press, 1961.] If severe and prolonged enough, the absence ofa normal, active flow of sensory stimuli may disintegrate the complexorganization and the interdependent functions of man’s consciousness.Man’s emotional mechanism works as the barometer of the efficacy or impotence ofhis actions. If severe and prolonged enough, the absence of a normal, activeflow of value experiences may disintegrate and paralyze man’s consciousness—bytelling him that no action is possible.The form in which man experiences the reality of his values is pleasure.[An essay from The Virtue of Selfishness on “The Psychology of Pleasure”states,] “Pleasure, for man, is not a luxury, but a profound psychological need.Pleasure (in the widest sense of the term) is a metaphysical concomitant oflife, the reward and consequence of successful action—just as pain is theinsignia of failure, destruction, death.... The state of enjoyment gives [man] adirect experience of his own efficacy, of his competence to deal with the factsof reality, to achieve his values, to live.... As pleasure emotionally entails asense of efficacy, so pain emotionally entails a sense of impotence. In lettingman experience, in his own person, the sense that life is a value and that he isa value, pleasure serves as the emotional fuel of man’s existence.”Where—in today’s culture—can a man find any values or any meaningful pleasure?If a man holds a rational, or even semi-rational, view of life, where can hefind any confirmation of it, any inspiring or encouraging phenomena?A chronic lack of pleasure, of any enjoyable, rewarding or stimulatingexperiences, produces a slow, gradual, day-by-day erosion of man’s emotionalvitality, which he may ignore or repress, but which is recorded by therelentless computer of his subconscious mechanism that registers an ebbing flow,then a trickle, then a few last drops of fuel—until the day when his inner motorstops and he wonders desperately why he has no desire to go on, unable to findany definable cause of his hopeless, chronic sense of exhaustion.Yes, there are a few giants of spiritual self-sufficiency who can withstand eventhis. But this is too much to ask or to expect of most people, who are unable togenerate and to maintain their own emotional fuel—their love of life—in themidst of a dead planet or a dead culture. And it is not an accident that this isthe kind of agony—death by value-strangulation—that a culture dominated byalleged humanitarians imposes on the millions of men who need its help.A peculiarity of certain types of asphyxiation—such as death from carbonmonoxide—is that the victims do not notice it: the fumes leave them no awarenessof their need of fresh air. The specific symptom of value-deprivation is agradual lowering of one’s expectations. We have already absorbed so much of ourcultural fumes that we take the constant pressure of irrationality, injustice,corruption and hooligan tactics for granted, as if nothing better could beexpected of life. It is only in the privacy of their own mind that men scream inprotest at times—and promptly stifle the scream as “unrealistic” or“impractical.” The man to whom values have no reality any longer—the man or thesociety that regards the pursuit of values, of the good, as impractical—isfinished psychologically.If, subconsciously, incoherently, inarticulately, men are still struggling for abreath of fresh air—where would they find it in today’s cultural atmosphere?The foundation of any culture, the source responsible for all of itsmanifestations, is its philosophy. What does modern philosophy offer us?Virtually the only point of agreement among today’s leading philosophers is thatthere is no such thing as philosophy—and that this knowledge constitutes theirclaim to the title of philosophers. With a hysterical virulence, strange inadvocates of skepticism, they insist that there can be no valid philosophicalsystems (i.e., there can be no integrated, consistent, comprehensive view ofexistence)—that there are no answers to fundamental questions—there is no suchthing as truth—there is no such thing as reason, and the battle is only overwhat should replace it: “linguistic games” or unbridled feelings?An excellent summary of the state of modern philosophy was offered in Time(January 7, 1966).Philosophy dead? It often seems so. In a world of war and change, of principlesarmed with bombs and technology searching for principles, the alarming thing isnot what philosophers say but what they fail to say. When reason is overturned,blind passions are rampant, and urgent questions mount, men turn for guidance to... almost anyone except their traditional guide, the philosopher....Contemporary philosophy looks inward at its own problems rather than outward atmen, and philosophizes about philosophy, not about life.And further:For both movements [the analytic and the existentialist], a question such as‘What is truth?’ becomes impossible to answer. The logical positivist would saythat a particular statement of fact can be declared true or false by empiricalevidence; anything else is meaningless. A language philosopher would contenthimself with analyzing all the ways the word true can be used. Theexistentialist would emphasize what is true for a person in a particularsituation.What, then, are modern philosophers busy doing? “Laymen glancing at the June 10,1965, issue of the Journal of Philosophy will find a brace of learned analystsdiscussing whether the sentence ‘There are brown things and there are cows’ isbest expressed by the formula (∃x) Exw · (∃x) Exy or by (∃x) Bx • (∃x) Cx.”If, in spite of this, someone might still hope to find something of value inmodern philosophy, he will be told off explicitly.A great many of his colleagues in the U.S. today would agree with Donald Kalish,chairman of the philosophy department at U.C.L.A., who says: “There is no systemof philosophy to spin out. There are no ethical truths, there are justclarifications of particular ethical problems. Take advantage of theseclarifications and work out your own existence. You are mistaken to think anyoneever had the answers. There are no answers. Be brave and face up to it.”This means that to look for ethical truths (for moral principles or values) isto be a coward—and that bravery consists of dispensing with ethics, truth,values, and of acting like a drunken driver or like the mobs that riot in thestreets of the cities throughout the world.If men seek guidance, the very motive that draws them to philosophy—the desireto understand—makes them give it up. And along with philosophy a man gives upthe ambitious eagerness of his mind, the quest for knowledge, the cleanliness ofcertainty. He shrinks the range of his vision, lowers his expectations and hiseyes, and moves on, watching the small square of his immediate steps, neverraising his head again. He had looked for intellectual values; the emotion ofcontempt and revulsion was all he found.If anyone attempts to turn from philosophy to religion, he will find thesituation still worse. When religious leaders form a new movement under a slogansuch as “God is dead,” there is no lower place to go in terms of cynicalobfuscation.“Theologian Calls ‘God-Talk’ Irrelevant,” announces a headline in The New YorkTimes of November 21, 1965. What sort of talk is relevant is not made clear inthe accompanying story, which is closer to double-talk than to any otherlinguistic category—as may be judged from the following quotations: “Even ifthere once was a God, they say, He is no longer part of human experience, andhence ’God-talk’ is both meaningless and irrelevant in the contemporarysituation.” And: “The function of religion is not to overcome the realities ofevil, hopelessness, and anguish with an apocalyptic vision, but to equip peopleto live with these problems and to share them through the religious community.”Does this mean: not to oppose, not to resist, but to share “evil, hopelessnessand anguish”? Your guess is as good as mine.From a report on a television discussion in Denver, Colorado, I gather that onemember of this movement has made its goal and meaning a little clearer. “God,”he said, “is a process of creative social intercourse.”This, I submit, is obscene. I, who am an atheist, am shocked by so brazen anattempt to rob religion of whatever dignity and philosophical intention it mightonce have possessed. I am shocked by so cynically enormous a degree of contemptfor the intelligence and the sensibility of people, specifically of thoseintended to be taken in by the switch.Now, if men give up all abstract speculation and turn to the immediateconditions of their existence—to the realm of politics—what values or moralinspiration will they find?There is a popular saying that alcohol and gasoline don’t mix. Morality andcynicism are as deadly a mixture. But a political system that mixes freedom andcontrols will try to mix anything—with the same kind of results on the darkroads of men’s spirit.On the one hand, we are drenched in the slick, stale, sticky platitudes ofaltruism, an overripe altruism running amok, pouring money, blood, and slogansabout global welfare, which everyone drips and no one hears any longer, sincemonotony—in moral, as well as sensory, deprivation—deadens perception. On theother hand, we all know and say and read in the same newspapers that all thesewelfare projects are merely a cynical power game, the game of buying votes withpublic funds, of paying off “election debts” to pressure groups, and of creatingnew pressure groups to pay off—since the sole purpose of political power, peopletacitly believe, is to keep oneself in power, and the sole recourse of thecitizens is to gang up on one another and maneuver for who’ll get sacrificed towhom.The first makes the second possible: altruism gives people an excuse to put upwith it. Altruism serves as the veneer—a fading, cracking, peeling veneer—tohide from themselves the terror of their actual belief: that there are no moralprinciples, that morality is impotent to affect the course of their existence,that they are blind brutes caught in a charnel house and doomed to destruction.No one believes the political proclamations of our day; no one opposes them.There is no public policy, no ideology, no goals, no convictions, no moral fire,no crusading spirit—nothing but the quiet panic of clinging to the status quo,with the dread of looking back to check the start of the road, with terror oflooking ahead to check its end, and with a leadership whose range of vision isshrinking down to the public poll the day after tomorrow’s televisionappearance.Promises? “Don’t remind us of promises, that was yesterday, it’s too late.”Results? “Don’t expect results, it’s too soon.” Costs? “Don’t think in terms ofold-fashioned economics—the more we spend, the richer we’ll get.” Principles?“Don’t think in terms of old-fashioned labels—we’ve got a consensus.” Thefuture? “Don’t think.”Whatever public images President Johnson may project. a moral crusader is notone of them. This lends special significance—and a typical whiff of today’scultural atmosphere—to a column entitled “President Johnson’s Dreams” by JamesReston, in The New York Times (February 25, 1966).Though his reach may exceed his grasp, it has to be said for him that he is ayearner after great ideals.... He makes the New Deal seem like a grudginghandout.... Nothing is beyond his aspirations. Roosevelt’s Vice President, HenryWallace, was condemned as a visionary because he wanted to give every Hottentota quart of milk. Humphrey came back talking as if he wanted to send them all tocollege, and the President’s message in New York was that the Four Freedoms cannever be secure in America if they are violated elsewhere in the world. This isnot mere speech-making to Lyndon Johnson.... He remains a believer in anunbelieving and cynical world.... He is out to eliminate poverty in America.Without any doubt, he feels he can bring adequate education to the multitude,and his confidence goes beyond the boundaries of the nation. Never mind that theBritish and the French let him know this week that they were reducing theircommitments in the world; he sees a combination of American power and generositydealing somehow with the problem. Has Malthus become as great a menace as Marx?Are the death rate and the birth rate too high? He has programs for them all ...He looked troubled and sounded harried in New York, and no wonder, for he isbearing all the dreams and lost causes of the century.Ask yourself: what is the moral and intellectual state of a nation that gives ablank check on its wealth, its work, its efforts, its lives to a “yearner” and“dreamer,” to spend on lost causes?Can anyone feel morally inspired to live and work for such a purpose?Can anyone preserve any values by looking at anything today? If a man who earnshis living hears constant denunciations of his “selfish greed” and then, as amoral example, is offered the spectacle of the War on Poverty—which fills thenewspapers with allegations of political favoritism, intrigues, maneuvering,corruption among its “selfless” administrators—what will happen to his sense ofhonesty? If a young man struggles sixteen hours a day to work his way throughschool, and then has to pay taxes to help the dropouts from the dropoutprograms—what will happen to his ambition? If a man saves for years to build ahome, which is then seized by the profiteers of Urban Renewal because theirprofits are “in the public interest,” but his are not—what will happen to hissense of justice? If a miserable little private holdup man is hauled off tojail, but when the government forces men into a gang big enough to be called aunion and they hold up New York City, they get away with it—what will happen tothe public’s respect for the law?Can anyone wish to give his life to defend the rights of South Vietnam—when therights of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia,Albania, East Germany, North Korea, Katanga, Cuba, and Hungary were notdefended? Can anyone wish to uphold the honor of our treaty obligations in SouthVietnam when it was not upheld on the construction site of the wall in Berlin?Can anyone acquire intellectual integrity by observing that it is thecollectivists who take a moral stand against the draft, in defense of individualrights—while the so-called “conservatives” insist that young men must be draftedand sent to die in jungle swamps, in order that the South Vietnamese may hold a“democratic” election and vote themselves into communism, if they so choose?The next time you hear about a crazed gang of juvenile delinquents, don’t lookfor such explanations as “slum childhood,” “economic underprivilege,” or“parental neglect.” Look at the moral atmosphere of the country, at the exampleset by their elders and by their public leaders.Today, the very motive that arouses men’s interest in politics—their sense ofresponsibility—makes them give it up. And along with politics a man gives up hisgood will toward people, his benevolence, his openness, his fairness. Hewithdraws into the small, tight, windowless cellar of his range-of-the-momentconcerns, shrinking from any human contact, convinced that the rule of the gameis to kill or be killed and that the only action possible to him is to defendhimself against every passerby. He had looked for social values; the emotion ofcontempt and revulsion was all he found.In the decadent eras of history, in the periods when human hopes and values werecollapsing, there was, as a rule, one realm to which men could turn for support,to preserve their image of man, their vision of life’s better possibilities, andtheir courage. That realm was art.Let us take a look at the art of our age.While preparing this discussion, I picked up at random the Sunday Book Reviewsection of The New York Times of March 20, 1966. I shall quote from the threeleading reviews of current fiction.1. “In his new book, it is as if [the author] has taken hold of his flaws,weaknesses, errors, and indulgences, and instead of dealing strictly with them,has made them the subject of his esthetic intention. The scatology has hit thefan. When homosexual camp has become a cliché, he tries to make it new by pokingit at the reader from every direction.... There are floating neon images ofdecay, corruption, putrefaction, illness.” This is not a negative review, but anadmiringly reproachful one: the reviewer does not like this particular novel,but he extols the author’s talent and urges him to do better. As he puts it:“Give us this day our daily horror, agreed; but carry through on your promises.”2. The second review is of the same order: respectfully admiring toward theauthor, but critical of the particular novel under discussion. “It’s hard,bright, and as cold as a block of ice. Gratuitous evil, upholstered innocence,and insane social arrangements condemn [the author‘s] characters to frightfulviolence. They must do or be done to. Under sentence, they move inexorablytoward futility and destruction.... Three people are murdered during a wave ofprivate crime in the West Indies. One of the murderers earns $100,000. The chiefengineer of the bizarre electrochemical derangement of two of the prey collectsa lifetime of compensation for a lousy childhood. The victims burn up, get shotor pushed down a thousand-foot ravine. It’s a total dark victory. One can inferpositive values only by their absence. The author’s own attitude is as antimoralas a tombstone.”3. The third review is enthusiastic about a novel which it describes as“remarkable as a rare instance of pornography sublimed to purest art.” Thecontent of the novel is indicated as follows: “The story gradually opens outinto a Daedalian maze of perverse relationships—a clandestine society ofsinister formality and elegance where the primary bond is mutual complicity indedication to the pleasures of sadism and masochism. [The heroine] is initiatedinto this world by her lover, who one day takes her to a secluded mansion whereshe is trained through the discipline of chains and whip to be totallysubmissive to the men who are her masters.... During her subsequent progress,she is subjected to every sort of sexual debasement and torture, only to bereturned in the penultimate stage of her education to a still more brutalinstitution, a ’gynaceum’ where she not only endures the cruelest torments butbegins to fulfill the sadistic lesbian underside of her own nature.” The themeof this book, according to the reviewer, is: “a perversion of the Christianmystery of exaltation through debasement, of the extremity of sufferingtransformed into an ultimate victory over the limitations of being.”If one turns from that muck to the visual arts, one finds the same sewer insomewhat different forms. To the extent that they communicate anything at all,the visual arts are ruled by a single principle: distortion. Distortion ofperspective, of space, of shape, of color, and, above all, of the human figure.We are surrounded by images of distorted, dismembered, disintegrated humanbodies—such as might be drawn by a retarded five-year-old—and they pursue useverywhere: on subway ads, in fashion magazines, in TV commercials, or suspendedon chains over our heads in fashionable concert halls.There is also the nonrepresentational—or Rorschach—school of art, consisting ofblobs, swirls, and smears which are and aren‘t, which are anything you mightwant them to be provided you stare at them long enough, keeping your eyes andmind out of focus. Provided also you forget that the Rorschach test was devisedto detect mental illness.If one were to look for the purpose of that sort of stuff, the kindest thing tosay would be that the purpose is to take in the suckers and provide a field dayfor pretentious mediocrities. But if one looked deeper, one would find somethingmuch worse: the attempt to make you doubt the evidence of your senses and thesanity of your mind.Art is a selective re-creation of reality according to an artist’s metaphysicalvalue judgments. Observe what image of man, of life and of reality modern artinfects people with—particularly the young whose first access to a broad view ofexistence and first source of values lie in the realm of art.Today, the very motive that draws a man to art—the quest for enjoyment—makes himrun from it for his life. He runs to the gray, sunless, meaningless drudgery ofhis daily routine, with nothing to relieve it, nothing to expect or to enjoy.And he soon stops asking the tortured question: “Is there anything to seetonight? Is there anything to read?” Along with art, he gives up his vision ofvalues and forgets that he had ever hoped to find or to achieve them.He had looked for inspiration. Contempt and revulsion were not the only emotionshe found, but also horror, indignation, and such a degree of boredom andloathing that anything is preferable to it—including the brutalizing emptinessof an existence devoid of any longing for values.If you wonder what is wrong with people today, consider the fact that nolaboratory experiment could ever reproduce so thorough a state ofvalue-deprivation.The consequences take many forms. Here is some of the evidence.A survey in The New York Times (March 21, 1966) quotes some observers whoestimate that forty to fifty percent of college students are drug addicts, thenadds:Actually, no one knows, even approximately, how many students take drugs. Buteveryone agrees that the number is rising, that it has been for several yearsand that no one is quite sure what to do about it....The drug takers are majoring in the humanities or social sciences, with more inEnglish than any other subject. There are fewer consistent users in the sciencesor in the professional schools....[The drug takers] are vaguely leftist, disenchanted with American policies inVietnam, agitated because there are Negro ghettos and bored with conventionalpolitics. They do not join the Peace Corps, which, a student at Penn State said,“is for Boy Scouts.”Their fathers, more often than not, are professional men or white-collarexecutives. They are not deprived. A California psychiatrist says that thechildren of television writers in Hollywood use drugs more than any othergroup....The LSD users speak of dissolving the ego, meeting the naked self, finding atruly religious experience, and being so terribly honest with themselves thatthey know that all about them is sham....Why do they increasingly drop out of school and join the LSD cult, there tocontemplate nature, induce periodic insanity, and pursue a philosophy that is acurious mélange of Zen, Aldous Huxley, existentialism, and leftover Orientalism?Dr. John D. Walmer, director of the mental health clinic at Penn State, suggeststhat “for people who are chronically unhappy drugs bring some relief from aworld without purpose.” George H. Gaffney, deputy commissioner of narcotics,says students take drugs because “of the growing disrespect for authority,because some professors just don’t care to set any kind of moral influence andbecause of the growing beatnik influence.” Dr. Harvey Powleson, director of thepsychiatric clinic at the Berkeley campus of the University of California, notes“a connection toward mystical movements in general.” ...A boy at San Francisco State may have spoken for his generation when he said hesmoked marijuana and used LSD “because there is just no reason not to.” He wasabsolutely sure that this was so.Who—in today’s culture—would have given him any valid reason to think otherwise?Here is another aspect of the same phenomenon (The New York Times, December 29,1964):The number of adolescent suicides and suicide attempts is a source of alarm toan increasing number of educators, doctors, and parents. Princeton added asecond full-time psychiatrist to its health services this fall; other schoolsare expanding existing services; at Columbia University the number of studentsseeking professional help has tripled in the last ten years....Surprisingly, Cornell doctors found that the student-patient who achieved thehighest marks was the one most likely to do away with himself. Nonsuicidalstudents, on the other hand, were often doing poorly in their academic work. Thebright students too often demanded far more of themselves than either theirprofessors or the university.Is it a matter of what the bright students demanded of themselves—or of life? Amuch more likely explanation is that the better the student, the more of today’sintellectual poison he had absorbed; being intelligent, he saw too clearly whatsort of existence awaited him and, being too young to find an antidote, he couldnot stand the prospect.When a culture is dedicated to the destruction of values—of all values, ofvalues as such—men’s psychological destruction has to follow.We hear it said that this is merely a period of transition, confusion, andgrowth, and that the leaders of today’s intellectual trends are groping for newvalues. But here is what makes their motives suspect. When the scientists of theRenaissance concluded that certain pseudo-sciences of the Middle Ages wereinvalid, they did not attempt to take them over and ride on their prestige; thechemists did not call themselves alchemists, the astronomers did not callthemselves astrologers. But modern philosophers proclaim themselves to bephilosophers while struggling to invalidate the essence of philosophy: the studyof the fundamental, universal principles of existence. When men like AugusteComte or Karl Marx decided to substitute society for God, they had the goodgrace not to call themselves theologians. When the esthetic innovators of thenineteenth century created a new literary form, they called it a “novel,” not an“anti-poem” —unlike the pretentious mediocrities of today who write“anti-novels.” When decorative artists began to design textiles and linoleums,they did not hang them up in frames on walls or entitle them “a representationof pure emotion.”The exponents of modern movements do not seek to convert you to theirvalues—they haven’t any—but to destroy yours. Nihilism and destruction are thealmost explicit goals of today’s trends—and the horror is that these trends moveon, unopposed.Who is to blame? All those who are afraid to speak. All those who are still ableto know better, but who are willing to temporize, to compromise, and thus tosanction an evil of that magnitude. All those intellectual leaders who areafraid to break with today’s culture, while knowing that it has rotted to thecore—who are afraid to check, challenge, and reject its basic premises, whileknowing that they are seeing the ultimate results—who are afraid to step out ofthe “mainstream,” while knowing that it is running with blood—who cringe, evade,and back away from the advance of screeching, bearded, drugged barbarians.Now you may logically want to ask me the question: What is the solution and theantidote? But to this question, I have given an answer—at length—elsewhere. Theanswer lies outside today’s cultural “mainstream.” Its name is Objectivism."},{"pageContent":"12Global Balkanizationby Ayn RandThis lecture was delivered at the Ford Hall Forum on April 10, 1977.Have you ever wondered about the process of the collapse of a civilization? Notthe cause of the collapse—the ultimate cause is always philosophical—but theprocess, the specific means by which the accumulated knowledge and achievementsof centuries vanish from the earth?The possibility of the collapse of Western civilization is not easy to imagineor to believe. Most people do not quite believe it—in spite of all the horrormovies about the end of the world in a nuclear blast. But of course the worldhas never been destroyed by a sudden catastrophe. Man-made catastrophes of thatsize are not sudden; they are the result of a long, slow, gradual process, whichcan be observed in advance.Let me remind you—as I have said many times before—that there is no such thingas historical determinism. The world does not have to continue moving towarddisaster. But unless men change their philosophical direction—which they stillhave time to do—the collapse will come. And if you want to know the specificprocess that will bring it about, that process—the beginning of the end—isvisible today.In The New York Times of January 18, 1976, under the title “Europe’s RestiveTribes,” columnist C. L. Sulzberger is crying out in anxious bewildermentagainst a phenomenon he cannot understand: “It is distressing to return fromAfrica and find the cultivated old continent of Europe subsiding into its ownform of tribalism just as new African governments make concerted efforts to curbthe power of tribes and subordinate them to the greater concept of thenation-state.”By “tribalism,” Mr. Sulzberger means the separatist movements spreadingthroughout Europe. “Indeed,” he declares,it is a peculiar phenomenon of contemporary times that so many lands which hadformerly been powerful and important seem obsessed with reducing the remnants oftheir own strength ... There is no logical reason that a Scotland which wasproud to be considered part of the British Empire’s heart when the sun never seton it, from Calcutta to Capetown, is now increasingly eager to disengage fromwhat is left of that grand tradition on an offshore European island. [Emphasisadded.]Oh yes, there is a very logical reason why Great Britain is falling apart, butMr. Sulzberger does not see it—just as he does not see what was grand about thatold tradition. He is the Times’ columnist specializing in European affairs, and,like a conscientious reporter, he is disturbed by something which he senses tobe profoundly wrong—but, tending to be a liberal, he is unable to explain it.He keeps coming back to the subject again and again. On July 3, 1976, in acolumn entitled “The Split Nationality Syndrome,” he writes: “The present era’smost paradoxical feature is the conflict between movements seeking to unifygreat geographical blocs into federations or confederations, and movementsseeking to disintegrate into still smaller pieces the component nations tryingto get together.”He offers an impressive list of examples. In France there is a Corsican autonomymovement, and similar movements of French Basques, of French Bretons, and ofFrench inhabitants of the Jura belt west of Switzerland. “Britain is nowobsessed with what is awkwardly called ‘devolution.’ This means watered-downautonomy and is designed to satisfy Welsh, but above all Scottish,nationalists.” Belgium remains split “by an apparently insoluble languagedispute between French-speaking Walloons and Dutch-speaking Flemish.” Spain isfacing demands for local independence “in Catalonia and the northern Basquecountry.... German-speaking inhabitants of Italy’s Alto Adige yearn to leaveRome and submit to Vienna. There is a tiny British-Danish argument ... over thestatus of the Faroe Islanders.... In Yugoslavia there are continuing disputesbetween Serbs and Croats ... There is also unresolved ferment among Macedonians... some of whom, on occasion, revive old dreams of their own state includingGreek Salonika and part of Bulgaria.”Please remember that these tribes and subtribes, which most of the world hasnever heard of—since they have achieved no distinction to hear about—arestruggling to secede from whatever country they are in and to form their ownseparate, sovereign, independent nations on their two-by-four stretches of theearth’s crust.I must make one correction. These tribes did achieve a certain kind ofdistinction: a history of endless, bloody warfare.Coming back to Mr. Sulzberger: Africa, he points out, is torn apart by tribalism(in spite of the local governments’ efforts), and most of Africa’s recent warswere derived “from tribal causes.” He concludes by observing: “The schizophrenicimpulses splitting Europe threaten actually to atomize Africa—and all in thename of progress and unity.”In a column entitled “Western Schizophrenia” (December 22, 1976), Mr. Sulzbergercries: “The West is not drawing closer together; it is coming apart. This isless complicated but perhaps more distressing in North America than in Europe.”For myself, I will add: and more disgusting.Mr. Sulzberger continues: “Canada is apparently getting ready to tear itselfasunder for emotional if illogical reasons which, on a massive scale, resemblethe language dispute that continually splits Belgium ...” He predicts thepossibility of a formal separation between French-speaking Quebec and the restof Canada, and comments sadly and helplessly: “Whatever happens, it is hard toforesee much good for the West ensuing.” Which is certainly true.Now what are the nature and the causes of modern tribalism?Philosophically, tribalism is the product of irrationalism and collectivism. Itis a logical consequence of modern philosophy. If men accept the notion thatreason is not valid, what is to guide them and how are they to live? Obviously,they will seek to join some group—any group—which claims the ability to leadthem and to provide some sort of knowledge acquired by some sort of unspecifiedmeans. If men accept the notion that the individual is helpless, intellectuallyand morally, that he has no mind and no rights, that he is nothing, but thegroup is all, and his only moral significance lies in selfless service to thegroup—they will be pulled obediently to join a group. But which group? Well, ifyou believe that you have no mind and no moral value, you cannot have theconfidence to make choices—so the only thing for you to do is to join anunchosen group, the group into which you were born, the group to which you werepredestined to belong by the sovereign, omnipotent, omniscient power of yourbody chemistry.This, of course, is racism. But if your group is small enough, it will not becalled “racism”: it will be called “ethnicity.”For over half a century, modern liberals have been observing the fact that theirideas are achieving the opposite of their professed goals: instead of“liberation,” communism has brought the blood-drenched dictatorship of SovietRussia—instead of “prosperity,” socialism has brought starvation to China, andCuba, and India (and Russia)—instead of “brotherhood,” the welfare state hasbrought the crumbling stagnation and the fierce, “elitist” power struggle ofGreat Britain, and Sweden, and many other, less obvious victims—instead of“peace,” the spread of international altruism has brought about two world wars,an unceasing procession of local wars, and the suspending of a nuclear bomb overthe heads of mankind. Yet this record does not prompt the liberals to checktheir premises or to glance, for contrast, at the record of the social systemthe last remnants of which they are so ferociously destroying.Now we are seeing another demonstration of the fact that their professed goalsare not the motive of today’s liberals. We are seeing a special kind ofintellectual cover-up—a cover-up so dirty and so low that it makes Watergatelook like a childish caper.Observe that ever since World War II, racism has been regarded as a viciousfalsehood and a great evil, which it certainly is. It is not the root of allsocial evils—the root is collectivism—but, as I have written before (in TheVirtue of Selfishness), “Racism is the lowest, most crudely primitive form ofcollectivism.” One would think that Hitler had given a sufficient demonstrationof racism’s evil. Yet today’s intellectuals, particularly the liberals, aresupporting and propagating the most virulent form of racism on earth: tribalism.The cover-up that makes it possible lies in a single word: ethnicity.“Ethnicity” is an anti-concept, used as a disguise for the word “racism”—and ithas no clearly definable meaning. But you can get a lead to its meaning if youhunt through a dictionary. The following are the results of my hunt through TheRandom House College Dictionary (1960), a book intended for young people.I found no such term as “ethnicity.” But I found “ethnic,” which is defined asfollows: “pertaining or peculiar to a population, esp. to a speech group,loosely also to a race.” Under “ethnic group,” the definition given associological usage reads: “a group of people, racially or historically related,having a common and distinctive culture, as an Italian or Chinese colony in alarge American city.”I looked up the word “culture.” The definition given as sociological usagereads: “the sum total of ways of living built up by a group of human beings,which is transmitted from one generation to another.” I looked up also the word“tribe.” The definition reads: “1. any aggregate of people united by ties ofdescent from a common ancestor, community of customs, and traditions, adherenceto the same leaders, etc. 2. a local division of a primitive or barbarouspeople.”The meaning of the sum of these definitions is fairly clear: the term“ethnicity” stresses the traditional, rather than the physiologicalcharacteristics of a group, such as language—but physiology, i.e., race, isinvolved and mentioned in all but one of these definitions. So the advocacy of“ethnicity,” means racism plus tradition—i.e., racism plus conformity—i.e.,racism plus staleness.The acceptance of the achievements of an individual by other individuals doesnot represent “ethnicity”: it represents a cultural division of labor in a freemarket; it represents a conscious, individual choice on the part of all the meninvolved; the achievements may be scientific or technological or industrial orintellectual or esthetic—and the sum of such accepted achievements constitutes afree, civilized nation’s culture. Tradition has nothing to do with it; traditionis being challenged and blasted daily in a free, civilized society: its citizensaccept ideas and products because they are true and/or good—not because they areold or because their ancestors accepted them. In such a society, concreteschange, but what remains immutable—by individual conviction, not bytradition—are those philosophical principles which correspond to reality, i.e.,which are true.The “old” and the “ancestral” are the standards of tradition, which supersedesreality, the standards of value of those who accept and practice “ethnicity.”Culture, in the modern sociolo gists’ view, is not a sum of achievements, but of“ways of living ... transmitted from one generation to another.” This means:concrete, specific ways of living. Can you—who are still the children of theUnited States of America—imagine the utter horror of a way of living that doesnot change from generation to generation? Yet this is what the advocates ofethnicity are advocating.Is such a way of living compatible with reason? It is not. Is it compatible withindependence or individuality? It is not. Is it compatible with progress?Obviously not. Is it compatible with capitalism? Don’t be funny. What centuryare we talking about? We are dealing with a phenomenon that is rising out ofprehistorical ages.Atavistic remnants and echoes of those ages have always existed in thebackwaters of civilized countries, particularly in Europe, among the old, thetired, the timid, and those who gave up before they started. Such people are thecarriers of “ethnicity.” The “ways of living” they transmit from generation togeneration consist in: folk songs, folk dances, special ways of cooking food,traditional costumes, and folk festivals. Although the professional “ethnics”would (and did) fight wars over the differences between their songs and those oftheir neighbors, there are no significant differences between them; all folk artis essentially similar and excruciatingly boring: if you’ve seen one set ofpeople clapping their hands while jumping up and down, you’ve seen them all.Now observe the nature of those traditional ethnic “achievements”: all of thembelong to the perceptual level of man’s consciousness. All of them are ways ofdealing with or manipulating the concrete, the immediately given, the directlyperceivable. All of them are manifestations of the preconceptual stage of humandevelopment.I quote from one of my articles: “The concrete-bound, anti-conceptual mentalitycan cope only with men who are bound by the same concretes—by the same kind of‘finite’ world. To this mentality, it means a world in which men do not have todeal with abstract principles: principles are replaced by memorized rules ofbehavior, which are accepted uncritically as the given. What is ’finite’ in sucha world is not its extension, but the degree of mental effort required of itsinhabitants. When they say ‘finite,’ they mean ‘perceptual.’ ” (This is from“The Missing Link” in [Philosophy: Who Needs It]. That article deals with thepsycho-epistemological roots of modern tribalism.)In the same article I said: “John Dewey’s theory of Progressive education (whichhas dominated the schools for close to half a century), established a method ofcrippling a child’s conceptual faculty and replacing cognition with ‘socialadjustment.’ It was and is a systematic attempt to manufacture tribalmentalities.”A symptom of the tribal mentality’s self-arrested, perceptual level ofdevelopment may be observed in the tribalists’ position on language.Language is a conceptual tool—a code of visual-auditory symbols that denoteconcepts. To a person who understands the function of language, it makes nodifference what sounds are chosen to name things, provided these sounds refer toclearly defined aspects of reality. But to a tribalist, language is a mysticheritage, a string of sounds handed down from his ancestors and memorized, notunderstood. To him the importance lies in the perceptual concrete, the sound ofa word, not its meaning. He would kill and die for the privilege of printing onevery postage stamp the word “postage” for the English-speaking and the word“postes” for the French-speaking citizens of his bilingual Canada. Since most ofthe ethnic languages are not full languages, but merely dialects or localcorruptions of a country’s language, the distinctions which the tribalists fightfor are not even as big as that.But, of course, it is not for their language that the tribalists are fighting:they are fighting to protect their level of awareness, their mental passivity,their obedience to the tribe, and their desire to ignore the existence ofoutsiders.The learning of another language expands one’s abstract capacity and vision.Personally, I speak four—or rather three-and-a-half—languages: English, French,Russian, and the half is German, which I can read but not speak. I found thisknowledge extremely helpful when I began writing: it gave me a wider range andchoice of concepts; it showed me four different styles of expression; it made megrasp the nature of languages as such, apart from any set of concretes.(Speaking of concretes, I would say that every civilized language has its owninimitable power and beauty, but the one I love is English—the language of mychoice, not of my birth. English is the most eloquent, the most precise, themost economical, and, therefore, the most powerful. English fits me best—but Iwould be able to express my identity in any Western language.)The tribalists clamor that their language preserves their “ethnic identity.” Butthere is no such thing. Conformity to a racist tradition does not constitute ahuman identity. Just as racism provides a pseudo-self-esteem for men who havenot earned an authentic one, so their hysterical loyalty to their own dialectserves a similar function: it provides a pretense at “collective self-esteem,”an illusion of safety for the confused, frightened, precarious state of atribalist’s stagnant consciousness.The proclaimed desire to preserve one’s language and/or its literary works, ifany, is a cover-up. In a free, or even semi-free country, no one is forbidden tospeak any language he chooses with those who wish to speak it. But he cannotforce it on others. A country has to have only one official language if men areto understand one another—and it makes no difference which language it is, sincemen live by the meaning, not the sound, of words. It is eminently fair that acountry’s official language should be the language of the majority. As toliterary works, their survival does not depend on political enforcement.But to the tribalists, language is not a tool of thought and communication.Language to them is a symbol of tribal status and power—the power to force theirdialect on all outsiders. This appeals not even to the tribal leaders, but tothe sick, touchy vanity of the tribal rank and file.In this connection, I want to mention a hypothesis of mine, which is only ahypothesis because I have given no special study to the subject of bilingualcountries, i.e., countries that have two official languages. But I have observedthe fact that bilingual countries tend to be culturally impoverished bycomparison to the major countries whose language they share in part. Bilingualcountries do not produce many great, first-rate achievements in any intellectualline of endeavor, whether in science, philosophy, literature, or art. Considerthe record of Belgium (which is French-speaking in part) as against the recordof France—or the record of Switzerland (a trilingual country) as against therecord of France, of Germany, of Italy—or the record of Canada as against therecord of the United States.The cause of the poor records may lie in the comparative territorial smallnessof those countries—but this does not apply to Canada versus the United States.The cause may lie in the fact that the best, most talented citizens of thebilingual countries tend to emigrate to the major countries—but this stillleaves the question: Why do they?My hypothesis is as follows: the policy of bilingual rule (which spares somecitizens the necessity to learn another language) is a concession to, and aperpetuation of, a strong ethnic-tribalist element within a country. It is anelement of anti-intellectuality, conformity, and stagnation. The best mindswould run from such countries: they would sense, if not know it consciously,that tribalism leaves them no chance.But quite apart from this particular hypothesis, there can be no doubt that thespread of tribalism is an enormously anti-intellectual evil. If, as I said, someelements of “ethnicity” did remain in the backyards of civilized countries andstayed harmless for centuries, why the sudden epidemic of their rebirth?Irrationalism and collectivism—the philosophical notions of the prehistoricaleras—had to be implemented in practice, in political action, before they couldengulf the greatest scientific-technological achievements mankind had everreached. The political cause of tribalism’s rebirth is the mixed economy—thetransitional stage of the formerly civilized countries of the West on their wayto the political level from which the rest of the world has never emerged: thelevel of permanent tribal warfare.As I wrote in my article on “Racism” (in The Virtue of Selfishness): “The growthof racism in a ‘mixed economy’ keeps step with the growth of governmentcontrols. A ’mixed economy’ disintegrates a country into an institutionalizedcivil war of pressure groups, each fighting for legislative favors and specialprivileges at the expense of one another.”When a country begins to use such expressions as “seeking a bigger share of thepie,” it is accepting a tenet of pure collectivism: the notion that the goodsproduced in a country do not belong to the producers, but belong to everybody,and that the government is the distributor. If so, what chance does anindividual have of getting a slice of that pie? No chance at all, not even a fewcrumbs. An individual becomes “fair game” for every sort of organized predator.Thus people are pushed to surrender their independence in exchange for tribalprotection.The government of a mixed economy manufactures pressure groups—and,specifically, manufactures “ethnicity.” The profiteers are those group leaderswho discover suddenly that they can exploit the helplessness, the fear, thefrustration of their “ethnic” brothers, organize them into a group, presentdemands to the government—and deliver the vote. The result is political jobs,subsidies, influence, and prestige for the leaders of the ethnic groups.This does not improve the lot of the group’s rank and file. It makes nodifference to the hard-pressed unemployed of any race or color what quota ofjobs, college admissions, and Washington appointments were handed out to thepolitical manipulators from their particular race or color. But the ugly farcegoes on, with the help and approval of the intellectuals, who write about“minority victories.”Here is a sample of the goal of such victories. In The New York Times of January17, 1977, a news story was headlined as follows : “Hispanic Groups Say They AreInequitably Treated in Support for Arts.” At a hearing on the subject, New YorkState Senator Robert Garcia declared: “What we are really talking about isdollars and whether we are receiving a fair share of the revenues generated inthis state.” The purpose of the demands for state dollars was “to assure thegrowth of ‘non-mainstream art forms.’ ” This means: art forms which people donot care to see or to support. The recommendations reached at the hearingincluded the demand that “at least twenty-five percent of the money goes toHispanic arts.”This, ladies and gentlemen, is what your tax money is being spent on: the newprofiteers of altruism are not the poor, the sick, or the unemployed, but ethnicfemales swishing their skirts in old Spanish dances which were not too good evenwhen they were new. This is a typical example of the motives and the vested interests behind thegrowth, the pushing, and the touting of “ethnicity.”An interesting article was published in the British magazine Encounter (February1975). It is entitled “The Universalisation of Ethnicity” and is written byNathan Glazer, a well-known American sociologist. It is quite revealing of themodern intellectuals’ attitude toward the spread of ethnicity—more revealing inwhat Mr. Glazer does not say than in what he does.He observes: “The overwhelming majority of people ... are born into a religion,rather than adopt it, just as they are born into an ethnic group. In thisrespect both are similar. They are both groups by ‘ascription’ rather than’achievement.‘ They are groups in which one’s status is immediately given bybirth rather than gained by some activities in one’s life.”This is eminently—and horribly—true. There is a great deal to be said about thehorrifying approach of a world dominated by people who prefer “ascription” to“achievement,” and who seek a physiologically determined, automatically givenstatus rather than a status they have to earn. Mr. Glazer does not say it; hemerely reports.He is disturbed by the relationship of “ethnic group” to “caste,” but treats itmerely as a problem of definitions. But, of course, castes are inherent in thenotion of ethnicity—castes of superiors and inferiors, determined by birth,enforced and perpetuated by law, dividing people into “aristocrats,”“commoners,” etc., down to “untouchables.”Mr. Glazer makes a true and profoundly important statement: “The United Statesis perhaps unique among the states of the world in using the term ‘nation’ torefer not to an ethnic group but to all who choose to become Americans.” But hedraws no conclusions from it. Yet it is extremely significant that the UnitedStates was the archenemy and the destroyer of ethnicity, that it abolishedcastes and any sort of inherited titles, that it granted no recognition togroups as such, that it recognized only the right of the individual to choosethe associations he wished to join. Freedom of association is the opposite ofethnicity.Mr. Glazer does not raise the question of the original American philosophy andthe relationship of its destruction to the rise of ethnicity. The focus of hisinterest lies elsewhere. He writes: “The Socialist hope for a trans-nationalclass struggle, based on class identification, never came to pass. Instead, ithas been replaced by national and ethnic conflicts.” And: “In most countriesnational interests and ethnic interests seem to dominate over class interests.”Mr. Glazer is baffled by this development. He offers some tentative explanationswith which he himself is not satisfied, such as: “The trends of modernisation,even while they do destroy some bases of distinctive culture and distinctiveidentity, create a need for a new kind of identity related to the old, intimatetype of village or tribal association.” A modern, technological society, whichincludes nuclear bombs and space travel—to be run by villages or by tribalassociations?Mr. Glazer himself tends to dismiss theories of this sort, and admits that hecannot find an explanation. “This is the heart of the darkness. Why didn’t themajor lines of conflict within societies become class conflicts rather thanethnic conflicts ? ... In most developing countries Marxism remains the ideologyof the students and often of the ruling group—but ethnicity is the focus aroundwhich identity and loyalty have been shaped.” Mr. Glazer comes closer to ananswer when he observes that ethnicity has “an irrational appeal,” but he takesit no further. He says instead:It would seem that the rallying cries that mobilise the classes have, in recentdecades, had less power than the rallying cries that mobilise the races, tribes,religions, language-users—in short, the Ethnic Groups. Perhaps the epidemic ofethnic conflicts reflects the fact that leaders and organisers believe they canget a more potent response by appealing to ethnicity than they can by appealingto Class Interest.True, leaders and organizers do believe this—but why? The answer to Mr. Glazer’squestions lies in the fact that Marxism is an intellectual construct; it isfalse, but it is an abstract theory—and it is too abstract for the tribalists’concrete-bound, perceptual mentalities. It requires a significantly high levelof abstraction to grasp the reality of “an international working class”—a levelbeyond the power of a consciousness that understands its own village, but hastrouble treating the nearest town as fully real. No, the level of men’sintelligence has not deteriorated from natural causes; it has been pushed down,retarded, stultified by modern anti-intellectual education and modernirrationalist philosophy.Mr. Glazer does not see or is not concerned with any part of this answer. It isobvious that he is disturbed by the spread of ethnicity, but he tries to hopefor the best—and this leads him, in conclusion, to a truly unspeakablestatement. After proposing some sort of solution in the form of “eitherguaranteed shares for each group, or guaranteed rights for each individual andeach group,” he continues: “The United States in the past seemed to find theapproach in terms of ‘guaranteed rights’ more congenial than the approach interms of guaranteed shares; but recently Americans have begun to take individualrights less seriously, and to take group shares more seriously.” After Irecovered from feeling sick at my stomach, I asked myself: What Americans hasMr. Glazer been observing or associating with? I do not know—but his statementis libel against an entire nation. His statement means that Americans arewilling to sell their rights for money—for a “share of the pie.”In his last paragraph Mr. Glazer observes that there was a time when “theproblems of Ethnicity, as a source of conflict within nations and betweennations, have generally appeared as simply a left-over, an embarrassment fromthe past. It is my conviction they must now be placed at the very centre of ourconcern for the human condition.”He is right to fear such a prospect.There is no surer way to infect mankind with hatred—brute, blind, virulenthatred—than by splitting it into ethnic groups or tribes. If a man believes thathis own character is determined at birth in some unknowh, ineffable way, andthat the characters of all strangers are determined in the same way—then nocommunication, no understanding, no persuasion is possible among them, onlymutual fear, suspicion, and hatred. Tribal or ethnic rule has existed, at sometime, in every part of the world, and, in some country, in every period ofmankind’s history. The record of hatred is always the same. The worst kinds ofatrocities were perpetrated during ethnic (including religious) wars. A recentgrand-scale example of it was Nazi Germany.Warfare—permanent warfare—is the hallmark of tribal existence. A tribe—with itsrules, dogmas, traditions, and arrested mental development—is not a productiveorganization. Tribes subsist on the edge of starvation, at the mercy of naturaldisasters, less successfully than herds of animals. War against other,momentarily luckier tribes, in the hope of looting some meager hoard, is theirchronic emergency means of survival. The inculcation of hatred for other tribesis a necessary tool of tribal rulers, who need scapegoats to blame for themisery of their own subjects.There is no tyranny worse than ethnic rule—since it is an unchosen serfdom oneis asked to accept as a value, and since it applies primarily to one’s mind. Aman of self-esteem will not accept the notion that the content of his mind isdetermined by his muscles, i.e., by his own body. But by the bodies of anunspecified string of ancestors? Determinism by the means of production ispreferable; it is equally false, but less offensive to human dignity. Marxism iscorrupt, but clean compared to the stale, rank, musty odor of ethnicity.As to the stagnation under tribal rule—take a look at the Balkans. At the startof this century, the Balkans were regarded as the disgrace of Europe. Six oreight tribes, plus a number of subtribes with unpronounceable names, werecrowded on the Balkan peninsula, engaging in endless wars among themselves orbeing conquered by stronger neighbors or practicing violence for the sake ofviolence over some microscopic language differences. “Balkanization”—the breakupof larger nations into ethnic tribes—was used as a pejorative term by theEuropean intellectuals of the time. Those same intellectuals were patheticallyproud when they managed, after World War I, to glue most of the Balkan tribestogether into two larger countries: Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. But thetribes never vanished; they have been popping up in minor explosions all along,and a major one is possible at any time.In the light of tribalism’s historical record, it is ludicrous to compromisewith it, to hope for the best or to expect some sort of fair “group shares.”Nothing can be expected from tribalism except brutality and war. But this time,it is not with bows and arrows that the tribes will be armed, but with nuclearbombs.As a tiny preview of what tribalism would mean in a modern, technologicalcivilization, a story in The New York Times of January 23, I977, reports thatthe French-speaking Canadians of Quebec had demanded the use of French in allofficial dealings, including at airports, but “a federal court upheld a ban bythe federal Ministry of Transport on the use of French for landings atMontreal’s two international airports. (English is the language accepted atairports in every nation of the world.)”Let me remind you of the recent terrible collision of two planes in the CanaryIslands. Although all the personnel involved spoke English perfectly, theinvestigations seem to indicate that the collision was caused by linguisticmisunderstandings. But what is that to the Canadians of Quebec, or to Idi Aminof Uganda, or to any other ethnic tribalists who might demand that theirlanguage be spoken by every plane pilot in the world? Incidentally, thatcollision took place because the small airport was overcrowded with planes thatcould not land at a nearby major airport: the major airport had been bombed byethnic terrorists who were seeking the independence of the Canary Islands fromSpain.How long would the achievements of a technological civilization last under thissort of tribal management?Some people ask whether local groups or provinces have the right to secede fromthe country of which they are a part. The answer is: on ethnic grounds, no.Ethnicity is not a valid consideration, morally or politically, and does notendow anyone with any special rights. As to other than ethnic grounds, rememberthat rights belong only to individuals and that there is no such thing as “grouprights.” If a province wants to secede from a dictatorship, or even from a mixedeconomy, in order to establish a free country—it has the right to do so. But ifa local gang, ethnic or otherwise, wants to secede in order to establish its owngovernment controls, it does not have that right. No group has the right toviolate the rights of the individuals who happen to live in the same locality. Awish—individual or collective—is not a right.Is there a way to avoid the rebirth of global tribalism and the approach ofanother Dark Ages? Yes, there is, but only one way—through the rebirth of theantagonist that has demonstrated its power to relegate ethnicity to a peacefuldump: capitalism.Observe the paradoxes built up about capitalism. It has been called a system ofselfishness (which, in my sense of the term, it is)—yet it is the only systemthat drew men to unite on a large scale into great countries, and peacefully tocooperate across national boundaries, while all the collectivist,internationalist, One-World systems are splitting the world into Balkanizedtribes.Capitalism has been called a system of greed—yet it is the system that raisedthe standard of living of its poorest citizens to heights no collectivist systemhas ever begun to equal, and no tribal gang can conceive of.Capitalism has been called nationalistic—yet it is the only system that banishedethnicity, and made it possible, in the United States, for men of various,formerly antagonistic nationalities to live together in peace.Capitalism has been called cruel—yet it brought such hope, progress and generalgood will that the young people of today, who have not seen it, find it hard tobelieve.As to pride, dignity, self-confidence, self-esteem—these are characteristicsthat mark a man for martyrdom in a tribal society and under any social systemexcept capitalism.If you want an example of what had once been the spirit of America—a spiritwhich would be impossible today, but which we must now struggle to bring to arebirth—I will quote from an old poem that represents the opposite of the abjectself-abasement of ethnicity. It is a poem called “The Westerner” by BadgerClark.He begins with “My fathers sleep on the Eastern plain and each one sleepsalone”—he acknowledges his respect for his forefathers, then says:But I lean on no dead kin.My name is mine for fame or scorn,And the world began when I was born,And the world is mine to win."},{"pageContent":"13How to Read (and Not to Write)by Ayn RandThis article was published in The Ayn Rand Letter, September 25, 1972.“He was doling his sentences out with cautious slowness, balancing himselfbetween word and intonation to hit the right degree of semi-clarity. He wantedher to understand, but he did not want her to understand fully, explicitly, downto the root—since the essence of that modern language, which he had learned tospeak expertly, was never to let oneself or others understand anything down tothe root.” [Atlas Shrugged.]Today, this is the dominant method of communication in public speaking andwriting, particularly on the subject of politics. A recent editorial in The NewYork Times is a valuable specimen of that method—an unusually clear example ofthe art of unclarity.“The Fourth of July is a good time to remind ourselves that there is urgentnecessity for the nation’s intellectual and political leaders to provide moralguidance at a time when so many people feel that the nation has lost its way,”said the Times, concluding an editorial, on July 4, 1972.This statement is incontrovertibly true, and one would be tempted to say“amen”—but the rest of the editorial is a remarkable example of the reasons whythe nation has lost its way (though not in the sense the editorial intended).The most important issue confronting us today, the editorial declares, is “howto prevent powerful special interests from frustrating the democratic process.”No definitions are given, but the context suggests that “special interests”means pressure groups. This is not exactly a fundamental issue, but this is whatthe editorial regards as an urgent problem. To solve a problem, one mustidentify and correct or eliminate its causes; therefore, one would expect theeditorial writer to mention what caused the emergence of pressure groups. But hedoes not. He treats the subject as if pressure groups were facts of nature orirreducible primaries.It is interesting to wonder what went on in that writer’s mind in the spacebetween two paragraphs—because the editorial continues by attacking those whomight name the unnamed causes he did not find it necessary to mention:That issue is so difficult to solve because all the clear, simple extremes areunworkable. Given modern industrial technologies, this country cannot go back tothe highly atomistic, competitive model of the early nineteenth century—even ifit were willing to accept the workings of the marketplace as the arbiter of allsocial values and outcomes. But the experience of totalitarian and democraticsocieties alike suggests that mere substitution of the power of big governmentfor that of big business and the marketplace is no solution.As an exercise in intellectual precision, see how many things you can list aswrong in that one little paragraph. I shall indicate some of them (omitting theparagraph’s first sentence, which I shall take up later).If a euphemism is an inoffensive way of identifying an offensive fact, then“highly atomistic, competitive model” is an anti-euphemism, i.e., an offensiveway of identifying an inoffensive (or great and noble) fact—in this case,capitalism. “Competitive” is a definition by nonessentials; “atomistic” isworse. Capitalism involves competition as one of its proper consequences, not asits essential or defining attribute. “Atomistic” is usually intended to imply“scattered, broken up, disintegrated.” Capitalism is the system that madeproductive cooperation possible among men, on a large scale—a voluntarycooperation that raised everyone’s standard of living—as the nineteenth centuryhas demonstrated. So “atomistic” is an anti-euphemism, standing for “free,independent, individualistic.” If the editorial’s sentence were intended to befully understood, it would read: “this country cannot go back to the free,individualistic, private-property system of capitalism.”Now why would “modern industrial technologies” make a return to capitalismimpossible? No answer is given. It is fashionable to treat technology as a darkmystery, as a kind of black magic beyond the layman’s power to understand—so thephrase is just thrown in, as an ineffable threat. But observe that modernindustrial technology is a product of capitalism and, today, of the privatesector of the U.S. economy, which is still the freest economy on earth—observethe abysmal failure of the world’s most controlled economy, Soviet Russia, toapproach America’s technological achievements—observe the correlation, in allthe mixed economies, between the degree of a country’s freedom and the degree ofits technological development—and you will have grounds to suspect that thatphrase was thrown in to prevent you from realizing that modern industrialtechnology (if it is to survive) makes statism, not capitalism, impossible.The clause “even if it [this country] were willing to accept the workings of themarketplace as the arbiter of all social values and outcomes” is an attack on astraw man. No advocate of capitalism ever held the workings of the marketplaceas the arbiter of all social values and outcomes—only of the economic ones,i.e., those pertaining to production and trade. In a free marketplace, thesevalues and outcomes are determined by a free, general, “democratic” vote—by thesales, purchases, and choices of every individual. And—as one indication of thefact that, under capitalism, there are social values outside the power of themarketplace—each individual votes only on those matters which he is qualified tojudge: on his own preferences, interests, and needs. The paramount social valuehe has no power to encroach upon is: the rights of others. He cannot substitutehis vote and judgment for theirs; he cannot declare himself to be “the voice ofthe people” and leave the people disenfranchised.Is this what our country would be unwilling to accept?The last sentence of the quoted paragraph resorts to the shabby old gimmick ofequating opposites by substituting nonessentials for their essentialcharacteristics. In this case, the defacing acid, obliterating differences, isthe attribute of “bigness.” If a reader is to be made to feel that businessmenand dictators are interchangeably equal villains, he must be pushed to forgetthat a big productive genius, e.g., Henry Ford, Sr., and a big killer, e.g.,Stalin, are not the same thing—and that the difference between a totalitarianand a free society does not consist in substituting Stalin for Henry Ford, Sr.(For a discussion of the difference between economic and political power, see“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business” in my book Capitalism: The UnknownIdeal.)When the baser kind of politician resorts to that gimmick, he is counting on theugliest emotion of lesser people—envy—and if they confuse “bigness” with“greatness,” it serves his purpose. But why would a reputable newspaper do it?The editorial’s next paragraph gives a clue to the answer: “The crucial taskfacing the United States and other democratic societies is to find workableanswers between the extremes—to limit concentrations of corporate power withoutundermining the efficiency of business; to permit the market to allocateresources insofar as possible—but also to use adequate resources to achievesocially desirable purposes in response to the democratically exercised choicesof the society.”Who is to permit the market to allocate resources? Whose resources? What are“socially desirable purposes”? Who desires them—and at whose expense? Since thegreatest, the fundamental, factor (“resource”) of production is humanintelligence, is it to be disposed of by the “choices of the society”?No explicit answers are given. But observe the workings of the unnamed in theabove quotation. The two “extremes” are capitalism (i.e., freedom) andtotalitarianism (i.e., dictatorship). The “workable answers” are to be sought inthe middle, in a combination of these two. Observe the method suggested.Business efficiency must not be undermined (which is an implicit admission thatthis efficiency depends on freedom)—but government must control the developmentand limit the growth of business. The market must be kept free “insofar aspossible” —but if “society” desires some particular “purpose,” freedom becomesimpossible. Which of the two “extremes” is violated and which is given priorityin this suggested method?So it turns out that the editorial writer is advocating the very thing which hefalsely ascribed to capitalism: he is suggesting that the marketplace should bemade “the arbiter of all social values and outcomes”—not, however, the clean,economic marketplace, but the corrupt, political one. (An intrusion of politicalpower, i.e, of force, into the market is corrupt and corrupting, since itintroduces an opportunity for legalized looting.) He is using the word“democratic” in its original meaning, i.e., unlimited majority rule, and he isurging us to accept a social system in which one’s work, one’s property, one’smind, and one’s life are at the mercy of any gang that may muster the vote of amajority at any moment for any purpose.If this is a society’s system, no power on earth can prevent men from ganging upon one another in self-defense—i.e., from forming pressure groups.“There is no magic formula for reconciling those aims,” the editorial continues.“Instead, this nation and all others can only seek to diffuse power by suchmeasures as more effectively employing the antitrust laws ...” etc.After raising so momentous a problem as the attempt to mix freedom anddictatorship (an attempt which has brought us where we are today)—afterdemonstrating (between the lines) that these two extremes cannot mix and thatthere is, indeed, no magic formula for reconciling opposites or for having yourcake and eating it, too—the editorial proceeds to suggest such remedies as: themiserably false, decrepit notion of persecutions by antitrust laws; a “sense ofmission” in regulatory agencies; “new types of regulatory institutions” on theorder of “public-interest crusaders” with an “ ‘ombudsman’ role both within andoutside government” (i.e., the most vicious of pressure groups:quasi-governmental private groups); the abolition of “the illegal financing ofpolitical campaigns by great corporations or labor unions”; etc., etc. (with nota word about how to “diffuse” the other power in that mixture, the power of thegovernment).This is offered as moral guidance for a nation that has lost its way.If I were using that editorial for an actual test of reading comprehension, Iwould give A + to anyone who would discover why the word “moral” is introducedat the conclusion of a piece that does not discuss morality. If you look pastthe modern verbiage, you will find, smuggled between the lines, the thing whichthe editorial writer wants you “to understand, but not to understand fully,explicitly, down to the root”: altruism. It is not any practical considerations,not “modern industrial technologies,” or “the workings of the marketplace,” oreconomics, or politics, or reality, that make it impossible for us to return tocapitalism—to freedom, progress, abundance—it is the altruist moral code, whichthe editorial is struggling to preserve in the form of “socially desirablepurposes” that supersede individual rights. The “workable answer” it exhorts usto seek, is how to combine capitalism with the creed of self-sacrifice. Brother,it can’t be done. I have been saying it for years. You may take it now from thehorse’s mouth—from an editorial written, apparently, in the horse’s unguardedmoment.It is futile to bemoan this country’s moral decadence or blame politicians forthe “credibility gap” if this is the kind of guidance the nation is given by itsintellectual leaders. Credibility? It is almost a miracle that the nation hasmanaged to preserve some unconquerable element of decency and common sense,instead of collapsing altogether into a sewer of amoral, anti-intellectualcynicism and skepticism under a cultural barrage of that kind.Politicians are not the cause of a culture’s trend, only its consequence. Theyget their notions from the cultural atmosphere, particularly from newspapers,magazines, and TV commentaries; they speak as these media teach them to speak.Who teaches the media?And now we come down to the root: of all our institutions, it is theuniversities that are primarily responsible for this country losing its way—andof all the university departments, it is the departments of philosophy.If you want to see what makes things such as that editorial possible, you willfind the hoofprints of Pragmatism in two key sentences: “That issue is sodifficult to solve because all the clear, simple extremes are unworkable,” and:“There is no magic formula for reconciling those aims.”By “clear, simple extremes,” modern intellectuals mean any rational theory, anyconsistent system, any conceptual integration, any precise definition, any firmprinciple. Pragmatists do not mean that no such theory, system, or principle hasyet been discovered (and that we should look for one), but that none ispossible. Epistemologically, their dogmatic agnosticism holds, as an absolute,that a principle is false because it is a principle—that conceptual integration(i.e., thinking) is impractical or “simplistic” —that an idea which is clear andsimple is necessarily “extreme and unworkable.” Along with Kant, theirphilosophic forefather, the pragmatists claim, in effect: “If you perceive it,it cannot be real,” and: “If you conceive of it, it cannot be true.”What, then, is left to man? The sensation, the wish, the whim, the range, andthe concrete of the moment. Since no solution to any problem is possible,anyone’s suggestion, guess, or edict is as valid as anyone else‘s—provided it isnarrow enough.To give you an example: if a building were threatened with collapse and youdeclared that the crumbling foundation has to be rebuilt, a pragmatist wouldanswer that your solution is too abstract, extreme, unprovable, and thatimmediate priority must be given to the need of putting ornaments on the balconyrailings, because it would make the tenants feel better.There was a time when a man would not utter arguments of this sort, for fear ofbeing rightly considered a fool. Today, Pragmatism has not merely given himpermission to do it and liberated him from the necessity of thought, but haselevated his mental default into an intellectual virtue, has given him the rightto dismiss thinkers (or construction engineers) as naive, and has endowed himwith that typically modern quality: the arrogance of the concrete-bound, whotakes pride in not seeing the forest fire, or the forest, or the trees, while heis studying one inch of bark on a rotted tree stump.Like all of Kant’s progeny, modern philosophy has a single goal: the defeat ofreason. The degree to which such philosophers succeed is the degree to which menand nations lose their way in a deepening night of insolvable problems.The human products of that philosophy—on all levels of today’s society—are thecrude skeptics and another, more offensive breed: the professional “seeker oftruth” who hopes to God he’ll never find it.If you meet one of those (and they are ubiquitous), you will find the answer tohis problems—and to the dilemmas of modern philosophy—in another passage fromAtlas Shrugged: “Do you cry that you find no answers? By what means did you hopeto find them? You reject your tool of perception-your mind—then complain thatthe universe is a mystery. You discard your key, then wail that all doors arelocked against you. You start out in pursuit of the irrational, then damnexistence for making no sense.”"},{"pageContent":"14The Lessons of Vietnamby Ayn RandThis article was written in May 1975, a few weeks after the fall of SouthVietnam to the Communists. Because The Ayn Rand Letter was behind schedule atthe time, the article was published in the issues dated August 26 and September9, 1974.The televised scenes of South Vietnam’s sudden collapse at Da Nang seemed oddlyfamilliar to me; they had a faded, distant quality of déjà vu. The scenes ofpeople in hopeless flight, the panic, the despair, the frantic struggle for afoothold on the last plane or ship leaving a doomed land, with everything leftbehind and nothing ahead—people running into a void outside history, as ifsqueezed off the face of the earth—I had seen it all before. It took me a momentand a shock of sadness to realize where I had seen it: this was the Russianpopulation fleeing before the advance of the Red Army in the civil war of1918-21.The newscaster’s voice said that fleeing South Vietnamese soldiers had seizedcontrol of an American rescue ship and had proceeded to rob, rape, and murderrefugees, their own countrymen. I felt indignation, disgust, disappointment—and,again, a faint touch of familiarity. The shock was more painful, this time, whenI realized that this was an example of the ignominious amorality of theso-called political right.Let me hasten to say that individual brutes exist.in any army and cannot betaken as representative of an entire people; that the atrocities committed bythose particular South Vietnamese would not even be reported if and whencommitted by the North Vietnamese, since such atrocities represent the official,ideological policy of North Vietnam; that South Vietnam does not represent thepolitical right or the political anything. Granting all this, it is still truethat if a group of soldiers attack their own countrymen in the midst of anational disaster, it means that attackers and victims have no values in common,not even the solidarity of primitive tribalism, that they have nothing to upholdor defend militarily, that they do not know what they are fighting for. And, intoday’s world, there is no one to tell them.I was in my early teens during the Russian civil war. I lived in a small townthat changed hands many times. (See We the Living; that part of the story isautobiographical.) When it was occupied by the White Army, I almost longed forthe return of the Red Army, and vice versa. There was not much differencebetween them in practice, but there was in theory. The Red Army stood fortotalitarian dictatorship and rule by terror. The White Army stood for nothing;repeat: nothing. In answer to the monstrous evil they were fighting, the Whitesfound nothing better to proclaim than the dustiest, smelliest bromides of thetime: we must fight, they said, for Holy Mother Russia, for faith and tradition.I wondered, even in those years, which is morally worse: evil—or the appeasementof evil, the cowardly evasion that leaves an evil unnamed, unanswered andunchallenged. I was inclined to think that the second is worse, because it makesthe first possible. I am certain of it today. But in the years of myadolescence, I did not know how rare a virtue intellectual integrity (i.e., thenon-evasion of reality) actually is. So I kept waiting for some person or groupamong the Whites to come out with a real political manifesto that would explainand proclaim why one must fight against communism and what one might fight for.I knew even then that the “what” was freedom, individual freedom, and (a conceptalien to Russia) individual rights.I knew that man is not a slave of the state; I knew that man’s right to his ownlife (and, therefore, to freedom) has to be upheld with as great and proud asense of moral righteousness as any idea could ever deserve; I knew that nothingless would do—and that without such a stand the anti-Reds were doomed. But Ithought that this was self-evident, that the whole civilized world knew it, andthat there surely existed some minds able to communicate this knowledge toRussia, which was perishing for lack of it. I waited through the years of thecivil war. Nothing resembling that manifesto was ever uttered by anyone.In a passive, indifferent way, the majority of the Russian people were behindthe White Army: they were not for the Whites, but merely against the Reds; theyfeared the Reds’ atrocities. I knew that the Reds’ deepest atrocity wasintellectual, that the thing which had to be fought—and defeated—was theirideas. But no one answered them. The country’s passivity turned to hopelesslethargy as people gave up. The Reds had an incentive, the promise of nationwidelooting; they had the leadership and the semi-discipline of a criminal gang;they had an allegedly intellectual program and an allegedly moral justification.The Whites had icons. The Reds won.I learned a great deal in the years since. I learned that the concept ofindividual rights is far, far from self-evident, that most of the world does notgrasp it, that the United States grasped it only for a brief historical momentand is now in the process of losing the memory. I learned that the civilizedworld is being destroyed by its dominant schools of philosophy—by irrationalism,altruism, collectivism—and, specifically, that altruism is the tear gas thatdefeats resistance, by reducing men to crying and vomiting.The hardest thing to learn (the most difficult one to believe) was the fact thatthe so-called political rightists in this country—the alleged defenders offreedom (i.e., of capitalism)—were as vague, as empty, and as futile as theleaders of the White Army (more shamefully so, since they had a much, muchgreater knowledge to evade). For years the intellectual posture of America’spolitical leaders has been a long, pleading, appeasing, self-abasing whine ofapology for this country’s greatness—an apology addressed to every advocate orperpetrator of collectivism’s horrors and failures anywhere on earth.But even American politicians had some sort of stature when compared to theirintellectual mentors, those (to me, still incredible) bipeds who—unable to finda moral justification for man’s life and happiness—attempted to defend freedomon the grounds of altruism (of the “public good”), or on the grounds of faith inthe supernatural, or on the grounds of brushing the issue aside and proclaimingthat morality is irrelevant to economics (i.e., to man’s life and livelihood).(At a certain point in recent years, I realized with astonishment that the kindof voice and manifesto I had been waiting for was my own. No, this is not aboast; it is an admission of a sort I don’t like to make: a complaint. [I don’tlike self-pity.] I did not want, intend, or expect to be the only philosophicaldefender of man’s rights, in the country of man’s rights. But if I am, I am.And, dear reader, if I am giving you the kind of intellectual ammunition [andinspiration] I had so desperately waited to hear in my youth, I’m glad. I cansay that I know how you feel.)No country could stand for long on the kind of moral erosion that the altruistsand amoralists of the right had done their best to aid and abet. The war inVietnam was the result and dramatization of that erosion. The military collapseof South Vietnam was preceded by the philosophical collapse of the United Statessome decades earlier.It was a shameful war—not for the reasons which leftists and sundry friends ofNorth Vietnam are proclaiming, but for the exactly opposite reasons: shamefulbecause it was a war which the U.S. had no selfish reason to fight, because itserved no national interest, because we had nothing to gain from it, because thelives and the heroism of thousands of American soldiers (and the billions ofAmerican wealth) were sacrificed in pure compliance with the ethics of altruism,i.e., selflessly and senselessly.In compliance with epistemological irrationalism, it was a war and a non-war atthe same time. It was a modern monstrosity called a “no win” war, in which theAmerican forces were not permitted to act, but only to react: they were to“contain” the enemy, but not to beat him.In compliance with modern politics, the war was allegedly intended to save SouthVietnam from communism, but the proclaimed purpose of the war was not to protectfreedom or individual rights, it was not to establish capitalism or anyparticular social system—it was to uphold the South Vietnamese right to“national self-determination,” i.e., the right to vote themselves into any sortof system (including communism, as American propagandists kept proclaiming).The right to vote is a consequence, not a primary cause, of a free socialsystem—and its value depends on the constitutional structure implementing andstrictly delimiting the voters’ power; unlimited majority rule is an instance ofthe principle of tyranny. Outside the context of a free society, who would wantto die for the right to vote? Yet that is what the American soldiers were askedto die for—not even for their own vote, but to secure that privilege for theSouth Vietnamese, who had no other rights and no knowledge of rights or freedom.Picking up the liberals’ discarded old slogan of World War I days—“theself-determination of nations”—the American conservatives were trying to hidethe American system, capitalism, under some sort of collectivistic cover. And itis not capitalism that most of them were (and are) advocating, it was a mixedeconomy. Who would want to die for a mixed economy?In compliance with a Hegelian sort of “A is non-A” metaphysics, both sides keptcontradicting their professed beliefs. Soviet Russia, who regards men as theproperty and fodder of the state, did not send soldiers to North Vietnam (shecould not trust them to fight, so she sent only military supplies). The UnitedStates, whose foundation is the supremacy of man’s right to life, sent soldiersto die in South Vietnam. Soviet Russia, the philosophical apostle ofmaterialism, won the war in Vietnam by spiritual, i.e., moral-intellectual,means: the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong were thoroughly indoctrinated withthe notion of the righteousness of their cause. The United States—whose modernleadership scorns materialism and professes to be moved by purely spiritualbeliefs (mystical-religious on the right, tribalist and anti-industrial on theleft)—abstained from proclaiming any moral principles or any principleswhatever, and relied on an abundance of material supplies to fight the war, anabundance of planes, bombs, and guns in the hands of men who had no idea of whythey should use them.The savagely primitive farmers of North Vietnam had an incentive, the promise oflooting the richer, industrialized South; they had the leadership and thesemi-discipline of a criminal gang; they had an allegedly intellectual program,Marxism, and an allegedly moral justification: altruism, the sacrifice of all tosome “higher” cause. The South Vietnamese had nothing but some mixed-economyechoes of the same altruism. The North Vietnamese won.As a rule, there is an ugly period of gloating among the winners and of bitterbuck-passing among the losers following a war. But I do not know of a historicalprecedent for the spectacle displayed by American intellectuals: an explosion ofgloating over America’s “defeat,” of proclaiming America’s “weakness,” ofdenouncing America’s “guilt,” of glorifying and glamorizing the enemy, ofpelting America with insults, accusations, humiliations—like an orgy of spittingat their own country’s face.When a national catastrophe, such as the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, has nogenerally known reason and no clearly perceivable cause, one may find leads tosome contributory causes by observing who profits from the catastrophe. Theintellectuals are the profiteers on the Vietnam war. They are of so miserablysmall a stature that it would be impossible to suspect them of causing thedisaster. They are not lions, but jackals. (The lion who avenged himself for toolong a neglect was philosophy, which left the U.S. vulnerable to the jackals.)What are the suspicious paw prints of a scavenger pack?Observe the double-standard switch of the anti-concept of “isolationism.” Thesame intellectual groups (and even some of the same aging individuals) whocoined that anti-concept in World War II—and used it to denounce any patrioticopponent of America’s self-immolation—the same groups who screamed that it wasour duty to save the world (when the enemy was Germany or Italy or fascism) arenow rabid isolationists who denounce any U.S. concern with countries fightingfor freedom, when the enemy is communism and Soviet Russia.The catch phrase of these new isolationists is a shabby little equivocation tothe effect that “other countries are not ours to lose”—e.g., we did not loseSouth Vietnam (or China, or Hungary, or Czechoslovakia) because it was not oursto lose—i.e., the fate of other countries is none of our business. This means:other countries are not ours to judge, to deal with, to trade with, or to help.(Unless it is help with no strings attached, i.e., help without moral judgment,political appraisal, or even humanitarian concern about the results—as demandedby Laos, when it threw out a U.S. aid agency, but wanted the U.S. money turnedover to the Laotian government.)The purpose of this new isolationism is to play on the American people’slegitimate weariness, confusion, and anger over Vietnam in the hope of makingthe U.S. government afraid to become involved in another foreign war of anykind. This would paralyze the U.S. in the conduct of any foreign policy notagreeable to Soviet Russia. The first intended victim of the new isolationismwill probably be Israel—if the “antiwar” efforts of the new isolationistssucceed. (Israel and Taiwan are the two countries that need and deserve U.S.help—not in the name of international altruism, but by reason of actual U.S.national interests in the Mediterranean and the Pacific.)To oppose the spread of communism is a worthy goal. But one cannot oppose it injungle villages while surrendering civilized countries—and one cannot oppose itby hiding from the world the nature and the moral meaning of communism’s onlyopposite and enemy: capitalism. To use America’s phony involvement in Vietnam asa scarecrow to keep us away from the real, the essential centers of the fightagainst communism—this is the current gimmick or policy of theneo-isolationists.Observe the frame-up staged against America’s military power.One of the methods used by statists to destroy capitalism consists inestablishing controls that tie a given industry hand and foot, making it unableto solve its problems, then declaring that freedom has failed and strongercontrols are necessary. A similar frame-up is now being perpetrated againstAmerica’s military power. It is claimed that the U.S. forces were defeated—in awar they had never been allowed to fight. They were defeated, it is claimed, twoyears after their withdrawal from Vietnam. The ignominious collapse of the SouthVietnamese when left on their own is being acclaimed as an American militaryfailure.There is no doubt that America’s entire involvement in Vietnam is a failureunworthy of a great power. It is a moral failure, a diplomatic failure, apolitical failure, a philosophical failure—the failure of American politiciansand of their intellectual advisers. But to regard it as a military failure isworse than outrageous when you consider the heroic performance of Americans in awar they should never have had to fight. If there are meh or groups with avested interest in creating an impression of America’s military weakness, useyour own judgment as to their nature and goals.Now observe the moral bankruptcy of the “humanitarians.” After decades of everlouder protestations of compassionate concern with every possible form ofsuffering—the suffering of the poor, the young, the old, the female, the black,the brown, the Indian, the sick, the weak, the illiterate, the retarded, thecriminal, the psychotic—after such a barrage of pleas and threats, of saccharineand blood, that one could be tempted, in protest, to hate babies and kittens,the altruists have suddenly shut up before an unprecedented atrocity of historicscale: the murder of a city, the evacuation of Phnom Penh.A horde of savages that would make Attila look civilized by comparison has giventhe world a perfect concretization of three abstractions which civilized menhave taken with too foggy a tolerance: collectivism, which regards individuallives as of no value—the rule of force, which implements the whims of thesubhuman—ecology as a social principle, which condemns cities, culture,industry, technology, the intellect, and advocates men’s return to “nature,” tothe state of grunting subanimals digging the soil with their bare hands.Since the Khmer Rouge are peasants who feel hatred for cities, the inhabitantsof Phnom Penh—its entire population without exceptions—were ordered to march outof the city and to go on marching until they reached uninhabited countryside,where they were to start farming on their own, without knowledge, tools, orseed. This order applied to everyone: young and old, rich and poor, men, women,and children, the well and the ill, even the crippled and, according to a newsreport, even the hospital patients who had just had their legs amputated.Everyone was ordered to walk. They walked.This is all we know. There have been no further reports on the fate of thatevacuation. After a few shocked remarks, there were no protests from our mediaor from those liberal altruists who cry over the victims of “relative poverty”in America. The liberals had been minimizing or ridiculing the conservatives’fear that a “blood bath” would follow a communist victory. If human sufferingconcerned them at all, one would expect the altruists to scream their heads offagainst an atrocity which is worse than a blood bath: a mass execution bylong-drawn-out torture. But the altruists have shut their traps. So have thealtruists of Europe. There has been no significant protest from the hundreds ofworld organizations devoted to the relief of suffering, including thatcontemptible citadel of global hypocrisy, the U.N.The best commentary on Phnom Penh, of those I have read, was “Get Out of Town”by William Safire, a conservative (The New York Times, May 12, 1975).In all human history nothing has taken place quite like the emptying of PhnomPenh. Sennacherib destroyed Babylon, the Romans sacked Carthage, and Hitler’sbombers leveled Guernica, but in every case the attacker was destroying aparticular city, not the idea of a city itself.... A city is civilization;civilization is diversity and creativity, which needs personal freedom;Communism is by its nature anti-city, anti-civilization, anti-freedom. The KhmerRouge understand this; too many Americans do not.To go from the horrendous to the grotesque, consider the Mayaguez incident. Ihasten to say that were it not for the proper and highly moral action taken byPresident Ford, the consequences of that incident could have been morehorrendous than Phnom Penh. That a small band of those same Cambodian savagesdared seize an unarmed American ship was such an affront to America (and tocivilization) that the collapse of international law would have followed ifPresident Ford had not acted as he did. [President Ford used air, sea, andground forces to free the ship.] To borrow Senator Goldwater’s very appropriatephrase, every “half-assed nation” would have felt free to attack the U.S.—whichwould have meant world rule by terrorist gangs.We shall never know whether the seizure of the Mayaguez was a deliberateprovocation to test what the global communist scum could get away with—or thespontaneous feat of a local gang drunk with power and acting more royalist thantheir kings. But this does not concern us: in either case, when a foreigncountry initiates the use of armed force against us, it is our moral obligationto answer by force—as promptly and unequivocally as is necessary to make itclear that the matter is nonnegotiable.Believe it or not, some American intellectuals (and some politicians) objectedto President Ford’s action. Mr. Anthony Lewis went so far as to declare it wasAmerica that was “a bully among nations, acting without consultation, withoutconcern for facts or principle.” [The Times, May 19, 1975] His principle (andfilthy accusations) rests on the fact that “we allowed less than a day and ahalf for a response from the untried and isolated government of a shatteredcountry.” After which, he struggles to prove that part of the U.S. bombing of aCambodian airport “could only have been punitive in purpose.” (I hope so.)This is international altruism gone wild. It demands that the U.S. give upself-defense in order to make allowances for an “untried government.” (Thismeans, I suppose, that we should wait until that government has gainedexperience in attacking us.) If those Cambodian brutes were so ignorant as topermit themselves an attack on a U.S. ship, the more reason to use force inanswer, in order to teach them caution in the future; force is the only languagethat totalitarian brutes understand.An interesting appraisal of the Mayaguez incident was given by C. L. Sulzberger,a liberal, who hailed President Ford’s action in a column entitled “Just Whatthe Doctor Ordered.” [The Times, May 17, 1975] Since Mr. Sulzberger’s columnsdeal mainly with the reactions of other countries to U.S. foreign policy, hisenthusiasm in this instance is significant, revealing, and almost pathetic: itshows the extent of the dismal, gray hopelessness previously conveyed by ourinternational diplomacy. “Small as the incident may later seem in history, apolluting stain is being erased from the previous American image of lassitude,uncertainty, and pessimism. This is a matter of world ideological concern aswell as strategic balances because too many democracies are sick.... Now a newvibrancy creeps into the picture.”Mr. Sulzberger explains:The internationally renowned ‘American tempo’ and productivity still lag and thework ethic with its emphasis on speed and efficiency—whether prompted bypuritanism or by the capitalistic profit motive—has certainly undergone visibleand withering change. In this uncertain age American flabbiness is ... harmfulto the United States.In the absence of American leadership, Mr. Sulzberger concludes, many Westerncountries were left adrift. “Now Gerald Ford seems to have put an end to thatsad phase. Abruptly he has shown Americans and the world that he knows how toget where he wishes to go. Hopefully, he also possesses a good sense ofdirection.”Nobody respects an altruist, neither in private life nor in internationalaffairs. An altruist is a person who keeps sacrificing himself and his values,which means: sacrificing his friends to his enemies, his allies to hisantagonists, his interests to any cry for help, his strength to anyone’sweakness, his convictions to anyone’s wishes, the truth to any lie, the good toany evil. How would you tell an altruist’s treacherously unpredictable policyfrom that of a cowardly milquetoast? And what difference would it make to hisvictims? A man practicing such a policy would be mistrusted and despised byeveryone, including the profiteers on his “generosity”—yet this is the policywhich the U.S. has come as close to practicing as any nation ever could. And ifforeign countries are now cheering the sight of a giant, the U.S., standing upto a flea, Cambodia, it is the (momentary) defeat of altruism that they arecheering unknowingly, it is America’s liberation from altruism’s flabbiness, itis America’s declaration to all the fleas of the world that the world is not toperish as a meal for fleas.The American people’s reaction to the Mayaguez incident was a great—andtragic—demonstration of America’s sense of life. Great, because when the newsbroke out, the letters and wires received at the White House ran—ten to one—insupport of President Ford’s intention to use military force against Cambodia.The American people—battered by disillusionment over a senseless war and byvicious pro-enemy, antiwar propaganda—could have had an excuse to fear andoppose the potential risk of another war in the same geographical area. But theydid not. They understood the principle involved; they were willing to fight, butnot to accept an affront. (Which, incidentally, is the only way to avoid a war,but not many leaders said so.) This grasp of principles, when the chips aredown, this proudly rebellious independence in the face of lies and threats, iswhat defeats the calculations of the manipulators, foreign or domestic, whoattempt to con the American people.The tragedy lies in the fact that these American characteristics can come intoplay only when the chips are down. A sense of life cannot foresee or prevent acatastrophe; it cannot save people from moving toward a disaster by single,gradual steps. Foresight and prevention are the task of conscious thought andknowledge, i.e., of political philosophy. In regard to a nation, they are thetask of the intellectuals.Just as Russia collapsed through the philosophical bankruptcy of itsanticommunists, so did China—so did every rebellion against communist rule, inHungary, in Czechoslovakia, in Poiand—so did, does, and will every attempt tohold out a mixed economy (and/or socialism!) as an alternative to communismworth fighting and dying for. The greatest intellectual crime today is that ofthe alleged “rightists” in this country: with reason, reality, and (potentially)an overwhelming majority of the American people on their side, they are afraidto assume the responsibility of a moral crusade for America’s values—i.e., forcapitalism (with everything this necessitates). Observe the extent to which thetear gas of altruism is making them squirm. But unless men are brave enough toventilate this country’s moral atmosphere, they have no chance. For a nation, asfor a man, a Declaration of Independence implies a declaration of self-esteem.Neither can stand without the other.Much as I admire President Ford’s conduct in the Mayaguez incident, there aremany aspects of his policies with which I do not agree. The relevant one here ishis appeal to leave Vietnam behind us and to avoid “recriminations” over thatwar. The lessons of Vietnam, he claims, have been learned. Have they?What—and who—got us into that war? Why? For what reason and purpose? How did awar advocated and begun by the liberals (mainly by Presidents Kennedy andJohnson) become the conservatives’ war? Isn’t a moral obscenity such as a “nowin” war unconstitutional—as a violation of the soldiers’ right to life—since itturns soldiers into cannon fodder?These are just a few of the questions to which the country has no clear answers.The Vietnam war is one of the most disastrous foreign-policy failures in U.S.history. We spent two years investigating everything connected with sevenburglars sent by a bunch of politicians to bug the headquarters of another bunchof politicians. What was that compared to the enormity of Vietnam? We kepthearing, and are still hearing, that Watergate represented a threat to ourrights, our freedom, our social system, and our Constitution. What was Vietnam?Shouldn’t there be an investigation of the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, wider,deeper, and more thorough than the investigation of Watergate—with nationallytelevised Congressional hear ings, with dozens of famous witnesses, with dailyheadlines, editorials, debates, etc.? The purpose? To discover the causes inorder to avoid the recurrence (or the continuation) of the policies that led toVietnam.Such an investigation would not be likely to uncover any crimes other thanintellectual ones—but try to imagine the magnitude of those! Intellectual crimescannot—and need not—be punished by law: the only punishment required isexposure. But who would conduct such an inquiry? Who would be able to ask theright questions, and integrate the answers, and point out the contradictions,and hammer at the evasions, and bring out the fundamental issues? Obviously,this is not a task for politicians, it is a task for theoretical thinkers, forintellectuals, for philosophers. But today they are the men who were responsiblefor the kind of thinking that was responsible for our involvement in Vietnam.This is the reason why no such investigation can or will be held today. And thisis the all-inclusive lesson to be learned from Vietnam."},{"pageContent":"15The Sanction of the Victimsby Ayn RandThis is Ayn Rand’s last piece of writing. She delivered the lecture in NewOrleans on November 21, 1981, before an audience of businessmen attendingseminars sponsored by the National Committee for Monetary Reform. She wasplanning to give it again at the Ford Hall Forum ; I delivered it there in herstead on April 25, 1982, some six weeks after her death. It was published in TheObjectivist Forum, April 1982.Since the subject of these seminars is investment, I must start by stating thatI am not an economist and have no purely economic advice to give you. But what Iam anxious to discuss with you are the preconditions that make it possible foryou to gain and to keep the money which you can then invest.I shall start by asking a question on a borrowed premise: What human occupationis the most useful socially?The borrowed premise is the concept of social usefulness. It is not part of myphilosophy to evaluate things by a social standard. But this is the predominantstandard of value today. And sometimes it can be very enlightening to adopt theenemy’s standard. So let us borrow the notion of “social” concern for just alittle while—just long enough to answer the question: What human occupation isthe most useful socially?Since man’s basic tool of survival is his mind, the most crucially importantoccupation is the discovery of knowledge—i.e., the occupation of scientists. Butscientists are not concerned with society, with social issues or with other men.Scientists are, essentially, loners; they pursue knowledge for the sake ofknowledge. A great many scientific—and technological—facts were known before theIndustrial Revolution, and did not affect human existence. The steam engine, forinstance, was known in ancient Greece. But knowledge of that sort remained anexclusive concern that lived and died with scientists—and, for century aftercentury, had no connection to the lives of the rest of mankind.Now, suppose that a group of men decided to make it their job to bring theresults of the achievements of science within the reach of men—to applyscientific knowledge to the improvement of man’s life on earth. Wouldn’t suchmen be the greatest social benefactors (as they have been since the IndustrialRevolution)? Shouldn’t the socially concerned humanitarians, those who holdsocial usefulness as their highest value, regard such men as heroes?If I say: No, such men are not regarded as heroes today—they are the most hated,blamed, denounced men in the humanitarians’ society—would you believe me? Orwould you think that I’m inventing some sort of irrational fiction? And wouldyou say that something is wrong—terribly wrong—in such a society?But this isn’t all; there is something much worse. It isn’t merely the fact thatthese heroic men are the victims of an unspeakable injustice: it is the factthat they are first to perpetrate that injustice against themselves—that theyadopt a public “stance” of perpetual apology and universal appeasement,proclaiming themselves guilty of an unspecified evil, begging the forgiveness ofevery two-bit intellectual, every unskilled laborer, every unemployedpolitician. No, this is not fiction. That country is the United States ofAmerica today. That self-destroying group of men is you, the Americanbusinessmen.When I say “you,” I mean the group as a whole—I accept the tenet that presentcompany is excepted. However, if any of you find a shoe that fits, wear it withmy compliments.Karl Marx predicted that capitalism would commit suicide. The Americanbusinessmen are carrying out that prediction. In destroying themselves, they aredestroying capitalism, of which they are the symbol and product—and America,which is the greatest and freest example of capitalism mankind has ever reached.There is no outside power that can destroy such men and such a country. Only aninner power can do it: the power of morality. More specifically: the power of acontemptibly evil idea accepted as a moral principle—altruism.Remember that “altruism” does not mean kindness or consideration for other men.Altruism is a moral theory which preaches that man must sacrifice himself forothers, that he must place the interest of others above his own, that he mustlive for the sake of others.Altruism is a monstrous notion. It is the morality of cannibals devouring oneanother. It is a theory of profound hatred for man, for reason, for achievement,for any form of human success or happiness on earth.Altruism is incompatible with capitalism—and with businessmen. Businessmen are acheerful, benevolent, optimistic, predominantly American phenomenon. The essenceof their job is the constant struggle to improve human life, to satisfy humanneeds and desires—not to practice resignation, surrender, and worship ofsuffering. And here is the profound gulf between businessmen and altruism:businessmen do not sacrifice themselves to others—if they did, they would be outof business in a few months or days—they profit, they grow rich, they arerewarded, as they should be. This is what the altruists, the collectivists andother sundry “humanitarians” hate the businessmen for: that they pursue apersonal goal and succeed at it. Do not fool yourself by thinking that altruistsare motivated by compassion for the suffering: they are motivated by hatred forthe successful.The evidence is all around us, but one small example sticks in my mind asextremely eloquent. In the early 1930s an assistant of Jane Addams, the famoussocial worker, went on a visit to Soviet Russia and wrote a book about herexperience. The sentence I remember is: “How wonderful it was to see everybodyequally shabby!” If you think you should try to appease the altruists, this iswhat you are appeasing.The great tragedy of capitalism and of America is the fact that most businessmenhave accepted the morality of altruism and are trying to live up to it—whichmeans that they are doomed before they start.Another, contributory evil is the philosophical root of altruism, which is:mysticism—the belief in the supernatural, which preaches contempt for matter,for wealth, well-being, or happiness on earth. The mystics are constantly cryingappeals for your pity, your compassion, your help to the less fortunate—yet theyare condemning you for all the qualities of character that make you able to helpthem.Evil theories have to rely on evil means in order to hold their victims.Altruism and collectivism cannot appeal to human virtues—they have to appeal tohuman weaknesses. And where there are not enough weaknesses, they have tomanufacture them. It is in the nature of altruists and collectivists that themore they need a person or a group, the more they denounce their victims, induceguilt, and struggle never to let the victims discover their own importance andacquire self-esteem. The businessmen are needed most by the so-called“humanitarians” —because the businessmen produce the sustenance the“humanitarians” are unable to produce. Doctors come next in the hierarchy ofbeing needed—and observe the hostility, the denunciations, and the attempts toenslave the doctors in today’s society.Most businessmen today have accepted the feeling of guilt induced in them by thealtruists. They are accused of anything and everything; for instance, theecologists denounce businessmen’s refusal to sacrifice themselves to the snaildarter and the furbish lousewort.But the businessmen’s actual guilt is their treason against themselves, which isalso their treason against their country. The statement that aroused such furyamong the collectivists—“What’s good for General Motors is good for thecountry”—was true. And the reverse is also true: What’s bad for industry is badfor the country.I am here to ask you a question on my own—not on borrowed—premises: What are youdoing to the advocates of capitalism, particularly the young?Appeasement is a betrayal not only of one’s own values, but of all those whoshare one’s values. If—for whatever misguided reason—businessmen are indifferentto and ignorant of philosophy, particularly moral and political philosophy, itwould be better if they kept silent rather than spread the horribleadvertisements that make us cringe with embarrassment. By “us” I mean advocatesof capitalism. Mobil Oil ran ads in the New York Times which stated thefollowing (I quote from memory): “Of the expression free, private, responsibleenterprise, we strike out ‘free’ and ’private’ as nonessential.” One of the bigindustries advertises on television that they are full of “people working forpeople,” and some other big company announces on television that its goal is“ideas that help people.” (I do not know what the ghastly P.R. men who come upwith these slogans wanted us to think: that the companies worked “for free,” orthat they traded with people rather than with animals?)The worst of the bunch is some new group in Washington, D.C., called somethinglike “Committee for the American Way,” which puts out a television commercialshowing some ugly, commonplace people of all kinds, each proclaiming that helikes a different type of music (“I like rock ’n roll.” “And I like jazz.” “AndI like Beethoven” etc.)—ending on a voice declaring: “This is the Americanway—with every man entitled to have and express his own opinion.”I, who come from Soviet Russia, can assure you that debates and differences ofthat kind were and are permitted in Soviet Russia. What about political orphilosophical issues? Why didn’t those upholders of the American Way show peopledisagreeing about nuclear weapons? Or about abortion? Or about “affirmativeaction”? If that committee stands for the American Way—there is no such Way anylonger.Observe also that in today’s proliferation of pressure groups, the lowest sortof unskilled laborer is regarded as “the public,” and presents claims to societyin the name of “the public interest,” and is encouraged to assert his “right” toa livelihood—but the businessmen, the intelligent, the creative, the successfulmen who make the laborer’s livelihood possible, have no rights, and no(legitimate) interests, are not entitled to their livelihood (their profits),and are not part of “the public.”Every kind of ethnic group is enormously sensitive to any slight. If one made aderogatory remark about the Kurds of Iran, dozens of voices would leap to theirdefense. But no one speaks out for businessmen, when they are attacked andinsulted by everyone as a matter of routine.What causes this overwhelming injustice? The businessmen’s own policies: theirbetrayal of their own values, their appeasement of enemies, theircompromises—all of which add up to an air of moral cowardice. Add to it the factthat businessmen are creating and supporting their own destroyers.The sources and centers of today’s philosophical corruption are theuniversities. Businessmen are both contemptuous of and superstitiouslyfrightened by the subject of philosophy. There is a vicious circle involvedhere: businessmen have good ground to despise philosophy as it is taught today,but it is taught that way because businessmen abandoned the intellect to thelowest rungs of the unemployables. All the conditions and ideas necessary toturn men into abjectly helpless serfs of dictatorship, rule the institutes oftoday’s higher education as a tight monopoly, with very few and rare exceptions.Hatred of reason and worship of blind emotions, hatred of the individual andworship of the collective, hatred of success and worship of self-sacrifice—theseare the fundamental notions that dominate today’s universities. These notionscondition (and paralyze) the minds of the young.If you want to discover how a country’s philosophy determines its history, Iurge you to read The Ominous Parallels by Leônard Peikoff [Mentor, 1983]. Thisbrilliant book presents the philosophical similarities between the state ofAmerica’s culture today and the state of Germany’s culture in the WeimarRepublic in the years preceding the rise of Nazism.It is the businessmen’s money that supports American universities—not merely inthe form of taxes and government handouts, but much worse: in the form ofvoluntary, private contributions, donations, endowments, etc. In preparation forthis lecture, I tried to do some research on the nature and amounts of suchcontributions. I had to give it up: it is too complex and too vast a field forthe efforts of one person. To untangle it now would require a major researchproject and, probably, years of work. All I can say is that millions andmillions and millions of dollars are being donated to universities by bigbusiness enterprises every year, and that the donors have no idea of what theirmoney is being spent on or whom it is supporting. What is certain is only thefact that some of the worst anti-business, anti-capitalism propaganda has beenfinanced by businessmen in such projects.Money is a great power—because in a free or even a semi-free society, it is afrozen form of productive energy. And, therefore, the spending of money is agrave responsibility. Contrary to the altruists and the advocates of theso-called “academic freedom,” it is a moral crime to give money to support ideaswith which you disagree; it means: ideas which you consider wrong, false, evil.It is a moral crime to give money to support your own destroyers. Yet that iswhat businessmen are doing with such reckless irresponsibility.On the faculties of most colleges and universities, the advocates of reason,individualism and capitalism are a very small minority, often represented by afeeble specimen of window dressing. But the valiant minority of authenticfighters is struggling against overwhelming odds and growing, very slowly. Thehardships, the injustices, and the persecutions suffered by these youngadvocates of reason and capitalism are too terrible a story to be told briefly.These are the young people whom businessmen should support. Or, if businessmenare too ignorant of academic issues, they should leave academic matters alone.But to support irrationalists, nihilists, socialists, and communists—who form animpenetrable barrier against the young advocates of capitalism, denying themjobs, recognition, or a mere hearing—is an unforgivable outrage on the part ofirresponsible businessmen who imagine that it is morally safe to give money toinstitutions of higher learning.The lasting influence of the universities is caused by the fact that most peoplequestion the truth or falsehood of philosophical ideas only in their youth, andwhatever they learn in college marks them for life. If they are givenintellectual poison, as they are today, they carry it into their professions,particularly in the humanities. Observe the lifeless grayness, the boringmediocrity of today’s culture—the empty pretentiousness and mawkishsentimentality of today’s stage, screen, and television writing. There are noserious dramas any longer—and such few as attempt to be serious are of aleftist-collectivist persuasion.On this subject, I can speak from personal experience. For several years, adistinguished producer in Hollywood has been attempting to make a televisionmini-series or a movie of my novel Atlas Shrugged. He was stopped on two counts:(1) he could not find a writer able to write a Romantic drama, even though thereare many good writers in Hollywood; and (2) he could not raise the money for hisproject.Allow me to say, even though I do not like to say it, that if there existed anovel of the same value and popularity as Atlas Shrugged, but written to glorifycollectivism (which would be a contradiction in terms), it would have beenproduced on the screen long ago.But I do not believe in giving up—and so, in answer to many questions, I chosethis occasion to make a very special announcement: I am writing a nine-hour teleplay for Atlas Shrugged.I intend to produce the mini-series myself.There is a strong possibility I will be looking for outside financing to producethe Atlas Shrugged series. [Miss Rand died a few months later, before completingthe teleplay.]In conclusion, let me touch briefly on another question often asked me: What doI think of President Reagan? The best answer to give would be: But I don’t thinkof him—and the more I see, the less I think. I did not vote for him (or foranyone else) and events seem to justify me. The appalling disgrace of hisadministration is his connection with the so-called “Moral Majority” and sundryother TV religionists, who are struggling—apparently with his approval—to takeus back to the Middle Ages, via the unconstitutional union of religion andpolitics.The threat to the future of capitalism is the fact that Reagan might fail sobadly that he will become another ghost, like Herbert Hoover, to be invoked asan example of capitalism’s failure for another fifty years.Observe Reagan’s futile attempts to arouse the country by some sort ofinspirational appeal. He is right in thinking that the country needs aninspirational element. But he will not find it in the God-Family-Traditionswamp.The greatest inspirational leadership this country could ever find rests in thehands of the most typically American group: the businessmen. But they couldprovide it only if they acquired philosophical self-defense and self-esteem.Here is what young Americans have to say about it.I quote from the May 15, 1980 issue of The Intellectual Activist, a newsletterpublished by Peter Schwartz:Feminists threaten to publicize the names of psychologists who hold theirconvention in a state which has not yet endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment.Unionists protest political functions that serve lettuce not approved by CesarChavez. Yet businessmen are willing not simply to tolerate denunciations of freeenterprise, but to financially sponsor them.And: I quote from an article by M. Northrup Buechner, “The Root of Terrorism,”in the October 1981 issue of The Objectivist Forum, published by HarryBinswanger:Imagine the effect if [some] prominent businessmen ... were to defend publiclytheir right to their own lives. Imagine the earthshaking social reverberationsif they were to assert their moral right to their own profits, not because thoseprofits are necessary for economic progress or the elimination of poverty (whichare purely collectivist justifications), but because a living being has theright to live and progress and do the best he can for his life for the time hehas on this earth.I recommend both these publications very highly. You may write to TheIntellectual Activist at: [Box 582, Murray Hill Station, New York, NY 10156]—andto The Objectivist Forum at: Box 5311, New York, NY 10150. [The ObjectivistForum ceased publication in December 1987.]As for me, I will close with a quotation which is probably familiar to you—and Iwill say that the battle for capitalism will be won when we find a presidentcapable of saying it:“The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it’syours.“But to win it requires your total dedication and a total break with the worldof your past, with the doctrine that man is a sacrificial animal who exists forthe pleasure of others. Fight for the value of your person. Fight for the virtueof your pride. Fight for the essence of that which is man: for his sovereignrational mind. Fight with the radiant certainty and the absolute rectitude ofknowing that yours is the Morality of Life and that yours is the battle for anyachievement, any value, any grandeur, any goodness, any joy that has everexisted on this earth.”"},{"pageContent":"16Through Your Most Grievous Faultby Ayn RandThis was one of Ayn Rand’s newspaper columns. It appeared in the Los AngelesTimes on August 19, 1962, two weeks after Marilyn Monroe’s death.The death of Marilyn Monroe shocked people with an impact different from theirreaction to the death of any other movie star or public figure. All over theworld, people felt a peculiar sense of personal involvement and of protest, likea universal cry of “Oh, no!”They felt that her death had some special significance, almost like a warningwhich they could not decipher—and they felt a nameless apprehension, the sensethat something terribly wrong was involved.They were right to feel it.Marilyn Monroe on the screen was an image of pure, innocent, childlike joy inliving. She projected the sense of a person born and reared in some radiantutopia untouched by suffering, unable to conceive of ugliness or evil, facinglife with the confidence, the benevolence, and the joyous self-flaunting of achild or a kitten who is happy to display its own attractiveness as the bestgift it can offer the world, and who expects to be admired for it, not hurt.In real life, Marilyn Monroe’s probable suicide—or worse: a death that mighthave been an accident, suggesting that, to her, the difference did notmatter—was a declaration that we live in a world which made it impossible forher kind of spirit, and for the things she represented, to survive.If there ever was a victim of society, Marilyn Monroe was that victim—of asociety that professes dedication to the relief of the suffering, but kills thejoyous.None of the objects of the humanitarians’ tender solicitude, the juveniledelinquents, could have had so sordid and horrifying a childhood as did MarilynMonroe.To survive it and to preserve the kind of spirit she projected on the screen—theradiantly benevolent sense of life, which cannot be faked—was an almostinconceivable psychological achievement that required a heroism of the highestorder. Whatever scars her past had left were insignificant by comparison.She preserved her vision of life through a nightmare struggle, fighting her wayto the top. What broke her was the discovery, at the top, of as sordid an evilas the one she had left behind—worse, perhaps, because incomprehensible. She hadexpected to reach the sunlight; she found, instead, a limitless swamp of malice.It was a malice of a very special kind. If you want to see her groping struggleto understand it, read the magnificent article in [the August 17, 1962) issue ofLife magazine. It is not actually an article, it is a verbatim transcript of herown words—and the most tragically revealing document published in many years. Itis a cry for help, which came too late to be answered.“When you’re famous, you kind of run into human nature in a raw kind of way,”she said. “It stirs up envy, fame does. People you run into feel that, well, whois she—who does she think she is, Marilyn Monroe? They feel fame gives them somekind of privilege to walk up to you and say anything to you, you know, of anykind of nature—and it won’t hurt your feelings—like it’s happening to yourclothing.... I don’t understand why people aren’t a little more generous witheach other. I don’t like to say this, but I’m afraid there is a lot of envy inthis business.”“Envy” is the only name she could find for the monstrous thing she faced, but itwas much worse than envy: it was the profound hatred of life, of success and ofall human values, felt by a certain kind of mediocrity—the kind who feelspleasure on hearing about a stranger’s misfortune. It was hatred of the good forbeing the good-hatred of ability, of beauty, of honesty, of earnestness, ofachievement and, above all, of human joy.Read the Life article to see how it worked and what it did to her:An eager child, who was rebuked for her eagerness—“Some times the [foster]families used to worry because I used to laugh so loud and so gay; I guess theyfelt it was hysterical.”A spectacularly successful star, whose employers kept repeating: “Rememberyou’re not a star,” in a determined effort, apparently, not to let her discoverher own importance.A brilliantly talented actress, who was told by the alleged authorities, byHollywood, by the press, that she could not act.An actress, dedicated to her art with passionate earnestness—“When I was five—Ithink that’s when I started wanting to be an actress—I loved to play. I didn’tlike the world around me because it was kind of grim—but I loved to play houseand it was like you could make your own boundaries”—who went through hell tomake her own boundaries, to offer people the sunlit universe of her ownvision—“It’s almost having certain kinds of secrets for yourself that you’ll letthe whole world in on only for a moment, when you’re acting”—but who wasridiculed for her desire to play serious parts.A woman, the only one, who was able to project the glowingly innocent sexualityof a being from some planet uncorrupted by guilt—who found herself regarded andballyhooed as a vulgar symbol of obscenity—and who still had the courage todeclare: “We are all born sexual creatures, thank God, but it’s a pity so manypeople despise and crush this natural gift.”A happy child who was offering her achievement to the world, with the pride ofan authentic greatness and of a kitten depositing a hunting trophy at yourfeet—who found herself answered by concerted efforts to negate, to degrade, toridicule, to insult, to destroy her achievement—who was unable to conceive thatit was her best she was punished for, not her worst—who could only sense, inhelpless terror, that she was facing some unspeakable kind of evil.How long do you think a human being could stand it?That hatred of values has always existed in some people, in any age or culture.But a hundred years ago, they would have been expected to hide it. Today, it isall around us; it is the style and fashion of our century.Where would a sinking spirit find relief from it?The evil of a cultural atmosphere is made by all those who share it. Anyone whohas ever felt resentment against the good for being the good and has given voiceto it, is the murderer of Marilyn Monroe."},{"pageContent":"17Apollo 11by Ayn RandThis article was published in The Objectivist, September 1969.“No matter what discomforts and expenses you had to bear to come here,” said aNASA guide to a group of guests, at the conclusion of a tour of the Space Centeron Cape Kennedy, on July 15, 1969, “there will be seven minutes tomorrow morningthat will make you feel it was worth it.”It was.The tour had been arranged for the guests invited by NASA to attend thelaunching of Apollo 11. As far as I was able to find out, the guests—apart fromgovernment officials and foreign dignitaries—were mainly scientists,industrialists, and a few intellectuals who had been selected to represent theAmerican people and culture on this occasion. If this was the standard ofselection, I am happy and proud that I was one of these guests.The NASA tour guide was a slight, stocky, middle-aged man who wore glasses andspoke—through a microphone, at the front of the bus—in the mild, gentle, patientmanner of a school-teacher. He reminded me of television’s Mr. Peepers—untit hetook off his glasses and I took a closer look at his face: he had unusual,intensely intelligent eyes.The Space Center is an enormous place that looks like an untouched wildernesscut, incongruously, by a net of clean, new, paved roads: stretches of wild,subtropical growth, an eagle’s nest in a dead tree, an alligator in a stagnantmoat—and, scattered at random, in the distance, a few vertical shafts risingfrom the jungle, slender structures of a shape peculiar to the technology ofspace, which do not belong to the age of the jungle or even fully to ours.The discomfort was an inhuman, brain-melting heat. The sky was a sunless spreadof glaring white, and the physical objects seemed to glare so that the meresensation of sight became an effort. We kept plunging into an oven, when the busstopped and we ran to modern, air-conditioned buildings that looked quietlyunobtrusive and militarily efficient, then plunging back into theair-conditioned bus as into a pool. Our guide kept talking and explaining,patiently, courteously, conscientiously, but his heart was not in it, andneither was ours, even though the things he showed us would have beenfascinating at any other time. The reason was not the heat; it was as if nothingcould register on us, as if we were out of focus, or, rather, focused toointently and irresistibly on the event of the following day.It was the guide who identified it, when he announced: “And now we’ll show youwhat you really want to see”—and we were driven to the site of Apollo 11.The “VIP‘s” tumbled out of the bus like tourists and rushed to photograph oneanother, with the giant rocket a few hundred yards away in the background. Butsome just stood and looked.I felt a kind of awe, but it was a purely theoretical awe; I had to remindmyself: “This is it,” in order to experience any emotion. Visually it was justanother rocket, the kind you can see in any science-fiction movie or on any toycounter: a tall, slender shape of dead, powdery white against the white glare ofthe sky and the steel lacing of the service tower. There were sharp black linesencircling the white body at intervals—and our guide explained matter-of-factlythat these marked the stages that would be burned off in tomorrow’s firings.This made the meaning of the rocket more real for an instant. But the fact thatthe lunar module, as he told us, was already installed inside the small, slantedpart way on top of the rocket, just under the still smaller, barely visiblespacecraft itself, would not become fully real; it seemed too small, too faraway from us, and, simultaneously, too close: I could not quite integrate itwith the parched stubble of grass under our feet, with its wholesomely usualtouches of litter, with the psychedelic colors of the shirts on the touristssnapping pictures.Tomorrow, our guide explained, we would be sitting on bleachers three milesaway; he warned us that the sound of the blast would reach us some seconds laterthan the sight, and assured us that it would be loud, but not unbearable.I do not know that guide’s actual work at the Space Center, and I do not know bywhat imperceptible signs he gave me the impression that he was a man in lovewith his work. It was only that concluding remark of his, later, at the end ofthe tour, that confirmed my impression. In a certain way, he set, for me, thetone of the entire occasion: the sense of what lay under the surface of theseemingly commonplace activities.My husband and I were staying in Titusville, a tiny frontier settlement—thefrontier of science—built and inhabited predominantly by the Space Center’semployees. It was just like any small town, perhaps a little newer andcleaner—except that ten miles away, across the bluish spread of the IndianRiver, one could see the foggy, bluish, rectangular shape of the Space Center’slargest structure, the Vehicle Assembly Building, and, a little farther away,two faint vertical shafts: Apollo 11 and its service tower. No matter what onelooked at in that town, one could not really see anything else.I noticed only that Titusville had many churches, too many, and that they hadincredible, modernistic forms. Architectur ally, they reminded me of the moreextreme types of Hollywood drive-ins: a huge, cone-shaped roof, with practicallyno walls to support it—or an erratic conglomeration of triangles, like a coralbush gone wild—or a fairy-tale candy-house, with S-shaped windows dripping atrandom like gobs of frosting. I may be mistaken about this, but I had theimpression that here, on the doorstep of the future, religion felt out of placeand this was the way it was trying to be modern.Since all the motels of Titusville were crowded beyond capacity, we had rented aroom in a private home: as their contribution to the great event, many of thelocal homeowners had volunteered to help their chamber of commerce with theunprecedented flood of visitors. Our room was in the home of an engineeremployed at the Space Center. It was a nice, gracious family, and one might havesaid a typical small-town family, except for one thing: a quality of cheerfulopenness, directness, almost innocence—the benevolent, unself-consciouslyself-confident quality of those who live in the clean, strict, reality-orientedatmosphere of science.On the morning of July 16, we got up at 3 A.M. in order to reach the NASA GuestCenter by 6 A.M., a distance that a car traveled normally in ten minutes.(Special buses were to pick up the guests at that Center, for the trip to thelaunching.) But Titusville was being engulfed by such a flood of cars that eventhe police traffic department could not predict whether one would be able tomove through the streets that morning. We reached the Guest Center long beforesunrise, thanks to the courtesy of our hostess, who drove us there throughtwisting back streets.On the shore of the Indian River, we saw cars, trucks, trailers filling everyfoot of space on both sides of the drive, in the vacant lots, on the lawns, onthe river’s sloping embankment. There were tents perched at the edge of thewater; there were men and children sleeping on the roofs of station wagons, inthe twisted positions of exhaustion; I saw a half-naked man asleep in a hammockstrung between a car and a tree. These people had come from all over the countryto watch the launching across the river, miles away. (We heard later that thesame patient, cheerful human flood had spread through all the small communitiesaround Cape Kennedy that night, and that it numbered one million persons.) Icould not understand why these people would have such an intense desire towitness just a few brief moments; some hours later, I understood it.It was still dark as we drove along the river. The sky and the water were asolid spread of dark blue that seemed soft, cold, and empty. But, framed by themotionless black leaves of the trees on the embankment, two things marked offthe identity of the sky and the earth: far above in the sky, there was a single,large star; and on earth, far across the river, two enormous sheaves of whitelight stood shooting motionlessly into the empty darkness from two tiny uprightshafts of crystal that looked like glowing icicles; they were Apollo 11 and itsservice tower.It was dark when a caravan of buses set out at 7 A.M. on the journey to theSpace Center. The light came slowly, beyond the steam-veiled windows, as wemoved laboriously through back streets and back roads. No one asked anyquestions; there was a kind of tense solemnity about that journey, as if we werecaught in the backwash of the enormous discipline of an enormous purpose andwere now carried along on the power of an invisible authority.It was full daylight—a broiling, dusty, hazy daylight—when we stepped out of thebuses. The launch site looked big and empty like a desert; the bleachers, madeof crude, dried planks, seemed small, precariously fragile and irrelevant, likea hasty footnote. Three miles away, the shaft of Apollo 11 looked a dusty whiteagain, like a tired cigarette planted upright.The worst part of the trip was that last hour and a quarter, which we spentsitting on wooden planks in the sun. There was a crowd of seven thousand peoplefilling the stands, there was the cool, clear, courteous voice of a loudspeakerrasping into sound every few minutes, keeping us informed of the progress of thecountdown (and announcing, somewhat dutifully, the arrival of some prominentgovernment personage, which did not seem worth the effort of turning one’s headto see), but all of it seemed unreal. The full reality was only the vast emptyspace, above and below, and the tired white cigarette in the distance.The sun was rolling up and straight at our faces, like a white ball wrapped indirty cotton. But beyond the haze, the sky was clear—which meant that we wouldbe able to see the whole of the launching, including the firing of the secondand third stages.Let me warn you that television does not give any idea of what we saw. Later, Isaw that launching again on color television, and it did not resemble theoriginal.The loudspeaker began counting the minutes when there were only five left. WhenI heard: “Three-quarters of a minute,” I was up, standing on the wooden bench,and do not remember hearing the rest.It began with a large patch of bright, yellow-orange flame shooting sidewaysfrom under the base of the rocket. It looked like a normal kind of flame and Ifelt an instant’s shock of anxiety, as if this were a building on fire. In thenext instant the flame and the rocket were hidden by such a sweep of dark redfire that the anxiety vanished: this was not part of any normal experience andcould not be integrated with anything. The dark red fire parted into twogigantic wings, as if a hydrant were shooting streams of fire outward and up,toward the zenith—and between the two wings, against a pitch-black sky, therocket rose slowly, so slowly that it seemed to hang still in the air, a palecylinder with a blinding oval of white light at the bottom, like an upturnedcandle with its flame directed at the earth. Then I became aware that this washappening in total silence, because I heard the cries of birds wingingfrantically away from the flames. The rocket was rising faster, slanting alittle, its tense white flame leaving a long, thin spiral of bluish smoke behindit. It had risen into the open blue sky, and the dark red fire had turned intoenormous billows of brown smoke, when the sound reached us: it was a long,violent crack, not a rolling sound, but specifically a cracking, grinding sound,as if space were breaking apart, but it seemed irrelevant and unimportant,because it was a sound from the past and the rocket was long since speedingsafely out of its reach—though it was strange to realize that only a few secondshad passed. I found myself waving to the rocket involuntarily, I heard peopleapplauding and joined them, grasping our common motive; it was impossible towatch passively, one had to express, by some physical action, a feeling that wasnot triumph, but more: the feeling that that white object’s unobstructed streakof motion was the only thing that mattered in the universe. The rocket wasalmost above our heads when a sudden flare of yellow-gold fire seemed to envelopit—I felt a stab of anxiety, the thought that something had gone wrong, thenheard a burst of applause and realized that this was the firing of the secondstage. When the loud, space-cracking sound reached us, the fire had turned intoa small puff of white vapor floating away. At the firing of the third stage, therocket was barely visible; it seemed to be shrinking and descending; there was abrief spark, a white puff of vapor, a distant crack—and when the white puffdissolved, the rocket was gone.These were the seven minutes.What did one feel afterward? An abnormal, tense overconcen tration on thecommonplace necessities of the immediate moment, such as stumbling over patchesof rough gravel, running to find the appropriate guest bus. One had tooverconcentrate, because one knew that one did not give a damn about anything,because one had no mind and no motivation left for any immediate action. How doyou descend from a state of pure exaltation?What we had seen, in naked essentials—but in reality, not in a work of art—wasthe concretized abstraction of man’s greatness.The meaning of the sight lay in the fact that when those dark red wings of fireflared open, one knew that one was not looking at a normal occurrence, but at acataclysm which, if unleashed by nature, would have wiped man out ofexistence—and one knew also that this cataclysm was planned, unleashed, andcontrolled by man, that this unimaginable power was ruled by his power and,obediently serving his purpose, was making way for a slender, rising craft. Oneknew that this spectacle was not the product of inanimate nature, like someaurora borealis, or of chance, or of luck, that it was unmistakably human—with“human,” for once, meaning grandeur—that a purpose and a long, sustained,disciplined effort had gone to achieve this series of moments, and that man wassucceeding, succeeding, succeeding! For once, if only for seven minutes, theworst among those who saw it had to feel—not “How small is man by the side ofthe Grand Canyon!”—but “How great is man and how safe is nature when he conquersit!”That we had seen a demonstration of man at his best, no one could doubt—this wasthe cause of the event’s attraction and of the stunned, numbed state in which itleft us. And no one could doubt that we had seen an achievement of man in hiscapacity as a rational being—an achievement of reason, of logic, of mathematics,of total dedication to the absolutism of reality. How many people would connectthese two facts, I do not know.The next four days were a period torn out of the world’s usual context, like abreathing spell with a sweep of clean air piercing mankind’s lethargicsuffocation. For thirty years or longer, the newspapers had featured nothing butdisasters, catastrophes, betrayals, the shrinking stature of men, the sordidmess of a collapsing civilization; their voice had become a long, sustainedwhine, the megaphone of failure, like the sound of an oriental bazaar whereleprous beggars, of spirit or matter, compete for attention by displaying theirsores. Now, for once, the newspapers were announcing a human achievement, werereporting on a human triumph, were reminding us that man still exists andfunctions as man.Those four days conveyed the sense that we were watching a magnificent work ofart—a play dramatizing a single theme: the efficacy of man’s mind. One afteranother, the crucial, dangerous maneuvers of Apollo 11’s fight were carried outaccording to plan, with what appeared to be an effortless perfection. Theyreached us in the form of brief, rasping sounds relayed from space to Houstonand from Houston to our television screens, sounds interspersed withcomputerized figures, translated for us by commentators who, for once, bycontagion, lost their usual manner of snide equivocation and spoke withcompelling clarity.The most confirmed evader in the worldwide audience could not escape the factthat these sounds announced events taking place far beyond the earth’satmosphere—that while he moaned about his loneliness and “alienation” and fearof entering an unknown cocktail party, three men were floating in a fragilecapsule in the unknown darkness and loneliness of space, with earth and moonsuspended like little tennis balls behind and ahead of them, and with theirlives suspended on the microscopic threads connecting numbers on their computerpanels in consequence of the invisible connections made well in advance by man’sbrain—that the more effortless their performance appeared, the more itproclaimed the magnitude of the effort expended to project it and achieveit—that no feelings, wishes, urges, instincts, or lucky “conditioning,” eitherin these three men or in all those behind them, from highest thinker to lowliestlaborer who touched a bolt of that spacecraft, could have achieved thisincomparable feat—that we were watching the embodied concretization of a singlefaculty of man: his rationality.There was an aura of triumph about the entire mission of Apollo 11, from theperfect launch to the climax. An assurance of success was growing in the wake ofthe rocket through the four days of its moon-bound flight. No, not becausesuccess was guaranteed—it is never guaranteed to man—but because a progressionof evidence was displaying the precondition of success: these men know what theyare doing.No event in contemporary history was as thrilling, here on earth, as threemoments of the mission’s climax: the moment when, superimposed over the image ofa garishly colored imitation-module standing motionless on the televisionscreen, there flashed the words: “Lunar module has landed”—the moment when thefaint, gray shape of the actual module came shivering from the moon to thescreen—and the moment when the shining white blob which was Neil Armstrong tookhis immortal first step. At this last, I felt one instant of unhappy fear,wondering what he would say, because he had it in his power to destroy themeaning and the glory of that moment, as the astronauts of Apollo 8 had done intheir time. He did not. He made no reference to God; he did not undercut therationality of his achievement by paying tribute to the forces of its opposite;he spoke of man. “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.”So it was.As to my personal reaction to the entire mission of Apollo 11, I can express itbest by paraphrasing a passage from Atlas Shrugged that kept coming back to mymind: “Why did I feel that joyous sense of confidence while watching themission? In all of its giant course, two aspects pertaining to the inhuman wereradiantly absent: the causeless and the purposeless. Every part of the missionwas an embodied answer to ‘Why?’ and ‘What for?’ —like the steps of alife-course chosen by the sort of mind I worship. The mission was a moral codeenacted in space.”Now, coming back to earth (as it is at present), I want to answer briefly somequestions that will arise in this context. Is it proper for the government toengage in space projects? No, it is not—except insofar as space projects involvemilitary aspects, in which case, and to that extent, it is not merely proper butmandatory. Scientific research as such, however, is not the proper province ofthe government.But this is a political issue; it pertains to the money behind the lunar missionor to the method of obtaining that money, and to the project’s administration;it does not affect the nature of the mission as such, it does not alter the factthat this was a superlative technological achievement.In judging the effectiveness of the various elements involved in any large-scaleundertaking of a mixed economy, one must be guided by the question: whichelements were the result of coercion and which the result of freedom? It is notcoercion, not the physical force or threat of a gun, that created Apollo 11. Thescientists, the technologists, the engineers, the astronauts were free menacting of their own choice. The various parts of the spacecraft were produced byprivate industrial concerns. Of all human activities, science is the field leastamenable to force: the facts of reality do not take orders. (This is one of thereasons why science perishes under dictatorships, though technology may survivefor a short while.)It is said that without the “unlimited” resources of the government, such anenormous project would not have been undertaken. No, it would not have been—atthis time. But it would have been, when the economy was ready for it. There is aprecedent for this situation. The first transcontinental railroad of the UnitedStates was built by order of the government, on government subsidies. It washailed as a great achievement (which, in some respects, it was). But it causedeconomic dislocations and political evils, for the consequences of which we arepaying to this day in many forms.If the government deserves any credit for the space program, it is only to theextent that it did not act as a government, i.e., did not use coercion in regardto its participants (which it used in regard to its backers, i.e., thetaxpayers). And what is relevant in this context (but is not to be taken as ajustification or endorsement of a mixed economy) is the fact that of all ourgovernment programs, the space program is the cleanest and best: it, at least,has brought the American citizens a return on their forced investment, it hasworked for its money, it has earned its keep, which cannot be said about anyother program of the government.There is, however, a shameful element in the ideological motivation (or thepublicly alleged motivation) that gave birth to our space program: John F.Kennedy’s notion of a space competition between the United States and SovietRussia.A competition presupposes some basic principles held in common by all thecompetitors, such as the rules of the game in athletics, or the functions of thefree market in business. The notion of a competition between the United Statesand Soviet Russia in any field whatsoever is obscene: they are incommensurableentities, intellectually and morally. What would you think of a competitionbetween a doctor and a murderer to determine who could affect the greatestnumber of people? Or: a competition between Thomas A. Edison and Al Capone tosee who could get rich quicker?The fundamental significance of Apollo 11’s triumph is not political; it isphilosophical; specifically, moral-epistemological.The lunar landing as such was not a milestone of science, but of technology.Technology is an applied science, i.e., it translates the discoveries oftheoretical science into practical application to man’s life. As such,technology is not the first step in the development of a given body ofknowledge, but the last; it is not the most difficult step, but it is theultimate step, the implicit purpose, of man’s quest for knowledge.The lunar landing was not the greatest achievement of science, but its greatestvisible result. The greatest achievements of science are invisible: they takeplace in a man’s mind; they occur in the form of a connection integrating abroad range of phenomena. The astronaut of an earlier mission who remarked thathis spacecraft was driven by Sir Isaac Newton understood this issue. (And if Imay be permitted to amend that remark, I would say that Sir Isaac Newton was thecopilot of the flight; the pilot was Aristotle.) In this sense, the lunarlanding was a first step, a beginning, in regard to the moon, but it was a laststep, an end product, in regard to the earth—the end product of a long,intellectual-scientific development.This does not diminish in any way the intellectual stature, power, orachievement of the technologists and the astronauts; it merely indicates thatthey were the worthy recipients of an illustrious heritage, who made full use ofit by the exercise of their own individual ability. (The fact that man is theonly species capable of transmitting knowledge and thus capable of progress, thefact that man can achieve a division of labor, and the fact that large numbersof men are required for a large-scale undertaking, do not mean what some creepsare suggesting: that achievement has become collective.)I am not implying that all the men who contributed to the flight of Apollo 11were necessarily rational in every aspect of their lives or convictions. But intheir various professional capacities—each to the extent that he did contributeto the mission—they had to act on the principle of strict rationality.The most inspiring aspect of Apollo 11’s flight was that it made suchabstractions as rationality, knowledge, science perceivable in direct, immediateexperience. That it involved a landing on another celestial body was like adramatist’s emphasis on the dimensions of reason’s power: it is not of enormousimportance to most people that man lands on the moon, but that man can do it,is.This was the cause of the world’s response to the flight of Apollo 11.Frustration is the leitmotif in the lives of most men, particularly today—thefrustration of inarticulate desires, with no knowledge of the means to achievethem. In the sight and hearing of a crumbling world, Apollo 11 enacted the storyof an audacious purpose, its execution, its triumph, and the means that achievedit—the story and the demonstration of man’s highest potential. Whatever hisparticular ability or goal, if a man is not to give up his struggle, he needsthe reminder that success is possible; if he is not to regard the human specieswith fear, contempt, or hatred, he needs the spiritual fuel of knowing that manthe hero is possible.This was the meaning and the unidentified motive of the millions of eager,smiling faces that looked up to the flight of Apollo 11 from all over theremnants and ruins of the civilized world. This was the meaning that peoplesensed, but did not know in conscious terms—and will give up or betray tomorrow.It was the job of their teachers, the intellectuals, to tell them. But it is notwhat they are being told.A great event is like an explosion that blasts off pretenses and brings thehidden out to the surface, be it diamonds or muck. The flight of Apollo 11 was“a moment of truth”: it revealed an abyss between the physical sciences and thehumanities that has to be measured in terms of interplanetary distances. If theachievements of the physical sciences have to be watched through a telescope,the state of the humanities requires a microscope: there is no historicalprecedent for the smallness of stature and shabbiness of mind displayed bytoday’s intellectuals.In The New York Times of July 21, 1969, there appeared two whole pages devotedto an assortment of reactions to the lunar landing, from all kinds of prominentand semi-prominent people who represent a cross-section of our culture.It was astonishing to see how many ways people could find to utter variants ofthe same bromides. Under an overwhelming air of staleness, of pettiness, ofmusty meanness, the collection revealed the naked essence (and spiritualconsequences) of the basic premises ruling today’s culture:irrationalism—altruism—collectivism.The extent of the hatred for reason was somewhat startling. (And,psychologically, it gave the show away: one does not hate that which onehonestly regards as ineffectual.) It was, however, expressed indirectly, in theform of denunciations of technology. (And since technology is the means ofbringing the benefits of science to man’s life, judge for yourself the motiveand the sincerity of the protestations of concern with human suffering.)“But the chief reason for assessing the significance of the moon landingnegatively, even while the paeans of triumph are sung, is that this tremendoustechnical achievement represents a defective sense of human values, and of asense of priorities of our technical culture.” “We are betraying our moralweakness in our very triumphs in technology and economics.” “How can this nationswell and stagger with technological pride when it is so weak, so wicked, soblinded and misdirected in its priorities? While we can send men to the moon ordeadly missiles to Moscow or toward Mao, we can’t get foodstuffs across town tostarving folks in the teeming ghettos.” “Are things more important than people?I simply do not believe that a program comparable to the moon landing cannot beprojected around poverty, the war, crime, and so on.” “If we show the samedetermination and willingness to commit our resources, we can master theproblems of our cities just as we have mastered the challenge of space.” “Inthis regard, the contemporary triumphs of man’s mind—his ability to translatehis dreams of grandeur into awe-some accomplishments—are not to be equated withprogress, as defined in terms of man’s primary concern with the welfare of themasses of fellow human beings ... the power of human intelligence which wasmobilized to accomplish this feat can also be mobilized to address itself to theultimate acts of human compassion.” “But, the most wondrous event would be ifman could relinquish all the stains and defilements of the untamed mind ...”There was one entirely consistent person in that collection, Pablo Picasso,whose statement, in full, was: “It means nothing to me. I have no opinion aboutit, and I don’t care.” His work has been demonstrating that for years.The best statement was, surprisingly, that of the playwright Eugene Ionesco, whowas perceptive about the nature of his fellow intellectuals. He said, in part:It’s an extraordinary event of incalculable importance. The sign that it’s soimportant is that most people aren’t interested in it. They go on discussingriots and strikes and sentimental affairs. The perspectives opened up areenormous, and the absence of interest shows an astonishing lack of goodwill. Ihave the impression that writers and intellectuals—men of the left—are turningtheir backs to the event.This is an honest statement—and the only pathetic (or terrible) thing about itis the fact that the speaker has not observed that “men of the left” are not“most people.”Now consider the exact, specific meaning of the evil revealed in thatcollection: it is the moral significance of Apollo 11 that is being ignored; itis the moral stature of the astronauts—and of all the men behind them, and ofall achievement—that is being denied. Think of what was required to achieve thatmission: think of the unself-pitying effort; the merciless discipline; thecourage; the responsibility of relying on one’s judgment; the days, nights andyears of unswerving dedication to a goal; the tension of the unbrokenmaintenance of a full, clear mental focus; and the honesty (honesty means:loyalty to truth, and truth means: the recognition of reality). All these arenot regarded as virtues by the altruists and are treated as of no moralsignificance.Now perhaps you will grasp the infamous inversion represented by the morality ofaltruism.Some people accused me of exaggeration when I said that altruism does not meanmere kindness or generosity, but the sacrifice of the best among men to theworst, the sacrifice of virtues to flaws, of ability to incompetence, ofprogress to stagnation—and the subordinating of all life and of all values tothe claims of anyone’s suffering.You have seen it enacted in reality.What else is the meaning of the brazen presumption of those who protest againstthe mission of Apollo 11, demanding that the money (which is not theirs) bespent, instead, on the relief of poverty?This is not an old-fashioned protest against mythical tycoons who “exploit”their workers, it is not a protest against the rich, it is not a protest againstidle luxury, it is not a plea for some marginal charity, for money that “no onewould miss.” It is a protest against science and progress, it is the impertinentdemand that man’s mind cease to function, that man’s ability be denied the meansto move forward, that achievement stop—because the poor hold a first mortgage onthe lives of their betters.By their own assessment, by demanding that the public support them, theseprotesters declare that they have not produced enough to support themselves—yetthey present a claim on the men whose ability produced so enormous a result asApollo 11, declaring that it was done at their expense, that the money behind itwas taken from them. Led by their spiritual equivalents and spokesmen, theyassert a private right to public funds, while denying the public (i.e., the restof us) the right to any higher, better purpose.I could remind them that without the technology they damn, there would be nomeans to support them. I could remind them of the pretechnological centurieswhen men subsisted in such poverty that they were unable to feed themselves, letalone give assistance to others. I could say that anyone who used one-hundredthof the mental effort used by the smallest of the technicians responsible forApollo 11 would not be consigned to permanent poverty, not in a free or evensemi-free society. I could say it, but I won’t. It is not their practice that Ichallenge, but their moral premise. Poverty is not a mortgage on the labor ofothers—misfortune is not a mortgage on achievement—failure is not a mortgage onsuccess—suffering is not a claim check, and its relief is not the goal ofexistence—man is not a sacrificial animal on anyone’s altar or for anyone’scause—life is not one huge hospital.Those who suggest that we substitute a war on poverty for the space programshould ask themselves whether the premises and values that form the character ofan astronaut would be satisfied by a lifetime of carrying bedpans and teachingthe alphabet to the mentally retarded. The answer applies as well to the valuesand premises of the astronauts’ admirers. Slums are not a substitute for stars.The question we are constantly hearing today is: why are men able to reach themoon, but unable to solve their social-political problems? This questioninvolves the abyss between the physical sciences and the humanities. The flightof Apollo 11 has made the answer obvious: because, in regard to their socialproblems, men reject and evade the means that made the lunar landing possible,the only means of solving any problem—reason.In the field of technology, men cannot permit themselves the kind of mentalprocesses that have been demonstrated by some of the reactions to Apollo II. Intechnology, there are no gross irrationalities such as the conclusion that sincemankind was united by its enthusiasm for the flight, it can be united byanything (as if the ability to unite were a primary, regardless of purpose orcause). There are, in technology, no evasions of such magnitude as the presentchorus of slogans to the effect that Apollo 11’s mission should somehow lead mento peace, goodwill, and the realization that mankind is one big family. Whatfamily? With one-third of mankind enslaved under an unspeakable rule of bruteforce, are we to accept the rulers as members of the family, make terms withthem, and sanction the terrible fate of the victims? If so, why are the victimsto be expelled from the one big human family? The speakers have no answer. Buttheir implicit answer is: We could make it work somehow, if we wanted to!In technology, men know that all the wishes and prayers in the world will notchange the nature of a grain of sand.It would not have occurred to the builders of the spacecraft to select itsmaterials without the most minute, exhaustive study of their characteristics andproperties. But, in the humanities, every sort of scheme or project is proposedand carried out without a moment’s thought or study of the nature of man. Noinstrument was installed aboard the spacecraft without a thorough knowledge ofthe conditions its functions required. All kinds of impossible, contradictorydemands are imposed on man in the humanities with no concern for the conditionsof existence he requires. No one tore apart the circuits of the spacecraft’selectric system and declared: “It will do the job if it wants to!” This is thestandard policy in regard to man. No one chose a type of fuel for Apollo 11because he “felt like it,” or ignored the results of a test because he “didn’tfeel like it,” or programmed a computer with a jumble of random, irrelevantnonsense he “didn’t know why.” These are the standard procedures and criteriaaccepted in the humanities. No one made a decision affecting the spacecraft byhunch, by whim, or by sudden, inexplicable “intuition.” In the humanities, thesemethods are regarded as superior to reason. No one proposed a new design for thespacecraft, worked out in every detail, except that it had no provision forrockets or for any means of propulsion. It is the standard practice in thehumanities to devise and design social systems controlling every aspect of man’slife, except that no provision is made for the fact that man possesses a mindand that his mind is his means of survival. No one suggested that the flight ofApollo 11 be planned according to the rules of astrology, and its course becharted by the rules of numerology. In the humanities, man’s nature isinterpreted according to Freud, and his social course is prescribed by Marx.But—the practitioners of the humanities protest—we cannot treat man as aninanimate object. The truth of the matter is that they treat man as less than aninanimate object, with less concern, less respect for his nature. If they gaveto man’s nature a small fraction of the meticulous, rational study that thescientists are now giving to lunar dust, we would be living in a better world.No, the specific procedures for studying man are not the same as for studyinginanimate objects—but the epistemological principles are.Nothing on earth or beyond it is closed to the power of man’s reason. Yes,reason could solve human problems—but nothing else on earth or beyond it can.This is the fundamental lesson to be learned from the triumph of Apollo 11. Letus hope that some men will learn it. But it will not be learned by most oftoday’s intellectuals, since the core and motor of all their incredibleconstructs is the attempt to establish human tyranny as an escape from what theycall “the tyranny” of reason and reality.If the lesson is learned in time, the flight of Apollo 11 will be the firstachievement of a great new age; if not, it will be a glorious last—not forever,but for a long, long time to come.I want to mention one small incident, an indication of why achievement perishesunder altruist-collectivist rule. One of the ugliest aspects of altruism is thatit penalizes the good for being the good, and success for being success. We haveseen that, too, enacted in reality.It is obvious that one of the reasons motivating the NASA administrators toachieve a lunar landing was the desire to demonstrate the value of the spaceprogram and receive financial appropriations to continue the program’s work.This was fully rational and proper for the managers of a government project:there is no honest way of obtaining public funds except by impressing the publicwith a project’s actual results. But such a motive involves an old-fashionedkind of innocence; it comes from an implicit free-enterprise context, from thepremise that rewards are to be earned by achievement, and that achievement is tobe rewarded. Apparently, they had not grasped the modern notion, the basicpremise of the welfare state: that rewards are divorced from achievement, thatone obtains money from the government by giving nothing in return, and the moreone gets, the more one should demand.The response of Congress to Apollo 11 included some prominent voices whodeclared that NASA’s appropriations should be cut because the lunar mission hassucceeded.(!) The purpose of the years of scientific work is completed, theysaid, and “national priorities” demand that we now pour more money down thesewers of the war on poverty.If you want to know the process that embitters, corrupts, and destroys themanagers of government projects, you are seeing it in action. I hope that theNASA administrators will be able to withstand it.As far as “national priorities” are concerned, I want to say the following: wedo not have to have a mixed economy, we still have a chance to change our courseand thus to survive. But if we do continue down the road of a mixed economy,then let them pour all the millions and billions they can into the spaceprogram. If the United States is to commit suicide, let it not be for the sakeand support of the worst human elements, the parasites-on-principle, at home andabroad. Let it not be its only epitaph that it died paying its enemies for itsown destruction. Let some of its lifeblood go to the support of achievement andthe progress of science. The American flag on the moon—or on Mars, or onJupiter—will, at least, be a worthy monument to what had once been a greatcountry."},{"pageContent":"18Epitaph for a Cultureby Ayn RandThis article was published in The Ayn Rand Letter on January 15, 1973,three-and-a-half years after the flight of Apollo 11.“A sense of loss pervades the space community on the day after [the] Apollo[program]. It is the bewilderment that comes from having achieved ‘theimpossible dream’—a frequently used phrase here—and now being left with nothingbut memories and a gnawing feeling that all the effort was not reallyappreciated.”This is the opening paragraph of a news story in The New York Times (December21, 1972), sent from Houston on December 20, the day after the splashdown ofApollo 17, which marked the end of the Apollo program. It is an interestingstory in that it is written by a good reporter who, by presenting the facts,offers, inadvertently, a profound indictment of today’s culture.In regard to great events, objectivity is possible to good reporters, butneutrality is not. It is obvious that that reporter feels sympathy for the menof the Apollo program and shares their bewilderment. It is obvious also that hefeels admiration for their achievements—and, at a certain point, proceeds torepress it, right there, on paper, before the reader’s eyes.The story, entitled “Meaning of Apollo: The Future Will Decide,” is an attemptto answer the question: “After eleven years and an expenditure of $25 billion,after nine spaceships have flown to the moon and twelve men have walked itssurface, what has it all meant?”“It may be the greatest achievement of the century.... It may be a major‘turning point’ in history ... But it may never be possible for the people whowilled this glorious adventure to know what they have wrought. Such is theinevitable frustration of those who attempt truly great things.” He is wrong onthis point. Those who achieve truly great things know what they have achieved,which makes their social position harder to bear: it is the lack of appreciationthat they are unable to understand.The story quotes one tribute—introducing it as “Perhaps the most satisfyingassessment for the four hundred thousand people who toiled on Apollo at its peak...”—a statement made by, of all people, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.: “The twentiethcentury will be remembered, when all else about it is forgotten, as the centuryin which man first burst his terrestrial bonds and began the exploration ofspace.” This seems to be a minority opinion, however, at least as far as thematerial quoted in the story is concerned.“The critics of Apollo, and there have been many, believe it was an evasion ofearthly responsibility. They usually share the sentiments of the late Max Born,the Nobel laureate who said, ‘Space travel is a triumph of intellect, but atragic failure of reason.’ They view Apollo as America’s pyramids, a folly ofnational vanity, or as technology’s Chartres, a symbol of the machine’s newdominion over man and reason.”Don’t ask me what they mean by the word “reason”—ask Immanuel Kant.“Even though there are no immediate plans for return trips to the moon or formanned voyages to the planets, who knows how the awareness of such a capabilitywill affect man’s image of himself?”Some people seem to know—and are struggling frantically to kill that image. Thereporter indicates their kind of reaction. The first photographs of the wholeearth, he states, which were brought by Apollo 8, made people feel that “theearth was a small and fragile sphere.” I do not personally know anyone who feltthat way, but it has certainly been a stressed, pushed, well-press-agentedsentiment, then and since.Whose purpose and motives would it serve? Well, Dr. René Dubos, a microbiologistat the Rockefeller University (and an influential leader of the ecologicalcrusade), says that this sentiment “may be Apollo’s greatest contribution andcould lead to a ‘new theology of the earth.’ It was no coincidence,” he says,“that the ecology movement gathered real force at the time of Apollo.”Two paragraphs later, the story presents the three truest, most perceptive, mostphilosophical—and, in regard to the essence of today’s culture, mosthorrifying—paragraphs I have ever read in a newspaper:Another reason for some confusion over Apollo’s significance could be that, inone sense, the program was out of step with the times. For all its vauntedtechnology, it was somewhat old-fashioned, a reflection of America past morethan of America present.Apollo was an expression of faith in the value of scientific discovery in a timeof reaction against science, even against rationality. Apollo was an act ofcan-do optimism, of a belief in progress, in a time of reigning pessimism.Apollo was the work of a dedicated team, pursuing a well-defined goal, in a timeof bitter confusion of national purpose. Apollo was, moreover, a success risingabove so much failure.If you want to know the difference between me and many other people, it is this:the moment I grasped that such was the essence of the culture, I would be on thebarricades, fighting for man’s highest value: his mind—against the whole world,if necessary (as I am doing). And I would not be able fully to grasp the answerto the question: How can anyone accept such a culture in passive resignation?(Forgive me for talking about myself at this point and in this context: I haveno other way to express my appraisal.)Oddly enough, the story gives a clue to that answer. The very next paragraph isan act of repression displayed in public, the act of a mind slamming the door ona blinding vision, on itself, and on the best within it: “But these are complexcontradictions better left to the historians of another time”—which is animpersonal substitute for the sentence: “Who am I to know?”What is left after such an abdication? Within the two-and-a-half inches ofnewsprint concluding the story, we are offered the sight of a phenomenon muchbroader than the problem of that particular reporter: the birth of a hopelesslonging in a human mind, of a limp, quiet, wistful aspiration and a staticpain—the noninflammable ashes left by the renunciation of something man may notrenounce:Perhaps a better measure of Apollo will come from some future Homer, who will beable to thrill generations with tales of those frail little vessels out on theblack sea of space and of those men in strange white suits stepping tentativelyamong the boulders and craters of the moon.... In those legends of TranquilityBase and Neil A. Armstrong, of the beauty of the earth as seen from space, maylie the inspiration for even greater deeds both in space and on earth.If that future Homer came today, that reporter would no longer be able to hearhim.I remember wondering, at the age of about ten, why adults admired virtue andheroism in literature, yet never sought to bring them into their own lives. Inthis respect, I have never grown up. But I felt an enormous sadness, when Ibegan to understand such lives.[In my article on “Apollo 11,” I wrote:] “For once, if only for seven minutes,the worst among those who saw it had to feel not ‘How small is man by the sideof the Grand Canyon!’ but ‘How great is man and how safe is nature when heconquers it!’ That we had seen a demonstration of man at his best, no one coulddoubt ... And no one could doubt that we had seen an achievement of man in hiscapacity as a rational being.”Apparently, Dr. Dubos’s followers and I perceived the same implications in thesame event. The difference—the death-or-life difference—ties in our respectiveestimates of these implications.I have been saying for years that the goal of modern philosophy is thedestruction of reason, and that today’s culture is motivated by hatred of man.Now you can hear it admitted—not in esoteric academic publications, or in thetone of a shocking discovery, but in the matter-of-fact, taken-for-granted,reporto rial voice of a newspaper story.Referring to that story’s three crucial paragraphs, ask yourself whether men maypermit themselves to evade the conclusions that scream from between the lines.If the Apollo program was “out of step with the times,” then what sort of hellis our time, and where are our steps leading us? If Apollo was “somewhatold-fashioned,” then what is the meaning of today’s fashions? If Apollo was “areflection of America past more than of America present,” then America past wasincalculably superior to America present: it had created a better way of living,it knew some truths which we have lost and which, if we value our lives, weshould rush to recover.“Apollo was an expression of faith in the value of scientific discovery” (“faithin science” is a post-Kantian contradiction in terms: “confidence” is the properword)—while ours is “a time of reaction against science, even againstrationality.” If so, then that reaction should have been blasted out of anyhonest mind by the blast that lifted Apollo II-which was a spectacular proof ofthe power of science and rationality.“Apollo was an act of can-do optimism, of a belief in progress” (“can-do” is atimid substitute for “self-confidence”)—while ours is “a time of reigningpessimism.” If so, then self-confident optimism and the conviction that progressis possible to man have been justified and validated more resoundingly thananyone could ask for. And the same event has shown us the precondition ofself-confidence, optimism, and progress, like skywriting left in the wake ofthose rockets: rationality. There is no necessity or justification for men tosuffer in stagnant hopelessness. If pessimism is reigning over our time, whoenthroned it and isn’t it time to stage a revolution against its reign?“Apollo was, moreover, a success rising above so much failure.” Is this a reasonfor being confused over and indifferent to Apollo’s significance? Innocentfailure makes an honest mind check its premises, seek further knowledge, andseize upon the sight of a triumphant success as upon a life line—in order togain courage, inspiration, and a lead to the secret that made it possible.But all these conclusions presuppose an honest (i.e., rational) mind, anauthentic goodwill toward men, an unbreached dedication to the pursuit of truth,and an eager desire to discover the proper way for man to live on earth. What ifa person lacks these qualifications? If he does, the result will be thementality represented by the “critics of Apollo.”If repeated failures make some men stick blindly to the same course, and damnsuccess as evit—white proclaiming that they are moved by love for mankind—it istheir motive that must be questioned.In various disguises, the motive has been the same throughout history: hatred ofman’s mind—and, therefore, of man—and, therefore, of life—and, therefore, of anysuccess, happiness or value man may achieve in life. The motive is hatred of thegood for being the good. (See my article “The Age of Envy,” in [The New Left:The Anti-Industrial Revolution, 2nd ed.].)The publicly visible symptom of this hatred is the desire to infect man with ametaphysical inferiority complex—to hold up to him a loathsome self-image, tokeep him small, to keep him guilty. The invisible part of it is the desire tobreak man’s spirit. The greatest threat to such a goal is any glimpse of man thehero, which the victims might catch. And nothing could offer mankind so direct,dramatic, and stunning an image of man the hero, on such a globally visiblescale, as Apollo’s feat has done.For ages, it was religion that had done the job of keeping man small—bycomparing him to the immensity of alleged supernatural powers. Its secularequivalents implemented the same intention by comparing him to the size of theGrand Canyon. When science enabled man to lift his head, when he began to gaincontrol of the earth, and the Grand Canyon ploy wore out, the haters’contingents swooped down upon the task of minimizing his achievement byshrinking the stature of the earth—which, they declared, “was a small andfragile sphere.” No, it was no coincidence that “the ecology movement gatheredreal force at the time of Apollo”—or that Dr. René Dubos is dreaming of a newtheology.Most people do not share the views of Apollo’s critics. The popular reaction toApollo 11 was a significant demonstration of the breach between the Americanpeople and the intellectuals. But in this issue, the people are helpless: theyrespond to Apollo’s greatness, they admire it, they long for the values itrepresents—but they are not aware of their reasons in clear, conscious terms.They cannot express, uphold, or fight for what they know only in the form ofnameless emotions, and they will give up—as the Times reporter gave up. Aculture is made—or destroyed—by its articulate voices.That reporter could have enlightened people—but he, too, is a victim. He saidmore, with deeper theoretical perceptiveness, than most newsmen do today. Butwithout the help of philosophy, he was unable to be certain of his ownconvictions—so he passed the buck to future historians and bowed to the will of“our times.” Who makes our time what it is? Who makes any times or any culture?Philosophers. What did they teach that reporter in college? What are theyteaching today?Suppose you heard a man make the following speech: “I ignore the greatachievement I have just witnessed—because the age of achievement is past. Thisachievement is a feat of science—but science is futile. This achievement is atriumph of rationality—but reason is impotent. This achievement is the productof self-confidence and of man’s capacity for progress—but man is a weak, evil,miserable creature, born to be depraved and helpless. This achievement is theproduct of a dedicated team, pursuing a well-defined goat—but voluntarycooperation is impossible to men, goals are unattainable, and definitions aresuperfluous (or arbitrary). This achievement is a glorious success rising abovea swamp of failure, but man, by his nature, is doomed to fail—and anyone whosays otherwise is a hater of mankind!” If you heard this, you would run—or youwould fight. Yet this is the speech which modern philosophy has been making forwell over a century—and this is the speech you have been hearing for years, fromtwo-bit intellectuals and fifty-grand-a-year professors, who are in control oftoday’s culture.A culture that tolerates such leadership is doomed. That reporter’s story is itsappropriate epitaph. If a future historian were to say: “This was the age whenmen traveled to another celestial body for the first time, but theircontemporaries did not acclaim their achievement—some, because they knew it wasgreat; the rest, because greatness did not matter to them any longer—this wouldbe the most damning obituary on the soul of our times.As to the men of Apollo, this would add another measure of heroism (the statusof being an exception) to their heroic achievement—like a salute from a greatdistance, some sense of which may, perhaps, reach them in their presentloneliness: they are used to great distances."},{"pageContent":"19Assault from the Ivory Tower: The Professors’ War Against Americaby Leonard PeikoffThis lecture was delivered at the Ford Hall Forum on April 24, 1983, andpublished in The Objectivist Forum, October-December 1983.Intellectuals around the world generally take a certain pride, whether deservedor not, in their own countries’ achievements and traditions. When they lash outat some group, it is not their nation, but some villain allegedly threateningit, such as the rich, the Jews, or the West. This pattern is true of Canada,from which I originally came, and it is true to my knowledge of England, France,Germany, Russia, China. But it is not true of America. One of the most strikingthings I observed when I first came here was the disapproval, the resentment,even the hatred of America, of the country as such and of most things American,which is displayed by American intellectuals; it is especially evident amongprofessors in the humanities and social sciences, whom I came to know the best.Typically these professors regard the American political system, capitalism, asbarbaric, anachronistic, selfish. They tell their classes that the American pastis a record of brutal injustice, whether to the poor, or to the Third World, orto the fish, or to the ethnic group of the moment. They describe the Americanpeople as materialistic, insensitive, racist. They seem to regard most thingsEuropean or Oriental or even primitive as interesting, cultured, potentiallydeep, and anything characteristically American—from rugged individualism to moonlandings to tap dancing to hamburgers—as junk, as superficial, vulgar,philistine. When the New Left, taught by these same professors, erupted a whileback, the student rebels expressed their philosophy by desecrating the Americanflag—blowing their noses in it, or using it to patch the seat of their pants. Ido not know another country in which anti-patriotism has ever on such a scalebeen the symbol of an ideology.It happened here because America at root is an ideology. America is the onlycountry in history created not by meaningless warfare or geographical accident,but deliberately, on the basis of certain fundamental ideas. The foundingfathers explicitly championed a certain philosophy, which they made the basis ofAmerica’s distinctive political institutions and national character, and thatphilosophy to some extent survives among the citizens to this day. That is whythe professors I mentioned can feel at home and at peace anywhere else in theworld, but not here: the fundamental ideas of the founding fathers are anathemato today’s intellectuals.The war against America mentioned in the title of my talk is not a political oranticapitalist war as such; that is merely a result, a last consequence. The warI want to discuss is deeper: it is the assault against the founding philosophyof this country that is now being conducted by our universities. This war isbeing conducted not only by radicals and by leftists, but also by most of themainstream, respectable moderates on the faculties. There are exceptions; thereare professors still carrying on some traditions from a better era. But thesemen are not a power in our colleges, merely a remnant of the past that has notyet fully died out.The basic philosophic credo of the United States was eloquently stated twocenturies ago by Elihu Palmer, a spokesman of the revolutionary era. “Thestrength of the human understanding,” he wrote, “is incalculable, its keennessof discernment would ultimately penetrate into every part of nature, were itpermitted to operate with uncontrolled and unqualified freedom.” At last, hesays, men have escaped from the mind-destroying ideas of the Middle Ages; theyhave grasped “the unlimited power of human reason,” “reason, which is the gloryof our nature.” Now, he says, men should feel “an unqualified confidence” intheir mental powers and energy, and they should proceed to remake the worldaccordingly.1 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en16]Such was the basic approach of the men who threw off the shackles of a despoticpast and built this nation.Now let me quote, more or less at random, from some modern college teachers. Inpreparation for this talk, I asked Objectivists around the country to tell mewhat they are being taught in college on basic issues. I received a flood ofeloquent mail and clippings, for which I am very grateful, and I would like toshare some of it with you.First, an excerpt from a textbook on The Craft of Writing prepared by someprofessors of rhetoric at Berkeley:“What do Plato’s opinions, or any other writer’s opinions we might choose tostudy, have to do with learning to write? Everything. Before anything good cancome out of writing, the students must at least sense the presuppositions of thewriter in his civilization. And the first presupposition is this: we do notreally know, surely and indubitably, the answer to any important question. Othercultures know such answers, or think they do, and writing is consequently a verydifferent experience for them. But we, collectively, do not.... It would be verycomfortable to be able to act upon the basis of immutable truth, but it is notavailable to us.”2 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en17] Note here thestatement of pure skepticism: truth or knowledge is not available to us—offeredas a flat statement, uncontroversial, even self-evident.Next I quote from The Washington Post, from a story about a symposium held atCatholic University, dealing with Galileo’s intransigent defense of his beliefsagainst the Inquisition. At one point, a prominent Harvard astronomer made anoffhand comment contrasting Galileo’s attitude toward scientific beliefs withthat of modern scientists. “Today in science,” the professor said, “there is no‘belief as such, only probability.”A man in the audience, visibly emotional, stood up [the story continues]. “Icannot credit it. I cannot believe you would say” that scientists do not really“believe” in the objects they study.... “Do you really think it’s possible that[astronomical science] is all wrong?” he demanded. “Yes,” said [the astronomer].“It is possible.”We cannot, he went on, know that there are atoms or what stars are. The reporterthen summarizes the astronomer’s conclusion:Scientists now cannot fail to remember that absolute reality collapsed justafter the turn of the century, with Einstein.... Since then, one simply cannotspeak of certainties, of what is real and what is not. “I cannot believe it,”muttered the man in the audience as he sat down.3[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en18]He better believe it. This viewpoint is standard today; the latest scientificdiscoveries, we are told regularly, invalidate everything we thought we onceknew, and prove that reality is inaccessible to our minds. If so, one might ask,what is it that scientists are studying? If we can know nothing, how didEinstein arrive at his discoveries and how do we know that they are right? Andif certainty is unattainable and inconceivable, how can we decide how close weare to it, which is what a probability estimate is? But it is no use asking suchquestions, because the cause of modern skepticism is not Einstein or anyscientific discoveries.Now let me tell you about another incident. One Objectivist undergraduate atColumbia University wrote, for a composition course, a research paper presentingthe founding fathers’ view of reason. The paper was sympathetic to the foundingfathers’ view, though not explicitly so. The teacher several times put questionmarks beside phrases that bothered her (e.g., beside “facts of reality”) orwrote marginal comments such as “Do you really believe this?” At the end, shesummed up: “The paper is very well written.... It’s difficult for me to see howwe can write about ‘reason’ without the nineteenth century’s sad discovery inmind—that... [the belief that] reason will help us get better and better meantnaivete in many senses. Let’s discuss.” In the discussion, the student told me,the teacher said that the nineteenth century had established the inability ofreason to know reality. Freud in particular, she said, had refuted the foundingfathers. “He showed that man is really an irrational creature, and that theEnlightenment idea that all our problems can be solved by reason is quiteunjustified.”4 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en19]The founding fathers, as thinkers of the Enlightenment era, championed the powerof man’s unaided intellect. It was on this basis, after centuries of Europeantyranny, that they urged the right to liberty, which was the right of each manto rely in action on his own mind’s judgment. They upheld this right becausethey believed that the human mind is reliable—that, properly employed, it canreach a knowledge of reality and give the individual the guidance he needs tolive. The individual, they held, does not have to submit blindly to anyauthority, whether church or state, because he has within himself a brilliantand potent cognitive tool to direct him. That tool is the power of reason, the“only oracle” he needs—“oracle” in the sense of a source of absolute, objectivetruth.There is no such truth, said the antipode and destroyer of the founding fathers’legacy. I mean the philosopher Immanuel Kant. Kant is the basic cause of themodern anti-reason trend. He is the man who, two hundred years ago, launched anunprecedented attack on the power of the human mind, declared that reason is inprinciple incapable of knowing reality, and thereby put an end to theEnlightenment. Freud was merely one of his many heirs, as are the modernskeptics who distort Einstein’s findings to rationalize their viewpoint, as arethe rhetoric professors at Berkeley and all their like-minded colleagues. Incountless forms, Kant’s rejection of reason is at the root of our moderncolleges.Question, debate, dispute—the founding fathers urged men—because by this meansyou will reach answers to your questions and discover how to act. Question,debate, dispute—our Kantianized faculty urges today—not to find the answers, butto discover that there aren’t any, that there is no source of truth and no guideto action, that the Enlightenment viewpoint was merely a comfortablesuperstition or a naivete. Come to college, they say, and we’ll cure you of thatsuperstition for life. Which, unfortunately, they often do. “On the first day ofclasses,” a student from Kent State University in Ohio wrote me, “my Englishprofessor said the purpose of college is to take a high-school graduate who’ssure of himself and make him confused.”“Kent fulfills that objective perfectly,” the writer adds, not only in itsinsistent pro-skepticism propaganda, but also in its very method of presentingthe course material. “Its courses are a hodgepodge of random and contradictoryinformation that can’t possibly be integrated into a consistent whole, and oneof the first things it teaches its students is not to bother to try. The typicalKent graduate leaves the school feeling bewildered ... vaguely pleased that hisbewilderment must mean he came out of college smarter than when he went in, andvaguely displeased that his enlightened confusion hasn’t made him happier thanit has.”5 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en20] This is an exact descriptionof many current graduates, and unfortunately not only in Ohio. That Englishprofessor’s statement of the purpose of college was not a wisecrack; it wasmeant, and practiced, as a serious pedagogical principle. We have reached avariant of the inverted slogans of Orwell’s 1984: the claim to knowledge, we arebeing taught, betrays ignorance. Knowledge is Ignorance, but Confusion isEnlightenment. That is what you can hope to achieve after tens of thousands ofdollars in tuition and four years of study and agonizing term papers—a B.C.degree, Bachelor of Confusion.If no one can know the truth, you might ask, why are these professors botheringto pursue their subjects at all? Some claim to be attaining probability, byunspecified means. But some are more modern and more frank. Here is anotherteacher from Columbia, this time from the Graduate School of Business, whooffers a course entitled “Individual and Collective Behavior.” According to oneof his students, this teacher stated in class “that psychological theoriescannot be proved. He added that this was a good thing, since it provided scopefor further research.”6 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en21]Do you follow the reasoning here? If we could prove a psychological theory, thatwould eliminate a whole area of research; there would be no need to investigatethat particular question, because we would already have established the answer.On the other hand, if we can never know, we can go on looking forever, with nougly barriers, such as knowledge, to stand in the way. But why then look? Why isresearch good if we never prove anything by it? Obviously, it is an end initself. One does research in order to get research grants from the government,in order to write papers and get promotions so that other researchers can attackone’s papers and thereby get more grants to finance more research for morestudies, forever; with a voluminous literature on the weirdest, most senselesssubjects pouring out, which everyone must study and no one can keep up with orintegrate, and with everyone agreeing that none of it proves anything—all of ita giant academic con game divorced from cognition, from human life, fromreality. Such is the nature of research under the reign of skepticism.No one, however, can be a consistent skeptic; a man devoid of all knowledgewould be like a newborn baby, unable to act or function at all. Despite theirviewpoint, therefore, skeptics have to find something to rely on and follow as aguide, and what most of them choose to follow ultimately is: the opinion ofothers, the group, society.Kant gave this approach a complex philosophic defense. There are, he says, tworealities. There is reality as it is in itself, which is unknowable. And thereis the reality we live in and deal with, the physical world, which, he says,mankind itself creates; the physical world, he says, is created by subjectivebut universal mechanisms inherent in the human mind. An idea that is merely theproduct of an individual brain, in this view, may or may not be acceptable; butan idea universal to the mind of the species can necessarily be relied on,because that defines reality for us; that is what creates reality, at least ourprivate, subjective, human reality. Under all its complexities andqualifications (and there are mountains of them) this doctrine amounts tosaying: the individual’s mind is helpless, but the group, mankind, iscognitively all-powerful. If mankind collectively thinks in terms of a certainidea, that is truth, not the objective, real truth, of course, we can’t knowthat; but subjective, human truth, which is the only truth we can know.The founding fathers, being champions of reason, were champions of theindividual. Reason, they held, is an attribute of each man alone, by himself;the power of the mind means the power of the individual. With today’santi-reason trend, however, such individualism simply disappears. In ourcolleges today, therefore, alongside Kant’s skepticism about true reality, thereis also the other element of Kant, the one systematically promoted by Hegel andMarx: the exaltation of the social. The student gets a powerful double message:you can’t know anything, there is no certainty—and: society knows, you mustadapt to its beliefs, who are you to question the consensus?Here is an example of the second from a psychology textbook written by aprofessor at the University of North Carolina. Let me preface this by sayingthat philosophers before Kant used to distinguish two sources of knowledge:experience (which led to empirical knowledge) and reason (rational knowledge).These two were conceived, with whatever errors, as capacities of the individualenabling him to reach truth. Now here are the new, Kantian definitions.“Empirical knowledge is the agreement in reports of repeated observations madeby two or more persons. Rational knowledge is the agreement in results ofproblem solving by two or more persons.”7[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en22] In other words: the genus of knowledgeis agreement; the fundamental of knowledge is a social consideration, not therelationship of your mind to reality, but to other men. The individual byhimself, on a desert island, cannot learn, he is cut off from the possibility ofany knowledge, because he cannot tabulate agreement or disagreement. Empiricalobservation is not using your eyes, but taking a Gallup poll of others’ reportson their eyes. Rational knowledge is not achieved by your brain grasping alogical argument; it is “agreement in results of problem solving”—and if menhappen not to agree, for whatever reason or lack of reason, then there is norational knowledge. This is nothing less than public ownership of the means ofcognition, which, as Ayn Rand observed, is what underlies the notion of publicownership of the means of production.If you want to see both Kantian elements—skepticism and the worship of thesocial—come together, consider the field of history today. Here is an excerptfrom a course description at the University of Indiana (Bloomington); the courseis titled “Freedom and the Historian.”History is made by the historian. Each generation of historians reinterprets thepast in the light of its own historical experience and values.... There can bethus no one definitive history of Alexander and no one historical truth aboutthe fall of the Roman Empire.... There have been as many concepts of history, asmany views of historical truth, as there have been cultures.8[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en23]The skeptical theme here is clear—there is “no one definitive history,” “no onehistorical truth.” An old-fashioned person, even of a skeptic mentality, wouldreact: “Well, then, let’s close down the field, if we can’t know the truth.” Butnot the moderns. We can’t know the real truth, they say, but we can know thesubjective truth that we ourselves create. “History is made by the historian.”If there is a consensus of historians, therefore, their viewpoint is valid andworth studying, for that time and culture. As in Kant, there are two realities:the real past (unknowable), and the private past each generation creates, itsown subjective historical truth. Notice that in this viewpoint the historian isat once helpless and omnipotent: he can know nothing really; but on the otherhand he is the creator of history, of the history that we can know, and so he isan unchallengeable authority. If any student disagrees with the fraternity ofhistorians, therefore, he has no chance. On the one side, he hears: “Who are youto know? There are no definitive facts.” On the other, he hears: “History ismade by the historian. Who are you to question it?”Observe what people allow themselves when hiding behind a group. If the authorof that course description were to say: “History is made by me,” he would bedismissed as a paranoid personality. But when he says it collectively: “Historyis made by us, by our guild, by historians,” that is acceptable. This is theKantian exaltation of the social.There is a further development of Kant’s approach beckoning here. Why,historians soon began to ask, should the social authority be universal? Whycan’t there be many groups of historians, each creating history in accordancewith its own mental structure, each version being true for that group though notfor the others? Why, in effect, shouldn’t we be democratic and let everycollective into the act? The result of this line of thinking is pressure-grouphistory, a pluralization of the Kantian approach, in which every group rewritesthe past according to its own predilections, and every group’s views are deemedto be as valid (or invalid) as every other group’s. To be progressive in historytoday means precisely this: it means to respect the rewriting of all the newestgroups, especially if their spokesmen make no sense to you; that shows that youare open-minded, and are not trying to impose your group’s private views onothers. To each his own subjectivism.Is this an exaggeration? A prominent history professor at Stanford University,Carl Degler, recently made a plea for women’s history, explaining that historyvaries subjectively from men to women. He declared: “The real test of thesuccess of affirmative action for women will come not by counting the number orproportion of women in a department or profession, but by the extent to whichmen ... are willing to accept the new and peculiar interests of women aslegitimate and serious, even when those interests are strikingly novel andperhaps even bizarre when compared with current acceptable work in a givenfield.”9 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en24] [Emphasis added.]I once heard a feminist intellectual on television declare that the central factof the ages is rape, and that the culmination of the historical process is thediscovery of the clitoral orgasm, which has finally freed women from men. Thisis surely an approach to history which is “strikingly novel and even bizarre,”but we mustn’t be chauvinistic; history is made by historians, and if a certaingroup begins to push a certain line, and organizes into a new pressure-unit,that line becomes true, true for these people, as true as any other claim in aworld where no one can really know anything. This is what I call Kantianizedhistory.The founding fathers, as men of the Enlightenment, were champions ofdispassionate objectivity; any form of subjectivism, or of emotion-drivencognition, was considered reprehensible by them. The opposite is true today. Ifobjectivity is not possible to man, as the Kantians hold, then in the endanything goes, including any kind of emotionalism; and the humanities and socialsciences end up, not as academic disciplines teaching facts, but as the preserveof shifting lobbyists disseminating sheer propaganda, which is what is happeningincreasingly in our colleges.History is merely one example of it. The field of anthropology offers anothereloquent illustration. First we read, a few months ago, about the scandal ofMargaret Mead. In her famous 1928 book Coming of Age in Samoa, Miss Meadpresented an idyllic picture of life in Samoa. The natives, she claimed, weregentle, peaceful, open, devoid of jealousy, free of stress. It was Rousseau overagain (the noble savage), and Miss Mead’s implicit moral was: the superiority ofprimitive culture over competitive, repressed Western society. Now, finally, atrue scholar, Derek Freeman, an anthropologist from New Zealand, has set therecord straight. After years of study in Samoa, he concluded that the Samoans [Iquote The New York Times‘s summary] “have high rates of homicide and assault,and the incidence of rape in Samoa is among the highest in the world.... [TheSamoans] live within an authority system that regularly results in psychologicaldisturbances ranging from compulsive behaviors to hysterical illnesses andsuicide. They are extremely prone to fits of jealousy.” Etc. Miss Mead’s claims,in sum, “are fundamentally in error and some of them preposterously false.”10[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en25]Judging by what one can gather from the press, anthropologists had known some ofthis for some time, but few had wanted to challenge Miss Mead publicly. Why not?Aside from a nature-nurture controversy that became involved here, two mainreasons were operative, as far as I can make out.One was the feeling that Miss Mead’s viewpoint—her endorsement of primitivesociety over Western civilization—is noble, moral, good. The second is apervasive subjectivism, which makes a potential dissenter feel: “I can’t besure, anybody can claim to prove or disprove anything, anthropology is whateveranthropologists say, why start a fight with a saint of the field for nothing?”Now couple this episode with another recent scandal in anthropology. Did youread about the doctoral candidate from Stanford who, while studying in RedChina, found that abortions were being forcibly performed on helpless womenafter the sixth month of pregnancy (when it is a dangerous, bloody practice),and who published this news in a Taiwanese weekly complete with photographs? TheChinese were furious, though the truth of his charges is not debated; and theStanford Anthropology Department expelled the student from Stanford forunethical conduct—in effect, so far as one can decipher the department’sstatements, for blowing the whistle on his host country, an allegedlyunforgivable academic sin. As one radio talk-show host in New York, BarryFarber, asked rhetorically: can you imagine the Stanford Anthropology Departmentexpelling a student for doing exactly the same thing in regard to South Africa,i.e., for publishing articles about that regime’s racial crimes? Such a studentwould have been treated as an academic hero.The double standard involved in the two cases is appalling. One scholar,Margaret Mead, who condemns the West, becomes a revered figure for decades, eventhough her factual claims are dead wrong. Another, who prints the uncontestedtruth about a communist dictatorship, is expelled from his discipline. Is thisfairness? Is this objectivity? Or is this the complete politiciza tion of thefield? But we must remember: the Kantians declare that there is no objectivity,and that truth is whatever the group wants it to be. In the social sciencestoday, the teachers do not leave much doubt about what they want it to be.I must quote one further example of today’s subjectivist trend, simply toindicate to you how brazen it is becoming. A recent issue of The National LawJournal describes a new development in the teaching of law in our universities,a development sponsored by a Harvard law professor, a law professor from SUNY(Buffalo), a sociologist from the University of Pennsylvania, and many others.These men “agree that an objective legal mode of reasoning, distinguishable fromthe society where it is being applied and the people applying it and capable ofyielding an inevitable result, does not exist; that law, by its mask ofobjectivity, functions chiefly to legitimize social and economic inequities inthe eyes of the lower classes as a way of keeping them docile; that becausedemocracy is a good and the law a shell, the goal is to found a government notby law but by people.”11 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en26]This statement is a union of Kant and Marx. Let me translate it. “There is noobjective legal reasoning; law pretends to be objective, but really it is aninstrument of the wealthy to keep the poor docile; law, in effect, is the opiateof the masses”—these are law professors speaking, mind you—“and our goal shouldbe a system run not by law, but by people.” How are the people to governthemselves, if not by reference to an objective code of laws? How are they tosettle their disputes and resolve conflicting claims? In this context, there isonly one alternative to government by law: government by pressure group, i.e.,by every sizable pack or tribe in the land struggling to seize control of thelegislature and the courts, and then ramming its arbitrary desires down thethroats of the rest, until they rebel and start ramming their desires, etc.—allof it a naked exercise in power politics, of group-eat-group, without thepretense of objectivity or justice.One of the great achievements of Western civilization was the concept of asociety in which men are not left helplessly at the mercy of clashing groups,but can resolve disputes fairly, as individuals, by reference to impersonalprinciple. This is what used to be called a government of laws and not of men.Today we have the frightening spectacle of law professors telling us that whatwe need is a government of men and not of laws. If this school needs a name, itshould call itself “Lawyers for Gang Warfare.”You may be wondering whether things are better in the physical sciences today.They are, somewhat, but science, too, depends on philosophy. Modern sciencearose in an Aristotelian period, a period characterized by respect for reasonand objective reality, and it cannot survive the collapse of that philosophy.One sign of this is the skepticism among scientists illustrated by the Harvardastronomer I quoted earlier. But there is another, even more ominous sign. Imean the claims made by an increasing number of physicists that modern physicsis growing closer to Oriental mysricism; you may have heard the tributes thatthese scientists now lavish on works such as the Upanishads and the I Ching. Ina rather mild statement, one such scientist wrote recently that there is a“curious connection between the sub-rational and the super-rational. Intuition,sudden flashes of insight, and even mystical experiences seem to play a role inthe restructuring of science.” This quote, by the way, is from a textbookwritten by the Head of the Astrophysics Department at the University of Colorado(Boulder).I have said that men cannot be consistent skeptics. One way out is to turn forguidance to society. But there is another way: old-fashioned mysticism—theturning not to society, but to the supernatural. Although this method was hardlyoriginated by Kant, here, too, his influence is at work today. Our minds cannotknow reality, Kant said, but certain of our feelings—our unprovable,nonconceptual, nonrational feelings—can give us a hint as to its nature. ThisKantian suggestion—that the mind is helpless, but feelings may be able toreplace it as a cognitive faculty—was taken up in the nineteenth century by awhole school of Romanticists, such as Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, who admiredand agreed with the essential ideas of Kant, and proceeded to unleash a flood ofovert irrationalism, often including a deep admiration for Oriental mysticism.Today, this particular development has also become widespread in the West; youcan see it in everything from art to psychotherapy to diet fads, and it isshowing up now even in physics. If scientists do not have a rational philosophyto guide them, they, too, have to sink back ultimately into the common horde.If you wonder what kind of physics is being produced by these mysticalscientists, let me quote one paragraph from the Colorado textbook. The passageoccurs in the context of an attack on the concept of reality.Even more disruptive to our notions of reality is the recognition that it isimpossible to describe the entirety of an object at one time. Because of thefinite speed of light no object has an instantaneous existence. All extendedobjects are fuzzy time averages. In order for an object to be totally present ata given instant of time, instantaneous communication would be required. Sincethat is impossible, all parts of an object exist in the past of every otherpart. Our present does not exist. One not only needs a clairvoyant to foretellthe future but also to foretell the present.The name of this textbook, by the way, is The Fermenting Universe.12[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en27] I do not say that this book is typicalof our college science, not yet. What I do say is this: it is significant, it isfrightening, that such a book by an author in such a prestigious position iseven possible.As to the wider meaning of the latest scientific theorizing taken as a whole, Iwill leave it to an intellectual historian from SUNY (Oswego) to comment. Thisprofessor seems to agree with all the skeptical and mystical moderninterpretations of science. In a lecture entitled “The Collapse of Absolutes,”he sums up for his students:What does all this mean? Well, first of all, it means that the universe hasbecome unintelligible.... Secondly, scientists themselves have become humble andadmit that science may never be able to observe reality.... Thirdly, thephysical world of Einstein has become something that even the most educatedlayman finds difficult to understand ... He in short finds it incomprehensibleand irrational.13 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en28]In other words, if the college student runs to science as an escape from thehumanities and the social sciences, he is learning there, too, that the mind isimpotent.Philosophy sets the standards for every school and department within auniversity. When philosophy goes bad, corrupt manifestations turn up everywhere.Visit Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, for instance, and audit a coursetitled “Creativity in Business” offered to MBA candidates. I quote the SanFrancisco Chronicle:The students [in this course] learn meditation and chanting, analyze dreams,paint pictures, study I Ching and tarot cards.... The course reading includes Iam That by Swami Muktananda ... Precision Nirvana ... Yoga Aphorisms.... Onewoman who had been a Moonie earlier in her life was fearful after a couple ofsessions that she was getting into the same sort of thing, said [the professor].It’s nothing of the kind, he added, but the heavy emphasis on developing theintuitive side of a student’s mind, where creativity is expressed, can sometimesleave that impression.There are, this professor teaches his students, two main blocks to creativity.One is fear; the other is: “the endless chattering of the mind.”14[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en29] If mysticism is the fashion amongscientists, why not among our future business leaders, too?According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, the Moonies and the HareKrishnas have become a problem to the colleges. “Many administrators ... agreethat religious cults have found college campuses to be among their moreprofitable recruiting grounds in recent years.”15[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en30] This is hardly a mystery. Thecolleges, by means of what they are teaching, are systematically setting thestudents up to be taken over. The Reverend Moon or his equivalent will be theultimate profiteer of today’s trends if these are not stopped.Now let us switch fields and turn to the area of sex education. I suggest youread a text widely used in junior high and high schools, cited by the AmericanLibrary Association as one of the “Best Books for Young Adults in 1978.” Thebook claims, to impressionable teenagers, that anything in the realm of sex isacceptable as long as those who do it feel no guilt. Among other practices, thebook explicitly endorses transvestism, prostitution, open marriage,sado-masochism, and bestiality. In regard to this latter, however, the bookcautions the youngsters to avoid “poor hygiene, injury by the animal or to theanimal, or guilt on the part of the human.”16[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en31]If you want still more, turn to art—for instance, poetry—as it is taught todayin our colleges. For an eloquent example, read the widely used Norton’sIntroduction to Poetry, and see what modern poems are offered to studentsalongside the recognized classics of the past as equally deserving of study,analysis, respect. One typical entry, which immediately precedes a poem byBlake, is entitled “Hard Rock Returns to Prison from the Hospital for theCriminal Insane.” The poem begins: “Hard Rock was ‘known not to take no shit /From nobody’ ...” and continues in similar vein throughout. This item can betopped only by the volume’s editor, who discusses the poem reverently,explaining that it has a profound social message: “the despair of thehopeless.”17 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en32] Just as history is whathistorians say, so art today is supposed to be whatever the art world endorses,and this is the kind of stuff it is endorsing. After all, the modernists shrug,who is to say what’s really good in art? Aren’t Hard Rock’s feelings just asgood as Tennyson’s or Milton’s?Now I want to discuss the cash value of the trends we have been considering. Thebase of philosophy is metaphysics and epistemology, i.e., a view of reality andof reason. The first major result of this base, its most important practicalconsequence, is ethics or morality, i.e., a code of values.The founding fathers held a definite view of morality. Although they were notconsistent, their distinctive ethical principle was: a man’s right to thepursuit of happiness, his own happiness, to be achieved by his own thought andeffort—which means: not an ethics of self-sacrifice, but of self-reliance andself-fulfillment—in other words, an ethics of egoism, or what Ayn Rand called“the virtue of selfishness.” The founding fathers built this country on atwofold philosophical basis: first, on the championship of reason; then, as aresult, on the principle of egoism, in the sense just indicated. The product ofthis combination was the idea: let us have a political system in which theindividual is free to function by his own mind and for his own sake or profit.Such was the grounding of capitalism in America.Just as our modern colleges have declared war on the first of these ideas (onreason), so they have declared war on the second. Here again they are followingKant. Kant was the greatest champion of self-sacrifice in the history ofthought. He held that total selflessness is man’s duty, that suffering is man’sdestiny in life, and that any egoistic motive, any quest for personal joy andany form of self-love, is the antonym of morality.The Dean of Arts and Sciences at Colgate University expressed a similarviewpoint clearly in some convocation remarks he offered in 1981, attacking whathe saw as an epidemic of egoism on campus. Egoism, the dean claimed, necessarilymeans whim-worship. Here is his definition of egoism: “serving the self, ortaking care of number one ... mindless hedonism and a concern for me, me now.”Where did he get this definition? Why can’t an egoist be enlightened, rational,long-range? No answer was given. The proper path for us to follow, the dean wenton, was indicated by the “socially concerned” students of the sixties, withtheir “emphasis on duty to others” and on “the ascetic mode.” We may leave asidehere the actual moral character of those violent, drug-addicted rebels of thesixties so admired by the dean. The point is the choice he offers: mindlesshedonism versus asceticism—note the word—i.e., utter self-abnegation,renunciation, sacrifice. Today’s students, the dean said disapprovingly, attendcollege for reasons such as “to get a better job and to make more money.” This,he said, is wrong. “It is ... my hope for you that you will recognize that thereis life outside the self, that we live in a world that cries out for those withvisions of a community founded upon just principles.... and [I] wish thatpreoccupation with self will give way to concern for others.”18[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en33]Professors sometimes take sides in a controversy, but deans, to my knowledge,never do. When a dean makes an ideological statement, you can be sure that it isa universally accepted bromide on campus.Our colleges are allegedly open to all ideas, yet on the fundamental issues ofphilosophy we hear everywhere the same rigid, dogmatic viewpoint, just as thoughthe faculties were living and teaching under government censorship. I visitedColumbia’s graduation exercises last year, and the priest who delivered theinvocation declared to the assembled graduates: “The age of individualachievement has passed. When you come to Columbia, you are not to be motivatedby the desire for money, or personal ambition, or success; you are here to learnto serve. And my prayer for you today is that at the end of your life you willbe able to say, ‘Lord, I have been an unworthy servant.’ ” If that priest hadcome out with a plug for the Communist party, it would have caused a stir; if hehad upheld the superiority of Catholicism, ditto. But to state as self-evidentthe moral code common to both caused not a murmur of protest.A social psychologist from Harvard, who also regards that code as self-evident,has devised a test to measure a person’s level of moral reasoning. This test isthe basis of many of the new courses in morality now being offered in schoolsaround the country. The testers give the student a hypothetical situation andseveral possible responses to it. He then chooses the response that best fitshis own attitude. Here is a typical example. “Your spouse is dying from a rarecancer, and doctors believe a drug recently discovered by the town pharmacistmay provide a cure. The pharmacist, however, charges $2,000 for the drug (whichcosts only $200 to make). You can’t afford the drug and can’t raise the money.”Before we proceed to the answers, observe what moral lessons a student wouldabsorb from the statement of the problem alone. Morality does not pertain tonormal situations, it is not concerned with how to live, he learns, but with howto meet disaster, death, terminal cancer. The obstacle to his values, he learns,is greed, the greed of the pharmacist who is trying to exploit him by chargingten times the cost of the product. There is no mention of any effort thepharmacist might have exerted to discover the drug, no mention of any researchor thought or study required of him in order to have discovered an unprecedentedcure for cancer, no mention of any other costs he might have incurred, noquestion of any gratitude to the man who alone has created the power to save thespouse, no mention of any reason why that pharmacist, counter to every principleof self-interest, would overcharge for the drug when he would make more money inthe long run by selling it in greater quantity at a lower price, as the wholehistory of mass production shows. All of this—in an exercise designed to teachmoral reasoning—is omitted as irrelevant. Nor is there any explanation of whythe student cannot raise money—no reference to banks, or savings, or insurance,or relatives. The case is simple: senseless greed on the part of a callousinventor, and what do you do about it?Now comes the answer—six choices, and you must pick one; the answers are givenin ascending order, the morally lowest first. The lowest is: not to steal thedrug (not out of respect for property rights, that doesn’t enter even on thelowest rung of the test, but out of fear of jail). The other five answers alladvocate stealing the drug; they differ merely in their reasons. Here are thethree most moral reasons, according to the test: “(4) I would steal the drugbecause I have a duty springing from the marriage vow I took. (5) I would stealthe drug because the right to life is higher than the right to property. (6) Iwould steal the drug because I respect the dignity of human beings.... [Ishould] act in the best interest of mankind.”19[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en34]Here is an eloquent example of what Ayn Rand has amply demonstrated: the creedof self-sacrifice is not concerned with the “dignity of human beings” or with“the best interest of mankind.” This creed is the destroyer of human dignity andof mankind, because it is incompatible with the requirements of human life. Itscorns—and dismisses as irrelevant—thought, effort, work, achievement, property,trade, justice, every value life requires. All of this is to be sacrificed, thealtruist claims, to that which has the first right on earth: pain, pain as such,weakness, illness, suffering, regardless of its cause. This is the penalizationof success for being success and the rewarding of failure for being failure; itis what Ayn Rand called the hatred of the good for being the good; and it is nowbeing taught to our children, courtesy of a Harvard authority, as an example ofhigh-quality moral reasoning. (As to what will happen to the weak and the sickafter the able and productive have been demeaned, expropriated, and throttled,read Atlas Shrugged, or look at Soviet Russia.)Did Ayn Rand exaggerate in saying that altruists wish to sacrifice thought topain? Let me quote from Dental Products Report magazine in 1982. I do not knowfirst-hand whether this item is true; I hope not. “Some medical schools in theUnited States are considering major changes in the traditional curriculumrequirements for premed and medical students. Harvard, for example, isconsidering abolishing requirements for premed science and, instead, requiringcourses stressing compassion and understanding in dealing with patients.”20[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en35]Did you hear that one? Our doctors may not study much science any longer, butthey will be skilled in expressing compassion to the suffering—who will sufferpermanently, without any chance of relief, because the doctors will no longer bewasting their time on science or thought. This is a perfect, fiction-likeexample of an altruistic curriculum change, if ever I heard one.Now let us sum up the total philosophy advocated by today’s colleges: realityhas collapsed; reason is naive; achievement is unnecessary and unreal. Isometimes fantasize the ideal modem curriculum, which would capture explicitlythe fundamental ideas of the modern university, and recently I found it. I foundthree actual courses offered at three different schools, one covering each basicbranch of philosophy, the sum indicating the naked essence of the modern trend.For metaphysics, we go to the University of Delaware (Newark) to take aninterdisciplinary honors course titled: “Nothing.” Subtitle: “A study of Nil,Void, Vacuum, Null, Zero, and Other Kinds of Nothingness.” The description: “Alecture course exploring the varieties of nothingness from the vacuum and voidof physics and astronomy to political nihilism, to the emptiness of the arts andthe soul.”21 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en36] That is our metaphysicalbase, our view of reality: nothing.For epistemology, we move to New York University to take a course titled “Theoryof Knowledge.” The description: “Various theories of knowledge are discussed,including the view that they are all inadequate and that, in fact, nobody knowsanything. The consequences of skepticism are explored for thought, action,language, and emotional relations.”22 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en37]We end up, for ethics, at Indiana (Bloomington), taking a course titled: “SocialReactions to Handicaps,” the description of which reads, in part: “This coursewill ... explore some of the different ways in which the handicapped individualand the idea of handicap have been regarded in Western Civilization. Figuresfrom the past such as the fool, the madman, the blind beggar, and the witch ...will be discussed.”23 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en38]There was once a time when college students studied facts, knowledge, and humangreatness. Now they study nothingness, ignorance, and the fool, the madman, theblind beggar, and the witch.If the philosophical message taught by our colleges is clear to you, thepolitical views of the faculties will require very little discussion. Politicsis a consequence of philosophy. The precondition of capitalism is egoism, andbeneath that: the efficacy of reason. The consequence of unreason andself-sacrifice, by contrast, is this idea: the individual is helpless on his ownand has no value anyway, and therefore should merge himself into the group andobey its spokesman, the state. Given today’s basic ideas, in short, thecollectivism and statism of the faculties are inevitable—and too obvious to needdocumentation.What I do want to mention is the political end result of our current trend. InThe Ominous Parallels I argue that the intellectuals are preparing us for atotalitarian dictatorship. This may seem like an exaggeration, so I want tooffer one final quote, this one from a philosopher, Richard Rorty, long atPrinceton, now at the University of Virginia. Professor Rorty, himself athorough modern, does not shrink from spelling out the final consequences of themodern skepticism; whatever you think of him, he has the honesty to state hisideas forthrightly. There is no truth, he holds, there is no such subject asphilosophy, there are no objective standards by which to evaluate or criticizesocial and political practices. No matter what is done to the citizens of acountry, therefore, they can have no objective grounds on which to protest.Once, Professor Rorty writes, men could criticize political dictators, at leastin their own minds. They could say to the dictator: “ ‘There is something withinyou which you are betraying. Though you embody the practices of a totalitariansociety which will endure forever, there is something beyond those practiceswhich condemns you.’ ” Once, he states, we could have said that; but no longer.Now we know that there is no knowledge, no values, no standards. Now we mustaccept the fact “that we have not once seen the Truth, and so will not,intuitively, recognize it when we see it again. This means that when the secretpolice come, when the torturers violate the innocent, there is nothing to besaid to them.” Professor Rorty, I must add, claims to be disturbed by thisresult; but he is propagating it vigorously all the same.24[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#en39]Ladies and gentlemen, higher education today has a remarkable press. We hearover and over about the value of our colleges and universities, their importanceto the nation, and our need to contribute financially to their survival andgrowth. In regard to many professional and scientific schools, this is true. Butin regard to the arts, the humanities, the social sciences, the opposite istrue. In those areas, with some rare exceptions, our colleges and universitiesare a national menace, and the better the university, such as Harvard andBerkeley and Columbia, the worse it is. Today’s college faculties are hostile toevery idea on which this country was founded, they are corrupting an entiregeneration of students, and they are leading the United States to slavery anddestruction.What is the solution? The only answer to a corrupt philosophy is a rationalphilosophy, and the only way to spread a rational philosophy is through theuniversities. The universities today—not the churches any longer, and not thepress or TV—are the main transmitters of philosophy; they are what set the toneand direction of a culture. To those of you of college age, therefore, those whodo not subscribe to Kant’s philosophy, I want to say that the moral of myremarks is not: quit college. On the contrary, if you are considering college orare already enrolled in one, I urge you to enter or stay, stay and fight thesystem, by trying to gain a hearing for some other ideas, some pro-Americanideas. The colleges pretend to be open to all viewpoints, even though they arenot. The only hope is to make them live up to their pretense. If you give up thecolleges, you give up any role in the decisive battle for the world, theintellectual battle.I am not suggesting that you become a martyr, or enter into arguments withprofessors who will penalize you for your ideas. Not all of them will, however,and I am speaking within the context and limits of rational self-interest.Within that context, I say: speak up when appropriate, let your voice be heardon campus, try to stick it out and obtain your degree, come back to teach if youcan get in the door and if that is the lifework you want; and if you are analumnus, be careful what kind of academic programs you support financially. Inthis battle, every word, man, and penny counts.I wish I could tell you that your college years will be a glorious crusade.Actually, they will probably be a miserable experience. If you are aphilosophically pro-American student, you have to expect every kind of smearfrom many of your professors. If you uphold the power of reason, you will becalled a fanatic or a dogmatist. If you uphold the right to happiness, you willbe called anti-social or even a fascist. If you admire Ayn Rand, you will becalled a cultist. You will experience every kind of injustice, and even hatred,and you will be unbelievably bored most of the time, and often you will be aloneand lonely. But if you have the courage to venture out into this kind ofnightmare, you will not only be acquiring the diploma necessary for yourprofessional future, you will also be helping to save the world, and we are allin your debt.The young lady who typed this speech said to me at this point: “It’s prettydepressing. Aren’t you going to end on an inspiring note?” I wish I could thinkof one. Perhaps, someday, Objectivists will start a better university, whichwould provide a real alternative to the current scene and offer sanctuary to thekind of young minds now being tortured by the Establishment. But this project,though possible, is still far from being a reality.To those of you in the college trenches today, therefore, I have only a bleakconclusion to offer. And even if I am an atheist, I know no better way to sayit: God bless you, and God help you!NOTES1 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c19_r1.html#Ref-en16] Principles of Nature (New York:1801); excerpted in Ideas in America, ed. by G.N.

The best indicator of our government tomorrow is our schoolstoday. Are our youngsters being brought up to be free, independent, thinking menand women? Or are they being turned into helpless, mindless pawns, who will runinto the arms of the first dictator that sounds plausible?One does not have to be an Objectivist to be alarmed about the state of today’sschools. Virtually everybody is in a panic over them—shocked by continuouslyfalling SAT scores; by college entrants unable to write, spell, paragraph, orreason; by a generation of schoolteachers so bad that even teachers-unionpresident Albert Shanker says of them: “For the most part, you are gettingilliterate, incompetent people who cannot go into any other field.”1[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en40]Last November, a new academic achievement test was given to some six hundredsixth-grade students in eight industrialized countries. The American students,chosen to be representative of the nation, finished dead last in mathematics,miles behind the Japanese, and sixth out of eight in science. As to geography,twenty percent of the Americans at one school could not find the U.S. on a worldmap. The Chicago Tribune reported these findings under the headline: “Studyhands world dunce cap to U.S. pupils.”2[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en41]A year ago, the National Commission on Excellence in Education described theUnited States as “a nation at risk,” pointing to what it called “a rising tideof mediocrity [in our schools] that threatens our very future as a nation and asa people.”3 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en42] These are extreme wordsfor normally bland government commissioners, but the words are no exaggeration.To prepare for this evening’s discussion, I did some first-hand research. Ispent two weeks in February visiting schools in New York City, both public andprivate, from kindergarten through teachers college. I deliberately choseschools with good reputations—some of which are the shining models for the restof the country; and I let the principals guide me to their top teachers. Iwanted to see the system not when it was just scraping by, starved for money andfull of compromises, but at its best, when it was adequately funded, competentlystaffed, and proud of its activities. I got an eyeful.My experience at one school, a famous Progressive institution, will serve tointroduce my impression of the whole system. I had said that I was interested inobserving how children are taught concepts, and the school obligingly directedme to three classes. The first, for nine and ten-year-olds, was a groupdiscussion of thirteen steps in seal-hunting, from cutting the hole in the iceat the start to sharing the blubber with others at the end. The teacher gave noindication of the purpose of this topic, but he did indicate that the classwould later perform a play on seal-hunting and perhaps even computerize thesteps. The next class, for thirteen-year-olds, consisted of a mock Washingtonhearing on the question of whether there should be an import tax on Japanesecars; students played senators, Japanese lobbyists, Lee Iacocca, and so on, anddid it quite well; the teacher sat silently, observing. I never learned the nameof this course or of the seal-hunting one, but finally I was to observe ameeting described to me as a class in English. At last, I thought, an academicsubject. But no. The book being covered was Robert Kennedy’s Thirteen Days, amemoir of the Cuban missile crisis of 1962; a typical topic for discussion waswhether a surgical air strike against Cuba would have been better policy than ablockade.The school, undoubtedly, would defend these classes as exercises in ethnicity ordemocracy or relevance, but, whatever the defense, the fact is that all theseclasses were utterly concrete-bound. Seal-hunting was not used to illustrate therigors of northern life or the method of analyzing a skill into steps oranything at all. The issue of taxing Japanese cars was not related to a study offree trade vs. protectionism, or of the proper function of government, or of theprinciples of foreign policy, or of any principles. The same applies to theCuban discussion. In all cases, a narrow concrete was taught, enacted,discussed, argued over in and of itself, i.e., as a concrete, without connectionto any wider issue. This is the essence of the approach that, in various forms,is destroying all of our schools: the anti-conceptual approach.Let me elaborate for a moment on the crucial philosophic point involved here.Man’s knowledge begins on the perceptual level, with the use of the five senses.This much we share with the animals. But what makes us human is what our minddoes with our sense experiences. What makes us human is the conceptual level,which includes our capacity to abstract, to grasp common denominators, toclassify, to organize our perceptual field. The conceptual level is based on theperceptual, but there are profound differences between the two—in other words,between perceiving and thinking. Here are some of the differences; this is notan exhaustive list, merely enough to indicate the contrast.The perceptual level is concerned only with concretes. For example, a man goesfor a casual stroll on the beach—tet’s make it a drunken stroll so as to numbthe higher faculties and isolate the animal element—and he sees a number ofconcrete entities: those birds chattering over there, this wave crashing toshore, that boulder rolling downhill. He observes, moves on, sees a bit more,forgets the earlier. On the conceptual level, however, we function verydifferently; we integrate concretes by means of abstractions, and therebyimmensely expand the amount of material we can deal with. The animal or drunkmerely looks at a few birds, then forgets them; a functioning man can retain anunlimited number, by integrating them all into the concept “bird,” and can thenproceed deliberately to study the nature of birds, their anatomy, habits, and soforth.The drunk on his walk is aware of a vast multiplicity of things. He lurches pasta chaos made of waves, rocks, and countless other entities, and has no abilityto make connections among them. On the conceptual level, however, we do notaccept such chaos; we turn a multiplicity into a unity by finding the commondenominators that run through all the seemingly disconnected concretes; and wethereby make them intelligible. We discover the law of gravity, for example, andgrasp that by means of a single principle we can understand the falling boulder,the rising tide, and many other phenomena.On the perceptual level, no special order is necessary. The drunk can totterfrom bird to rock to tree in any order he wishes and still see them all. But wecannot do that conceptually; in the realm of thought, a definite progression isrequired. Since we build knowledge on previous knowledge, we need to know thenecessary background, or context, at each stage. For example, we cannot startcalculus before we know arithmetic—or argue about tariff protection before weknow the nature of government.Finally, for this brief sketch: on the perceptual level, there is no need oflogic, argument, proof; a man sees what he sees, the facts are self-evident, andno further cognitive process is required. But on the conceptual level, we doneed proof. We need a method of validating our ideas; we need a guide to let usknow what conclusions follow from what data. That guide is logic.Perception as such, the sheer animal capacity, consists merely in staring atconcretes, at a multiplicity of them, in no order, with no context, no proof, nounderstanding—and all one can know by this means is whatever he is staring at,as long as he is staring. Conception, however—the distinctively humanfaculty—involves the formation of abstractions that reduce the multiplicity toan intelligible unity. This process requires a definite order, a specificcontext at each stage, and the methodical use of logic.Now let us apply the above to the subject of our schools. An education thattrains a child’s mind would be one that teaches him to make connections, togeneralize, to understand the wider issues and principles involved in any topic.It would achieve this feat by presenting the material to him in a calculated,conceptually proper order, with the necessary context, and with the proof thatvalidates each stage. This would be an education that teaches a child to think.The complete opposite—the most perverse aberration imaginable—is to takeconceptual-level material and present it to the students by the method ofperception. This means taking the students through history, literature, science,and the other subjects on the exact model of that casual, unthinking, drunkenwalk on the beach. The effect is to exile the student to a no-man‘s-land ofcognition, which is neither perception nor conception. What it is, in fact, isdestruction, the destruction of the minds of the students and of theirmotivation to learn.This is literally what our schools are doing today. Let me illustrate byindicating how various subjects are taught, in the best schools, by the bestteachers. You can then judge for yourself why Johnny can’t think.I went to an eighth grade class on Western European history in a highlyregarded, non-Progressive school with a university affiliation. The subject thatday was: why does human history constantly change? This is an excellentquestion, which really belongs to the philosophy of history. What factors, theteacher was asking, move history and explain men’s past actions? Here are theanswers he listed on the board: competition among classes for land, money,power, or trade routes; disasters and catastrophes (such as wars and plagues);the personality of leaders; innovations, technology, new discoveries (potatoesand coffee were included here); and developments in the rest of the world, whichinteracts with a given region. At this point, time ran out. But think of whatelse could qualify as causes in this kind of approach. What about an era’s pressor media of communication? Is that a factor in history? What about people’spsychology, including their sexual proclivities? What about their art or theirgeography? What about the weather?Do you see the hodgepodge the students are being given? History, they are told,is moved by power struggles and diseases and potatoes and wars and chancepersonalities. Who can make sense out of such a chaos? Here is a randommultiplicity thrown at a youngster without any attempt to conceptualize it—toreduce it to an intelligible unity, to trace the operation of principles. Thisis perceptual-level history, history as nothing but a torrent of unrelated,disintegrated concretes.The American Revolution, to take a specific example, was once taught in theschools on the conceptual level. The Revolution’s manifold aspects wereidentified, then united and explained by a principle: the commitment of thecolonists to individual rights and their consequent resolve to throw off thetyrant’s yoke. This was a lesson students could understand and find relevant intoday’s world. But now the same event is ascribed to a whole list of allegedcauses. The students are given ten (or fifty) causes of the Revolution,including the big land-owners’ desire to preserve their estates, the Southernplanters’ desire for a cancellation of their English debts, the Bostonians’opposition to tea taxes, the Western land speculators’ need to expand past theAppalachians, etc. No one can retain such a list longer than is required to passthe exam; it must be memorized, then regurgitated, then happily and thoroughlyforgotten. That is all one can do with unrelated concretes.If the students were taught by avowed Marxists—if they were told that historyreflects the clash between the factors of production and the modes ofownership—it would be dead wrong, but it would still be a principle, anintegrating generalization, and it would be much less harmful to the students’ability to think; they might still be open to argument on the subject. But toteach them an unconceptualized hash is to imply that history is a tale told byan idiot, without wider meaning, or relevance to the present. This approachdestroys the possibility of the students thinking or caring at all about thefield.I cannot resist adding that the State Education Department of New York has founda way, believe it or not, to make the teaching of history still worse. You mightthink that, in history at least, the necessary order of presenting the materialis self-evident. Since each era grows out of the preceding, the obvious way toteach events is as they happened, i.e., chronologically. But not according to anew proposal. In order “to put greater emphasis on sociological, political, andeconomic issues,” a New York State proposal recommends that historical materialbe organized for the students according to six master topics picked out of theblue from the pop ethos: “ecology, human needs, human rights, culturalinteraction, the global system of economic interdependence, and the future.” Inthis approach, an event from a later period can easily be taught (in connectionwith one master topic) first, long before the developments from an earlierperiod that actually led to it. As a more traditional professor from Columbiahas noted: “The whole thing would be wildly out of chronological order. The[Russian] purge trials of the 1930s would be taught before the revolutions of1905 and 1917. It is all fragmented and there is no way that this curriculumrelates one part of a historical period to another, which is what you want kidsto be able to do.”4 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en43] But the moderneducators don’t seem to care about that. They want “fragments,” i.e., concretes,without context, logic, or any other demands of a conceptual progression.I do not know what became of this New York proposal. The fact that it wasannounced to the press and discussed seriously is revealing enough.Given the way history is now being taught, it is not surprising that huge chunksof it promptly get forgotten by the students or simply are never taken in. Theresult is many adolescents’ shocking ignorance of the most elementaryhistorical, or current, facts. One man wrote a column recently in The WashingtonPost recounting his conversations with today’s teenagers. He found high-schoolgraduates who did not know anything about World War II, including what happenedat Pearl Harbor, or what country the United States was fighting in the Pacific.“Who won?” one college student asked him. At one point, the writer and a girlwho was a junior at the University of Southern California were watchingtelevision coverage of Poland after martial law had been imposed; the set showedpolitical prisoners being put into a cage. The girl could not understand it.“ ‘Why don’t they just leave and come to LA.?’ ” she asked.“I explained that they were not allowed to leave.”“ ‘They’re not?’ ” she said. “ ‘Why not?’ ”“I explained that in totalitarian states citizens usually could not emigrate.”“ ‘They can’t?’ ” she said. “ ‘Since when? Is that something new?’ ”5[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en44]Now let us make a big jump—from history to reading. Let us look at the method ofteaching reading that is used by most American schools in some form: theLook-Say method (as against Phonics).The method of Phonics, the old-fashioned approach, first teaches a child thesound of individual letters; then it teaches him to read words by combiningthese sounds. Each letter thus represents an abstraction subsuming countlessinstances. Once a child knows that p sounds “puh,” for instance, that becomes aprinciple; he grasps that every p he meets sounds the same way. When he haslearned a few dozen such abstractions, he has acquired the knowledge necessaryto decipher virtually any new word he encounters. Thus the gigantic multiplicityof the English vocabulary is reduced to a handful of symbols. This is theconceptual method of learning to read.Modern educators object to it. Phonics, they say (among many such charges), isunreal. I quote from one such mentality: “There is little value in pronouncingthe letter p in isolation; it is almost impossible to do this—a vowel of somesort almost inevitably follows the pronunciation of any consonant.”6[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en45] This means: when you pronounce thesound of p—“puh”—you have to utter the vowel sound “uh”; so you haven’t isolatedthe pure consonant; so Phonics is artificial. But why can’t you isolate in yourmind, focusing only on the consonant sound, ignoring the accompanying vowel forpurposes of analysis—just as men focus on a red table’s color but ignore itsshape in order to reach the concept “red”? Why does this writer rule outselective attention and analysis, which are the very essence of human cognition?Because these involve an act of abstraction; they represent a conceptualprocess, precisely the process that modern educators oppose.Their favored method, Look-Say, dispenses with abstractions. Look-Say forces achild to learn the sounds of whole words without knowing the sounds of theindividual letters or syllables. This makes every word a new concrete to begrasped only by perceptual means, such as trying to remember its distinctiveshape on the page, or some special picture the teacher has associated with it.Which amounts to heaping on the student a vast multiplicity of concretes andsaying: stare at these and memorize them. (You may not be surprised to discoverthat this method was invented, as far as I can tell, by an eighteenth-centuryGerman professor who was a follower of Rousseau, the passionate opponent ofreason.)There is a colossal Big Lie involved in the Look-Say propaganda. Its advocatescrusade against the overuse of memory; they decry Phonics because, they say, itrequires a boring memorization of all the sounds of the alphabet. Their solutionis to replace such brief, simple memorization with the task of memorizing thesound of every word in the language. In fact, if one wishes to save childrenfrom the drudgery of endless memorization, only the teaching of abstractionswill do it—in any field.No one can learn to read by the Look-Say method. It is too anti-human. Ourschools today, therefore, are busy teaching a new skill: guessing. They offerthe children some memorized shapes and pictures to start, throw in a littlePhonics (thanks to immense parental pressure), count on the parents secretlyteaching their children something at home about reading—and then, given thisstew of haphazard clues, they concentrate their efforts on teaching the childrenassorted methods of guessing what a given word might be.Here is a Look-Say expert describing a child’s proper mental processes whentrying to determine the last word of the sentence, “They make belts out ofplastic.” The child must not, of course, try to sound out the letters. Here iswhat should go on in his brain instead:“Well, it isn’t leather, because that begins with l. My mother has a straw belt,but it isn’t straw either. It looks like a root. I’ll divide it between s and t.There couldn’t be more than two syllables because there are only two vowels.Let’s see—p, l, a, s. One vowel and it’s not at the end of the syllable ...”This goes on a while longer, and the child finally comes up with: “Oh, sure,plastic! I’m surprised I didn’t think of that right away because so many thingsare made of plastic.” The expert comments: “Just described is a child who wasnot about to carry out a letter-by-letter analysis of plastic if it wasn’tnecessary, which is exactly right.”7 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en46]Can you imagine reading War and Peace by this method? You would die of old agebefore you reached the third chapter.I must add that the Look-Say educators demand that children—I quote anotherdevotee—“receive praise for a good guess even though it is not completelyaccurate. For example, if a child reads ‘I like to eat carrots’ as ’I like toeat cake,‘ praise should be given for supplying a word that makes sense andfollows at least some of the phonic cues.”8[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en47]How would you like to see, at the head of our army, a general with this kind ofschooling? He receives a telegram from the president during a crisis orderinghim to “reject nuclear option,” proceeds to make a good guess, and reads it as“release nuclear option.” Linguistically, the two are as close as “carrots” and“cake.”The result of the Look-Say method is a widespread “reading neurosis” amongchildren, a flat inability to read, which never existed in the days of Phonics(and also a bizarre inability to spell). In 1975, for example, 35 percent offourth-graders, 37 percent of eighth-graders, and 23 percent of twelfth-graderscould not read simple printed instructions. The U.S. literacy rate, it has beenestimated, is now about equal to that of Burma or Albania, and by all signs isstill dropping. Do you see why angry parents are suing school systems for a newcrime: educational malpractice?Now let us look at another aspect of English studies: the teaching of grammar.This subject brings out even more clearly the modern educators’ contempt forconcepts.Grammar is the study of how to combine words—i.e., concepts—into sentences. Thebasic rules of grammar—such as the need of subject and predicate, or therelation of nouns and verbs—are inherent in the nature of concepts and apply toevery language; they define the principles necessary to use conceptsintelligibly. Grammar, therefore, is an indispensable subject; it is a sciencebased entirely on facts—and not a very difficult science, either.Our leading educators, however, see no relation between concepts and facts. Thereason they present material from subjects such as history withoutconceptualizing it, is precisely that they regard concepts as mental constructswithout relation to reality. Concepts, they hold, are not a device of cognition,but a mere human convention, a ritual unrelated to knowledge or reality, to beperformed according to arbitrary social fiat. It follows that grammar is a setof pointless rules, decreed by society for no objectively defensible reason.I quote from a book on linguistics written for English teachers by a modernprofessor: “Because we know that language is arbitrary and changing, a teacher’sattitude toward nonstandard usage should be one of acceptance.... One level oflanguage is not ‘better’ than another; this is why the term nonstaradard ispreferable to substandard in describing such usage as ’He don’t do it,‘ ’Was youthere?‘ A person who uses terms such as these will probably be penalized interms of social and educational advancement in our society, however, and it isfor this reason that the teacher helps children work toward, and eventuallyachieve, standard usage, perhaps as a ’second’ language.”9[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en48] In short, there is no “correct” or“incorrect” any more, not in any aspect of language; there is only the senselessprejudice of society.I saw the results of this approach in the classroom. I watched an excellentpublic-school teacher trying to explain the possessive forms of nouns. She gavea clear statement of the rules, with striking examples and frequent repetition;she was dynamic, she was colorful, she was teaching her heart out. But it wasfutile. This teacher was not a philosopher of language, and she could not combatthe idea, implicit in the textbook and in all the years of the students’ earlierschooling, that grammar is purposeless. The students seemed to be impervious toinstruction and incapable of attention, even when the teacher would blow ashrieking police whistle to shock them momentarily into silence. To them, thesubject was nothing but senseless rules: the apostrophe goes here in this case,there in that one. Here was a whole science reduced to disintegrated concretesthat had to be blindly memorized—just like the ten causes of the AmericanRevolution, or the ten shapes of the last Look-Say session.You might wonder how one teaches composition—the methods of expressing one’sthoughts clearly and eloquently in writing—given today’s philosophy of grammarand of concepts. I will answer by reading excerpts from a recent manifesto.“We affirm the students’ right to their own patterns and varieties oflanguage—the dialects of their nurture or whatever dialects in which they findtheir own identity and style.... The claim that any one dialect is unacceptableamounts to an attempt of one social group to exert its dominance over another.”If so, why does anyone need English teachers?Who issued this manifesto? Was it some ignorant, hotheaded teenagers drunk onthe notion of student power? No. It was the National Council of Teachers ofEnglish.10 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en49]If you want a hint as to the basic philosophy operative here, I will mentionthat the editor of College English, one of the major journals of the profession,objects to “an industrial society [that] will continue to want from us—orsomeone else—composition, verbal manners, discipline in problem solving, anddocile rationality.”11 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en50] Note howexplicit this is. The climax of his “enemies list” is “rationality.”Despite today’s subjectivism, some rules of composition are still being taught.Certain of these are valid enough, having been carried over from a better past.But some are horrifying. Here is an exercise in how to write topic sentences.The students are given two possible sentences with which to start a paragraph,then are asked to choose which would make a good opening and which a bad one.Here is one such pair:1. Cooking is my favorite hobby.2. It really isn’t hard to stir-fry Chinese vegetables.The correct answer? Number 1 is bad. It is too abstract. (!) Students should notwrite about so enormous a subject as an entire hobby. They should focus only onone concrete under it, such as Chinese vegetables.Here is another pair:1. There is too much pollution in the world.2. We have begun to fight pollution in our own neighborhood.Of course, Number 1 is inadmissible. Students must not think about worldproblems—that is too vague—only about the dinky concretes in their ownbackyard.12 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en51]This sort of exercise has been consciously designed to teach students to beconcrete-bound. How are children with such an upbringing ever to deal with orthink about problems that transcend Chinese vegetables and their ownneighborhood? The implicit answer, absorbed by the students unavoidably, is:“You don’t have to worry about things like that; society or the president willtake care of you; all you have to do is adapt.”Before we leave English, I want to mention what has been happening to theteaching of literature in our schools as a consequence of the attitude towardconcepts that we have been discussing. First, there has been the disappearancefrom the schools of the classics in favor of cheap current novels. The languageand themes of the classics are too difficult for today’s students to grasp; onedoes not teach Shakespeare to savages, or to civilized children being turnedinto savages. Then, there is the continuous decline even of today’s debasedstandards. I quote from two English teachers: “Years ago we used to hear thatJulius Caesar was too difficult for ninth-graders; now we are told that Lord ofthe Flies is too hard for the general run of tenth-graders.” Then, there is thefinal result, now increasingly common: the disappearance of literature of anykind and its replacement by what are called “media classes.” These are classes,in one book’s apt description, that “teach television, newspapers, car-repairmagazines, and movies.”13 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en52]I will pass up all the obvious comments on this frightening descent. I have justone question about it: why should these graduates of TV and car-repair magazinescare if the great books of the past are burned by government edict—when theycan’t read them anyway?Turning to the teaching of science in our schools, I want to mention aninstructive book written by two professors at Purdue University; titled CreativeSciencing, it tells science teachers how to teach their subject properly. Tolearn science, the book declares, students must engage in “hands-on scienceactivities.” They must perform a series of concrete “experiments,” such asdesigning a bug catcher, collecting pictures of objects that begin with a c,going on field trips to the local factory, or finding polluters in thecommunity. (These examples are taken from the book.) There is no necessary orderto these activities. The children are encouraged to interact with the classroommaterials “in their own way,” as the mood strikes them. They are not to beinhibited by a teacher-imposed structure or by the logic of the subject.14[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en53]You may wonder whether students taught in this manner will ever learn theabstract concepts and principles of science, the natural laws and explanatorytheories that have been painstakingly discovered across the centuries—theknowledge that makes us civilized men rather than jungle primitives.The answer has been given by F. James Rutherford, chief education officer of theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science. “We’re too serious,” hedeclared. “We insist on all the abstract stuff. We need to relax and let thechildren learn their own neighborhood.” This statement was made at a meeting ofexperts brought together by a large foundation to discover what ails scienceteaching.15 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en54]Today’s education, I have said, reduces children to the status of animals,without the ability to know or predict the future. Animals, however, can rely onbrute instinct to guide them. Children cannot; brought up this way, they soonbegin to feel helpless—to feel that everything is changing and that they cancount on nothing.The above is not merely my polemic. The science teachers are workingdeliberately to create this state of mind. The teachers are openly skepticalthemselves, having been given a similar upbringing, and they insist to theirstudents that everything is changing, that factual information is continuouslybecoming outdated, and that there are things much more important in class—inscience class—than truth. It is hard to believe how brazen these people havebecome. “When preparing performance objectives,” the Creative Sciencing booksays, “you may wish to consider the fact that we don’t demand accuracy in art orcreative writing, but we have permitted ourselves to require accuracy inscience. We may be paying a high price in lost interest, enthusiasm, vitality,and creativity in science because of this requirement of accuracy.”16[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en55]Our students should not have to be concerned about factual accuracy. They needhave no idea whether gases expand or contract under pressure, or whether typhusgerms cause or cure disease—but this will leave them free to be “vital” and“creative.”But, you may ask, what if a student comes out in class with a wrong answer to afactual question? You are old-fashioned. There is no such answer, and besides itwould be bad for the student’s psychology if there were: “How many times will astudent try to respond to a question if continually told that his or her answersare wrong? Wrong answers should be reserved for quiz shows on television.”17[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en56]What then is the point in having a teacher at all?—since there are no wronganswers, and since adults must not be “authoritarian,” and since, as John Deweyhas proclaimed, students do not learn by listening or by reading, but only by“doing.” This brings me to an extremely important issue, one that is much widerthan science teaching.My overriding impression of today’s schools, derived from every class I visited,is that teachers no longer teach. They no longer deliver prepared material whilethe students listen attentively and take notes. Instead, what one encounterseverywhere is group-talking, i.e., class participation and class discussion.Most of the teachers I saw were enthusiastic professionals, excellent at whatthey do. But they conceive their role primarily as bull-session moderators. Someof the teachers obviously had a concealed lesson in mind, which they werebootlegging to the students—in the guise of asking leading questions or makingbrief, purposeful side comments. But the point is that the lesson had to bebootlegged. The official purpose of the class was for the pupils to speak moreor less continuously—at any rate, well over half the time.I asked one group of high-school students if their teachers ever deliveredlectures in class. “Oh no!” they cried incredulously, as though I had come fromanother planet or a barbaric past. “No one does that anymore.”All the arguments offered to defend this anti-teaching approach are senseless.“Students,” I have heard it said, “should develop initiative; they shoulddiscover knowledge on their own, not be spoon-fed by the teachers.” Then whyshould they go to school at all? Schooling is a process in which an expert ispaid to impart his superior knowledge to ignorant beginners. How can thisinvolve shelving the expert and leaving the ignorant to shift for themselves?What would you think of a doctor who told a patient to cure himself because thedoctor opposed spoon-feeding?“Students,” I have heard, “should be creative, not merely passive andreceptive.” How can they be creative before they know anything? Creativity doesnot arise in a void; it can develop only after one has mastered the currentcognitive context. A creative ignoramus is a contradiction in terms.“We teach the method of thought,” I have heard, “rather than the content.” Thisis the most senseless claim of all. Let us leave aside the obvious fact thatmethod cannot exist apart from some content. The more important point here isthat thought is precisely what cannot be taught by the discussion approach. Ifyou want to teach thought, you must first put up a sign at the front of theclass: “Children should be seen and not heard.” To be exact: they may be heardas an adjunct of the lesson, if the teacher wishes to probe their knowledge, oranswer a question of clarification, or assess their motivation to learn, orentertain a brief comment. But the dominant presence and voice must be that ofthe teacher, the cognitive expert, who should be feeding the material to theclass in a highly purposeful fashion, carefully balancing concretes andabstractions, preparing for and then drawing and then interrelatinggeneralizations, identifying the evidence at each point, etc. These are theprocesses that must first be absorbed year after year by the student in relationto a whole series of different contents. In the end, such training will jell inhis mind into a knowledge of how to think—which he can then apply on his own,without any teacher. But he can never even begin to grasp these processes in thechaotic hullabaloo of a perpetual class discussion with equally ignorant peers.Have you seen the [1984] television debates among the Democrats seeking to bepresident? Do you regard these spectacles of arbitrary assertion, constantsubject-switching, absurd concrete boundedness, and brazen ad homenem asexamples of thinking? This is exactly the pattern that is being inculcated asthinking today by the class-discussion method.An educator with any inkling of the requirements of a conceptual consciousnesswould never dream of running a school this way. But an educator contemptuous ofconcepts, and therefore of knowledge, would see no objection to it.In the class discussions I saw, the students were regularly asked to state theirown opinion. They were asked it in regard to issues about which they had no ideahow to have an opinion, since they had no knowledge of the relevant facts orprinciples, and no knowledge of the methods of logical argument. Most of thetime the students were honest; they had no opinion, in the sense of a sincere,even if mistaken, conviction on the question at hand. But they knew that theywere expected to “express themselves.” Time and again, therefore, I heard thefollowing: “I like (or dislike) X.” “Why?” “Because I do. That’s my opinion.”Whereupon the teacher would nod and say “very interesting” or “good point.”Everybody’s point, it seemed, was good, as good as everybody else‘s, and reasonswere simply irrelevant. The conclusion being fostered in the minds of the classwas: “It’s all arbitrary; anything goes and no one really knows.” The result isnot only the spread of subjectivism, but of a self-righteous subjectivism, whichcannot even imagine what objectivity would consist of.Project a dozen years of this kind of daily processing. One study of Americanstudents notes that they “generally offered superficial comments ... andconsultants observed that they seemed ‘genuinely puzzled at requests to explainor defend their points of view.’ ”18 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en57]What else could anyone expect?Now let me quote from a New York Times news story.“I like [Senator Gary Hart‘s] ideas,” said Darla Doyle, a Tampa homemaker. “He’sa good man. His ideas are fresher than Mondale’s are. I like the way he comesacross.”A reporter asked Mrs. Doyle to identify the ideas that appealed to her. “That’san unfair question,” she said, asking for a moment to consider her answer. Thenshe replied, “He wants to talk with Russia.”The headline of this story is: “Hart’s Fans Can’t Say Why They Are.”19[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en58]According to John Dewey, students are bored by lectures, but motivated to learnby collective “doing.” Not the ones I saw. Virtually every class was incontinuous turmoil, created by students waving their hands to speak, droppingbooks, giggling, calling out remarks, whispering asides, yawning, fidgeting,shifting, shuffling. The dominant emotion was a painful boredom, which is thesign of minds being mercilessly starved and stunted. Perhaps this explains themagic influence of the bell. The instant it rang, everywhere I went, the roomwas empty, as though helpless victims were running for their lives from a dreadplague. And so in a sense they were.Ladies and gentlemen, our schools are failing in every subject and on afundamental level. They are failing methodically, as a matter of philosophicprinciple. The anti-conceptual epistemology that grips them comes from JohnDewey and from all his fellow irrationalists, who dominate twentieth-centuryAmerican culture, such as linguistic analysts, psychoanalysts, andneo-Existentialists. And behind all these, as I argued in The Ominous Parallels,stands a century of German philosophy inaugurated by history’s greatest villain:Immanuel Kant, the first man to dedicate his life and his system to thedestruction of reason.Epistemological corruption is not the only cause of today’s educational fiasco.There are many other contributing factors, such as the teachers unions, and thesenseless requirements of the teachers colleges, and the governmentbureaucracies (local and federal). But epistemology is the basic cause, withoutreference to which none of the others can be intelligently analyzed or remedied.Now let me recount for you two last experiences, which bear on the politicalimplications of today’s educational trend.One occurred at the most prestigious teacher-training institution in thecountry, Teachers College of Columbia University.In my first class there, chosen at random, the professor made the followingpronouncement to a group of sixty future teachers: “The evil of the West is notprimarily its economic exploitation of the Third World, but its ideologicalexploitation. The crime of the West was to impose upon the communal culture ofAfrica the concept of the individual.” I thought I had heard everything, butthis shocked me. I looked around. The future teachers were dutifully taking itdown; there were no objections.Despite their talk about “self-expression,” today’s educators have to inculcatecollectivism. Man’s organ of individuality is his mind; deprived of it, he isnothing, and can do nothing but huddle in a group as his only hope of survival.The second experience occurred in a class of juniors and seniors at a highschool for the academically gifted. The students had just returned from a visitto the United Nations, where they had met with an official of the Russiandelegation, and they were eager to discuss their reactions. The class obviouslydisliked the Russian, feeling that his answers to their questions about life inRussia had been evasions or lies. But soon someone remarked that we Americansare accustomed to believing what our government says, while the Russiansnaturally believe theirs. “So how do I know?” he concluded. “Maybe everything isa lie.”“What is truth?” asked one boy, seemingly quite sincere; the class laughed, asthough this were obviously unanswerable.“Neither side is good,” said another student. “Both countries lie all the time.But the issue is the percentage. What we need to know is how much they lie—is it99 percent for one, for example, and 82 percent for the other?”After a lot more of this, including some pretty weak arguments in favor ofAmerica by a small patriotic faction, one boy summed up the emerging consensus.“We can never know who is lying or telling the truth,” he said. “The only thingwe can know is bare fact. For example, we can know that a Korean airliner wasshot down by the Russians [in 1983]. But as to the Russians’ story of the causevs. our story, that is mere opinion.”To which one girl replied in all seriousness: “But we can’t even know that—noneof us saw the plane shot down.”This class discussion was the climax of my tour. I felt as though I werewitnessing the condensed essence of a perceptual-level schooling. “Thought,”these students were saying, “is helpless, principles are nonexistent, truth isunknowable, and there is, therefore, no way to choose between the United Statesof America and the bloodiest dictatorship in history, not unless we have seenthe blood with our own eyes.”These youngsters represent the future of our country. They are the children ofthe best and the brightest, who will become the businessmen, the artists, andthe political leaders of tomorrow. Does this kind of generation have thestrength—the intellectual strength, the strength of conviction—necessary touphold the American heritage in an era dominated by incipient Big Brothers athome and missile-rattling enemies abroad?It is not the students’ fault, and they do not fully believe the awful thingsthey say, not yet. The ones I saw, at every school except for Columbia—and hereI want to register some positive impressions—were extremely likable. For themost part, they struck me as clean-cut, well-mannered, exuberant, intelligent,innocent. They were not like the typical college student one meets, who isalready hardening into a brash cynic or skeptic. These youngsters, despite alltheir doubts and scars, still seemed eager to discover some answers, albeitsporadically. They were still clinging to vestiges of the idea that man’s mindcan understand reality and make sense of the world.They are still open to reason—if someone would teach it to them.Nor is it basically the teachers’ fault. The ones I saw were not like thecollege professors I know, who reek of stale malice and delight in wreckingtheir students’ minds. The teachers seemed to take their jobs seriously; theygenuinely liked their classes and wanted to educate them. But given thedirection of their own training, they were unable to do it.There is a whole generation of children who still want to learn, and aprofession much of which wants to help them, to say nothing of a country thatdevoutly wishes both groups well. Everything anyone would need to save the worldis there, it is waiting, and all that is required to activate it is ... what?Merit pay? First we need a definition of merit, i.e., of the purpose ofteaching. More classes in the use of computers? We have enough children who knowFORTRAN but not English. Compulsory community service? (A recommendation of theCar negie Commission.) Prayer in the schools? (President Reagan’s idea of asolution.)All these are the equivalent of sticking Band-Aids on (or in the last two casesknives into) a dying man. The only real solution, which is a precondition of anyother reform, is a philosophic change in our culture. We need a philosophy thatwill teach our colleges—and thereby our schoolteachers, and thus finally ouryoungsters—an abiding respect, a respect for reason, for man’s mind, for theconceptual level of consciousness. That is why I subscribe to the philosophy ofAyn Rand. Hers is the only such philosophy in America today. It could be thewonder cure that would revive a generation.The National Committee on Excellence in Education declared, “If an unfriendlyforeign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educationalperformance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war.”20[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en59] Intellectually speaking, however, weare under the yoke of a foreign power. We are under the yoke of Kant, Hegel,Marx, and all their disciples. What we need now is another Declaration ofIndependence—not political independence from England this time, butphilosophical independence from Germany.To achieve it would be a monumental job, which would take many decades. As partof the job, I want to recommend one specific step to improve our schools: closedown the teachers colleges.There is no rational purpose to these institutions (and so they do little butdisseminate poisonous ideas). Teaching is not a skill acquired through years ofclasses; it is not improved by the study of “psychology” or “methodology” or anyof the rest of the stuff the schools of education offer. Teaching requires onlythe obvious: motivation, common sense, experience, a few good books or courseson technique, and, above all, a knowledge of the material being taught. Teachersmust be masters of their subject; this—not a degree in education—is what schoolboards should demand as a condition of employment.This one change would dramatically improve the schools. If experts in subjectmatter were setting the terms in the classroom, some significant content wouldhave to reach the students, even given today’s dominant philosophy. In addition,the basket cases who know only the Newspeak of their education professors wouldbe out of a job, which would be another big improvement.This reform, of course, would be resisted to the end by today’s educationalestablishment, and could hardly be achieved nationally without a philosophicchange in the country. But it gives us a starting point to rally around thatpertains specifically to the field of education. If you are a parent or ateacher or merely a concerned taxpayer, you can start the battle for quality ineducation by demanding loudly—even in today’s corrupt climate—that the teachersyour school employs know what they are talking about, and then talk about it.“If a nation expects to be ignorant and free . . .” wrote Thomas Jefferson, “itexpects what never was and never will be.”21[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#en60]Let us fight to make our schools once again bastions of knowledge. Then nodictator can rise among us by counting, like Big Brother in 1984, on theenshrinement of ignorance.And then we may once again have a human future ahead of us.NOTES1 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en40] Quoted in USA Today, Aug. 12,1983.2 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en41] Dec. 12, 1983.3 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en42] Quoted in The New York Times,Apr. 27, 1983.4 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en43] The New York Times, Apr. 18,1983; the professor is Hazel Hertzberg.5 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c20_r1.html#Ref-en44] Benjamin J.

To represent him, in this context, means to represent his views interms of political principles. Thus the government of a free country derives its“just powers from the consent of the governed.” (For the basis of thisdiscussion, see “Man’s Rights” and “The Nature of Government” in Capitalism: theUnknown Ideal.)As a corroboration of the link between man’s rational faculty and arepresentative form of government, observe that those who are demonstrably (orphysiologically) incapable of rational judgment cannot exercise the right tovote. (Voting is a derivative, not a fundamental, right; it is derived from theright to life, as a political implementation of the requirements of a rationalbeing’s survival.) Children do not vote because they have not acquired theknowledge necessary to form a rational judgment on political issues; neither dothe feeble-minded or the insane, who have lost or never developed their rationalfaculty. (The possession of a rational faculty does not guarantee that a manwill use it, only that he is able to use it and is, therefore, responsible forhis actions.)The mentally unprepared or incapacitated are unable personally to exercise theirrights—e.g., the right to acquire property or to assume contractualobligations—and the protection of their rights is delegated to their parents orto legally appointed guardians, who act in their name. The right to vote,however, is non-transferable. The father of twelve minors does not acquire theright to cast twelve votes in addition to his own; neither does the keeper of aninsane asylum.Philosophically, the theory of representative government is in profound conflictwith the dominant schools of modern philosophy, which deny the efficacy orexistence of reason and of volition. Dictatorship and determinism arereciprocally reinforcing corollaries: if one seeks to enslave men, one has todestroy their reliance on the validity of their own judgments and choices—if onebelieves that reason and volition are impotent, one has to accept the rule offorce.Ever since Kant, the dominant method of modern philosophers has been to fightissues not by open intellectual presentation, but by corruption—the corruptioninto its opposite of any concept which they dared not oppose explicitly. Just asKant corrupted the concept “reason” to mean a mystic faculty pertaining toanother dimension, so his theoretical and practical descendants have beenemploying his technique on an ever growing scale and shrinking subjects. Thus“freedom,” in today’s jargon, means obedience to a totalitarian ruler—“security”is dependence on the whims of the government—“individuality” is conformity tothe life-style of a pack—a Putsch to seize dictatorial power is a “War ofLiberation”—the “Right to Life” is the right of the unborn to sacrifice theliving—and “love of this earth” consists in making it impossible for men to liveon it.It is fairly easy to corrupt the concept of representative government in acountry that has had no experience of it: people are offered the flatteringparaphernalia of ballot boxes, but only one party to vote for. It is moredifficult in a country whose history began with free elections. For half acentury (or longer), the collectivist intellectuals have been corrupting our twomajor political parties to make them merge into one by making themindistinguishable—while the commentators ignored the country’s discontent andpretended that no opposition existed. But this did not work: instead of merging,both parties are now breaking up into irreconcilable factions. In the meantime,the collectivists have come out with a new corruption of the concept ofpolitical representation, more grotesque than the rest of their notions.It is expressed in the demand that various statistical quotas be imposed on thiscountry, in order to “represent” various kinds of people.It has never been made clear what the term “represent” means in this context.Represent—where and by whom? At first, the demands were voiced in regard toprivate or semiprivate activities, but in fields vulnerable to politicalpressure—e.g., the demands for racial quotas in the student enrollment and onthe faculties of schools, or in the employment practices ofgovernment-controlled industries, such as television. Then the demands grewlouder and more directly political, seeking “representation” in Cabinet postsand even on the Supreme Court. The [1972] rules for the Democratic party’schoice of convention delegates implemented these demands and brought themstraight into the field of political elections.It is, therefore, time to examine the meaning of the quota doctrine.The notion of racial quotas is so obviously an expression of racism that nolengthy discussion is necessary. If a young man is barred from a school or a jobbecause the quota for his particular race has been filled, he is barred byreason of his race. Telling him that those admitted are his “representatives” isadding insult to injury. To demand such quotas in the name of fighting racialdiscrimination is an obscene mockery.But observe that the demands for “representation” by quotas are not confined tominorities and are not made exclusively on the grounds of race. The same demandsare presented on behalf of a majority: women—on the grounds of age: theyoung—and on the grounds of economics: the poor.Now observe the common denominator of these groups. The basis of their groupingand of the quotas they advocate is not intellectual, but physiological. (In thecase of poverty, it is physical: an absence of material means.)This is the sort of doctrine with which today’s intellectuals, particularly theacademic crowd, would feel profoundly at home—most of them emotionally andsubconsciously, and a few of them with full, conscious awareness of all theimplications.This doctrine—a product of determinism—assumes that physiology is thedetermining factor in human life and that the interests of all the members of agiven physiological group are identical. Yet it is obvious that an intelligent,efficient career woman has more interests in common with men than with a sloppyhousewife who joins Women’s Lib and refuses to cook her husband’s dinner. Asuccessful, self-made black businessman has more interests in common with whitebusinessmen than with a black mugger. A rational young student seeking knowledgehas more interests in common with old professors than with drugged young “Jesusfreaks.”The quota doctrine assumes that all members of a given physiological group areidentical and interchangeable—not merely in the eyes of other people, but intheir own eyes and minds. Assuming a total merging of the self with the group,the doctrine holds that it makes no difference to a man whether he or his“representative” is admitted to a school, gets a job, or makes a decision. Thisparticular notion is widely believed by the student activists, who clamor forparticipation in running universities and other institutions, declaring: “Wewant to have a say about the things that affect our lives”—the “say” consistingin casting one vote out of thousands for some little campus politician, whilesurrendering the only “say” they have the right to demand: the say about theirown lives.It is obvious why the quota doctrine appeals to modern intellectuals: iteliminates the responsibility of thought, judgment, and choice. Just follow yourgroup leaders, it advises, they are physiologically predestined to protect youand take care of you. To most of them, this promises the comfort of lethargy,and to a few—a road to power.If and to the extent that the quota doctrine is taken seriously, it can lead tothe abolition of actual political elections, which would be replaced by a systemguaranteeing that every sort of group—except one—will be “represented” in thegovernment. There are already suggestions for labor “representation,” andspecial demands by groups laying the groundwork for welfare recipients’“representation,” for “gay representation,” for the “representation” of thefetus, etc. The one kind of group to be excepted and excluded is a group broughttogether by ideas. There is to be no ideological representation—ordifferentiation.(A precedent for this sort of electoral policy is offered by Soviet Russia.Ethnic, or physiological, diversity is welcomed and fostered in Russia [unlesssome group displeases the authorities]. The Soviet Union is broken up into anumber of racially different states, each with its own language, folk songs,commemorative postage stamps, and U.N. representation. This flatters theenslaved and is of no danger to the rulers. But ideological diversity is not tobe mentioned or dreamed about, under penalty of death.)As one more example of the connection between reason and freedom, observe thatthe quota doctrine relegates people to the status of children or of the mentallyincompetent, with appointed guardians in place of genuine representatives. Noindividual choice, no personal authorization to represent him, is required onthe part of the citizen—physiology provides the authorization.The advantages to the leaders of the pressure-group racket are obvious. As tothe followers, they would have to reach that hopeless, brutalized state in whichpeople accept as flattery the assertion that the pharaoh’s pyramids or thepalaces of Versailles, of Berchtesgaden, of the Kremlin are erected to“represent” their, the people‘s, glory.I do not believe that the collectivists can get away with it in America. But anysuggestion of the quota doctrine is too much for this country—and, today, we arehearing and seeing more than a suggestion. The introduction of that doctrineinto the Democratic party’s rules of delegate selection is not merely a futureand potential, but a present and actual, violation of a citizen’s individualrights.The violation lies in the statistical method of apportioning the quotas. Theyare apportioned not on the basis of a given organization’s membership, but onthe basis of the number of persons of a certain physiological type who live in agiven district or in the country at large. Thus fifty percent of a delegation“represents” women (all women), ten percent “represents” blacks (all blacks),etc. This means that an individual woman or an individual black—who has neverheard of these delegates, may not agree with their views, may not even be aDemocrat—is counted as one of the delegate’s constituents, without voting,consent, or authorization on her or his part.An individual’s right to choose his own representatives or agents is recognizedin the material realm, but, apparently, not in the ideological one. If somestranger sold you the Brooklyn Bridge or the Empire State Building, he would bearrested for fraud, because he had no authorization to act as agent for theowners of the bridge or the building. Yet the quota advocates regard you as aunit of meat and appoint themselves your “representatives” in so vast, complexand controversial a field as political elections.No organization has the right to speak for or to act in the name of anyone butits own members. No organization may be taken as an agent for an individualwithout his personal knowledge and consent.If “taxation without representation is slavery,” then representation withoutauthorization is slavery embellished with fraud."},{"pageContent":"22To Dream the Noncommercial Dreamby Ayn RandThis article was published in The Ayn Rand Letter, January 1, 1973.Have you ever wondered about the mentality of those who advocate governmentfinancing of intellectual and artistic pursuits, in the name of intellectualindependence and creative freedom?Their goal, they claim, is to liberate men’s mind from material concerns oreconomic pressures. The necessity to earn a living in a free marketplace, theyclaim, is demeaning and corrupting. In their language, the word “commercial” isa pejorative term, an antonym of “intellectual.” Only the security of governmentsupport, they claim, can release the full power of the intellect.The contradictions in this viewpoint are so obvious that it seems impossible foranyone to miss seeing them. Nothing is less secure than a position of dependenceon the arbitrary power of politicians dispensing favors. The fate of thinkers,scientists, and artists whose livelihood depends on the government—anygovernment in any age, at the courts of absolute monarchs or in moderndictatorships or in mixed economies—is too well-known to leave anyone in“idealistic” doubt. So are the fear, the intrigues, the rigid censorship, andthe abject bootlicking in which and with which the recipients of governmentalfavors have to live moment by precarious moment. How can today’s intellectualsfail to know it?Some of them are motivated by powerlust and long for political careers in theroles of manipulators or “powers behind the thrones.” But these, as a rule,advocate some form of government control over the intellectual professions, inthe hope of maneuvering themselves or their cliques into the posts ofprofessional “czars”; they do not plead for economic security and do not talktoo much about intellectual freedom. What is the motive of those who do? Whatprompts the rank and file of the intellectual professions, who are loudly,touchily, belligerently championing such things as the First Amendment, civilliberties, academic freedom, etc., and, simultaneously, are pleading with thegovernment for financial support? What can they hope for?A significant answer may be found in a very enlightening article which appearedin The New York Times (July 29, 1972): “Another Channel” by Lester Markel, theretired Sunday Editor of the Times.The article discusses the current troubles of public television: the chronic andgrowing financial plight of this noncommercial venture. The issue has arousedthe intellectuals’ angrily anxious concern ever since President Nixon vetoed abill appropriating 65 million dollars for public television, which Congress hadpassed.“The government has been engaged in an unholy crusade against publictelevision,” the article declares. “[The Administration‘s] attacks arousedneither the general public nor the Congress because of the feeling that publictelevision is a dispensable institution. It isn’t, but it has not shown that itisn’t.”What makes public television indispensable? Mr. Markel does not say; he merelyindicates that its purpose is “to fill the large gaps left by commercialtelevision.” What gaps? “It can reach an audience commercial televisionconsiders economically unfeasi ble.” What audience? Mr. Markel states only thatit is (either actually or potentially) an “audience of ten or fifteen millionlisteners” and that they are very “intent.” What does this audience want? “Inthe cultural and entertainment areas [public television] can do much imaginativeand experimental work.”But it is “the area of public affairs” that Mr. Markel regards as mostimportant. “Genuine democracy depends ultimately on an informed opinion;American opinion is insufficiently or wrongly informed; this means that thosewhose duty it is to enlighten the citizenry are not doing their jobs.” In thenews area, commercial television “shirks the assignment because the undertakingis unprofitable; entertainment pays off, information doesn’t. And publictelevision has failed to fill the gap; it has not provided public affairsprogramming of consequence and immediacy.”If “information doesn’t pay off,” it means that the public doesn’t want tolisten to it. If so, then what will be accomplished by broadcasts which peopledo not hear? Will “genuine democracy” be served by the “informed opinion” of tenor fifteen million people, i.e., less than ten percent of a population of twohundred ten million whose taxes have to pay for it? No answer is given, exceptfor the statement (at the end of- the article) that “the size of informedminority can be significantly increased—and that would be a long forward stridein the democratic process.”“In general, the shortcoming of public television can be attributed to lack ofindependence, of money, of inspiration and of perspective. The first two lackscan be remedied only if the government, executive and Congress, are pressuredinto action by public demand.” What public? The ten or fifteen million? Do theyrepresent or are they the public? No answer is given, but, in the context oftoday’s pressure-group demands, the answer is obvious.“That demand will not come unless public television supplies the two otheringredients—imagination and balance.” And then, astonishingly, Mr. Markelproceeds to list the present flaws of public television, more correctly andsuccinctly than its enemies have done.For the most part, public television caters to the elite and preaches to theconverted. In the effort to be different, programs have often been onlyeccentric or ineffectively experimental; they have been marked by an amateurrather than a professional touch.... Moreover and most seriously, the attacks onthe score of bias have been justified in numerous instances; for example, manyof the programs of station WNET [in New York City] have had a distinctly leftistcoloration.... The sledding for public television has been made harder alsobecause of clashes and power duels in the system, notably between left- andright-wing outfits and over the issue of central versus local power.All this is eminently true; it has always been true of any government-sponsored“cultural” establishment. It is not a matter of personalities: a man ofintegrity and impeccable taste will not preserve either in such anestablishment. It is not the free market, but government patronage thatcorrupts. The corruption is inherent in the status of a privileged politicalelite—i.e., an elite selected by favor and maintained by force. If a member ofthat elite has no particular convictions, his performance will be bad; if hehas, it will be worse. His convictions, his vanity, and his quest for “prestige”will blend inextricably into a driving motive to ram his ideas down the throatsof the country and of his disarmed opponents, who are forced to pay for hissupport. Thus, whether for “idealistic” or for the lowest kinds of motives, the“power duels” among the members of the elite will continue.As to the quality of their work, a “professional touch” is achieved by theelement of objectivity—by objective standards of value, of performance, oftaste—which is a necessity for an artist seeking the voluntary support of anaudience. Men liberated from that necessity and guided by whims can be nothingbut amateurs.On the basis of his own observations, one would expect Mr. Markel to concludethat public television is a useless, hopeless, and evil institution. But hesprings another surprise on his readers.“If public TV is to have a future,” he declares, “it must evolve a newphilosophy and a new approach. It must clear its head and clean its house.” Whatphilosophy, what approach, what is to be cleared or cleaned and in what way, isnot indicated, beyond the statement that “the coverage of public affairs must begreatly improved,” and the advice to emulate the B.B.C. And on the basis ofthese floating platitudes, Mr. Markel comes out with the one paragraph for whichall the rest serves merely as verbal window dressing:“In such ways public TV can win popular support and so achieve both independenceand economic relief (the two are linked). As long as it is dependent for fundingon Congress, and therefore on politics, public TV will not be free. The onlysolution is an excise tax, possibly a levy on sets as in Britain.” [Emphasisadded.]Get this straight: public TV is to be liberated from politics by thenonpolitical (!) means of a tax imposed on the people for the exclusive benefit,use, and disposal of the men in public TV.Even the welfare recipients who stage demonstrations have more decency thanthat: they, at least, present demands to Congress—they do not seek a direct lienon their neighbors’ pockets.Congress is a body of representatives chosen by the people; if public TV ispublic, on whom should its funding—and its control—depend if not on the public’srepresentatives? Yet it is Congress that Mr. Markel’s proposal seeks to bypass.Yes, Congress is a fluid, flexible institution, unpredictable in its policies,subject to the fluctuating views of the electorate—as it has to be, in a freecountry (where its power is limited by a Constitution), or in the sort of“genuine democracy” that liberals of Mr. Markel’s kind are constantly touting.Yes, to depend on the switching moods of momentary majorities is as precariousas to build on quicksand—which is one of the reasons why intellectual pursuitsmust be kept outside the reach of government power. Yes, “independence andeconomic relief [i.e., the security of one’s financial means] are linked,” andthere can be no independence when the means to achieve one’s goals depend, noton mutual trade, but on unilateral favor—which is one of the reasons whyindependence is the corollary of a free economy and cannot be achieved anywhereelse.But Mr. Markel wants to eat his cake and have it, too. He advocates publicservice without public responsibility; a blank check on public funds withoutpublic accounting; the “security” of a public income without public control.Who, in such a setup, would determine the policies of public TV? Who wouldchoose its managers and performers, the recipients of public money? Who wouldjudge the value of its programs—and by what standard? Who would establish whatis “imagination” and “balance”? Who would determine what is biased and what isnot—what is informative and what is not—what sort of information is needed bythe public and what sort is not—what is “imaginative” and what is“eccentric”—and whether a symbolic study of space, time, and sex in thesubconscious of a fruit fly is effectively or ineffectively “experimental”?If, under the vague control of a loose, haphazard, too easily tolerantCongressional supervision, public TV has done as badly as it has—and as Mr.Markel describes—what can lead one to expect that it would turn into an assemblyof genius, of great thinkers, unbiased commentators, and brilliantly originalartists, if unlimited funds were placed at its disposal, with no supervision, norules, no strings attached? No group of people has so great a faith in the powerof money as those who are socialisti cally inclined.It is useless to raise moral questions in regard to a moral obscenity such asthe proposal to force people to support public TV—which means: to take frompeople, by force, the money they had to work for, and give it to sundryintellectual connivers in exchange for a nebulous non-product which peoplecannot use, would not want to use, and would hate if they tried it (but which isallegedly desired by ten million college hippies who do not propose to pay foranything they desire). Consider the issue of pay-TV (for which only those whowant it, would pay): the same types of mentalities who oppose pay-TV, for fearthat it might eventually deprive the poor of the free commercial programs theynow enjoy, do not hesitate to support the imposition of a tax on the televisionsets of the poor, in order to make them pay for programs they would not see.In my [article in Philosophy: Who Needs It] on “The Establishing of anEstablishment,” which discussed government grants to the social sciences, Iwrote: “The origin of an aristocracy is the king’s power to confer on a chosenindividual the privilege of receiving an unearned income from the involuntaryservitude of the inhabitants of a given district. Now, the same policy isoperating in the United States—only the privileges are granted not inperpetuity, but in a lump sum for a limited time, and the involuntary servitudeis imposed not on a group of serfs in a specific territory, but on all thecitizens of the country.”I overestimated the moral stature and underestimated the ambition of modernintellectuals. Their goal is not the position of a temporary elite, but theestablishment of a full-fledged aristocracy in perpetuity (with the successiondetermined not by birth, but by self-perpetuating professional guilds)—anaristocracy which, once established, would no longer be subject to publicchoice, approval, or control, an aristocracy independent of the government,except for the government’s obligation to send out internal revenue agents tocollect from the country at large the private tax imposed by the aristocrats.This is the secret dream of those advocates of “genuine democracy” who regardthe free market as insecure and the necessity to earn a living as an impediment,who long for liberation from material concerns, and who are not afraid toexchange the “tyranny” of a private employer for the terrible chains of agovernment’s control. They do not intend to be under government control; theywould be exempt; the government would guarantee their income, collect it,deliver it, and ask no questions; they would achieve liberation from materialconcerns, by the only means it can ever be attempted: by the slave labor ofothers.There is a limit to everything, even to the human capacity for evasion. No mancould face others and declare that he intends to force them to support him forno reason whatever, just because he wants it, for his own “selfish” sake. Heneeds to justify his intention, not merely in their eyes, but, above all, in hisown. There is only one doctrine that can pass for a justification: altruism.Observe that such men are impassioned advocates of altruistic ideals, ofcollectivism, brother love, social service, and self-sacrificial dedication tothe good of others. They are not hypocrites; in their own way, they are“sincere”; they have to be. They need to believe that their work serves others,whether those others like it or not, and that the good of others is their onlymotivation; they do believe it—passionately, fiercely, militantly—in the sensein which a belief is distinguishable from a conviction: in the form of anemotion impervious to reality.It makes no difference whether they embraced altruism as a means to theirulterior motives or the motives grew out of their altruistic creed. The twoelements are mutually reinforcing, and neither is given a consciousidentification in their minds. The same lack of self-esteem that would make aman accept and desire the position of being supported by the forced labor ofothers, would make him accept, and regard as noble, the doctrine demanding hisself-immolation.In this special sense, the advocates of every vicious, irrational doctrine are“sincere” and believe what they preach, though their belief is somewhatdifferent and deeper than the faith they demand of their victims (if “depth,” inthis case, is to be measured by distance from reality). The victims arecommanded to believe and to take the blame if they permit their faith to beshaken by facts that contradict it. The leaders are free (up to a point) to facethe facts of their own performance, to lie, to cheat, to rob, to kill—so long asthey hold, as an inviolate absolute, the belief that they are the vehicles of ahigher truth which justifies, somehow, any action they might commit; this grantsthem the kind of malleable, non-absolute reality which is their basic goal.For the victims of altruism, doubt is paralyzed by guilt; for the leaders,altruism removes the necessity of doubt, i.e., of thought.In the case of some liberals’ clamor for public TV, nothing more may be involvedthan some hack’s desire to see his epic produced at public expense. But thathack’s psychology—his belief—is part of a continuum that leads to Robespierre orHitler or Stalin.Let me give you an illustration of such belief. When Khrushchev visited theUnited States in 1959, he was interviewed on various television news programs,usually through the voice of a translator; but on one occasion his answers werebroadcast in Russian (with the English translation following). He was askedabout the grounds of his faith in the ultimate triumph of world communism. Andsuddenly this cynical old brute—this Big Boss, feared by the whole world, knownin Russia as “the Butcher of the Ukraine” for the mass slaughter that raised himto prominence—began to recite the credo of dialectic materialism in the exactwords and tone in which I had heard it recited at exams, in my college days, bystudents at the University of Leningrad. He had the same uninflected, monotonoustone of a memorized lesson, the same automatic progression of sounds rather thanmeaning, the same earnest, dutiful, desperate hope that the sacred formulaswould come out correctly. But in the face and eyes of a large televisioncloseup, there was a shade more intensity than in the faces of the poor littlecollege robots, more superstitious awe, and less comprehension: it was the faceof a man performing a magic ritual on which his life depends. This man, Ithought, believes it; he is compelled to believe it; he does not know what itmeans—but he knows that if this string of sounds were taken away from him, hewould be left to face something more frightening than death.Such is the nature, the pattern, and the ultimate exponent of those who havefaith—and a vested interest—in altruism."},{"pageContent":"23Tax Credits for Educationby Ayn RandThis article was published in The Ayn Rand Letter. March 13, 1972.Politically, the goal of today’s dominant trend is statism. Philosophically, thegoal is the obliteration of reason; psychologically, it is the erosion ofambition.The political goal presupposes the two others. The human characteristic requiredby statism is docility, which is the product of hopelessness and intellectualstagnation. Thinking men cannot be ruled; ambitious men do not stagnate.“Ambition” means the systematic pursuit of achievement and of constantimprovement in respect to one’s goal. Like the word “selfishness,” and for thesame reasons, the word “ambition” has been perverted to mean only the pursuit ofdubious or evil goals, such as the pursuit of power; this left no concept todesignate the pursuit of actual values. But “ambition” as such is a neutralconcept: the evaluation of a given ambition as moral or immoral depends on thenature of the goal. A great scientist or a great artist is the most passionatelyambitious of men. A demagogue seeking political power is ambitious. So is asocial climber seeking “prestige.” So is a modest laborer who worksconscientiously to acquire a home of his own. The common denominator is thedrive to improve the conditions of one’s existence, however broadly or narrowlyconceived. (“Improvement” is a moral term and depends on one’s standard ofvalues. An ambition guided by an irrational standard does not, in fact, lead toimprovement, but to self-destruction.)An economic “freeze” is intended to paralyze ambition (and its root: the activemind). A freeze is an order not to act, not to grow, not to improve. It is ademand to sacrifice one’s future. But—since an essential characteristic of lifeis motion—when men do not move forward, they move back; the demand to stopcannot stop and becomes a demand to sacrifice one’s present.The Nixon Administration did not even take the trouble to delay or disguise thisprocess. After all the mawkish pleas to “hold the line” against inflation—toforgo, “temporarily,” higher profits or higher wages or a higher standard ofliving—the Administration is now proposing higher taxes. This means that ourstandard of living is not to stand still, but to collapse under a huge new taxburden, a so-called “value-added tax” (which is a complex form of national salestax).To add insult to injury, this tax is intended to finance not some suddennational emergency, but public education.Of all the government undertakings, none has failed so disastrously as publiceducation. The scope, the depth, and the evidence of this failure are observableall around us. To name three of its obvious symptoms: drug addiction among theyoung (which is an attempt to escape the unbearable state of a mind unable tocope with existence)—functional illiteracy (the inability of the averagehigh-school or college graduate to speak English, i.e., to speak or writecoherently)—student violence (which means that students have not learned whatsavages know to some minimal extent: the impracticality and immorality ofresorting to physical force).In the face of such evidence, one would expect the government’s performance inthe field of education to be questioned, at the least. Instead, the governmentis demanding more money—at a time of national economic crisis—to continuespreading the wreckage wider and wider. (Observe, incidentally, the consistencywith which moral principles work out in politics: when need, not achievement, isthe standard of value, success at a given assignment is penalized, and failurerewarded. For example, NASA’s success in landing a man on the moon was followedby cuts in Congressional appropriations for the space program; the growingfailures of the educational establishment are followed by the appropriation oflarger and larger sums.)There is, however, a practical alternative. If the countless individuals who areeager to “do something” in politics, and the countless groups who professconcern over the growth of statism, really wish to accomplish something ofvalue, the coming debate on the new tax to support education offers them achance. (It is also a chance for any honest politician, of either party, whoseeks a worthy issue to crusade for at election time.) It is an opportunity tounite many people of different viewpoints in an ad hoc movement for aspecifically defined goal.The goal is: tax credits for education.The idea is not entirely new. (I was advocating it ten years ago.) Differentversions of it were periodically proposed in Congress, but were defeated incommittee. (In 1964, one of the proposal’s notable supporters was SenatorRibicoff.) The evidence of the desperate need for such a program has never beenas clear as it is at present.The essentials of the idea (in my version) are as follows: an individual citizenwould be given tax credits for the money he spends on education, whether his owneducation, his children‘s, or any person’s he wants to put through a bona fideschool of his own choice (including primary, secondary, and higher education).The upper limits of what he may spend on any one person would be equal to whatit costs the government to provide a student with a comparable education (ifthere is a computer big enough to calculate it, including all the costsinvolved, local, state, and federal, the government loans, scholarships,subsidies, etc.).If a young person’s parents are too poor to pay for his education or to payincome taxes, and if he cannot find a private sponsor to finance him, the publicschools would still be available to him, as they are at present—with thelikelihood that these schools would be greatly improved by the relief of thepressure of overcrowding, and by the influence of a broad variety of privateschools.I want to stress that I am not an advocate of public (i.e., government-operated)schools, that I am not an advocate of the income tax, and that I am not anadvocate of the government’s “right” to expropriate a citizen’s money or tocontrol his spending through tax incentives. None of these phenomena would existin a free economy. But we are living in a disastrously mixed economy, whichcannot be freed overnight. And in today’s context, the above proposal would be astep in the right direction, a measure to avert an immediate catastrophe.It would accomplish the following: instead of becoming a crushing new tax burdenat a time when the country is staggering under the present one, the costs ofeducation would be borne directly by those who now pay them indirectly—byindividual citizens. (The public schools would remain in existence and would befinanced out of general tax revenues.) Parents would still have to pay foreducation, but they would have a choice: either to send their children to freepublic schools and pay their taxes in full—or to pay tuition to a privateschool, with money saved from their taxes.It would give private schools a chance to survive (which they do not have atpresent). It would bring their tuition fees within the reach of the majority ofpeople (today, only the well-to-do can afford them). It would break up thegovernment’s stranglehold, decentralize education, and open it to competition—aswell as to a free marketplace of ideas.It would eliminate the huge educational bureaucracy of the government (which isnow growing with the speed of a terminal cancer) and reduce it to a reasonablesize. The amount of money this would save is literally inconceivable to theaverage citizen. To give just one example: it was estimated that the Job Corps[a federal training program] spent $9,210 to $13,000 per year per enrollee; atsome camps, the figure reached $22,000, and even $39,205. At private residentialschools giving vocational training, the costs ranged from $2,300 to $2,600 perstudent per year. (Shirley Scheibla, Poverty Is Where the Money Is, NewRochelle, N.Y.: Arlington House, 1968.)Let the schoolteachers and college professors remember these figures. Theirs isone of the lowest paid professions today, yet most of them are supporters of thestatus quo. Let them realize that it is not the poverty of their students, butthe enrichment of the bureaucracy, that is responsible for their plight—and whata competitive market would do in regard to the financial value of theirservices.At present, the biggest spender of government funds, the largest recipient oftax money in the national budget, is not the Department of Defense, but theDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare. It is clear why the government musthold a monopoly on national defense. But no one—except a full-fledged communistor fascist—would advocate a government monopoly on education. Yet such amonopoly is what we are, in fact, approaching—and taxation is the main cause ofthe trend.Private universities are being ground out of existence between two moderndisasters, both products of government policies: the erosion of privatecontributions (eaten away by taxes), and rising costs (brought about byinflation, which is caused by government spending). State universities withnominal or free tuition are another factor destroying the chances of the privateuniversities’ survival. No private concern can compete with a governmentinstitution for any length of time, and the injustice involved is obvious: it isa competition in which one contestant has unlimited funds, part of them takenfrom the other, and in which one contestant is forced to obey the rulesarbitrarily set by the other. If any private schools survive, they will survivein name only (which is the typical policy of a fascist state): they are all buthog-tied by the government already. The current attempts to assist privateuniversities with federal funds will complete the job. If “the power to tax isthe power to destroy,” the power to disburse government funds is the power torule.Now consider the nature of today’s tax policies in regard to the educationalneeds of young people.While millions of dollars are being spent by the government on attempts toeducate young people most of whom have no ability and/or no desire to get aneducation, what happens to the young man who has both? If he is poor, he has towork his way through school—a terrible process that takes eight years or longerfor a four-year course, consuming his youth and becoming progressively harder,in view of rising costs and shrinking opportunities of employment. (Scholarshipsare a drop in the bucket, nor are they always granted fairly.) Yet out of hismeager income, he has to pay taxes—not only the hidden ones in the cost ofeverything he buys, but income taxes as well. Thus while he is allowed nodeductions for the costs of his own education, he is paying for the freeeducation of the youths enrolled in government projects.To seek education in such circumstances requires an unusual strength ofcharacter, an unusual independence, ambition, and long-range vision. The youngpeople who do it are, potentially, the best of the nation; they are its future;they do not need help, only a fair chance, which they are denied. Many of themare broken by the struggle and driven to give up. But wherever they go, theirtaxes still pay for the education and “rehabilitation” efforts which allegedlystrive (but fail) to develop in stuporous hippies the qualities of characterwhich they, the victims, had once possessed.If a young man does not, or cannot afford to, go to college, but goes to workinstead, to earn his living, he will soon discover—if he is an activelyinterested, conscientious, ambitious worker— that he needs education to rise toa better job. The tax laws allow him deductions only if the schooling isdemanded by his employer as a condition of keeping his job—not if he seeksspecial training on his own initiative. What does this do to his self-confidenceor his sense of control over his own future? Yet in the government’sjob-training programs, the lethargic recipients are not merely given freetraining, but are paid for attending the courses. It is inequities of this kindthat make Mr. Nixon’s exhortations to “self-reliance” sound so ludicrously andcruelly hypocritical.All over the country, self-respecting and self-supporting young couples arecarrying a double financial burden: paying constantly rising taxes for thesupport of schools to which they cannot in conscience send their own children.The private revival of Montessori schools demonstrates the plight ofconscientious young parents on a nationwide scale. Aware of the ravages ofProgressive education in public schools, such parents send their children toprivate schools (or join to build such schools), which few of them can afford.It is a heavy sacrifice for most of them, at a time when they are struggling toachieve some degree of professional and financial security. They are given notax relief for such expenses, which places private schools outside the reach ofthe hard-working, respectable lower middle class.The same injustice is perpetrated against the parents who send their children toparochial schools. As you surely know, I am not an advocate of religion or ofreligious education, but the double burden of a forced necessity to pay for thesupport of secular schools is a violation of the parents’ right to religiousfreedom. The parochial schools are collapsing financially, for the same reasonsand under the same pressures as the private universities—and the currentcontroversy over the support of parochial schools illustrates the nature of theissue. On the one hand, it is certainly improper and unconstitutional to usepublic funds for the support of religious schools. On the other hand, it isunjust that the children of religious taxpayers are denied the specialadvantages granted to the children of nonreligious ones. You may take it as ageneral rule: whenever an issue leads to an unresolvable conflict, you willfind, at its root, the violation of someone’s rights.These are only a few of the problems that tax credits for education would solve.The opposition to such a program would be horrendous and would come from anentrenched pressure group: the educational establishment. But this is the timeto raise the question of a “conflict of interests.” Public officials who haveconnections with private sources of income that involve government matters—as,for instance, with a company seeking government contracts—are regarded assuspect, unless they break the connection. By the same token, a bureaucrat whosesource of income is a government job (an unnecessary job, more often than not)should be regarded as suspect when and if he opposes a program that threatensthe source of his income.Some people would oppose the program on the grounds that it will foster thedevelopment of different educational theories and methods in the various privateschools. The answer to them is that that precisely is one of the program’sgoals—that differences, not regimented uniformity, are essential to the progressof a free country—and that equality before the law, not egalitarianism, is oneof this country’s fundamental principles.Let us take the educational establishment at their word and hold them to it:that their goal is to provide education, not to control the intellectual life ofthis country."},{"pageContent":"24Antitrust: The Rule of Unreasonby Ayn RandThis is one of Ayn Rand’s earliest discussions of the evils of antitrustlegislation. It was published in The Objectivist Newsletter, February 1962.It is a grave error to suppose that a dictatorship rules a nation by means ofstrict, rigid laws which are obeyed and enforced with rigorous, militaryprecision. Such a rule would be evil, but almost bearable; men could endure theharshest edicts, provided these edicts were known, specific, and stable; it isnot the known that breaks men’s spirits, but the unpredictable. A dictatorshiphas to be capricious; it has to rule by means of the unexpected, theincomprehensible, the wantonly irrational; it has to deal not in death, but insudden death; a state of chronic uncertainty is what men are psychologicallyunable to bear.The American businessmen have had to live in that state for seventy years. Theywere condemned to it by that judicial version of the doctrine of original sinwhich presumes men to be guilty with little or no chance to be proved innocentand which is known as the antitrust laws.No business-hating collectivist could have gotten away with creating so perfectan instrument for the destruction of capitalism and the delivery of businessmeninto the total power of the government. It took the so-called “conservatives,”the alleged defenders of capitalism, to create the antitrust laws. And it takesthe intellectual superficiality of today’s “conservatives” to continuesupporting these laws, in spite of their meaning, record, and results.The alleged purpose of the antitrust laws was to protect competition; thatpurpose was based on the socialistic fallacy that a free, unregulated marketwill inevitably lead to the establishment of coercive monopolies. But, in fact,no coercive monopoly has ever been or ever can be established by means of freetrade on a free market. Every coercive monopoly was created by governmentintervention into the economy: by special privileges, such as franchises orsubsidies, which closed the entry of competitors into a given field, bylegislative action. (For a full demonstration of this fact, I refer you to theworks of the best economists.) The antitrust laws were the classic example of amoral inversion prevalent in the history of capitalism: an example of thevictims, the businessmen, taking the blame for the evils caused by thegovernment, and the government using its own guilt as a justification foracquiring wider powers, on the pretext of “correcting” the evils.Since “free competition enforced by law” is a grotesque contradiction in terms,antitrust grew into a haphazard accumulation of non-objective laws so vague,complex, contradictory, and inconsistent that any business practice can now beconstrued as illegal, and by complying with one law a businessman opens himselfto prosecution under several others. No two jurists can agree on the meaning andapplication of these laws. No one can give an exact definition of whatconstitutes “restraint of trade” or “intent to monopolize” or any of the other,similar “crimes.” No one can tell what the law forbids or permits one to do. Theinterpretation is left entirely up to the courts. “The courts in the UnitedStates have been engaged ever since 1890 in deciding case by case exactly whatthe law proscribes. No broad definition can really unlock the meaning of thestatute.” [A.D. Neale, The Antitrust Laws of the U.S.A., Cambridge UniversityPress, 1960, p. 13.]Thus a businessman has no way of knowing in advance whether the action he takesis legal or illegal, whether he is guilty or innocent. Yet he has to act; he hasto run his business.Retroactive law—which means: a law that punishes a man for an action which wasnot legally defined as a crime at the time he committed it—is a form ofpersecution practiced only in dictatorships and forbidden by every civilizedlegal code. It is not supposed to exist in the United States and it is notapplied to anyone—except to businessmen. A case in which a man cannot know untilhe is convicted whether the action he took in the past was legal or illegal iscertainly a case of retroactive law.At first, antitrust was merely a potential club, a “big stick” overbusinessmen’s heads, but it soon became actual. From their hesitant, sluggishbeginnings in a few vaguely semi-plausible cases, antitrust prosecutionsaccelerated by a progression of logical steps to such judicial decisions as:that established businesses have to share with any newcomer the facilities ithad taken them years to create, if the lack of such facilities imposes a realhardship on the would-be competitor (Associated Press case, 1945)—that businessconcerns have no right to pool their patents and that the penalty for such poolsis either the compulsory licensing of their patents to any and all comers or theoutright confiscation of the patents; and if a businessman, who is a member ofsuch a pool, sues a competitor who has infringed his patent, the competitor notonly wins the case, but collects treble damages from the man whose patent he hadinfringed (Kobe v. Dempsey Pump Company, 1952)—that if a would-be competitor’sefficiency is so low that he is unable even to pay a royalty on the patentsowned by stronger companies, he is entitled to such patents royalty-free(General Electric case, 1948)—that business concerns must not merely make a giftof their patents to any rival, but must also teach him how to use these patents(I.C.I. and duPont case, 1952)—that a business concern must not anticipateincreases in the demand for its product and must not be prepared to meet them byexpanding its capacity “before others entered the field,” because this mightdiscourage newcomers (ALCOA case, 1945).Is the basic line clear? Do you observe the nature of the principle thatdictated the decisions in these cases?A. D. Neale identifies it as follows: “There is an element of pure‘underdoggery’ in the law; an element of throwing the weight of the enforcementauthorities into the scale on the side of the weaker parties, which has littleto do with the economic control of monopoly.” [p. 461]I identify it as: the penalizing of ability for being ability, the penalizing ofsuccess for being success, and the sacrifice of productive genius to the demandsof envious mediocrity.Who were the profiteers of antitrust? Many businessmen supported it from thestart: some innocently, some not. These last were the kind who seek to rise notby free trade and productive ability, but by political favor and pull, whichmeans: not by merit, but by force. They are the typical products of a “mixedeconomy” and their numbers multiply as the economy grows more “mixed.”The other group of profiteers was the bureaucrats and the statists. As the trendtoward statism grew, the statists found an invaluable instrument for thepersecution and the eventual enslavement of businessmen. Observe that the mostoutrageous antitrust cases date from the 1940s. Power in a statist sense meansarbitrary power. An objective law protects a country’s freedom; only anon-objective law can give a statist the chance he seeks: a chance to impose hisarbitrary will—his policies, his decisions, his interpretations, hisenforcement, his punishment or favor—on disarmed, defenseless victims. He doesnot have to exercise his power too frequently or too openly; he merely has tohave it and let his victims know that he has it; fear will do the rest.In the light of this, consider the new phase of antitrust enforcement. InFebruary of 1961, in Philadelphia, seven businessmen, representing some ofAmerica’s greatest industrial concerns, were sentenced to jail in the“Electrical Conspiracy” case. This case involved twenty-nine companiesmanufacturing electrical equipment. The charge against them was that they hadmade secret agreements to fix prices and rig bids. But without such agreements,the larger companies could have set their prices so low that the smaller oneswould have been unable to match them and would have gone out of business,whereupon the larger companies would have faced prosecution, under these sameantitrust laws, for “intent to monopolize.”It is evil enough to impose ruinous fines under laws which the victims have noway to comply with, laws which everyone concedes to be non-objective,contradictory, and undefinable. It is obscene, under such laws, to impose jailsentences on men of distinguished achievement, outstanding ability, andunimpeachable moral character, who had spent their lives on so responsible atask as industrial production.But this, perhaps, is the clue to the purpose of that disgraceful verdict. Itcreated in the public’s mind the impression that industrial production is somesort of sinister underworld activity and that businessmen, by their nature andprofession, are to be treated as criminals.Such was the obvious implication of the disgusting howling that went on in thepress. The same humanitarians who rush to the defense of any homicidaldipsomaniac did not hesitate to release all of their repressed hatred and maliceon seven silent, defenseless men whose profession was business. That the leftistpress would enjoy it is understandable and, at least, consistent. But what isone to think of the alleged “conservative” press? Take a look at the February17, 1961, issue of Time magazine; with its story about the verdict, Timepublished photographs of six of the victims—six faces with intelligence anddetermination as their common characteristic—and under them, the caption: “Adrama that U.S. business will long remember to its shame.”The same humanitarians of the press who clamor that penitentiaries are auseless, vengeful form of cruelty to juvenile switchblade killers questing for“kicks” and that these sensitive victims of society should be “given a chance”and should be sent to garden rest homes for rehabilitation—these samehumanitarians have remained silent while a bill is proposed in Congress to theeffect that an executive convicted of an antitrust violation may not,thereafter, be given employment by any business concern and is thus to bedeprived of the right to earn a living.No, all this is not the result of a communist conspiracy. It is the result ofsomething much harder to fight: the result of a culture’s cynical, goal-lessdisintegration, which can benefit no one but the communists and the randomlittle powerlusters of the moment, who fish in muddy waters.It is futile to wonder about the policies or the intentions of the present[Kennedy] administration. Whether the whole administration or any one of itsmembers is consciously dedicated to the destruction of American business doesnot matter. What matters is that if any of them are, they have the machinery toaccomplish it and no opposition: a culture without goals, values, or politicalprinciples can offer no opposition to anything.Intentionally or not, the purpose achieved by those jail sentences is:intimidation—or, more precisely: terrorization. The antitrust laws give thegovernment the power to prosecute and convict any business concern in thecountry any time it chooses. The threat of sudden destruction, of unpredictableretaliation for unnamed offenses, is a much more potent means of enslavementthan explicit dictatorial laws. It demands more than mere obedience; it leavesmen no policy save one: to please the authorities; to please—blindly,uncritically, without standards or principles; to please—in any issue, matter,or circumstance, for fear of an unknowable, unprovable vengeance. Anyonepossessing such a stranglehold on businessmen possesses a stranglehold on thewealth and the material resources of the country, which means: a stranglehold onthe country.Businessmen are already helpless and almost silenced. It is only theintellectuals who still have a chance to be heard. That is why I suggest to youthe following test: if you hear an alleged “conservative” who quibbles bravelyover taxes, budgets, or school aid, but supports the antitrust laws—you may besure that he is futile as a fighter for capitalism. To combat petty larceny as acrucial danger, at a time when murder is being committed, is to sanction themurder.What should we do? We should demand a reexamination and revision of the entireissue of antitrust. We should challenge its philosophical, political, economicand moral base. We should have a Civil Liberties Union—for businessmen. Therepeal of the antitrust laws should be our ultimate goal; it will require a longintellectual and political struggle, but, in the meantime and as a first step,we should urge that the jail-penalty provisions of these laws be abolished.Businessmen are the one group that distinguishes capitalism and the American wayof life from the totalitarian statism that is swallowing the rest of the world.All the other social groups—workers, professional men, scientists,soldiers—exist under dictatorships, even though they exist in chains, in terror,in misery and in progressive self-destruction. But there is no such group asbusinessmen under a dictatorship. Their place is taken by armed thugs: bybureaucrats and commissars. So if you want to fight for freedom, you must beginby fighting for its unrewarded, unrecognized, unacknowledged, yet bestrepresentatives—the American businessmen."},{"pageContent":"25The Pull Peddlersby Ayn RandAyn Rand regarded a country’s domestic policy (and the philosophy underlying it)as decisive for its future and as the source of its foreign policy. Accordingly,she wrote relatively little about foreign policy as such. This discussion offoreign aid is one of her few articles on the area, published in The ObjectivistNewsletter, September 1962.America’s foreign policy is so grotesquely irrational that most people believethere must be some sensible purpose behind it. The extent of the irrationalityacts as its own protection: like the technique of the “Big Lie,” it makes peopleassume that so blatant an evil could not possibly be as evil as it appears tothem and, therefore, that somebody must understand its meaning, even though theythemselves do not.The sickening generalities and contradictions cited in justification of theforeign aid program fall roughly into two categories which are offered to ussimultaneously: the “idealistic” and the “practical,” or mush and fear.The “idealistic” arguments consist of appeals to altruism and swim out of focusin a fog of floating abstractions about our duty to support the “underdeveloped”nations of the entire globe, who are starving and will perish without ourselfless help.The “practical” arguments consist of appeals to fear and emit a different sortof fog, to the effect that our own selfish interest requires that we go bankruptbuying the favor of the “underdeveloped” nations, who, otherwise, will become adangerous threat to us.It is useless to point out to the advocates of our foreign policy that it’seither-or: either the “underdeveloped” nations are so weak that they are doomedwithout our help, in which case they cannot become a threat to us—or they are sostrong that with some other assistance they can develop to the point ofendangering us, in which case we should not drain our economic power to help thegrowth of potential enemies who are that powerful.It is useless to discuss the contradiction between these two assertions, becauseneither of them is true. Their proponents are impervious to facts, to logic, andto the mounting evidence that after two decades of global altruism, our foreignpolicy is achieving the exact opposite of its alleged goals: it is wrecking oureconomy—it is reducing us internationally to the position of an impotent failurewho has nothing but a series of compromises, retreats, defeats, and betrayals onhis record—and, instead of bringing progress to the world, it is bringing thebloody chaos of tribal warfare and delivering one helpless nation after anotherinto the power of communism.When a society insists on pursuing a suicidal course, one may be sure that thealleged reasons and proclaimed slogans are mere rationalizations. The questionis only: what is it that these rationalizations are hiding?Observe that there is no consistent pattern in the erratic chaos of our foreignaid. And although in the long run it leads to the benefit of Soviet Russia,Russia is not its direct, immediate beneficiary. There is no consistent winner,only a consistent loser: the United States.In the face of such a spectacle, some people give up the attempt to understand;others imagine that some omnipotent conspiracy is destroying America, that therationalizations are hiding some malevolent, fantastically powerful giant.The truth is worse than that: the truth is that the rationalizations are hidingnothing—that there is nothing at the bottom of the fog but a nest of scurryingcockroaches.I submit in evidence an article in the editorial section of The New York Timesof July 15, 1962, entitled: “Role of Foreign Lobbies.”A “non-diplomatic corps” of foreign agents has bloomed in recent years [inWashington].... Lobbying in Congress to obtain—or prevent—the passage oflegislation of interest to their foreign clients, seeking to pressure theAdministration into adopting certain political or economic policies, orattempting to mold public opinion through a myriad of methods and techniques,this legion of special agents has become an elusive shadow for operating inWashington and the width and the length of the land.“Lobbying” is the activity of attempting to influence legislation by privatelyinfluencing the legislators. It is the result and creation of a “mixedeconomy”—of government by pressure groups. Its methods range from mere socialcourtesies and cocktail-party or luncheon “friendships” to favors, threats,bribes, blackmail.All lobbyists, whether serving foreign or domestic interests, are required—bylaws passed in the last three decades—to register with the government. Theregistrations have been growing at such a rate—with the foreign lobbyistsoutnumbering the domestic ones—that legislators are beginning to be alarmed. TheSenate Foreign Relations Committee has announced that it is preparing aninvestigation of these foreign agents’ activities.The New York Times article describes foreign lobbying as follows:The theory behind this whole enterprise is that for a fee or a retainer andoften for hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising, publicity and expensemoney, a foreign Government or a foreign economic or political interest canpurchase a favorable legislation in the United States Congress, a friendlypolicy of the Administration or a positive image in the eyes of the Americanpublic opinion, leading in turn to profitable political or economic advantage.[Emphasis added.]Who are these lobbyists? Men with political pull—with “access” to influentialWashington figures—American men hired by foreign interests. The article mentionsthat most of these men are “Washington lawyers” or “New York public relationsfirms.”Russia is one of these foreign interests and is served by registered lobbyistsin Washington, but she is merely cashing in on the situation, like the others.The success of her conspiracy in this country is the result, not the cause, ofour self-destruction; she is winning by default. The cause is much deeper thanthat.The issue of lobbies has attracted attention recently through the struggle offoreign lobbyists to obtain sugar quotas from the American government. “Theirefforts,” states the article, “were centered on Representative Harold D. Cooley,Democrat of North Carolina, chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, whoat least until this year held almost the complete power in the distribution ofquotas. It has never been too clear what criteria Mr. Cooley used in allocatingthese quotas, and, by the same token, it is impossible to determine what was theactual effect of the lobbyists’ entreaties on him.“But in offering their services to foreign governments or sugar growers’associations, these representatives were, in effect, offering for sale theirreal or alleged friendship with Mr. Cooley.”This is the core and essence of the issue of lobbying—and of our foreign aid—andof a “mixed economy.”The trouble is not that “it has never been too clear what criteria Mr. Cooleyused in allocating these quotas”—but that it has never been and never can be tooclear what criteria he was expected to use by the legislation that granted himthese powers. No criteria can ever be defined in this context; such is thenature of non-objective law and of all economic legislation.So long as a concept such as “the public interest” (or the “social” or“national” or “international” interest) is regarded as a valid principle toguide legislation—lobbies and pressure groups will necessarily continue toexist. Since there is no such entity as “the public,” since the public is merelya number of individuals, the idea that “the public interest” supersedes privateinterests and rights can have but one meaning: that the interests and rights ofsome individuals take precedence over the interests and rights of others.If so, then all men and all private groups have to fight to the death for theprivilege of being regarded as “the public.” The government’s policy has toswing like an erratic pendulum from group to group, hitting some and favoringothers, at the whim of any given moment—and so grotesque a profession aslobbying (selling “influence”) becomes a full-time job. If parasitism,favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a “mixedeconomy” would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men toothers, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guidedin practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of moneytaken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes downultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, nonobjective, arbitrarypower to some government officials.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, butthat it cannot be used honestly. The wisest man in the world, with the purestintegrity, cannot find a criterion for the just, equitable, rational applicationof an unjust, inequitable, irrational principle. The best that an honestofficial can do is to accept no material bribe for his arbitrary decision; butthis does not make his decision and its consequences more just or lesscalamitous.A man of clear-cut convictions is impervious to anyone’s influence. But whenclear-cut convictions are impossible, personal influences take over. When aman’s mind is trapped in the foggy labyrinth of the non-objective, that has noexits and no solutions, he will welcome any quasi-persuasive, semi-plausibleargument. Lacking certainty, he will follow anyone’s facsimile thereof. He isthe natural prey of social “manipulators,” of propaganda salesmen, of lobbyists.When any argument is as inconclusive as any other, the subjective, emotional, or“human” element becomes decisive. A harried legislator may conclude, consciouslyor subconsciously, that the friendly man who smiled at him at the cocktail partylast week was a good person who would not deceive him and whose opinion can betrusted safely. It is by considerations such as these that officials may disposeof your money, your effort, and your future.Although cases of actual corruption do undoubtedly exist among legislators andgovernment officials, they are not a major motivating factor in today’ssituation. It is significant that in such cases as have been publicly exposed,the bribes were almost pathetically small. Men who held the power to dispose ofmillions of dollars sold their favors for a thousand-dollar rug or a fur coat ora refrigerator.The truth, most likely, is that they did not regard it as bribery or as abetrayal of their public trust; they did not think that their particulardecision could matter one way or another, in the kind of causeless choices theyhad to make, in the absence of any criteria, in the midst of the general orgy oftossing away an apparently ownerless wealth. Men who would not sell out theircountry for a million dollars are selling it out for somebody’s smile and avacation trip to Florida. “It is of such pennies and smiles that the destructionof your country is made.”The general public is helplessly bewildered. The “intellectuals” do not care tolook at our foreign policy too closely. They feel guilt; they sense that theirown worn-out ideologies, which they dare not challenge, are the cause of theconsequences which they dare not face. The more they evade, the greater theireagerness to grasp at any fashionable straw or rationalization and to uphold itwith glassy-eyed aggressiveness. The threadbare cloak of altruism serves tocover it up and to sanction the evasions by a fading aura of moralrighteousness. The exhausted cynicism of a bankrupt culture, of a societywithout values, principles, convictions, or intellectual standards, does therest: it leaves a vacuum for anyone to take over and use.The motive power behind the suicidal bleeding of the greatest country in theworld is not an altruistic fervor or a collectivist crusade any longer, but themanipulations of little lawyers and public relations men pulling the mentalstrings of lifeless automatons.These—the lobbyists in the pay of foreign interests, the men who could not hopeto get, in any other circumstances, the money they are getting now—are the realand only profiteers on the global sacrifice, as their ilk has always been at theclose of every altruistic movement in history. It is not the “underdeveloped”nations or the “underprivileged” masses or the starving children of junglevillages who benefit from America’s self-immolation—it is only the men who aretoo small to start such movements and small enough to cash in at the end.It is not any “lofty ideal” that the altruism-collectivism doctrine accomplishesor can ever accomplish. Its end-of-trail is as follows: “A local railroad hadgone bankrupt in North Dakota, abandoning the region to the fate of a blightedarea, the local banker had committed suicide, first killing his wife andchildren—a freight train had been taken off the schedule in Tennessee, leaving alocal factory without transportation at a day’s notice, the factory owner’s sonhad quit college and was now in jail, awaiting execution for a murder committedwith a gang of raiders—a way station had been closed in Kansas, and the stationagent, who had wanted to be a scientist, had given up his studies and become adishwasher—that he, James Taggart, might sit in a private barroom and pay forthe alcohol pouring down Orren Boyle’s throat, for the waiter who spongedBoyle’s garments when he spilled his drink over his chest, for the carpet burnedby the cigarettes of an ex-pimp from Chile who did not want to take the troubleof reaching for an ashtray across a distance of three feet.” [Atlas Shrugged]"},{"pageContent":"26About a Woman Presidentby Ayn RandThis piece, an answer to letters from readers, was published in the issue of TheObjectivist dated December 1968, although the piece was actually written inJanuary 1969.About a year ago, in the issue of January 1968, McCall’s published anarticle-interview with sixteen prominent women (myself included) who had beenasked to answer the question: What would I do if I were president of the UnitedStates? The first paragraph of my answer read: “I would not want to be presidentand would not vote for a woman president. A woman cannot reasonably want to be acommander-in-chief. I prefer to answer the question by outlining what a rationalman would do if he were president.”Thereafter, I received many letters from students of Objectivism, asking me thereasons of that particular paragraph.I was counting on the readers of my novels to understand my reasons. I grantyou, however, that the issue is not self-evident and that it is not easy toconceptualize. For illustrative material, I suggest that you study the basicmotivation of the heroines in my novels, particularly Dagny Taggart.I do not think that a rational woman can want to be president. Observe that Idid not say she would be unable to do the job; I said that she could not wantit. It is not a matter of her ability, but of her values.It is not an issue of feminine “inferiority,” intellectually or morally; womenare not inferior to men in ability or intelligence; besides, it would not takemuch to do a better job than some of our recent presidents have done. It iscertainly not an issue of the popular notion that women are motivatedpredominantly by their emotions rather than by reason—which is plain nonsense.It is not an issue of the false dichotomy of marriage versus career, with thecorollary notion that “a woman’s place is in the home”; whether married orsingle, women need and should have careers, for the same reasons as men. Womenmay properly rise as high as their ability and ambition will carry them; inpolitics, they may reach the ranks of congresswomen, senators, judges, or anysimilar rank they choose.But when it comes to the post of president, do not look at the issue primarilyfrom a somewhat altruistic or social viewpoint—i.e., do not ask: “Could she dothe job and would it be good for the country?” Conceivably, she could and itwould—but what would it do to her?The issue is primarily psychological. It involves a woman’s fundamental view oflife, of herself and of her basic values. For a woman qua woman, the essence offemininity is hero worship—the desire to look up to man. “To look up” does notmean dependence, obedience, or anything implying inferiority. It means anintense kind of admiration; and admiration is an emotion that can be experiencedonly by a person of strong character and independent value judgments. A“clinging vine” type of woman is not an admirer, but an exploiter of men. Heroworship is a demanding virtue: a woman has to be worthy of it and of the heroshe worships. Intellectually and morally, i.e., as a human being, she has to behis equal; then the object of her worship is specifically his masculinety, notany human virtue she might lack.This does not mean that a feminine woman feels or projects hero worship for anyand every individual man; as human beings, many of them may, in fact, be herinferiors. Her worship is an abstract emotion for the metaphysical concept ofmasculinity as such—which she experiences fully and concretely only for the manshe loves, but which colors her attitude toward all men. This does not mean thatthere is a romantic or sexual intention in her attitude toward all men; quitethe contrary: the higher her view of masculinity, the more severely demandingher standards. It means that she never loses the awareness of her own sexualidentity and theirs. It means that a properly feminine woman does not treat menas if she were their pal, sister, mother—or leader.Now consider the meaning of the presidency: in all his professionalrelationships, within the entire sphere of his work, the president is thehighest authority; he is the “chief executive,” the “commander-in-chief.” Evenin a fully free country, with an unbreached constitutional division of powers, apresident is the final authority who sets the terms, the goals, the policies ofevery job in the executive branch of the government. In the performance of hisduties, a president does not deal with equals, but only with inferiors (notinferiors as persons, but in respect to the hierarchy of their positions, theirwork, and their responsibilities).This, for a rational woman, would be an unbearable situation. (And if she is notrational, she is unfit for the presidency or for any important position,anyway.) To act as the superior, the leader, virtually the ruler of all the menshe deals with, would be an excruciating psychological torture. It would requirea total depersonalization, an utter selflessness, and an incommunicableloneliness; she would have to suppress (or repress) every personal aspect of herown character and attitude; she could not be herself, i.e., a woman; she wouldhave to function only as a mind, not as a person, i.e., as a thinker devoid ofpersonal values—a dangerously artificial dichotomy which no one could sustainfor long. By the nature of her duties and daily activities, she would become themost unfeminine, sexless, metaphysically inappropriate, and rationally revoltingfigure of all: a matriarch.This would apply to the reigning queen of an absolute monarchy, but it would notapply to a woman in any field of endeavor other than politics. It does notapply, for instance, to a woman who heads a business concern; even though she isthe highest authority within that concern, she deals constantly with men who arenot under her orders: with customers, suppliers, competitors; she is notcondemned to the solitary confinement of dealing exclusively with men who areher hierarchical inferiors (nor is her power as wide as that of a president).It is conceivable that in some unusual historical context, in some period ofextreme national emergency, it would be proper for a woman temporarily to assumethe leadership of a country, in the role of president, if there were no men ableto assume it. But what would this imply about the character of the men at thattime? (Normally, the best and ablest among men do not necessarily have to seekthe presidency, but in an extreme emergency, they would have to—as did thefounding fathers.)There is a historical precedent for the fate of a woman leader in a period ofextreme emergency: Joan of Are—the most heroic woman and the most tragic symbolin history. I say “tragic” not merely because she was burned at the stake inreward for having saved her country—although that monstrous physical evil issingularly appropriate, as a fiction-like concretization of the spiritualtragedy of her life. Ask yourself: what power of dedication she must havepossessed when she found herself as the only one able to revive the fightingspirit of men who had given up—and what would she personally have felt about it?For a woman to seek or desire the presidency is, in fact, so terrible a prospectof spiritual self-immolation that the woman who would seek it is psychologicallyunworthy of the job."},{"pageContent":"27The Inverted Moral Prioritiesby Ayn RandThis article was published in the issue of The Ayn Rand Letter dated July 15,1974, though it was written a few months later than this date.A widespread ignorance of a crucial economic issue is apparent in mostdiscussions of today’s problems: it is ignorance on the part of the public,evasion on the part of most economists, and crude demagoguery on the part ofcertain politicians. The issue is the function of wealth in an industrialeconomy.Most people seem to believe that wealth is primarily an object ofconsumption—that the rich spend all or most of their money on personal luxury.Even if this were true, it would be their inalienable right—but it does nothappen to be true. The percentage of income which men spend on consumptionstands in inverse ratio to the amount of their wealth. The percentage which therich spend on personal consumption is so small that it is of no significance toa country’s economy. The money of the rich is invested in production; it is anindispensable part of the stock seed that makes production possible.Even the most primitive forms of production require an investment of time andsustenance (i.e., of unconsumed goods) to enable men to produce. The higher asociety’s industrial development, the more expensive the tools required to putmen to work (and the greater the productivity of their labor). Some years ago,it took an investment of five thousand dollars per worker to create jobs inindustry; I have no exact figures for the present time, but the investment isnow much higher. Deferred consumption (i.e., savings) on a gigantic scale isrequired to keep industrial production going. Savings pay for machines whichenable men to produce in a day an amount of goods they would not be able toproduce by hand in a year (if at all). This enables the workers in turn to deferconsumption and to save some of their income for their future needs or goals.The hallmark of an industrial society is its members’ distance from ahand-to-mouth mode of living; the greater this distance, the greater men’sprogress.The major part of this country’s stock seed is not the fortunes of the rich (whoare a small minority), but the savings of the middle class—i.e., of responsiblemen who have the ability to grasp the concept “future” and to deposit one dollar(or more) into a bank account. A man of this type saves money for his ownfuture, but the bank invests his money in productive enterprises; thus, thegoods he did not consume today are available to him when he needs themtomorrow—and, in the meantime, these goods serve as fuel for the country’sproductive process.Except for short periods of unforeseeable emergency, a rational person cannotstand living hand-to-mouth. No matter what his income, he saves some part of it,large or small—because he knows that his life is not confined to the immediatemoment, that he has to plan ahead, and that savings are his means of controlover his life: savings are his badge of independence and his door to thefuture—if he is to have a future.Project fully and concretely what a hand-to-mouth existence would be like.Assume that you have a job which takes care of your immediate physical needs(food, clothing, and shelter), but nothing more: you consume everything youearn. Without the possibility of saving, you would live in a state of chronicterror; terror of losing your job and terror of sudden illness. (Never mindunemployment insurance and Medicaid: insurance is a form of saving, andcompulsory savings leave you at the mercy of the government.) Could you look fora better job? No—because you have no reserves to carry you a single day. Couldyou go to school to learn a new skill? No—because this takes savings. Could youplan to buy a car? No—this takes savings. Could you plan to buy a home of yourown? No—this takes an enormous amount of savings over a long period of time.Could you plan an unusual vacation, such as a trip to Europe? No, nor any kindof vacation—a vacation takes savings. Could you go to a movie, a theater, aconcert? No—this takes savings. Could you buy a book, a phonograph record, aprint for your bare walls? No—these take savings. If you have a family, couldyou send your children through college? No—this takes a small fortune insavings. If you are single, could you get married? No—you have no way toincrease your income. If you are an aspiring young writer or artist, could youhold a job, and skimp and go hungry and deny yourself everything—in order to buytime to write or paint? Forget it.Would you care to go on living in such conditions? Since you are a person ableto read, the answer is: No. Yet this is the state to which today’s intellectualleaders (who are led by the egalitarians) wish to reduce you.There is an old saying: “Time is money,” which is true enough in an efficient,productive, free society. Today, the urgent thing to realize is that money istime. Money is the goods which you produced, but did not consume; what yourdeferred consumption buys for you is time to achieve your goals. Bear this inmind when you consider what inflation is doing to your savings.Let us suppose that you have $1,000 in a savings account. If the [1974] rate ofinflation is ten percent (it is actually higher), you lose $100 a year—thegovernment is robbing you of that amount, as surely as if it took the bills outof your pocket. Are you permitted to write that loss off on your tax return?No—the government is pretending that the loss did not occur. But the bank paysyou, say, 5 percent interest, i.e., $50 a year—does this make up for half ofyour loss? No—because the government regards bank interest as “unearned income,”and taxes you on it (the amount of the tax depends on your income bracket). Arethere any public voices—in this age of “social conscience” —protesting againstso vicious an injustice? No.“Stripped of its academic jargon, the welfare state is nothing more than amechanism by which governments confiscate the wealth of the productive membersof a society to support a wide variety of welfare schemes.” [Alan Greenspan,“Gold and Economic Freedom,” in my book Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal] The majorpart of this country’s wealth belongs to the middle class. The middle class isthe heart, the lifeblood, the energy source of a free, industrial economy, i.e.,of capitalism; it did not and cannot exist under any other system; it is theproduct of upward mobility, incompatible with frozen social castes. Do not ask,therefore, for whom the bell of inflation is tolling; it tolls for you. It isnot at the destruction of a handful of the rich that inflation is aimed (therich are mostly in the vanguard of the destroyers), but at the middle class. Itis the middle class that was wiped out in the German inflation, and thecannibalistic society that permitted it to happen got what it deserved: Hitler.Inflation is a symptom of the terminal stage of that social disease which is amixed economy. A mixed economy (as I have said many, many times) is an invalid,unstable, unworkable system which leads to one of two endings: either a returnto freedom or a collapse into dictatorship. In the face of an approachingdisaster, what is the attitude of most of our public leaders? Politics as usual,evasion as usual, moral cowardice as usual.In view of what they hear from the experts, the people cannot be blamed fortheir ignorance and their helpless confusion. If an average housewife struggleswith her incomprehensibly shrinking budget and sees a tycoon in a resplendentlimousine, she might well think that just one of his diamond cuff links wouldsolve all her problems. She has no way of knowing that if all the personalluxuries of all the tycoons were expropriated, it would not feed her family—andmillions of other, similar families—for one week; and that the entire countrywould starve on the first morning of the week to follow. (This is what happenedin Chile.) How would she know it if all the voices she hears are telling herthat we must soak the rich?No one tells her that higher taxes imposed on the rich (and the semi-rich) willnot come out of their consumption expenditures, but out of their investmentcapital (i.e., their savings); that such taxes will mean less investment, i.e.,less production, fewer jobs, higher prices for scarcer goods; and that by thetime the rich have to lower their standard of living, hers will be gone, alongwith her savings and her husband’s job—and no power in the world (no economicpower) will be able to revive the dead industries (there will be no such powerleft).Since the men who know it keep silent, they leave the field open to swarms ofpolitical demagogues, who cash in on that housewife’s despair and bewilderment.They provide her with a scapegoat, the usual one, the easiest to set up: thebusinessman. When she hears denunciations of “windfall” profits (or “exorbitant”profits, or “unfair” profits), she does not know how to determine what thismeans, what the size of profits “should” be—and she does not suspect that thedemagogues do not know it, either (because no one can determine it, except thefree market). It merely confirms her consumption-oriented view of wealth andsuggests that she is the victim of somebody’s “greed”—which nurtures her ugliestemotions. No one tells her that the businessmen’s profits are the onlyprotection of her home, her family, her life—and that if the erosion of profitswere to force businessmen out of production altogether, the only alternativewould be a “nonprofit” industry run by the government; what this would mean tothe people has been demonstrated amply and conclusively in Soviet Russia.These are the things which the public urgently needs to know today, but is notbeing told. The better kinds of politicians do not indulge in business-baitingdemagoguery, but they do not fight it; they are afraid to fight it; they merelystruggle to appease the demagogues. So do most economists and most businessmen.What do they all fear?The televised summit conference on inflation gave a clue to the answer. Itpresented a sorry spectacle of this country’s intellectual leadership—and astartling dramatization of the fundamental problem: today’s inverted moralpriorities.The representatives of the men who are of greatest importance to this country’sproduction and are most needed today—the businessmen—were quiet, earnest,undemanding, and concerned (a little too selflessly) with the state of theeconomy as a whole.The representatives of the men next in importance to production—organizedlabor—were louder and more self-assertive; but, with the exception of a fewdemagogues, they assumed the responsibility of concern with national problems.The representatives of the men who contribute nothing—the welfare recipients,the professional consumerists, the nonproducers, the objects of publiccharity—were the loudest, the most aggressive, the most self-righteouslyarrogant and hostile. They made demands, displaying the kind of conventional“selfishness” —the greedy, grasping, grabbing kind—which is usually ascribed toa rich magnate in leftist cartoons. They shouted, screamed, hissed accusationsand commands in the tone of conquerors delivering ultimatums to their cowed,vanquished serfs. Their message, in effect, was that the needs of thenonproducers are a first mortgage on the nation and must be met regardless ofwhat happens to the rest of the country. How? They scorned the necessity tothink of an answer. The answer was loudly implicit in their manner: Somehow.Acting as if need conferred on their clients a special privilege supersedingreality—as if the needy had rights denied to the rest of mankind—they flauntedthe consumption-oriented, range-of-the-moment, hand-to-mouth mentality that seeseconomics in terms of hunger, not of production, seeks “fairness” in terms ofequalizing the hunger, and stands ready to devour the rest of the country (thiscountry, where—according to their own leaders—poverty is not absolute, but“relative”).Nobody (with a very few exceptions) answered them or protested at thatconference. Why did the reputable politicians, the economists, the businessmenkeep silent in the face of outrageous abuse? Why did they allow the deadly,illiterate nonsense to proliferate without opposition? Why did they listenrespectfully, apologetically, “compassionately,” and promise more help toegalitarian savages? There is only one power that could paralyze the country’sleaders, a power more potent than the power of money, of professional knowledge,even of political force: the power of morality. This was what the invertedmorality of altruism accomplished, this was the kind of moral cowardice,intellectual disintegration, professional dishonesty, and patriotic default itled to in practice, at a time of national emergency.There is a group of economists who deserved it: the so-called “conservatives”who claim that economics has nothing to do with morality."},{"pageContent":"28Hunger and Freedomby Ayn RandThis article, a follow-up to “The Inverted Moral Priorities,” was published inthe next issue of The Ayn Rand Letter, dated July 29, 1974; again, it waswritten several months later than this date.I hope that my [recent articles] have helped you to see the cannibalistic natureof altruism in action and the extent to which it is devouring this country. Butyou have not yet heard the whole story.At a time like the present—when this country is threatened with economiccollapse under the burden of supporting millions of nonproductive citizens, andthe heavier burden of the parasites-on-parasitism: the welfare-statebureaucracy—a new campaign is being sneaked up on us, softly, tentatively, butinsistently: a campaign to load us with the responsibility of feeding the wholeworld.No, that campaign does not mean it symbolically or allegorically ororatorically, or in the form of aspirational mush—but literally, officially,permanently, by law and by force. (I do not know which is more evil in thiscontext: those who believe that that mush is an idealistic aspiration or thosewho cash in on it. I am inclined to say: the former.)An interesting trial balloon was sent up in a column by Anthony Lewis, entitled“The Politics of Hunger” (The New York Times, October 24, 1974). It isparticularly interesting (and revealing) in its implications, which thecolumnist, apparently, did not see and does not consider.In its own journalistic terms, the column is honestly factual: it presents theproblem clearly and offers no solution (except in murky hints). It starts with:“On the current trends of population and food production, according tointernational experts, by 1985 the poor countries of the world would need 85million tons of grain a year from outside. In a year of bad harvests, the needcould be 100 million tons, or even more.” And: “Before the problem of movingthat much food, there are the questions of how to grow it and pay for it. Attoday’s prices, 100 million tons of cereals would cost something approaching $20billion. Haiti and Bangladesh and the thirty other food-short countries will nothave the foreign exchange to pay for it. Who will?” This, properly, is the firstquestion to ask. (The column does not answer it.)That is the scale of the issues facing the World Food Conference in Romestarting Nov. 5. Public discussion of the food problem understandably tends tofocus on immediate matters, such as the amount of American aid to hold offimminent mass starvation in South Asia. But the conference is meant to take alonger view, and that means dealing with the most fundamental issues ofpopulation , resources and the wealth of nations. [Emphasis added.]It sure does. (No such issues were raised at that conference.) Mr. Lewis indicates, “State Department officials preparing for the conferenceseem modestly hopeful of agreed progress in defining the problems”—and listssome of the points they “sketch.” One such point reads: “There must beintensified international efforts to increase food production in the lessdeveloped countries, for example by scientific improvements in tropicalagriculture.”“Scientific improvement” means technology. How would they reconcile it with theworldwide assault on science and technology by ecological crusaders, who demanda return to “unspoiled” nature? Those starving populations are certainly livingin the midst of “unspoiled,” untouched nature. Which fundamental goal are theworld-planners going to pursue: production or ecology? And how will thescientists function in countries where science is banned, reason is a hatedenemy, and the crudest mystic superstitions rule the people’s lives, traditions,and rudimentary culture? What self-respecting scientist would want to work insuch conditions—and why should he? Neither the column nor, I am sure, the StateDepartment answers any of these questions.The paragraph continues: “But for the foreseeable future there will bedependence on imports from a handful of surplus countries, primarily the U.S.,Canada, Australia, Argentina, and the Common Market.” Ask yourself: What dothese countries (with one exception) have in common? Two paragraphs later, Mr.Lewis says that the American delegates expect another conference after the onein Rome, “a negotiating conference among the major grain-exporting countries andthe big consistent importers: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Japan, the SovietUnion, and China.” What do these countries (also with one exception) have incommon?The column offers some vague hints about someone’s proposal to establish worldgrain reserves, and to agree on “who should contribute how much ... in whatwould amount to an international system of national reserves.” (?) There is evenan indication of what is the immediate, “practical” goal behind that foodconference and what sort of deadly game is being played. “Secretary Kissinger issaid by his associates to see the food issue now as a crucial example of the newinterdependence of nations.”The game, apparently, is to trick the Arabs into some sort of One-World EconomicOrder which would enable us to barter our grain for their oil (if they don’toutsmart us). And this is the sort of lofty purpose for which somebody iswilling to sell America’s soul, her sovereignty, her freedom, and your standardof living. The alleged justification is global need, compassion, altruism. Topragmatists of this kind, altruism is the window dressing, the bait that luresthe victims to slaughter.(This is an interesting example of today’s alliance between the “practical” menand the intellectuals—an alliance based on mutual contempt, with each sidebelieving that it is using the other. The “practical” men are willing to adoptany currently fashionable ideology in exchange for some material advantage ofthe moment. The intellectuals are willing to support any “practical” policy thatleads toward their own long-range ideological goals. In this case, the“practical” men want oil; the intellectuals want One World.)Mr. Lewis seems to see a little further than the “practical” diplomats. He seemsto take altruism seriously—and he is pressing for the logical consequences ofsuch international schemes. His concluding paragraph states:All of the thought on reserve mechanisms, hard as it is, only touches thesurface of the world food problem. Underneath there is the question of money—theneed for the less developed countries to have enough of it so the U.S. andothers can go all-out in food production for them. Aid can hardly make a dent inthat need. In the long run there must be real transfers of purchasing power, andthat in turn raises the whole question of the oil producers and theirresponsibility as well as ours. [Emphasis added.]And this in turn raises the whole question of what is purchasing power andwhether it can be “transferred.”In my [article in Philosophy: Who Needs It] on “Egalitarianism and Inflation,” Isaid that money cannot function as money, i.e., as a medium of exchange, unlessit is backed by actual, unconsumed goods. Mr. Lewis’s last paragraph is a nicebit of evidence to support my contention. If money does not have to be backed bygoods, why do the less developed countries need it so badly? Why can’t theirgovernments print more paper currency? Why are the U.S. and others unable to goall-out in food production, without receiving any payment for it? Why doesn’tthe need—the desperate need—of the consumers endow them with purchasing power?Obviously, purchasing power is an attribute of producers, not of consumers.Purchasing power is a consequence of production: it is the power of possessinggoods which one can trade for other goods. A “purchase” is an exchange of goods(or services) for goods (or services). Any other form of transferring goods fromone person to another may belong to many different categories of transactions,but it is not a purchase. It may be a gift, a loan, an inheritance, a handout, afraud, a theft, a robbery, a burglary, an expropriation. In regard to services,however (omitting temporary or occasional acts of friendship, in which thepayment is the friend’s value), there is only one alternative to trading: unpaidservices, i.e., slavery.How can you “transfer purchasing power” to people who are unwilling or unable toproduce? You can transfer your goods to them without payment—by means of one ofthe transactions listed above—but if you then receive from them the goods whichyou produced, in payment for the goods which you are now producing, this cannotbe designated as a “purchase” even by the sloppiest of today’s linguistic usage.And even if we all agreed so to designate it, how long would we be able tocontinue producing under a system of that kind? How would we accumulate thestock seed of production, i.e., unconsumed goods?If you are sick (as I am) of hearing such accusations as “Americans representonly 6 percent of the world population, but consume 54 percent of its naturalresources,” ask the accusers: “How can 6 percent of the world population feed 94percent of it?” (This is the ultimate intention of all international-feedingschemes.)But the real question goes deeper than that. The real question lies in those“most fundamental issues of population, resources, and the wealth of nations”which Mr. Lewis mentioned, but did not discuss. Why are some nations wealthy andothers not? Why do some nations produce abundance and others starve? The answer,strangely enough, is contained (implicitly) in Mr. Lewis’s column—and one cansee it, without any further research, if one accepts his facts as facts (whichthey are).Let us go back to the two groups of countries he lists. The “handful of [grain]surplus countries [are] primarily the U.S., Canada, Australia, Argentina, andthe Common Market.” The “big consistent [grain] importers [are] India, Pakistan,Bangladesh, Japan, the Soviet Union, and China.” The surplus countries aresemi-free economies, with a century of greater freedom behind them and, invarious degrees, some traditional remnants and memories of freedom. (Theexception is Argentina, a semi-dictatorship in bad economic shape, buttraditionally an agricultural country.) The grain importers, which live under achronic threat of hunger, are socialist and communist dictatorships. (Theexception is Japan, which, however, has never been a free country, and which isgeographically unable to develop its agriculture to any significant extent.)The relevance of two of Mr. Lewis’s “fundamental issues” breaks down in thelight of his own lists. “Population” and “resources” do not determine “thewealth of nations.” The countries of Europe’s Common Market are as denselypopulated as most of the countries on the hunger list. Russia has greaternatural resources than the U.S., but they are untouched and unused.It is the presence of Russia on the hunger list that blasts all modern economictheories out of the realm of serious consideration. Under the inept governmentof the czars and with the most primitive methods of agriculture, Russia was amajor grain exporter. The unusually fertile soil of the Ukraine alone was (andis) capable of feeding the entire world. Whatever natural conditions arerequired for growing wheat, Russia had (and has) them in overabundance. ThatRussia should now be on a list of hungry, wheat-begging importers is the mostdamning indictment of a collectivist economy that reality can offer us.The simple, metaphysical fact—which no man-made wishes or edicts can alter—isthat individual freedom is the precondition of human productivity and,therefore, of abundance, and, therefore, of the wealth of nations. The historyof mankind bears witness to this fact—particularly, the prosperity explosion ofthe nineteenth century (the century dominated by capitalism), as against themillennia of stagnant misery under every variant of “democratically” orautocratically controlled economy.(If you hear it said that that prosperity was caused by an abundance of naturalresources, which are now exhausted, remember that similar allegations and direwarnings were voiced by statists from the beginning of the IndustrialRevolution, and that they were prompted by the same motives. Furthermore, at theturn of this century, there were voices claiming that all possible forms ofindustrial production had been discovered and we could expect nothing butgeneral decline. This was said before the invention of the electric light bulb,the automobile, the airplane, the telephone, the telegraph, the movies, radio,television, atomic motors, spaceships, etc.)The simple, metaphysical fact is that man by nature is not equipped to survive“in nature.” His mind is his basic tool of survival, and his mind creates threelife-supporting achievements: science, technology, industrial production.Without these, he cannot wrest sufficient sustenance from nature to fill hisimmediate, physical needs. In the pre-industrial era, population control wasaccomplished by starvation: a periodic famine, every twenty years, wiped out thesurplus population, which the hand plows and hand looms of Europe were unable tofeed. The famines were assisted by periodic wars, which tribal rulers waged inorder to loot one another’s precarious sustenance. The famines (and the worldwars) stopped with the coming of the Industrial Revolution—and, in thenineteenth century, the population of Europe rose by over three hundred percent.Today, as freedom vanishes from an ever larger area of the globe, famine iscoming back—mass famine killing off the millions of human beings whom controlledeconomies are unable to feed.In the face of a spectacle of this kind, what are we to think of those allegedhumanitarians who plead with us for help and compassion, screaming that thehorror of mass starvation supersedes all selfish political concerns? Does it?If a self-respecting American industrialist were to declare that he cannot andwill not help the starving because his productive capacity is not unlimited andhe has no desire to descend to a Haitian’s standard of living—it is easy toimagine the howls of indignation we would hear from today’s intellectuals. Whyare they practicing a double standard? Why do they scream that the needs of thehungry supersede our lives, freedom, future, and all values—except their hatredof capitalism? Why do they ask us to sacrifice everything—while they refuse tosacrifice their power lust or their mental lethargy long enough to discover thecure, the only cure, of global starvation?While you consider these questions, consider also the following facts:contemporary history has demonstrated that the lives of the people, of the broadmasses, have not been improved under any collectivist system, but have beenreduced to hopeless misery. But there have been profiteers under every suchsystem: the ruling bureaucracy—the parasites-on-parasitism—the wretched handfulof pretentious mediocrities who, unable to compete on a free market, extort anunearned “prestige” and a luxurious living from “the sores of the poor and theblood of the rich.”These are the men who would let mankind starve, but will not relinquish theirpower—these are the men to whom the world is being sacrificed—these, not thepoor brutes of Russia, China, or India who are perishing because the last oftheir meager earnings has been plundered to support the nuclear armaments oftheir rulers.It is to these rulers that we are now asked to sacrifice the last, best hope onearth: the United States of America.Such is the nature of altruism."},{"pageContent":"29How Not to Fight Against Socialized Medicineby Ayn RandIn the spring of 1962, some two hundred New Jersey doctors, led by Dr. J. BruceHenriksen, signed a resolution of protest against the Kennedy Administration’sKing-Anderson bill, which was the precursor of President Johnson’s Medicareprogram. The doctors stated that they would treat the indigent aged withoutcharge, but would not treat anyone whose medical care was financed under theKennedy plan. The King-Anderson bill was soon afterwards defeated in Congress.The following is a condensed version of a talk delivered on February 6, 1963 ata meeting of the Ocean County Medical Society of New Jersey, to which Dr.Henriksen and his group belonged. These remarks were published in TheObjectivist Newsletter, March 1963.I am happy to have this opportunity to express my admiration for Dr. Henriksenand the group of doctors who signed his resolution.Dr. Henriksen and his group took a heroic stand. The storm of viciousdenunciations unleashed against them at the time showed that they had delivereda dangerous blow to the welfare-statists. More than any other single factor, itwas Dr. Henriksen’s group that demonstrated to the public the real nature of theissue, prevented the passage of the King-Anderson bill and saved this countryfrom socialized medicine—so far.Their action was an eloquent example of the fact that only a strong,uncompromising stand—a stand of moral self-confidence, on clear-cut, consistentprinciples—can win.But there are grave danger signs that the medical profession as a whole—iikeevery other group today—will ignore that example and pursue the usual modernpolicy of caution and compromise. Such a policy is worse than futile: it assistsand promotes the victory of one’s own enemies. The battle is not over. TheKing-Anderson bill will be brought up again, and if the doctors are defeated,they will be defeated by their own hand, or rather: by their own mind.I want, therefore, to make certain suggestions to the medical profession—on thesubject of how not to fight against socialized medicine.The majority of people in this country—and in the world—do not want to adoptsocialism; yet it is growing. It is growing because its victims concede itsbasic moral premises. Without challenging these premises, one cannot win.The strategy of the Kennedy administration, and of all welfare-statists,consists of attempts to make people accept certain intellectual “package deals,”without letting them identify and differentiate the various elements—andequivocations—involved. The deadliest of such “package deals” is the attempt tomake people accept the collectivist-altruist principle of self-immolation underthe guise of mere kindness, generosity, or charity. It is done by hammering intopeople’s minds the idea that need supersedes all rights—that the need of somemen is a first mortgage on the lives of others—and that everything should besacrificed to the undefined, undefinable grab bag known as “the publicinterest.”Doctors have no chance to win if they concede that idea and help their enemiesto propagate it.Yet the ideological policy of most spokesmen for the medical profession—such asthe A.M.A.—is as permeated by the collectivist-altruist spirit as thepronouncements of the welfare-statists. The doctors’ spokesmen declare, in neteffect, that selfless service to their patients is the doctors’ only goal, thatconcern for the needy is their only motive, and that “the public interest” isthe only justification of their battle.The sole difference is this: the voices of the welfare-statists are brazenly,self-righteously overbearing—while the voices of the doctors’ spokesmen areguiltily, evasively apologetic.Whom can one expect the people to believe and to follow?People can always sense guilt, insincerity, hypocrisy. The lack of a morallyrighteous tone, the absence of moral certainty, have a disastrous effect on anaudience—an effect which is not improved by the triviality of the arguments overpolitical minutiae. And the terrible thing is that the doctors’ spokesmen givean impression of guilty evasiveness while the right is on their side. They do itby being afraid to assert their rights.They are afraid of it because they do not believe that they possess anyrights—because they have conceded the enemy’s premises—because they have nomoral base, no intellectual guide lines, no ideology, no defense.Consider, for instance, the outcome of the Canadian doctors’ struggle inSaskatchewan. The doctors had gone on strike [in 1962] against the full-scalesocialized medicine instituted by the provincial government. They won thebattle—and lost the war; in exchange for a few superficial concessions, theysurrendered the principle for which they had been fighting: to permit nosocialized medicine in the Western hemisphere.They surrendered even though the overwhelming sympathy and support of theCanadian people were on their side (except for the intellectuals and the laborunions). They were defeated not by the power of the socialists, but by thegaping holes in their own ideological armor.They had been fighting, properly, in the name of individual rights, against theenslavement of medicine by totalitarian-statist controls. Then, under thepressure of the usual intellectual lynching, under the hysterical, collectivistcharges of “antisocial selfishness and greed,” they made a shocking change intheir stand. Declaring, in effect, that their rebellion was not directed againstsocialized medicine as such, but against the high-handed, arbitrary manner inwhich the government had put it over, their spokesmen began to argue that thegovernment plan did not represent “the will of the people.” The ideological kissof death was a statement by Dr. Dalgleish, the strikers’ leader, who declaredthat if a plebiscite were taken and the people voted for it, the doctors wouldaccept socialized medicine.Could they deserve to win after that? They could not and did not.Consider the full meaning of Dr. Dalgleish’s statement. It meant the totalrepudiation of individual rights and the acceptance of unlimited majority rule,of the collectivist doctrine that the people’s vote may dispose of an individualin any way it pleases. Instead of a battle for the integrity of a doctor’sprofessional judgment and practice, it became a battle over who should violatehis integrity. Instead of a battle against the enslavement of medicine, itbecame a battle over who should enslave it. Instead of a battle for freedom, itbecame a battle over a choice of masters. Instead of a moral crusade, it becamea petty quarrel over political technicalities.This led to the ludicrous spectacle of the alleged individualists arguing fordemocratic mob rule, and the socialists righteously upholding the parliamentaryform of government.Those who doubt the power of ideas should note the fact that the doctors’surrender took place five days after Dr. Dalgleish’s statement.The text of the agreement reached between the doctors and the governmentcontained the following horrifying sentence: “The doctors fear that if thegovernment becomes their only source of income they are in danger of becomingservants of the state and not servants of their patients.” [Emphasis added.]A more abject statement of self-abnegation could not be hoped for or extorted bythe most extreme collectivist.No self-respecting labor union would declare that its members are “servants” oftheir employers. It took so-called “conservatives” to declare that professionalmen—and of so responsible, so demanding, so unusually skilled a profession asmedicine—are the “servants” of their patients or of anyone who pays them.The concept of “service” has been turned into a collectivist “package deal” bymeans of a crude equivocation and a cruder evasion. In the language ofeconomics, the word “service” means work offered for trade on a free market, tobe paid for by those who choose to buy it. In a free society, men deal with oneanother by voluntary, uncoerced exchange, by mutual consent to mutual profit,each man pursuing his own rational self-interest, none sacrificing himself orothers; and all values—whether goods or services—are traded, not given away.This is the opposite of what the word “service” means in the language ofaltruist ethics: to an altruist, “service” means unrewarded, self-sacrificial,unilateral giving, while receiving nothing in return. It is this sort ofselfless “service” to “society” that collectivists demand of all men.One of the grotesque phenomena of the twentieth century is the fact that the“package deal” of “service” is most vociferously propagated by the“conservatives.” Intellectually bankrupt, possessing no political philosophy, nodirection, no goal, but clinging desperately to the ethics of altruism, such“conservatives” rest their case on a cheap equivocation: they proclaim that“service” to others (to one’s customers or clients or patients or “consumers” ingeneral) is the motive power and the moral justification of a free society—andevade the question of whether such “services” are or are not to be paid for.But if “service” to the “consumers” is our primary goal, why should thesemasters pay us or grant us any rights? Why shouldn’t they dictate the terms andconditions of our work?If socialized medicine comes to the United States, it is such “conservatives”that the doctors would have to thank for it, as well as their own spokesmen whorecklessly play with an intellectual poison of that kind.Doctors are not the servants of their patients. No free man is a “servant” ofthose he deals with. Doctors are traders, like everyone else in a freesociety—and they should bear that title proudly, considering the crucialimportance of the services they offer.The pursuit of his own productive career is—and, morally, should be—the primarygoal of a doctor’s work, as it is the primary goal of any self-respecting,productive man. But there is no clash of interests among rational men in a freesociety, and there is no clash of interests between doctors and patients. Inpursuing his own career, a doctor does have to do his best for the welfare ofhis patients. This relationship, however, cannot be reversed: one cannotsacrifice the doctor’s interests, desires, and freedom to whatever the patients(or their politicians) might deem to be their own “welfare.”Many doctors know this, but are afraid to assert their rights, because they darenot challenge the morality of altruism, neither in the public’s mind nor intheir own. Others are collectivists at heart, who believe that socializedmedicine is morally right and who feel guilty while opposing it. Still othersare so cynically embittered that they believe that the whole country consists offools or parasites eager to get something for nothing—that morality and justiceare futile—that ideas are impotent—that the cause of freedom is doomed—and thatthe doctors’ only chance lies in borrowing the enemy’s arguments and gaining abrief span of borrowed time.This last is usually regarded as the “practical” attitude for “conservatives.”But nobody is as naive as a cynic, and nothing is as impractical as the attemptto win by conceding the enemy’s premises. How many defeats and disasters willcollectivism’s victims have to witness before they become convinced of it?In any issue, it is the most consistent of the adversaries who wins. One cannotwin on the enemy’s premises, because he is then the more consistent, and all ofone’s efforts serve only to propagate his principles.Most people in this country are not moochers who seek the unearned, not eventoday. But if all their intellectual leaders and the doctors themselves tellthem that doctors are only their “selfless servants,” they will feel justifiedin expecting and demanding unearned services.When a politician tells them that they are entitled to the unearned, they arewise enough to suspect his motives; but when the proposed victim, the doctor,says it too, they feel that socialization is safe.If you are afraid of people’s irrationality, you will not protect yourself byassuring them that their irrational notions are right.The advocates of “Medicare” admit that their purpose is not help to the needy,the sick, or the aged. Their purpose is to spare people “the embarrassment” of ameans test—that is, to establish the principle and precedent that some peopleare entitled to the unrewarded services of others, not as charity, but as aright.Can you placate, conciliate, temporize, or compromise with a principle of thatkind?As doctors, what would you say if someone told you that you must not try to curea deadly disease—you must give it some chance—you must reach a “compromise” withcancer or with coronary thrombosis or with leprosy? You would answer that it isa battle of life or death. The same is true of your political battle.Would you follow the advice of someone who told you that you must fighttuberculosis by confining the treatment to its symptoms—that you must treat thecough, the high temperature, the loss of weight—but must refuse to consider orto touch its cause, the germs in the patient’s lungs, in order not to antagonizethe germs?Do not adopt such a course in politics. The principle—and the consequences—arethe same. It is a battle of life or death."},{"pageContent":"30Medicine: The Death of a Professionby Leonard PeikoffThis lecture was delivered at the Ford Hall Forum on April 14, 1985, more thantwenty years after Ayn Rand’s talk to the New Jersey doctors, and was publishedin The Objectivist Forum, April—June 1985. I wish to acknowledge the invaluableassistance given to me in the preparation of this lecture by my brother, Dr.Michael Peikoff, who is a surgeon in Nevada.One day, when you are out of town on a business trip, you wake up with a cough,muscle aches, chills, and a high fever. You do not know what it is, you start topanic, but you do know one action to take: you call a doctor. He conducts aphysical exam, takes a history, administers lab tests, narrows down thepossibilities; within hours, he reaches a diagnosis of pneumonia and prescribesa course of treatment, including antibiotics. Soon you begin to respond, yourelax, the crisis is over. Or: you are getting out of your car, you fall andbreak your leg. It is a disaster, but you remain calm, because you can utter onesentence to your wife: “Call the doctor.” He proceeds to examine your leg fornerve and blood-vessel injury, he takes X rays, reduces the fracture, puts on acast; the disaster has faded into a mere inconvenience, and you resume yournormal life. Or: your child comes home from school with a stabbing pain in theabdomen. There is only one hope: you call the doctor. He performs anappendectomy—the child recovers.We take all this completely for granted, as though modern drugs, modernhospitals, and modern doctors were facts of nature, which always had been thereand which always will be there. Many people today take for granted not only thesimpler kinds of medical intervention, but even the wonder cures and wondertreatments that the medical profession has painstakingly devised—like the latestradiation therapy for breast cancer, or the intricate delicacy of modern brainsurgery, or such a breathtaking achievement as the artificial-heart implantsperformed by Dr. William C. DeVries. Most of us expect that the doctors will goon accomplishing such feats routinely, steadily removing pain and thus enhancingthe quality of our life, while adding ever more years to its quantity.America’s medical system is the envy of the globe. The rich from every othercountry, when they get sick, do not head for Moscow or Stockholm or even Londonanymore; they come here. And in some way, despite the many public complaintsagainst the medical profession, we all know this fact; we know how good ourdoctors are, and how much we depend on their knowledge, skill, and dedication.Suppose you had to go on a six-month ocean voyage with no stops in port, withample provisions and sailors, but with only one additional professionrepresented on board, and you could decide which it would be. Would you ask foryour lawyer to come along? your accountant? your congressman ? Would you dareeven to ask for your favorite movie star? Or would you say: “Bring a doctor.What if something happens?” The terror of having no answer to this question isprecisely what the medical profession saves us from.I am not saying that all doctors are perfect—they are not; or that they all havea good bedside manner—they do not; or that the profession is free fromflaws—like every other group today, the medical profession has its share oferrors, deficiencies, weaknesses. But these are not my subject tonight, and theydo not alter two facts: that our doctors, whatever their failings, do give usthe highest caliber health care in world history—and that they live a gruelingexistence in order to do so.I come from a medical family, and I can tell you what a doctor’s life is like.Most of them study nonstop for years in medical school and then work nonstopuntil they die. My own father, who was a surgeon, operated daily from 7 A.M.until noon and then made hospital rounds; from 2 to 6 P.M., he held officehours. When he came home for dinner, if he did, the phone never stoppedringing—it was nurses asking instructions, or doctors discussing emergencycases, or patients presenting symptoms. When he got the chance, usually late atnight or on Sundays after rounds, he would read medical journals (or write forthem), to keep abreast of the latest research. My father was not an exception.This is how most doctors, in any branch of medicine, live, and how they work.The profession imposes not only killing hours, but also continuous tension:doctors deal all the time with crisis—with accidents, diseases, trauma,disaster, the imminence of death. Even when an ailment is not a mortal threat,the patient often fears that it is, and he must be reassured, nursed through theterror, even counseled psychologically by the physician. The pressure on thedoctor never lets up. If he wants to escape even for the space of a singledinner on the town, chances are that he cannot: he will probably get beeped andhave to rush to the emergency room just as the entrée is being served.The doctor not only has to live and work in such a pressure cooker, he has tothink all the time—clearly, objectively, scientifically. Medicine is a fieldthat requires a vast body of specialized theoretical knowledge; to apply itproperly to particular cases, the doctor must regularly make delicate,excruciatingly complex decisions. Medical treatment is not usually acut-and-dried affair, involving a simple, self-evident course of action; itrequires the balancing of countless variables; it requires clinical judgment.And the doctor must not only exercise such judgment—he must do it fast;typically, he has to act now. He cannot petition the court or his client or anyemployer for a postponement. He faces daily, hourly, the merciless timetable ofnature itself.What I personally admire most about doctors is the fact that they live this kindof life not out of any desire for altruistic self-sacrifice, but selfishly—whichis the only thing that enables them to survive it. They love the field, most ofthem; they find the work a fascinating challenge in applied science. They areproud men, most of them, with an earned pride in their ability to observe,evaluate, act, cure. And, to their credit, they expect to be rewarded materiallyfor their skill; they want to make a good living, which is the least men canoffer them in payment for their achievements. They make that living, as a rule,by standing on their own, not as cogs in some faceless, government-subsidizedenterprise, but as entrepreneurs in private practice. The doctors are among thelast of the capitalist breed left in this country. They are among the last ofthe individualists that once populated this great nation.If I knew nothing about today’s world but the nature of our politicians and thephilosophy represented by the medical profession, I would predict an inevitable,catastrophic clash between the two: between the government and the doctors. Onpurely theoretical grounds, I would predict the destruction of the doctors bythe government, which in every field now protects and rewards the exact oppositeof thought, effort, and achievement.This catastrophe is actually taking place. It will affect your future as well asthat of the doctors.To understand what is happening in medicine today, we must go back to thebeginning, which in this case is 1965, the year when Medicare and Medicaid werefinally pushed through Congress by Lyndon Johnson. Medicare covers most of themedical expenses of those over sixty-five, whatever their income. Medicaid is asupplemental program for the poor of any age.Those of us who opposed the Johnson plan argued at the time that governmentintervention in medicine is immoral in principle and would be disastrous inpractice. No man, we claimed, has a right to medical care; if he cannot pay forwhat he needs, then he must depend on voluntary charity. Government financing ofmedical expenses, we argued, even if it is for only a fraction of thepopulation, necessarily means eventual enslavement of the doctors and, as aresult, a profound deterioration in the quality of medical care for everyone,including the aged and the poor.The proponents of Medicare were unmoved by any arguments. Altruistic service tothe needy, they said, is man’s duty. It is degrading, they said, for the elderlyto be dependent on private charity; a “means test” is incompatible with humandignity. Besides, they added, the government would not dream of asking for anycontrol over the doctors or over their methods of patient care. All we want thestate to do, they said, is pay the bills.It is now twenty years later. Let us look at what actually happened.The first result of the new programs should have been self-evident. Suppose weapply the same principle to nutrition. Suppose President Johnson had said: “Itis unfair for you to have to pay for your own food and restaurant bills. Menhave a right to eat. Washington, therefore, will pick up the tab.” Can youproject the results? Can you imagine the eating binges, the sudden mania fordining out, the soaring demand for baked peacock tongues and other gourmetdelicacies? Do you see Lutèce and the “21” Club becoming nationally franchisedand starting to outdraw McDonald’s? Why not? The eaters do not have to pay forit. And the food industry, including its most sincere members, is ecstatic; nowthat the money is pouring from Washington into the grocery chains and therestaurants, they can give every customer the kind of luxury treatment oncereserved for millionaires. Everybody is happy—except that expenditure on foodbecomes so great a percentage of our GNP, and the drain on the federal treasurybecomes so ominous, that every other industry starts to protest and soon eventhe bureaucrats begin to panic.This is what happened to medical spending in the United States. The patientscovered by the new programs no longer had to pay much attention to cost—that wasthe whole purpose of the programs. And the health-care professionals at firstwere generally delighted. Now, many of them felt, the sky is the limit, and theyproceeded to build hospitals, purchase equipment, and administer testsaccordingly. Medical expenditures in the U.S. were 4.3% of GNP in 1952; todaythey are about 11% and still rising. Medicare expenditures doubled from 1974 to1979, doubled again by 1984, and are expected to double again by 1991, at whichtime, according to current estimates, the Medicare program will be bankrupt.Something, the government recognized, has to be done; we are going broke becauseof the insatiable demand for medical care.The government did not decide to cancel its programs and return to a free marketin medicine—when are disastrous government programs ever canceled? Instead, itdid what governments always do: it decided to keep the programs but impose rigidcontrols on them. The first step was a campaign to force hospitals not to spendmuch on Medicare patients, no matter what the effects on the health of thosepatients.We will no longer, officials said, pay hospitals a fee for each service theyrender a Medicare patient. That method of payment, they said, simply encouragesspending. Instead, we will pay according to a new principle, DRGs. DRGsrepresent the first major assault by the government against the doctors andtheir patients. It is not yet the strangulation of the medical profession. Butit is the official dropping of the noose around their necks.DRG means “diagnosis-related group.” According to this approach, the governmenthas divided all ailments into 468 possible diagnoses, and has set in advance afixed, arbitrary fee for each: it will pay a hospital only what it claims is theaverage cost of the ailment. For example, for a Medicare patient in the WesternMountain region who is admitted to a hospital with a heart attack and finallyrecovers enough to go home, the government now pays the hospital exactly$5,094—no more and no less. And it pays this amount no matter what the hospitaldoes for the patient, no matter how long his stay or how short, no matter howmany services he requires or how few. If the patient costs the hospital morethan the government payment, the hospital loses money on him. If he costs less,the hospital makes a profit.Here is a fictional story now in process of becoming reality around the country.A man suffering from severe chest pains is taken by ambulance to the hospital.He receives certain standard tests, including a cardiogram, then is moved to theIntensive Care Unit, where his vital signs are continuously monitored. Hisdoctor thinks that in this instance a further test, an angiogram, is urgentlyindicated; this test would outline the arteries of the heart and indicate if oneis about to close off, an event that could be fatal. The hospital administratorprotests: “An angiogram is expensive. It costs up to $1,000, about 20% of ourtotal fee for this man, and who knows what else he’s still going to cost us? Youcan’t prove this test is necessary. Let’s wait and see.” The test is not given.Maybe the patient lives, maybe not. Several days later, the administrator comesto the doctor: “You’ve got to get this man out of the ICU. It’s costing almost$800 per day, and he’s been here now for five days. What with everything else,we’ve already spent almost the whole payment we get for him.” The doctor thinksthat the patient still desperately needs the specialized nursing available onlyin the ICU. The administrator overrules him. “There’s an area of judgment here,”he says. “We’ll just have to take a bit of a chance on this case.”Or: the doctor decides that the patient is an excellent candidate for remedialheart surgery. A bypass operation, he thinks, would probably prolong the man’slife considerably while relieving him of pain. But the man, after all, iselderly and the operation would involve a lengthy hospital stay. “Let’s try amore conservative treatment first,” the administrator says, “let’s give him somemedication and wait and see.” Again, maybe the patient lives, maybe not.Let us say that he lives and is moved to a bed in the regular ward. He stillfeels very weak, and the doctor does not think he is anywhere near ready to bedischarged. But the $5,094 has long since been spent, and the administratorstarts to wonder aloud: “Maybe this man could manage somehow at home. In anyevent, he’s eating us alive—get him out of here.” Maybe the patient will surviveat home, maybe not.Do you see the thrust of the system? If the hospital does relatively little forthe patient, it makes money; if it provides an extensive range of services, itloses heavily. The best case from its viewpoint is for the patient to die rightafter admission: the hospital still gets the full fee. The worst case is for himto survive with complications and require a lengthy stay—which is why somehospitals are refusing to admit patients they fear will linger on too long.I do not mean to suggest that our hospitals are now callously withholdingurgently needed treatment from Medicare patients. Today’s hospitals and doctorsdo have integrity; most are continuing to do their best for the patient. Thepoint is that they have to do it within the DRG constraints. The issue is notsimply: treat the patient or let him die. The issue is: treat him how? At whatcost? With what range of services, specialists, and equipment? With what degreeof safety or of risk? This is the area where there is enormous room foralternatives in the quality of medical treatment. And this is the area that isnow in the process of being slashed across the board for Medicare patients, thevery people singled out by the liberals in the 1960s as needing better medicalcare.To revert to our nutrition analogy: it is as though the government socializedeating out, paying restaurants only what it computed to be the average cost permeal. There would then be a powerful incentive for restaurants to cut corners inevery imaginable way—to serve only the cheapest foods in the smallest amounts inthe cheesiest settings. What do you think would happen to the nation’seaters—and its chefs—under such a setup? How long could the chefs preserve theirdedication to preparing haute cuisine, when the restaurant owners, inself-preservation, were forced to fight them at every step and to demand junkfood instead?There is now a new and deadly pressure on the doctors, which continuouslythreatens the independence and integrity of their medical judgment: the pressureto cave in to arbitrary DRG economies, while blanking out the effects on thepatient. In some places, hospitals are offering special financial incentives tothe physician whose expenditure per patient averages out to be relatively low.For example, the hospital might subsidize such a doctor’s office rent orpurchase new equipment for him. On the other hand, a doctor who insists onquality care for his Medicare patients and thereby drives up costs is likely toincur the hospital’s displeasure. In the extreme case, the doctor risks beingdenied staff privileges, which means cutting off his major source of livelihood.Thanks to DRGs, a new conflict is in the offing, just starting to take shape:the patient vs. the hospital. To put it another way, the conflict is: doctorsvs. hospitals—doctors fighting a rearguard action to maintain standards againsthospitals that are forced by the government to become cost-cutting ogres. Howwould you like to practice a profession in which half your mind is devoted tohealing the patient, while the other half is trying to appease a hospitaladministrator who himself is trying to appease some official in Washington?Medicare patients are not a small group. Because of their age, they constitute asignificant part of most doctors’ practice. Medicare patients now make up aboutfifty percent of all hospital admissions in the U.S.The defenders of DRGs answer all criticisms by saying that costs simply must becut. Even under complete capitalism, they say, doctors could not give unlimitedtreatment to every patient. This is true, but it ignores two crucial facts. (1)It is because of government programs that medical prices have soared to thepoint of being out of reach for masses of patients. This was not true in thedays of private medicine. The average American a generation ago could affordquality, in medicine as in every other area of life, without courtingbankruptcy. (2) Even if a patient could not afford it, at least, in thepre-welfare-state era, he was told the truth: as a rule, he was told about thetreatment options available, and it was up to him, in consultation with hisdoctor, to weigh the possibilities and decide how to cut costs. But under thepresent system, the hospital not only has to cut services drastically—it is toits interest to conceal this fact from the patient. If he or his family everlearns that the angiogram he is not going to have, or the heart surgery, wouldmake all the difference to the outcome of his case, he would immediatelyprotest, insist on the service, even threaten to launch a malpractice suit. Thesystem is rigged to squeezing every drop of quality out of medical care, so longas the patient does not understand what is happening. The patient does not knowmedicine; he relies on the doctor’s integrity to tell him what services areavailable and necessary in his case—yet, increasingly, the hospitals must try tobatter down that integrity. They must try to make the doctor keep silent and nottell the patient the full truth.The Medicare patient is no longer a free man to be accorded dignity and respect,but a puppet on the dole, to be manipulated accordingly—while the doctor isbeing transformed from a sovereign professional into a mere appendage andaccessory, a helpless tool in a government-orchestrated campaign of shoddyquality and deception.The government’s takeover of medical practice is not confined to publicpatients; it is starting to extend into the private sector as well. This bringsme to the HMOs, which are now mushrooming all over the country.HMO means “health-maintenance organization.” It could also have been called BBM,for “bargain-basement medicine.” In this setup, a group of doctors, perhaps withtheir own hospital, offers prepaid, all-inclusive medical care at a cheap rate.For a fixed payment in advance, a payment substantially less than a regulardoctor would charge, the patient is guaranteed virtually complete coverage ofhis medical costs, no matter what they are. The principle here is the same asthat of the DRG system: if the patient’s costs exceed his payment, the HMO losesmoney on him; if not, it makes a profit.Although HMOs are privately owned, the spread of these organizations is whollycaused by government. There were very few HMOs in the days of private medicine.As part of the government’s campaign to lower the cost of medical care, however,Washington has decided to throw its immense weight behind HMOs, even going sofar as to advertise nationally on their behalf and to give them direct financialsubsidies.Hew do HMOs achieve their low rates? In essence, by the DRG method—the method ofcurtailing services. In this case, however, the cuts in quality are moresweeping, inasmuch as the HMO embraces every aspect of medical care, not merelyhospital costs. As a rule, HMO doctors do not have personal patients, nor doesthe patient have a choice of doctors or even necessarily see the same onetwice—that is too expensive. The patient sees whoever is on duty when he showsup; the doctor gives up the luxury of following a case from beginning to end.Nor does the doctor have much time to spend with a given patient—HMOs aregenerally understaffed to save money; typically, there are long waiting lines ofpatients. Further, the doctor must obtain prior authorization of any significantexpenditure from a highly cost-conscious administrator. The doctor may detect apossible abdominal tumor and request a CAT scan—in effect, an exquisitelydetailed, 3-D X ray. But if the administrator says to him: “It costs a lot. Idon’t think it’s necessary,” the doctor is helpless. Or he may find that thepatient has an aneurysm, a weakening of an artery that is like a time bombwaiting to go off, and he may want to operate to remove it. But theadministrator can reply: “These cases often go years without rupturing. Let’swait awhile.” Like the doctor under DRGs, the HMO doctor ultimately has to obey:he either keeps his costs within the dictated parameters, or he is out of work.The kind of doctor who is willing or eager to practice medicine under theseconditions represents a new breed, new at least in quantity. There is ageneration of utterly unambitious young doctors growing up today, especiallyconspicuous in the HMOs, doctors who are the opposite of the old-fashionedphysician in private practice—doctors who want to escape the responsibility ofindependent thought and judgment, and who are prepared to abandon the prospectof a large income or a private practice in order to achieve this end. Thesedoctors do not mind the forfeit of their professional autonomy to the HMOadministrator. They do not object to practicing cut-rate medicine with facelesspatients on an assembly-line basis, so long as they themselves can escape blamefor any bad results and cover their own tracks. These are the new bureaucraticdoctors, the MDs with the mentality, and the fundamental indifference to theirjob, of the typical post-office clerk.I hasten to add that there are better doctors in the HMOs (and that some HMOsare better than others). As a rule, however, these better doctors aremercilessly exploited. Being conscientious, they put in longer hours thannecessary, trying to make up for the chronic understaffing. They do not give inmeekly to arbitrary decrees on cost, but fight the administrator when they feeltheir own judgment is right. Increasingly, their professional life becomes aseries of such fights, which makes them the heavies, hard to get along with andguilty of costing the HMO money—while their lesser colleagues capitulate to thesystem, do as they are told, and take things easy. Time after time, the bettermen step in to bail out such colleagues, struggling to correct their errors,clean up their messes, rescue their patients. At a certain point, however, thebetter doctors get fed up.An HMO doctor in California, a qualified internist and a highly conscientiouswoman, told me the following story. “I was looking through a pile of cardiogramsone day,” she said, “and I saw one that was clearly abnormal. I knew that theman should be taken by ambulance to the emergency room for retesting andpossible hospitalization. Then I thought: it’s late Friday afternoon, and it’sgoing to take an hour and a half, and I’m not being paid for the extra work, andwho will know if I wait until Monday? I was tempted for a minute to drop thewhole thing and go home, but then the remnants of my conscience made me get upwearily and telephone the patient. This sort of thing,” she concluded, “happensall the time and not just to me, and often the doctor does simply look the otherway.” Do you see what happens under a system in which the doctor is penalizedfor his virtue or, at the least, is deprived of any incentive, spiritual ormaterial, including pride in his judgment and payment for his work? Would youlike your cardiogram to be in a pile on this new breed’s desk? Yours is next—allof ours are.The debased standards inherent in government medicine are now spreading to thewhole of medical practice in the United States. The new medicine is notrestricted to Medicare patients or to HMO members; it is soon going to engulfprivate doctors as well, even when they see their own private, paying patients.There are many reasons for this. The most obvious is the pressure from thehealth-insurance companies, such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Hospitals noware charging higher rates to private patients in order to recoup their lossesfrom Medicare cases. As a result, the private insurance companies are demandingthat a DRG-type system be imposed uniformly, on all patients. They want privateinsurance policies from now on to pay only according to arbitrary, preset rates,just as Medicare does now, which would put the total of medicine in thiscountry—all patients, all doctors, all ailments—into the same category as theheart-attack patient we discussed earlier. His fate would become everyone‘s, andthe standards of American medicine would simply collapse.If this demand of the insurance companies surprises you, remember that there areno truly private health-insurance companies in the U.S. today. What we have inthis field is a government-protected, government-regulated cartel. And what thecartel wants is not more freedom, but more money through government favors,including stiffer government controls over medical costs.The end of the Medicare road is complete socialized medicine.Now you can see the absurdity of the claim that state payment of medical billswill not affect the freedom of physicians or the quality of patient care. Statefunding necessarily affects and corrupts every private service. Communism, infact, is essentially nothing more than state funding. The Soviets pretty muchleave doctors and everyone else free to dream or fantasize within their ownskulls; all the government does is fund everything, i.e., take over the physicalmeans of every citizen’s existence. The enslavement of the country, and thus thecollapse of all standards, follows as a matter of course.Now let me backtrack to answer an objection. I have been maintaining that thecause of our soaring health-care costs is government funding of medical care.Many observers, however, claim that the cause is the rapid advances in medicaltechnology, such as CAT scanners or the latest, most sophisticateddisease-detecting instruments, the magnetic resonance imaging or MRI machines.These people want to limit such technology or even abolish it.Technology by itself does not drive up costs; it generally reduces costs as itimproves the quality of life. The normal pattern, exemplified by the automobileand computer industries, is that a new invention is expensive at first, so thatonly a few can afford it. But inventors and businessmen persevere, aiming forthe profits that come from a mass market. Eventually, they discover cheaper andbetter methods of production. Gradually, costs come down until the generalpopulation can afford to buy. No one is bankrupted, everyone gains.The source of today’s national bankruptcy in the field of medicine is nottechnology, but technology injected into the field by government decree, apartfrom supply and demand. State-of-the-art medical treatment—including newinventions or procedures that are still prohibitively expensive, such as livertransplants and long-term kidney dialyses—is now being financed by thegovernment for the total population in the name of egalitarianism. The result isthe unbelievable expenditures, far beyond most people’s capacity to afford,which are made routinely in our hospitals. These expenditures are particularlyevident in regard to the terminally ill, who almost always fall under theumbrella of some government-supported insurance program. It has been estimatedthat 1% of our GNP is now spent on the dying in their last weeks of life. Or:one-half of a man’s lifetime medical expenses occur now in the last six monthsof his life.In a free society, you personally would have to make a choice: do you want todefer consumption, cancel vacations, forgo pleasures year after year, so as toextend your life in the ICU by a few months at the end? If you do, no one wouldinterfere under capitalism. You could hoard your cash and then have a gloriousspree in the hospital as you die. I would not care to do this. It does notbother me that some billionaire can live months longer than I by using machinerythat I cannot begin to afford. I would rather be able to make ends meet, enjoymy life, and die a bit sooner. But in a free society, you are not bound by mydecision; each man makes and finances his own choice. The moral principle hereis clear-cut: a man has a right to act to sustain his life, but no right to lootothers in the process. If he cannot afford some science-fiction cure, he mustlearn to accept the facts of reality and make the best of it.In a free society, the few who could afford costly discoveries would, by thenormal mechanism, help to bring the costs down. Gradually, more and more of uscould afford more and more of the new technology, and there would be nohealth-cost crisis at all. Everyone would benefit, no one would be crushed. Theterminally ill would not be robbing everyone else of his life, as is happeningnow, thanks to government intervention; the elderly would not be devouring thesubstance of the young.You may wonder if I have now covered, at least in essence, the ways in whichgovernment is wrecking the practice of medicine. I have barely scratched thesurface. For example, I have not even mentioned the formal introduction of theprinciple of collectivism into medical practice—of committee-medicine as againstindividual judgment. This is exemplified by the flourishing PROs in ourhospitals, the Professional Review Organizations, which act to oversee andstrengthen the various DRG controls. PROs are committees of doctors and nursesestablished by the government to monitor the treatment of Medicare patients, andespecially to cut its cost—committees with substantial power to enforce theirarbitrary judgments on any dissenting doctor. These committees are theequivalent in the Medicare system of the HMO administrators, and havepotentially the same kind of all-encompassing power to forbid hospital stays(along with the associated tests and surgical procedures), even when theadmitting doctor thinks they are required.Nor have I yet mentioned CONs, or Certificates of Need. Since the governmentregards anything new in the field of medicine as potentially expensive, ahospital today is prohibited from growing in any respect, whether we speak ofmore beds or new technology, unless the administrator can prove “need” to someofficial. Since “need” in this context is undefined and unprovable, theoperative criterion is not “need” at all, but pull, political pull. Under thisprogram, the government [in 1984] denied Sloan-Kettering, the famous New Yorkcancer hospital, permission to purchase an MRI machine, because another New Yorkhospital already had one. Later, the government backed down in the face of theresulting public uproar. But what about the hospitals that do not enjoy suchfame or contacts, and that are inexplicably denied the right to acquire acrucial diagnostic tool? So far, the freeze on them is only partly effective.Doctors are still allowed to purchase new equipment for their own offices, whichhospital patients now often use. But the government is fighting to close thisloophole; it is on the verge of decreeing that private doctors in their ownoffices out of their own funds cannot purchase new equipment without agovernment certificate of “need.” Here again you can see how your care will beaffected, even if you are not a Medicare patient. If your doctor or hospital isnot allowed to have the equipment, you cannot benefit from it either. It isn’tthere. It doesn’t exist.Nor have I mentioned the hundreds of other government interventions in medicine.In the space of a year, state legislatures alone recently enacted almost threehundred pieces of health-cost containment legislation. One hospital in New Yorknow reports to ninety-nine separate regulatory agencies.And I have not yet touched on what is perhaps the worst crisis in the field ofmedicine today, the one most demoralizing to the doctors: the malpracticecrisis. This crisis illustrates dramatically, in yet another form, the lethaleffects of government intervention in the field of medicine.Medical malpractice suits have trebled in the past decade. There are now [1985]about sixteen lawsuits for every hundred doctors. In addition, awards toplaintiffs average around $330,000 and are steadily climbing. The effect of thissituation on physicians is unspeakable. First, I have been told, there is fear,chronic fear, the terror of the next attorney’s letter in the mail. Then thereis the agony of drawn-out legal harassment, including endless depositions and aprotracted trial. There is the exhaustion of feeling that one lives in amalevolent universe, in which every patient is a potential enemy. Always, thereis the looming specter: a career-destroying verdict. And whatever the verdict,win or lose, there is the fact that all the doctors, innocent and guilty alike,are paying for it. They are paying for the exorbitant awards in the form ofunbelievable insurance premiums—over $100,000 per year per physician in someplaces.In response to this situation, doctors are forced to engage wholesale in“defensive medicine,” i.e., the performing of unnecessary tests or proceduressolely in order to build a legal record and thereby prevent the patient fromsuing later. For example, I heard about the case of a man falling and bumpinghis head slightly. Since there was no evidence of any head injury, there was nobasis, in the doctor’s judgment, to order an expensive series of skull X rays.But if he does not order it, he takes a chance: if months or even years later,the man should develop mysterious headaches, the doctor might be sued. He mightbe charged retroactively with negligence, since he omitted a test that mighthave shown something that might have enabled him to prevent the headaches. Sothe doctor has no choice; he has to order the tests to protect himself. By aconservative estimate, defensive medicine now accounts for one-third of allhealth-care costs.Since the medical profession did not suddenly turn evil or irresponsible in thelast several years, we must ask what is the cause of the soaring lawsuits. Themost immediately apparent answer lies in the law, which has now lost anypretense at rationality. The standards of liability are corrupt. Negligence, inany rational sense of the term, is no longer the legal standard. Today’sstandard demands of the doctor not responsible care, but omniscience andomnipotence.For example, if a doctor prescribes a drug that is safe by every known test, andyears later it is discovered to have side effects undreamed of at the time, thedoctor can be sued. Was he negligent? No, merely not omniscient. If he treats apatient with less than the most expensive technology, whether the patient canafford it or not, he can be sued. “You open yourself to a malpractice suit,”says an attorney in the field, “if you even give the appearance of lettingfinancial considerations conflict with good patient care.”1[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c30_r1.html#en61] Or: if a baby has a birth defect thatcan be ascribed to the trauma of labor, the obstetrician can be sued for nothaving done a Caesarian, even though there were no advance indications in favorof one—because, as one obstetrician puts it, people assume “that anything less[than perfection] is due to negligence.”2[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c30_r1.html#en62] This last statement actually revealsthe operative principle of the law today, not of some crackpot left-wingradical, but of the law: the patient is entitled to have whatever he wishes,regardless of cost or means; it makes no difference what doctors know, orwhether the money exists; the patient’s desire is an absolute, the doctor is amere serf expected to provide all comers with an undefined “perfect care”somehow.Do you see where this idea comes from? It is the basic principle that underliesand gave birth to Medicare. “You the patient,” Washington said in the 1960s,“need do nothing to earn your medical care or your cures. From now on you needmerely wish, and the all-powerful government will do the rest for you.” Well,now we see the result. We see the rise of a generation of patients (and lawyers)who believe it, who expect treatment and cures as a matter of right, simplybecause they wish it, and who storm into court when their wish is frustrated.The government not only inculcates such an attitude, but makes it seemfinancially feasible as well, because Washington has poured so much money intothe field of medicine for so long. How else could anyone afford the defensivetests, or the inflated medical prices necessary to help pay for the incrediblemalpractice awards? They could not have been afforded in a free-market context.In the days of private medicine, there was no malpractice crisis; there wasneither the public psychology nor the irresponsible funding that it requires.But now, thanks to government, there is both. And there is also a large enoughcorps of unscrupulous lawyers who are delighted to cash in on the disaster,lawyers who are eager to extort every penny they can from conscientious,bewildered, and in most cases utterly innocent doctors—while grabbing off hugecontingency fees for themselves in the process.The only solution to the malpractice crisis is a rational definition of“malpractice,” which would restrict the concept severely, to cases ofdemonstrable negligence or irresponsibility, within the context of objectivedefinitions of these terms, taking into account the knowledge and the moneyavailable at the time. But this approach is impossible until the government getsits standards and its cash out of the medical business altogether.We are all kept alive by the work of man’s mind—the individual minds that stillretain the autonomy necessary to think and to judge. In medicine, above all, themind must be left free. Medical treatment, as I have said, involves countlessvariables and options that must be taken into account, weighed, and summed up bythe doctor’s mind and subconscious. Your life depends on the private, inneressence of the doctor’s function: it depends on the input that enters his brain,and on the processing such input receives from him.What is being thrust now into the equation? It is not only objective medicalfacts any longer. Today, in one form or another, the following also has to enterthat brain: “The DRG administrator will raise hell if I operate, but themalpractice attorney will have a field day if I don‘t—and my rival down thestreet, who heads the local PRO, favors a CAT scan in these cases, I can’tafford to antagonize him, but the CON boys disagree and they won’t authorize aCAT scanner for our hospital —and besides the FDA prohibits the drug I should beprescribing, even though it is widely used in Europe, and the IRS might notallow the patient a tax deduction for it, anyhow, and I can’t get a specialist’sadvice because the latest Medicare rules prohibit a consultation with thisdiagnosis, and maybe I shouldn’t even take this patient, he’s so sick—after all,some doctors are manipulating their slate of patients, they accept only thehealth iest ones, so their average costs are coming in lower than mine, and itlooks bad for my staff privileges ...” Would you like your case to be treatedthis way—by a doctor who takes into account your objective medical needs and thecontradictory, unintelligible demands of ninety-nine different governmentagencies and lawyer squads? If you were a doctor, could you comply with all ofit? Could you plan for or work around or deal with the unknowable? But how couldyou not? Those agencies and squads are real, and they are rapidly gaining totalpower over you and your mind and your patients.In this kind of nightmare world, if and when it takes hold fully, thought ishelpless; no one can decide by rational means what to do. A doctor either obeysthe loudest authority; or he tries to sneak by unnoticed, bootlegging some goodhealth care occasionally; or he gives up and quits the field.Now you can understand why Objectivism holds that mind and force areopposites—and why innovation always disappears in totalitarian countries—and whydoctors and patients alike are going to perish under socialized medicine if itsinvasion of this nation is not reversed.Conservatives sometimes observe that government, by freezing medical fees, isdestroying the doctors’ financial incentive to practice. This is true enough,but my point is different. With or without incentive, the doctors are beingplaced in a position where they literally cannot function—where they cannotthink, judge, know what to do, or act on their conclusions. Increasingly, for aman who is conscientious, today’s government is making the practice of medicineimpossible.The doctors know it, and many have decided what to do about it. In preparationfor this talk, I spoke to or heard from physicians around the country. I wantedto learn their view of the state of their profession. From New York toCalifornia, from Minnesota to Florida, the response was almost always the same:“I’m getting out of medicine.” “I can’t take it any more.” “I’m putting everycent I can into my pension plan. In five years, I’ll retire.”Such is the reward our country is now offering to its doctors, in payment fortheir life-saving dedication, effort, and achievements.As to talented newcomers rising to replace the men who quit, I want to point outthat medical-school enrollments are dropping. Bright students today, says thepresident of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, are “discouraged by theperception of growing government regulation of medicine.”3[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c30_r1.html#en63] Note that it is bright students aboutwhom he speaks. The other kind will always be in ample supply.Any government program has beneficiaries who fight to keep the program going.Who is benefiting from the destruction of the doctors? It is not the poor. Ageneration ago, the poor in this country received excellent care through privatecharity, comparatively much better care than they are going to get now under theDRG and HMO approaches. The beneficiary is not the poor, but only one subgroupamong them: those who do not want to admit that they are charity cases, thosewho want to pretend that they are entitled to medical handouts as a matter ofright. In other words, the beneficiary is the dishonest poor, who wantrighteously to collect the unearned and consider it an affront even to have tosay “Thank you.” There is a second beneficiary: the new 9-to-5, civil-servantdoctor, the kind who once existed only on the fringes of medicine, but who nowbasks in the limelight of being a physician and healer, because his betters arebeing frozen out. And there is one more kind of beneficiary: the medicalbureaucrats, lobbyists, legislators, and the malpractice lawyers—in short, allthe force-wielders now slithering out of their holes, gorging themselves onunearned jobs, money, fame, and/or power, by virtue of having sunk their fangsinto the body of the medical profession.Altruism, as Ayn Rand has demonstrated, does not mean kindness or benevolence;it means that man is a sacrificial animal; it means that some men are to besacrificed to others. Our country today is a textbook illustration of her point.The competent doctors, along with their self-supporting patients, are beingsacrificed—to the parasites, the incompetents, and the brutes. This is howaltruism always works. This is how it has to work, by its nature.The doctors resent today’s situation passionately. Many of them are ready toquit, but not to fight for their field—at least, not to fight in the manner thatwould be necessary, if they were to have a chance of winning. In part, this isbecause the doctors are frightened; they sense that if they speak out tooloudly, they may be subject to government reprisals. Most of all, however, thedoctors feel guilty. Their own professional motivation—the personal, selfishlove of their field and of their mind’s ability to function—is noble, but theydo not know it.For ages they have had it pounded into them that it is wrong to have a personalmotivation, wrong to enjoy the material rewards of their labor, wrong to asserttheir own individual rights. They have been told over and over that, no matterwhat their own private desires, they should want to sacrifice themselves tosociety. And so they are torn now by a moral conflict and silenced by despair.They do not know what to say if they quit, or how to protest their enslavement.They do not know that selfishness, the rational selfishness they embody andpractice, is the essence of virtue. They do not know that they are not servantsof their patients, but, to quote Ayn Rand, “traders, like everyone else in afree society—and they should bear that title proudly, considering the crucialimportance of the services they offer.” If the doctors could hear just this muchand learn to speak out against their jailers, there would still be a chance; butonly if they speak out as a matter of solemn justice, upholding a moralprinciple, the first moral principle: self-preservation.Thereafter, in practical terms, they—and all of us—could advocate the onlysolution to today’s crisis: removing its primary cause. This means: closing downMedicare. Reducing Medicare’s budget is not the answer—that will simply tightenthe DRG noose. The program itself must be abolished. In principle, the method issimple: phase it out in stages. Let the government continue to pay, on a slidingscale, for those who are already too old to save for their final years, but giveclear notice to the younger generations that there is a cutoff age, and thatthey must begin now to make their own provision for their later medical costs.Is there still time for such a step? The most I can answer is: in ten years,there won’t be—that is how fast things are moving. In ten years, perhaps even infive, our medical system will have been dismantled. Most of the best doctorswill have retired or gone on strike, and the government will be so entrenched inthe field that nothing will get rid of it.If you are my age, you may sneak by with the rest of your lifespan, relying onthe remnants of private medicine that still exist. But if you are in your teens,twenties, thirties, then you are too young to count on such a hope. To you inparticular, I want to conclude by saying: find out what is going on in thisfield—don’t take my word for it—and then act, let people know the situation, inwhatever way is open to you. Above all, talk to your doctor. If you agree withthe Declaration of Independence, tell him that he, too, comes under it; that he,too, is a human being with a right to life; and that you want to help protecthis freedom, and his income, on purely selfish grounds.If you are looking for a crusade, there is none that is more idealistic or morepractical. This one is devoted to protecting some of the greatest creators inthe history of this country. It is also literally a matter of life anddeath—your life, and that of anyone you love. Don’t let it go without a fight.NOTES1 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c30_r1.html#Ref-en61] Arthur R.

It has comeunder attack in various quarters for holding the value of liberty as anabsolute. It has been condemned by conservatives for elevating liberty abovetradition and authority, and by liberals for elevating liberty above equalityand humanitarianism.Both camps are mistaken. Libertarianism deserves only one fundamental criticism:it does not value liberty. If it were ever successful, it would destroy theremnants of freedom that still exist in this country far faster than any of themore explicit enemies of liberty.Libertarianism has no philosophy. To put this more accurately: it renounces theneed for any intellectual basis for its beliefs. The volumes of scholarlymaterial defending Libertarianism are self-admittedly pointless, since the trueLibertarian position is that no defense is necessary. Murray Rothbard, widelyviewed as the father of the movement, expresses this clearly in presenting hiscentral argument for liberty.“Should virtuous action (however we define it) be compelled, or should it beleft up to the free and voluntary choice of the individual?” he asks. And heanswers: “To be virtuous in any meaningful sense, a man’s actions must befree.... The point is more forceful: no action can be virtuous unless it isfreely chosen.” Freedom, therefore, is a prerequisite of any virtue, and thuscan be validated with no knowledge of virtue at all. Morality, in other words,is irrelevant to the issue of liberty. “Freedom is necessary to, and integralwith, the achievement of any of man’s ends,” Rothbard insists. [Last emphasisadded.]1 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en64]How can a man identify the requirements of virtue without first knowing whatvirtue is? Yet Rothbard does not ask why the very concept of virtue isnecessary, what it consists of, or how it is justified. Without understandinganything about the nature of virtue, he proceeds to declare that liberty is itssine qua non. His reasoning is an effort to subvert—indeed, to invert—thelogical hierarchy of ethics and politics by claiming that one need know nothingabout the first in order to establish the principles of the second.But since the fundamental question of ethics is how to define the good, it isethics itself which must determine the propriety or impropriety of force. If,for example, the good is—as many believe—a world that heeds God’s will, then itis virtuous to prevent, by force if necessary, the distribution of pornographyor the drinking of alcohol or the preaching of atheism. If prayer is a duty oneis obliged to perform—if the act of praying is intrinsically good, regardless ofone’s knowledge or rational interests—why shouldn’t one be compelled to gothrough the motions of prayer, if that is supposed to bring greater glory toGod? How many “sinners” throughout history have been tortured and killed inorder to save their souls and thereby please God? Of what logical relevance isthe victim’s lack of consent, if one accepts this concept of the good?One cannot exhort people to have faith in a being beyond their comprehension,and then insist that freedom—which means the right to act on the judgment ofone’s mind—is a prerequisite of virtue. A moral code that urges man to surrenderhis mind to a higher authority is irreconcilable with the principle that manought to live his life guided by his own thinking. If obedience is a virtue,freedom of thought and action cannot be a right.Most secular codes of morality are also in conflict with the principle offreedom. If the good is an egalitarian society, for example, then it is virtuousto expropriate the wealth of the rich and give it to the poor. If the good isthat which gives the greatest pleasure to the greatest number, then it isvirtuous to kill off some minority of “undesirables,” if the majority so wishes.If the good is the melding of the individual’s “unreal self” into thecollective, organic whole of humanity, then it is virtuous to establish atotalitarian state.The evil of the initiation of force lies in the fact that force is the negationof the mind. It makes the victim act not by the guidance of his independentperception, but by the dictates of a gun. Only if reason is a virtue, therefore,can force be a vice. But to uphold reason as a virtue requires a specific codeof morality. It requires a morality the standard of which is man’s life, andwhich recognizes that human survival depends on human rationality. With that asan ethical base, one can demonstrate that the initiation of physical force isanti-life and thus immoral. In this approach, liberty is indeed a prerequisiteof virtue.But if reason is not a moral value, if virtue is based on dogmatically assertedduties or on subjectively asserted desires, then human understanding of rightand wrong is irrelevant—is, in fact, an obstacle—to morality. In this view,there are no grounds for barring force in human relations, and more: forcebecomes indispensable in obtaining compliance with unprovable moral imperatives.Without reason, no resolution of disagreements can take place, except by resortto fists and bullets.In defiance of all fact, Libertarianism declares that there is no need for anyconcept such as individual rights, there is no need for any code of ethics,there is no need for any philosophical ideas at all—other than the Libertarianaxiom that no matter how irrational one’s values, “liberty” is the prerequisiteof achieving them.This fatuous reasoning brings even Marxism and Nazism under the Libertarianumbrella. After all, the values of a liberated proletariat or of a purifiedAryan race cannot really be achieved—the Libertarian would have to argue—exceptthrough uncoerced action. Marxists and Nazis need not repudiate theirphilosophies—they merely have to call for the factory owners to hand over theirproperty to the state, for the book publishers to accept the views of theMinister of Propaganda, for the Jews to march into the gas chambers ...voluntarily! If the Hitlers and the Stalins want to implant the virtue ofabsolute submission to the state—Rothbard would tell them—they must persuade thepeople to submit willingly. In other words, only when political freedom reignscan the goals of barbarians be realized.There is nothing un-Libertarian about the basic moral tenets of dictatorship.The ethical values—the ends—of Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany (as of anyoneelse) are perfectly consistent with Libertarianism; it is only their coercivemeans that, allegedly, aren’t.Libertarianism is a version of moral subjectivism. It is the view that allvalues are equally valid, and therefore equally irrelevant to the issue ofpolitical liberty. Consequently, all of ethics must be expunged from Libertariandoctrine. There must be no hint of any position being taken in regard to moralvalues.For example, a statement on racial discrimination in the 1978 Libertarian Partyplatform said: “We condemn bigotry as irrational and repugnant.”2[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en65] It was subsequently eliminated forbeing incompatible with Libertarianism. “Such a moralism simply has no businessin a Libertarian platform,” a former state party chairman explains. “Bigotrydoes not contradict basic Libertarian principle.... To condemn it is to make anethical value judgment, not a Libertarian political statement.”3[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en66]A second section in the platform, on health care, proposed to condemn governmentrestrictions on scientific research, particularly “attempts to suppressrecombinant DNA research, which has opened the way for increased supply ofmedically useful human proteins, such as insulin, and shows promise of revealingthe nature of hereditary diseases, the structure of bacteria and viruses, andthe nature of the immune response.”4 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en67]This statement, too, was found to be unacceptable because “scientific researchand improvement of medical technology are values that simply have no place inthe Libertarian Party platform.... What about those Libertarians who don’t valuerecombinant DNA research?”5 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en68]A leading Libertarian writer and speaker, Walter Block, states this antipathytoward moral principles even more baldly. He asks whether Libertarianism “mustbe honest and truthful,” and whether it ought to involve not just a “disembodiedideology” but some “animating ideal or spirit to give the movement a sense ofpurpose.” And he answers with an unequivocal no. “There must not be more to ourLibertarian movement than its disembodied ideology—its nonaggression principle.Any sort of additional ‘animating ideal’ or ’spirit’ will only needlessly, andunjustly, force true Libertarians to leave; although they may agree with thenoninitiation of force, they may not be in tune with this undefined, ineffable‘spirit.’ ” As to the issue of honesty: “Lying violates no Libertarianprinciple.... You don’t owe [anyone] the truth unless he’s paid you for it.”6[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en69]Block is correct: Libertarianism is incompatible with values as such. If nomorality is unacceptable to Libertarianism, then no morality can be acceptable,either. There can be no endorsement of scientific progress, or of honesty; therecan be no criticism of irrationality. What Block fails to grasp, however, isthat once ethics is abandoned, all values become groundless and must berepudiated—including the value of liberty. Libertarianism cannot argue, forinstance, that socialized medicine destroys medical care—why is healthnecessarily a value? It cannot condemn the public school system for making trueeducation impossible—why should education be a value? It cannot claim that pricecontrols destroy an economy’s productivity—why is production or prosperity avalue? Does justice demand that the individual be free? What about thoseLibertarians who believe that justice is heartless and that mercy is morallysuperior? Is coercion wrong because it interferes with people’s pursuit ofhappiness? What about those Libertarians who regard happiness as a vice? Isliberty to be upheld because it is allegedly the means of achieving whatever itis one happens to value? What about the Libertarian who preaches a life ofsuffering and frustration, who considers the renunciation, rather than theachievement, of values to be a virtue?If Libertarianism were consistent in its avowed rejection of the realm ofmorality, if it stopped smuggling in implicit value judgments to give itsstatements a deceptive veneer of coherence, it could say nothing in favor ofliberty.This contempt for ideas extends far beyond the field of ethics. It is not onlymoral principles that Libertarianism repudiates, but all philosophic ideas.Murray Rothbard claims to hold a philosophy but predictably regards it, too, asinconsequential. He writes:As a political theory, Libertarianism is a coalition of adherents from allmanner of philosophic (or nonphilosophic) positions, including emotivism,hedonism, Kantian a priorism, and many others. My own position groundsLibertarianism on a natural rights theory embedded in a wider system ofAristotelian-Lockean natural law and a realist ontology and metaphysics. Butalthough those of us taking this position believe that only it provides asatisfactory groundwork and basis for individual liberty, this is an argumentwithin the Libertarian camp about the proper basis and grounding ofLibertarianism rather than about the doctrine itself. [Emphasis added.]7[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en70]This reflects Rothbard’s utter scorn for ideas—even his own. If he claims tobelieve that only an Aristotelian system can “ground” Libertarianism, how can hecall the adherents of “emotivism, hedonism, and Kantian a priorism” members ofthe same camp? If these proponents are presenting false arguments based on falsepremises, why does he not see this as undercutting his own case for liberty? Ifan investment adviser tells people to buy gold because he believes that theprice will rise and they will get rich, while a devout Hindu, who believes thatwealth is evil, tells people to buy gold because he believes the price willplummet and they will become impoverished, the two advisers are not reaching thesame conclusion, even though both say: “Buy gold.” And neither are theAristotelian and the Kantian, even though both may proclaim the words: “Libertyis good.” Only a total disregard for the context and the meaning of conceptscould allow anyone to equate the two viewpoints.Rothbard is saying simultaneously that only one philosophic foundation canjustify liberty—and that Libertarianism is comfortable with any foundation, orwith no foundation. This can only mean that liberty needs no justification, andthat he regards all discussion, including his own copious contributions, aboutits proper “grounding” as pointless pedanticism.Imagine a pro-capitalist who joins with socialists in a demonstration againstthe Reagan Administration. Should he overlook, as a mere detail, the fact thathe believes Reagan is too appeasing of Russia and too tolerant of social-welfarespending, while the socialists believe that Reagan is too harsh toward theSoviets and too draconian in his budget cuts? Would any sane person dismiss thisdisagreement as just an intra-camp argument about “grounding,” but not about thecrucial point itself of Reagan’s undesirability? Yet this is exactly theattitude taken by Libertarians toward the question of the desirability ofliberty.In logic, there is no way to comprehend the meaning of the principle of thenoninitiation of force without a philosophical foundation. And there is no wayto apply the principle in a political context without formulating a code ofrights, particularly property rights. Without such a base, liberty could meananything from socialism, which offers “freedom” from the law of supply anddemand, to Zen Buddhism, which offers “freedom” from the law ofnoncontradiction.But a code of rights cannot be established except by reference to a code ofethics. Rights pertain to freedom of action in a social context, and one cannotknow how man should act as a member of society before knowing how man should actas man. Ethics itself, moreover, is the product of a view of man and of reality.In other words, to arrive at a proper understanding and an objective validationof liberty, philosophy is inescapable. One has to begin with a view of realityas comprehensible, and of man as a rational being who relies upon reason as hissole means of valid knowledge and as his basic tool of survival. One must thenidentify man’s life as the proper standard of value, and morality as theprinciples defining the actions necessary to maintain man’s life. Since life issustained through thought and action, one then concludes that the individualmust have the right to think and to act, and to keep the product of thatthinking and acting—which means: the right to life, liberty, and property.Because the initiation of force is the means by which a mind is paralyzed, suchforce is evil. Because force is the means by which one’s rights are violated, itmust be outlawed. Thus the conclusion that liberty is a fundamental social good.Without such a philosophic base, the concept of liberty cannot be defended. Atthe core of Libertarianism, however, is the denial of this basic connection.Libertarians display nothing but disdain for fundamental ideas. They disparagethe very idea of a fundamental idea. Libertarianism wishes to espouse an endproduct: liberty—while remaining oblivious to its source: philosophy. It sees nological, ordered structure of ideas, but only a haphazard smorgasbord ofnotions, and feels entitled to help itself to any one, at any time, in anysequence, as the mood strikes.What must this imply about the effort to achieve liberty in practice? If libertyposes no threat to the dominant ideas of our culture today, where is theresistance to it emanating from? If the ideal of freedom is so devoid ofintellectual content and controversy—if it is compatible with all philosophiesand all values—if it is, as Rothbard puts it, “necessary to, and integral with,the achievement of any of man’s ends”—what ideas do people need to be convincedof in order for the ideal of liberty to gain wide acceptance? The Libertariananswer has to be: none.According to the basic premise of Libertarianism, no ideological education ispossible. Can Libertarians persuade people of the truth of some particularphilosophy? One philosophy is as good as any other. Can they point out theerrors of various philosophies? Even false philosophies are compatible withliberty. Can they show how certain moral values are in conflict with liberty?None are. But if wrong ideas are not the problem, and correct ideas are not thesolution, what explains our steady drift toward statism, and what could reverseit?The answer indicates the next development in Libertarian thinking: its versionof the Marxist theory of class struggle.“American society is divided into a government-oppressed class and agovernment-privileged class, and is ruled by a power elite,” says theLibertarian Party Radical Caucus.8 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en71]Therefore,A Libertarian class analysis is the key theoretical tool, the one indispensablemethod of unraveling complex strategic and tactical questions. Crucial to anyLibertarian theory of social change is the clear moral and political distinctionto be made between those who hold state power and those who do not—between thosewho rule and those who are ruled.... Our Libertarian worldview comes ever moreclearly into focus as we draw the line politically between two opposing classeswith mutually exclusive relations to the state. Which side are you on? Do youdefend the state—or do you side with the people?9[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en72]There is no intellectual conflict in regard to liberty, this view declares. Thepeople are simply kept in chains by a privileged elite, which has somehowmanaged to take control of the coercive machinery of the state. Each group isdrawn to pursue its innate “class interests.” The masses for some reason aredriven to seek freedom; the ruling bureaucrats, power.What weapons do Libertarians intend to use in this type of battle, sinceeducation is pointless? The abandonment of reason necessitates the endorsementof force. In Libertarianism’s pursuit of social change, therefore, it is leftwith only one recourse: violence.Libertarians want to transform the present system not by force of argument, butby plain force. And some of them broadcast this openly. “The fact is that noruling class has ever given up its power voluntarily—and any movement forradical social change which fails to realize this will never achieve its goals,”says Libertarian Vanguard, a “radical” newspaper within the Libertarianmovement. America’s “present system cannot be reformed or wishedaway—extra-parliamentary action is, ultimately, the prospect awaiting us.”10[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en73]The goal of Libertarians is to topple the state’s power elite through armedstruggle. The Libertarian battleground is not the halls of academia or theeditorial pages of the newspapers, but the streets and the back alleys. Thetroops Libertarianism seeks are not individuals armed with convincing arguments,but a mindless horde avid to lash out against the “system” and the state withmachine guns and hand grenades. The Libertarian Vanguard describes the makeup ofthis corps:The revolutionary potential of blacks, Chicanos, women, and gays who have beenbetrayed by decades of social welfare programs, which have led to nothing butmisery, exploitation, and crushing inflation, is the greatest fear of theCorporate State oligarchy.... Slavery, the conquest of the West and thesubsequent looting of American Indian and Mexican land rights, the historicalsubjugation of women, the brutal repression of lesbians and gay men—every singleone of these are crimes committed on a scale so massive that it is almostunimaginable; and every single one of these crimes can be traced directly to theactions of the state. In these instances, and in others, what is involved isnothing less than the attempted systematic obliteration of an entire classformation.11 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en74]The Libertarian campaign for “liberty” is a war against the state, not againststatism. It is not the ideas behind statism that Libertarians attack—there areno such ideas, they believe; the target of their attack is the state itself,even the state as defined and established by America’s founding fathers. It isthe state, in any form, that represents a restriction upon their “liberty,” andtherefore deserves to be crushed. This is the anarchism inherent in themovement.“Libertarian principle and the dynamics of social change dictate that we beperpetual state-haters,” says a former vice chairman of the Libertarian Party.12[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en75] Not haters of slavery or oftyranny—but of the state as such.“We seek the abolition of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureauof Investigation,” declares the platform of the Libertarian Party.13[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en76] “We favor international negotiationstoward general and complete disarmament down to police levels.”14[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en77]“The U.S. government should unilaterally abandon all nuclear weapons,” says aformer editor of the Libertarian Party News. “The desire of some to support theU.S. nuclear buildup is based on the faulty notion that the U.S. government ison ‘our side’—that it will use these weapons to defend our lives and liberty.Yet this is clearly not the case. It uses these weapons ... to defend the state.If Libertarians truly regard the state as their enemy, they cannot support itsholding of nuclear weapons.”15 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en78]The goals of achieving liberty and destroying the state are incompatible—yetLibertarians choose the latter. A properly functioning government, one whosepurpose is to protect individual rights against attack, is essential to thepreservation of liberty; but this is of no concern to Libertarians—all statesare the enemy. Libertarians do not believe that by crippling the state they arehelping the cause of freedom. The dissolution of the state is an end of itself.To Libertarians, whatever harms the state is categorically good; whatever helpsthe state is categorically bad—regardless of the effect on human liberty.For example, when South Vietnam was conquered by North Vietnam in 1975, MurrayRothbard found it an occasion for celebration: “What is inspiring toLibertarians is to actually see the final and swift disintegration of aState.... None of [America‘s] superior might and firepower could in the endprevail against the will and determination of the mass of Vietnamese (andCambodians) bent against seemingly impossible odds to dislodge dictatorialgovernments.” The death of a state, he writes,vindicates once again the insights of the theorists of mass guerrilla warfare... that after a slow, patient, protracted struggle, in which the guerrillaarmies (backed by the populace) whittle and wear down the massively superiorfirepower of the state armies (generally backed by other, imperialistgovernments), the final blow occurs in which the state dissolves anddisintegrates with remarkable speed.16 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en79]It is immaterial to Rothbard that communism had triumphed and that the freedomof the South Vietnamese people had been reduced from minuscule to nonexistent.All that matters to “perpetual state-haters” is that for one brief moment theyexperience the exhilaration of seeing a government ground into dust. And thenumber one target of this hostility is the government not of some totalitariandictatorship, but of the United States.America has become “a new worldwide empire which has set itself up as themilitary guardian of the status quo—and the main enemy of every nationalliberation movement seeking autonomy,” says the Libertarian Party RadicalCaucus. “The national isolation of the American Libertarian movement can only beprolonged by an attempt to deny what is clear, by now, to people all around theglobe—the fact that the United States is the main danger to peace andfreedom.”17 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en80]Libertarianism thus provides the grotesque spectacle of a movement claiming tosupport individual liberty-while reviling America as the world’s most immoralnation. When communists issue the same vituperative charge against the U.S.,they are at least honest in naming their standard of value.According to Libertarians, America is far more contemptible than even the SovietUnion. Murray Rothbard writes,Taking the twentieth century as a whole, the single most war-like, mostinterventionist, most imperialist government has been the United States....Lenin and his fellow Bolsheviks adopted the theory of “peaceful coexistence” asthe basic foreign policy for a communist state. The idea was this: as the firstsuccessful communist movement, Soviet Russia would serve as a beacon for andsupporter of other communist parties throughout the world. But the Soviet statequa state would devote itself to peaceful relations with all the othercountries, and would not attempt to export communism through interstatewarfare.... Thus, fortuitously, from a mixture of theoretical and practicalgrounds of their own, the Soviets arrived early at what Libertarians consider tobe the only proper and principled foreign policy.... Increasing conservatismunder Stalin and his successors strengthened and reinforced the nonaggressive,“peaceful coexistence” policy. [Emphasis added]18[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en81]The communist guerrilla movement that is trying to overthrow the American-backedgovernment in El Salvador deserves unqualified moral support, says theLibertarian Vanguard:There can be no moral or political neutrality in a battle of this kind. If wemust temporarily join forces with Marxist-Leninists to fight the junta and itsU.S. supporters, then so be it.... A victory for the revolution in El Salvadorwould be a major defeat for U.S. imperiahsm—the main danger to peace andliberty—right in Washington’s own back yard.19[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en82]What emerges from Libertarianism—the alleged advocate of absolute liberty—is astandard leftist worldview. The poor and the weak are oppressed by a CorporateState—America is an imperialist oligarchy—Moscow wants peace and participates inan arms race only in order to keep up with our power-mad Pentagon planners—theThird World is being denied freedom and prosperity by America’s ruling elite—allU.S. foreign policy, from Southeast Asia to Central America, is designed toachieve world domination—class struggle is the key to understanding the state ofthe world.The role model for the Libertarian revolution is the New Left of the 1960s—“thefirst quasi-Libertarian mass movement in a hundred years,” and one which“embodied the Libertarian values of respect for personal sovereignty, freedom,and peace,” according to the Students for a Libertarian Society (SLS), the majorLibertarian network on college campuses.20[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en83]Why did the New Left fail after its promising start? Because, a former directorof SLS explains, it needed “a comprehensive philosophy of social change. Yet theonly such philosophy immediately available was that of Marxism-Leninism.... Thepoint is that those seeking a strategy for revolutionary change had nowhere elseto go but toward Marxism.”21 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en84] Isn’t thelesson, then, that radical change requires a philosophical alternative toMarxism? No, he says:Wherever and whenever there have been masses of people desirous ofchange—oppressed people, idealists, intellectuals—they have been drawn toMarxism as if by an invisible hand. I do not think that this can be explainedfully by assuming that the people involved were statist, authoritarian, orcollectivist. The drift to Marxism can be better explained by noting that, inthe words of [the leader of the New Left’s major campus organization], “therewas—and is—no other coherent, integrative, and explicit philosophy ofrevolution.”... We can inherit that kind of influence if we construct a new,distinctly Libertarian theory of revolution.22[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en85]In other words, the way that social change takes place is as follows. Peoplesomehow conclude that the existing political structure must be overthrown, theydecide to make a revolution, they deliver rousing speeches and print up fierypamphlets, they draw up plans to storm the gates of government—and then, likelast-minute shoppers, they look around for the right brand of philosophy to graboff the counter in order to find out what the hell they are doing. And the brandthey ultimately grab is not the one that presents the most persuasiveexplanation of the ideas they should be fighting for, but the one that happensto offer the best advice on how to get past the palace guards. If the New Lefthad had a Libertarian “model” for destroying the state in 1968, this analysissuggests, it would surely have abandoned Marxism. The future of Libertarianism,then, depends on its occupying more prominent shelf space than does Karl Marx inthe supermarket of revolutionism.The rabid desire, shared both by Libertarianism and the New Left, to bring downthe U.S. government stems from a common root. As was true in the 1960s of theMolotov-cocktail thrower blowing up ROTC offices and chanting “Revolution,now!”, the present-day Libertarian is a thorough emotionalist. He wants to acton whatever feelings he happens to feel, no matter how capricious andirrational. He wants no constraints on his behavior. As the Society forLibertarian Life puts it in a statement of principles, all people “have anatural right to do their own thing, providing that they do not physically harmor coercively restrict another individual’s life, liberty or property.”[Emphasis added.]23 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en86]The Libertarian interprets liberty to mean the license to do whatever he feelslike doing. Since he dismisses reason and philosophy, he has no way even todefine force. To him, the pseudo-definition of “force” is that which interfereswith somebody’s desires; to him, any obstacle in the path of people’s whims isundesirable. People ought to be “free” to act on any random impulses they feel.That is Libertarianism.That is not liberty.Libertarianism rejects all values and all morality because they are too“restrictive.” Moral values establish standards for human conduct. This is toooppressive for the Libertarian, who cries that he wants to be “free” from allconstraints.If rights are a subjective matter, if the right to which men are inalienablyentitled is subjectively to “do their own thing,” then there is no basis for anyobjective concept of force. And regardless of how vociferously Libertariansproclaim their devotion to some fuzzy notion of noncoercion, they willinevitably endorse the use of force.An individual who feels an urge to engage in child molestation, for example, ismerely doing “his own thing” and should not be hindered by the state. Members ofthe North American Man/Boy Love Association—which advocates the legalization ofsex between underage and adult males—“are among the most brutallystate-oppressed individuals in this country,” writes Marc Joffe in IndividualLiberty, and support for them is the “acid test” of one’s Libertariancredentials. “Any law which discriminates on the basis of age is unjust andun-Libertarian,” he says.24 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en87]Since rights, in this view, are severed from the faculty of reason, children,like adults, are seen as having the right to do whatever they want. “We opposeall legally created or sanctioned discrimination against (or in favor of)children, just as we oppose government discrimination directed at any otherartificially defined subcategory of human beings,” says the Libertarian Partyplatform.25 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en88] If a seven-year-old nodsassent when asked whether he wants to engage in sex with an adult, that is his“right.” If he wishes to drink liquor, one has a “right” to give it to him. Ifhe wants to leave home and live with some strangers he has just met, he has aperfect “right” to do so. If he decides he wants to use heroin, buy a gun, drivea car, or fly a plane, neither he nor anyone willing to accommodate him shouldbe stopped by law.Should there be laws against libel and slander? No, say Libertarians; this isunduly restrictive of one’s right to say whatever one feels like saying. “Libellaws were created by people with a vested interest in the status quo. Usinglibel laws stops the stirring up of controversy, and doesn’t permit change,”says a former vice president of the Cato Institute (a Libertarianpolicy-research organization). “Libel law is completely invalid,” says theeditor of Inquiry magazine. “The freedom to speak means the freedom to speakwhat others might consider untruth. [Apparently no statements are ever in factuntrue.] The central premise behind libel law is that a person has a right tohis own reputation—but you can’t own it or control it because it exists in theminds of others. Libel law is a monstrous threat to free speech.”26[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en89] (So false advertising about one’sproduct—or one’s competitor’s product—is acceptable because the item’sreputation merely “exists in the minds of others.”)It should be plain why anarchism, far from being a viewpoint on the periphery ofLibertarianism, is integral to it. Anarchism follows from amoralism. If peoplehave a right never to be “constrained,” then the state must be an illegitimateentity. If there are no objective standards of judging right and wrong, whyshouldn’t a person be entitled to act on his own feelings about what does anddoes not constitute force? If all views are subjective and no opinion is anyless valid than another, by what right, and by what means, can a state establishany objective definition of crime?If a man’s fundamental goal is to define and validate individual rightsobjectively, and then to create a structure under which they are protected, hewill discover laissez-faire capitalism and limited government. If, on the otherhand, his basic concern is to allow people to do whatever they desire and toconcoct a social arrangement by which that appears to be possible, then he willunearth Libertarianism and anarchism.Of course, no social system can make the irrationalism of warring factions work.Dictatorship is the inevitable outcome of anarchism. Existentially, the chaosand destructiveness that anarchism encourages will make people turn to someonewho promises order and security; intellectually, the people will have no groundsfor resisting any despot who claims that his “private defense agency” is simplyoffering the marketplace the most “efficient” use of force—force that he feelsis entirely “justified.” In fact, there is no essential distinction betweendictatorship and Libertarianism. The totalitarian maintains that the state maydo whatever it wishes, without any restraints; the Libertarian insists that theindividual may do whatever he wishes, without any restraints. Both agree thatman is to be ruled by whim, and differ only on whether private whim orgovernment whim takes precedence. They share the same anti-reason theory—and thesame anti-freedom practice. (A term coined by author Ernest van den Haag todescribe Libertarianism captures this aspect perfectly:anarcho-totalitarianism.)The militant emotionalism of Libertarianism is succinctly conveyed by WalterBlock. The virtue of Libertarianism, he writes,is that it allows for an amazing diversity.... We’ve seen priests, monogamists,family men as the fellow-Libertarians of the gays, the sado-masochists, theleather-freaks, and those into what they call “rational bestiality.” ... OnlyLibertarianism could gather together the homosexual motorcycle gang, theacid-dropper fascinated by the price of silver, and the Puerto Rican nationalistimmersed in the Austrian school of economics.27[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en90]What unites all these creatures is a single premise: that human rationality is adispensable element in politics and in life.What Libertarianism entails is not just a trivialization of liberty, but anannihilation of the very concept. Block’s crew is the dead end of the path thatbegins with the abdication of the mind.But what is Libertarianism’s goal? If it is anti-philosophy, anti-reason,anti-morality, anti-state, and anti-liberty-what is it for? A movement that isneutral about or indifferent to moral values does not launch a politicalcrusade. Why would anyone who has renounced all values undertake a campaign tobring about radical social change?The answer is that Libertarianism rests not on neutrality or apathy, but onhostility. The source of Libertarianism—the animating force behind its assaultson philosophy, on ethics, on ideas, on the institution of government, on theUnited States—is the desire not to neglect values, or even to evade theirexistence, but to eradicate them.Walter Block, in Defending the Undefendable, argues that prostitution is nodifferent from any business transaction and should not be viewed as demeaning.“We have to offer something to our prospective partners before they will consentto have sex with us,” he says, such as the arrangement by whichthe male is expected to pay for the movies, dinners, flowers, etc., and thefemale is expected to reciprocate with sexual services. The marriages in whichthe husband provides the financial elements, and the wife the sexual andhousekeeping functions, also conform clearly enough to the [prostitution]model.... All relationships where trade takes place, those which include sex aswell as those which do not, are a form of prostitution. Instead of condemningall such relationships because of their similarity to prostitution, prostitutionshould be viewed as just one kind of interaction in which all human beingsparticipate. Objections should not be raised to any of them—not to marriage, notto friendship, not to prostitution.28 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en91]Even pimps elicit moral praise from Block: “The pimp serves the function ofbringing together two parties to a transaction at less cost than it would taketo bring them together without his good offices.” In doing so, the pimp “is, ifanything, more honorable than many other brokers, such as [those in] banking,insurance and the stock market. They rely on restrictive state and federal lawsto discourage their competition, whereas the pimp can never use the law tosafeguard his position.”29 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en92]This is not a demand for the repeal of laws against victimless crimes (laws thatshould be repealed). It is a blatant call for the repudiation of moralstandards. Block is not defending an individual’s right to engage in sordidbehavior—he is denouncing the very idea of evaluating any behavior as sordid. Heis insisting that pimps are actually honorable men, deserving of more respectthan the typical businessman.Who qualifies for Block’s accolades? Only the dregs of society. They areapplauded not in spite of their worthlessness, but because of it. It is becausethey are commonly regarded as scum that Block wants to elevate them torespectability—in order to debase the very idea of respectability. His “heroic”counter feiter (whose activities “reduce and counteract the great evil ofgovernment counterfeiting”)—the policeman who takes bribes for not enforcingcertain laws (“the acceptance of money cannot be logically distinguished fromthe acceptance of a gift, and the mere acceptance of a gift is notillegitimate”)—the habitual litterer (“who treats public property in much thesame way that he would treat private property if he were but free to—namely, heleaves garbage around on it[!]” and thus exhibits “courage” and “can serve as aprotest against an unjust system” of public streets)—the heroin pusher (who, “byacting so as to lower prices even at considerable personal risk,” actually“saves lives and alleviates the tragedy somewhat”)—all these are paragons ofvirtue to Block.30 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en93] Why? Because theyhave rejected standards of behavior—not in favor of different or higherstandards, but in the name of the annihilation of standards. As these reprobateschoose to climb down into the slime, they do not uphold some new ethicalcriteria by which to claim that their lives are noble; they simply announce thatthey relish slime.The “counterculture” of two decades ago was highly praised by Libertarians. Inan article aptly titled “In Praise of Decadence,” a former editor of LibertarianReview extols the hippies for demanding that “each person must be his ownauthority and must ‘do his own thing.’ ”31[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en94] The fact that they could articulate noalternatives, no philosophies, no arguments, no values to offer in place of theones they were repudiating is immaterial to the Libertarian. What is significantto him is the repudiation per se.The concept of “value” is irreconcilable with the Libertarian notion of“liberty.” The existence of any value entails a certain “restraint” upon one’sactions. It declares that X is good, that one ought to attain it, that oneshould pursue a particular end by using some defined means. It thereby limitsman’s behavior by pointing it in a specific direction. This is intolerable tothose who want nothing to stand in the way of their whims.In order for Libertarianism to bloom, therefore, values—not any particular codeof values, but values as such—must be eliminated. This can be done either bydebasing the good or by glorifying the depraved—by damning limited government orby upholding anarchism—by describing the Grenada invasion as “senselessmilitarism”32 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en95] or by celebrating NorthVietnam’s victory over America as reflecting the people’s determination “todislodge dictatorial governments”33 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en96]-bydefaming Israel as “ma niacally committed to the dread logic of empire, viz.,... [of] slaughter and genocide”34 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en97] orby praising the PLO as leading a “fight for justice and property rights”35[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en98]—by vilifying the United States as theworld’s “main danger to peace and freedom”36[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en99] or by hailing the Soviet Union forpracticing a “proper and principled foreign policy.”37[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en100]By either method, authentic values are sabotaged—and then anything goes.Rothbard explains why the student rioters of the 1960s, who occupied universitybuildings and marched around campuses with loaded weapons, were quintessentialLibertarians: “Perhaps the whole thing can be summed up by a sign carried bysome of the kids at an antiwar march in New York City on April 5. The sign readsimply: ‘Death to the State. Power to the People.’ How can you fault a movementhaving that as a slogan?”38 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en101]That sign does indeed reveal the essence of Libertarianism—the hostility, theanti-intellectualism, the utter philosophical void it represents. There is onlyone term that accurately describes this diseased viewpoint: nihilism.Libertarianism rests upon a pervasive desire to annihilate. There is to be nostate, no ethics, no values, no standards, no ideas, no reason, no reality. Nostate—because it defines the use of force; no ethics—because it identifiesproper behavior; no values—because they demand that actions have a purpose; nostandards—because they establish right and wrong; no ideas—because they denyprimacy to feelings; no reason—because it excludes the irrational; noreality—because it decrees that whims do not work.Libertarianism starts with the brute observation that people have desires—wherethey come from and whether they are right or wrong are of no concern—and itoffers, as the whole of its message, a single emotional ejaculation: act onthose desires without restraint.Liberty is the protector of man’s values. It does not produce material goods,but it makes all production possible. It is comparable to the locks on doors:they do not create any wealth, but simply allow one to function in peace and tokeep what one has already produced. Nobody could agitate for the universalinstallation of locks and burglar alarms in order to protect people’s goodsagainst theft, and at the same time declare that it does not matter to himwhether the homes actually contain any goods or not; or whether materialpossessions should be valued or condemned; or even whether one’s property reallyexists or is merely a figment of one’s subjective consciousness.Yet Libertarians do exactly this with respect to liberty. They want itsprotective shield, while nullifying everything that it safeguards. They wantliberty—the means—while rejecting values—the end. Nothing matters toLibertarians—not even the value of life itself—but somehow the freedom to be azero is of vital importance. They want to be free to act. To act how? Withoutpurpose or reason. To achieve what? Nothing in particular. But the belligerentpursuit of nothing in particular is in fact the pursuit of ... destruction. Itis the quest not for political, but for metaphysical “freedom,” which means:freedom from the demands of existence. Libertarians reject anything that tellsthem there is something they should not do, that there is something which willnot yield to their emotions, that there is something. Reality itself is thelimitation they ultimately resent. It is from the universe as such thatLibertarians wish to be “liberated.”There are undoubtedly many Libertarians who would argue that the litany ofirrationalities cited above does not represent their views. It is unjust, these“better” Libertarians would maintain, to denounce the entire movement on accountof the absurd statements of those who do not typify or understand it.It is these “better” Libertarians, however, who fail to understand the essenceof Libertarianism.The nature of an ideology is determined not by majority vote—but by logic, byanalyzing its essence and its necessary implications. The logic ofenvironmentalism, for example, leads to a society without technology; the logicof feminism leads to an egalitarian society in which men are not permitted tohave anything which women do not; the logic of the New Right leads totheocracy—even if various environmentalists, feminists, and conservatives woulddeny this. And what the logic of Libertarianism inexorably leads to is nihilism,regardless of how many Libertarians protest that this is not their intention.The full implications of an ideology’s central principle are often evaded by itsadherents. Many early supporters of Nazism in Germany, if asked, might very wellhave voted against the concentration camps. Does this mean that Hitler’satrocities reflect merely upon a number of sadistic Nazis but not upon Nazismper se? There are many Marxists who condemn the brutality of Soviet Russia,claiming that Moscow has abandoned the teachings of Karl Marx. Does this meanthat Marxism itself is absolved of responsibility for such standard communisthorrors as the machine-gunning of young children who try to escape across theBerlin wall? Obviously, all that this suggests is that many Nazis and Marxistsare blind to the essential nature of their own philosophies.Just as blind are those who claim that Libertarianism is compatible withlaissez-faire capitalism, with morality, with reason, and with the requirementsof human life.The Libertarian movement was created in order to adopt a “united front” approachto liberty, that is, to spread out a broad umbrella under which a motleycollection of people, irrespective of their philosophies, could gather in ajoint effort to advance freedom. Libertarianism’s one and only function is tobring together people who agree on nothing whatsoever except—ostensibly—thecontextless claim that the use of force is evil. Its essence is precisely tobypass all the ideas underlying liberty and to jump directly to the assertionthat the use of force is wrong.But if there is no why, there can be no what. If Libertarianism announces thatit need not offer any reason for its belief in liberty, then it cannot evenstate what it means by the term “liberty.” Everyone from Karl Marx to RalphNader can then say that he is fundamentally in favor of liberty, and there is noobjective means of disputing him. Why shouldn’t anarchism be regarded as theimplementation of genuine freedom? Why not describe libel and counterfeiting asactions fully consistent with individual rights? Why can’t Moscow be said to bepursuing a foreign policy of worldwide liberation? Why not invite Timothy Learyto speak at Libertarian conventions—or label Jesus Christ “a Libertarianmystic”39 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en102]—or glorify Yassir Arafat asa defender of “justice and property rights”40[rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en103]—or view God as “the UltimateNoninterventionist”?41 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en104] Once anytheory is acceptable, any practice must be equally tolerable.It is thus not just some Libertarians, but Libertarianism itself that isinherently subjectivist and therefore destructive. Imagine a group of physiciansforming an umbrella organization in order to promote health in a societyinfected by disease. But, not wishing to be overly restrictive, they refuse toestablish any basic principles. There are many avenues to health, they say;there is no need to take a position on why human health is desirable, or whatvalues and premises the science of medicine presupposes—that could “prejudice”one’s opinion against those who hold opposite premises. We just care aboutachieving health, they say; we don’t care why people join us. Imagine furtherthat as they go around lecturing on the importance of health, they areaccompanied on the podium by Christian Scientists, faith healers, and witchdoctors. They too support the value of “healing” —the physicians say—it does notmatter why they do so or what they mean by it. After all, that is just aquestion about “grounding,” not about the doctrine of health itself; so why carewhether health is attained by exorcising demons inside one’s body, or byfollowing objective medical principles? It’s all “health.”Those Libertarians who protest that they do not accept the premise of anarchismor of subjectivism or of nihilism simply refuse to see what is inherent in thefundamental nature and founding purpose of Libertarianism. Someone who agreeswith the essence of capitalism—the principle of individual rights—and endorsestariffs or unemployment benefits does not understand capitalism’s logicalimplications. By the same reasoning, someone who agrees with the essence ofLibertarianism—“liberty” as a baseless assertion—and yet opposes unilateral U.S.disarmament or the terrorism of the PLO is likewise contradicting his basicpremise.Libertarianism’s corrupt view of “liberty” also explains its attitude towardObjectivism.Although Objectivism, unlike the rest of today’s philosophies, advocateslaissez-faire capitalism, it is those other philosophies that Libertarianstolerate and only Objectivism that elicits from them widespread hostility. Theirpolicy of promiscuity in intellectual intercourse is suddenly replaced by one ofextreme fastidiousness when they encounter Objectivism.Libertarian writer Peter Breggin complains that the “books and philosophy of AynRand have set back Libertarianism in their unabashed assault on anything thatsmacks of humanitarianism or humanism. Human beings are loved and hated strictlyon the grounds of their ethical adherence to Objectivist principles and aregranted no value whatsoever on the basis of their common humanity, theirmembership in the species.”42 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en105] AynRand’s “legacy has been a tragic one”—says another Libertarian writer—“aconservatarian millstone around the neck of the Libertarian movement. And thatis why I say it’s time to dissociate ourselves from Rand and everything shestood for.”43 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#en106]So while Libertarians believe that there are many avenues to their notion ofliberty, they apparently draw the line at Objectivism—and they are entirelyright to do so. Objectivism is incompatible with Libertarianism on everyphilosophical issue. Objectivism says: live by reason, follow a rational code ofmorality, practice self-interest as a virtue, establish the principles oflimited government to define the appropriate use of retaliatory force. As itsname implies, Ayn Rand’s philosophy upholds an objective reality, objectivecognition, objective values, and objective law.Libertarianism’s relationship to Objectivism is not merely that of an enemy, butof a parasite. Without Objectivism there would, ironically, be no Libertarianmovement today. It is Objectivism that has offered a moral defense ofliberty—which Libertarianism has stolen and mutilated. It is Objectivism thathas imbued so many young people with a deep commitment to capitalism—whichLibertarianism has seized on and corrupted.Libertarianism seeks to appropriate some of the fruits of Objectivism whiletrying to uproot the tree. Its anti-conceptual nature makes it consistentlydesire effects without causes—politics without ethics, liberty without reason,social change without philosophy. It wants to use the words of Objectivism’snoninitiation-of-force principle, but not the ideas that give them meaning. Itwishes to feed off the by-products of Objectivism’s defense of capitalism, whilerepudiating the nature and roots of that defense.But the law of causality, like any metaphysical fact, cannot be circumvented.The attempt to do so can result only in that perversion of liberty which is theessence of Libertarianism.NOTES1 [rand_9781101137260_oeb_c31_r1.html#Ref-en64] “Frank S.

If I could be granted a wishoutside my power, it would be to meet and talk to someone like her again;unfortunately, I do not expect this wish to come true. The root of heruniqueness, which I had abundant opportunity to experience and enjoy in mythirty-year friendship with her, was the nature of her mental processes.The purpose of this intellectual memoir is not to report on the content of theideas I learned from Ayn Rand—whoever knows her books knows that already—but onher method of thinking as I observed it, her approach to the whole realm ofideas and therefore of living, her basic way of functioning cognitively in anysituation. Method is fundamental; it is that which underlies and shapes contentand thus all human achievement, in every field. Ayn Rand’s method of thinking isan eloquent case in point: it is the root of her genius and of her distinctiveart and philosophy. The mental processes she used in everyday life, fromadolescence on, were the processes that led her, one step at a time, to all ofher brilliant insights and to the principles of Objectivism.Because of the role of method in human life, I have often thought that thegreatest humanitarian service I could perform would be to leave the world arecord and analysis of Ayn Rand’s mind and how it worked. In the presentdiscussion, I can offer you at least a glimpse of what I was privileged to see.Near the end, I will say something less epistemotogical—about Ayn Rand as aperson.When I met Ayn Rand, in the spring of 1951, I was an ignorant, intelligentseventeen-year-old, an admirer of The Fountainhead, but one who knew nothingabout philosophy or how to think. Ayn Rand brought me up intellectually. In thenature of the case, therefore, some of my reminiscences are going to cast me inthe role of naive foil exhibiting her brilliance by contrast. This implicationdoes not bother me, however, because alongside my confusions and errors, I claimone offsetting virtue: I did finally learn and come to practice what Ayn Randtaught me.The strongest first impression I had of Ayn Rand on the fateful evening I mether—fatefut to my life—was her passion for ideas. I have never seen its equal. Icame to her California home that evening with a few broad questions suggested tome by The Fountainhead. One pertained to the issue of the moral and thepractical, attributes which I had always been told were opposites. The characterof Howard Roark, therefore, puzzled me, because he seemed to be both at once. SoI asked Ayn Rand to tell me which one she intended him to represent. This wasthe sort of issue—relating to the nature of ideals and their role in life—whichI had tried now and then, without much success, to discuss with family orteachers. Such issues were usually dismissed by the people I knew with a bromideor a shrug, amounting to the declaration: “Who knows and who cares?” Ayn Randknew and Ayn Rand cared.From the moment we started talking, she was vibrant, alert, alive. She listenedintently to my words, she extracted every drop of meaning and of confusion, andthen she answered. She spoke at length, first considering the question as Iphrased it, then the deeper implications she saw in it. At each step, sheexplained what were the facts supporting her viewpoint, what kinds of objectionsmight occur to me later if I pursued the topic, and what was the logical replyto them. She never suggested that I accept what she said on her say-so; on thecontrary, she was working diligently to get me to see the truth with my own eyesand mind. The result was a brilliant extemporaneous dissertation on man’s needof morality and therefore on the unity of the moral and the practical—in Roarkand in any rational person—along with an eloquent demonstration of the disasterscaused by the conventional viewpoint.I was astonished not only by the originality of her ideas, but even more by hermanner. She spoke as though it were urgent that I understand the issue and thatshe forestall every possible misinterpretation on my part. She was wringing outof herself every ounce of clarity she had. I have seen men lecturing to solemnhalls of graduate students, and men running for national office, dealing in themost literal sense with issues of life and death; but I have never seen anyonework as hard as she did to be fully understood, down to the root. Yet she wasdoing it in a drawing room, in answer to a question from a boy she had just met.Clearly, it was not the boy who primarily inspired her; it was the subject(though she would not have answered as she did if she had doubted my sincerity).Ayn Rand’s performance that evening opened up the world to me. She made me thinkfor the first time that thinking is important. I said to myself after I left herhome: “All of life will be different now. If she exists, everything ispossible.”As long as I knew Ayn Rand, her passion for ideas never abated. As a rule, shewrote in her office daily from noon until 6:30, and she often came out lookingexhilarated but utterly spent. But then if I or someone else would drop over andmake an intellectual observation or ask a question, she was suddenly,dramatically invigorated, and it might very well be midnight before she realizedthat she hadn’t yet eaten dinner. A day or even an hour spent on legalcontracts, or on business phone calls, or on shopping, or on having her hairdone, tired her out thoroughly. But philosophy—ideas—was the stimulant thatalways brought her back.She had such a passion for ideas because she thought that ideas arepractical—that they are the most practical things in the world. In this regard,her approach was the opposite of that which philosophers call “rationalism.”“Rationalism” amounts to the viewpoint that ideas are detached from reality,unrelated to daily events, and without significance for man’s actual life—thatthey are nothing but floating abstractions to be manipulated by ivory-towerintellectuals for their own amusement, just as other men manipulate chesspieces. This viewpoint dominates twentieth-century thinkers. When I went tocollege, I routinely heard philosophical theories being discussed or debated bymy professors as a purely academic matter. One professor was a follower ofImmanuel Kant, say, another was an opponent of Kant, but they spoke and acted asthough nothing separated them but dry, technical differences. After the debate,the two would go off arm in arm, buddies in spirit who had just finished a gameor a show and were now returning to the real world. It reminds me of the logicalpositivist I heard about years ago who gave a lecture on why the word “God” ismeaningless, then asked for directions to the nearest synagogue so he could sayhis prayers. The man was surprised that anyone was surprised by his request.“What has philosophy got to do with living?” he asked indignantly.After a few weeks of classes with such professors, I would come running to AynRand, chock-full of sophistry and fallacies, and she would spend twelve or evenfifteen unbroken hours struggling to straighten out my thinking again. Why didit matter so much to her? Because her own mental practice was the antithesis ofrationalism. To continue the same example, I remember asking her once long agowhy she was so vehement in denouncing Kant’s theories, particularly the abstractideas at the base of his system, such as his view that the world we perceive byour senses and mind is not real, but is only a creation of man’s subjectiveforms of awareness. I knew that Kant was wrong, but I did not understand at theage of twenty why the issue evoked in her so strong an emotion.She replied, in essence: “When someone says that reality is unreal or thatreason is subjective, he is, admittedly or not, attacking every conviction andevery value I hold. Everything I love in life—my work, my husband, my kind ofmusic, my freedom, the creativity of man’s mind—all of it rests on my perceptionof reality; all of it becomes a delusion and an impossibility if reason isimpotent. Once you concede Kant’s kind of approach, you unleash the destroyersamong men, the creatures who, freed of the need to be rational, will proceed—asin fact they have done since Kant—to expropriate the producers, sacrifice allvalues, and throw the rest of us into a fascist or communist dictatorship.”If you went up to an ordinary individual, itemized every object and person hecared for, then said to him seriously: “I intend to smash them all and leave yougroveling in the muck,” he would become indignant, even outraged. What set AynRand apart from mankind is the fact that she heard the whole item ization andthe intention to smash everything in the simple statement that “reality isunreal.” Most people in our age of pragmatism and skepticism shrug off broadgeneralizations about reality as mere talk—i.e., as floating abstractions—andreact only to relatively narrow utterances. Ayn Rand was the reverse. Shereacted much more intensely to philosophical ideas than to narrow concretes. Themore abstract an evil formulation, the more territory it covered, and thegreater, therefore, the destructive potential she saw in it.By the same token, if Ayn Rand heard a basic idea that she regarded as true—anidea upholding reality and reason, like many of the principles of Aristotle—sheresponded with profound respect, admiration, even gratitude. Ideas to her werenot a parlor game. They were man’s form of grasping the world, and they werethus an essential of human action and survival. So true ideas were an invaluableasset, and false ones a potential disaster.Just as Ayn Rand did not detach abstractions from concretes, so she did notallow concretes to remain detached from abstractions. That is, she rejectedtoday’s widespread policy of staring at daily events in a vacuum, then wailingthat life is unintelligible. What a man does, she held, is a product of what hethinks. To be understood, therefore, a man’s actions have to be seen in relationto his ideas. Whether she encountered an inspiring novel by Victor Hugo,accordingly, or some horror spawned by Progressive education, or America’sthrilling venture into space, or the latest catastrophe out of Washington, orthe seemingly incomprehensible behavior of a friend she had trusted—whatever itwas, she was always intent on explaining it by identifying the ideas at itsroot. Since abstractions, in her philosophy, are man’s means of grasping anddealing with concretes, she actually used them for that purpose. She would notrest content either with floating theories or with unintelligible news items.She always required a crucial unity: theory and reality, or ideas and facts, orconcepts and percepts.Now I think you can see how Ayn Rand arrived at the most revolutionary elementin Objectivism, her theory of concepts. I asked her about this once. She told methat she was talking one day to a Thomist and disagreed with the theory ofconcepts the man was advancing. “Well, then,” Ayn Rand was asked, “where do youthink concepts come from?” “Let me introspect a moment and see what my mind doesin forming a concept,” she replied, “because I haven’t yet considered thisquestion.” Whereupon, after a few minutes of silence, she came up with her ideaof measurement-omission as the essence of abstraction. I was always astounded bythis feat of philosophic creativity; it seemed as though she had solved theproblem of the ages by a casual glance inward. But now I think I understand it.What I see is that Ayn Rand’s theory of concepts was implicit from the time ofher adolescence in her basic mental approach—in her recognition of the fact thatconcepts are not supernatural or arbitrary, but rather are instruments enablingmen to integrate perceptual data. The rest of her theory of concepts is reallyan elaboration of this fundamental, although of course it takes a genius todiscover such an elaboration.Ayn Rand regarded ideas as important to human life—as the shaper of man’scharacter, his culture, his history, his future—because she knew what an ideais. She knew that an idea is not a social ritual, but a means of cognition.If ideas are as crucial as this, then they must be dealt with properly—whichbrings me to the center of the present discussion: the specific steps of AynRand’s intellectual method. In her own thinking, she always distinguished the“what,” as she called it, from the “how”: what she knew, and how (by what means)she knew it. If you disagreed with her about a particular conclusion, you didnot argue the point for long, because the discussion soon changed to method. Toher, the “how” was the burning issue in life; it was the thing that gave rise tothe “what.” So let us look at some of the distinctive steps of Ayn Rand’smethod. The best way to approach this subject briefly is through the issue ofprinciples.Ayn Rand thought in terms of principles. In the sense I mean it, this is a rarephenomenon. I personally had never encountered or even imagined it before I mether, and most people have no idea of it at all. Let me start here by giving youan example; it is the one on which I first discovered the issue, about a yearafter I met Ayn Rand.I had been taking an ethics course in college and was thoroughly confused aboutthe virtue of honesty. I was not tempted to be dishonest myself, but I did notsee how to prove the evil of lying. (I speak throughout of lying in order togain some value from others, as against lying to defend oneself from criminals,which is perfectly moral.) On my own, I rejected the two dominant schools inregard to honesty: the religious school, which holds that lying is absolutelywrong because God forbids it; and the Utilitarian school, which holds that thereare no absolutes and that one has to judge each case “on its own merits,”according to the probable consequences of any given lie. I rejected the first ofthese as mystical, the second as brute expediency. But what could constitute athird interpretation? I had no idea, so I went to Ayn Rand.She started her answer by asking me to invent the most plausible lie I couldthink of. I don’t remember the details any longer, but I know that I did proceedto concoct a pretty good con-man scheme for bilking investors out of large sumsof money. Ayn Rand then analyzed the example patiently, for thirty or fortyminutes, showing me on my own material how one lie would lead necessarily toanother, how I would be forced into contradictory lies, how I would graduallybecome trapped in my own escalating deceptions, and why, therefore, sooner orlater, in one form or another, my con-man scheme would have to backfire and leadto the loss of the very things I was seeking to gain by it. If you areinterested in the content of her analysis, I have re-created the substance ofthis lengthy discussion in my next book, Objectivism: The Philosophy of AynRand.The point now, however, lies in what happened next. My immediate reaction to herreply was to amend my initial scheme in order to remove the particularweaknesses she had found in it. So I made up a second con-man scheme, and againshe analyzed it patiently, showing that it would lead to the same disastrousresults even though most of the details were now different. Whereupon, in allinnocence, I started to invent a third scheme (I was only 18). But Ayn Rand bythis time was fed up. “Can’t you think in principle?” she asked me.Let me condense into a few paragraphs what she then explained to me at length.“The essence of a con-man’s lie,” she began, “of any such lie, no matter whatthe details, is the attempt to gain a value by faking certain facts of reality.”She went on: “Now can’t you grasp the logical consequences of that kind ofpolicy? Since all facts of reality are interrelated, faking one of them leadsthe person to fake others; ultimately, he is committed to an all-out war againstreality as such. But this is the kind of war no one can win. If life in realityis a man’s purpose, how can he expect to achieve it while struggling at the sametime to escape and defeat reality?”And she concluded: “The con-man’s lies are wrong on principle. To state theprinciple positively: honesty is a long-range requirement of humanself-preservation and is, therefore, a moral obligation.”This was not merely a new ethical argument to me. It was a whole new form ofthought. She was saying, in effect: you do not have to consult some supernaturalauthority for intellectual guidance, nor try to judge particular cases in avacuum and on to infinity. Rather, you first abstract the essence of a series ofconcretes. Then you identify, by an appropriate use of logic, the necessaryimplications or result of this essence. You thereby reach a fundamentalgeneralization, a principle, which subsumes and enables you to deal with anunlimited number of instances—past, present, and future. The consequence, inthis example, is an absolute prohibition against the con-man mentality—aprohibition based not on God, but on perception and thought.Ayn Rand applied this method not only to lying or to moral issues, but to everyfact and question she studied. She applied it in every branch of philosophy,from metaphysics to esthetics. If she saw that the sun rises every day, she didnot, like David Hume, consider it a puzzling coincidence. She identified theessence of the event: an entity acting in accordance with its nature; andthereby was able to reach and validate the principle of causality. Or, if sheadmired the novels of Hugo and the plays of Friedrich Schiller, she did not saymerely: “I like their grand-scale protagonists.” She identified the essence ofsuch art: the depiction of man as a being with volition; and thereby was able toreach and validate the principle of Romanticism in art. This kind of method isthe root of a whole new approach to thought. It led her a step at a time to aphilosophy that is neither mystical nor skeptical, but objective; one thatneither bases knowledge on revelation nor succumbs to relativism, but thatteaches men to conceptualize logically the data of observation. Such aphilosophy enables us to discover absolutes which are not supernatural, butrational and this-worldly.Ayn Rand started thinking in terms of principles, she told me once, at the ageof twelve. To her, it was a normal part of the process of growing up, and shenever dropped the method thereafter. Nor, I believe, did she ever entirelycomprehend the fact that the approach which was second nature to her was notpracticed by other people. Much of the time, she was baffled by or indignant atthe people she was doomed to talk to, people like the man we heard about in theearly 1950s, who was calling for the nationalization of the steel industry. Theman was told by an Objectivist why government seizure of the steel industry wasimmoral and impractical, and he was impressed by the argument. His comeback was:“Okay, I see that. But what about the coal industry?”The method of thinking in principle involves many complexities, about which Iintend, someday, to write an entire volume. But let me mention here a fewfurther aspects, to give you a fuller picture of Ayn Rand’s approach. You recallthat, to reach the principle that honesty is a virtue, we had first to grasp theessence of lying. Let us focus now on this issue, i.e., thinking in essentials,which was an essential part of Ayn Rand’s method of thinking.The concept of “essential” was originated by Aristotle in connection with histheory of definition. He used the term to name the quality that makes an entitythe distinctive kind of thing it is, as against what he called the “accidental”qualities. For example, having a rational faculty is essential to being a man.But having blue eyes rather than green is not; it is a mere detail or accidentof a particular case. Ayn Rand’s commitment to essentials grew out of thisAristotelian theory, although she modified the concept significantly andexpanded its role in human thought.For Ayn Rand, thinking in essentials was not restricted to the issue ofdefinitions. It was a method of understanding any complex situation bydeliberately setting aside irrelevancies—such as insignificant details,superficial similarities, unimportant differences—and going instead to the heartof the matter, to the aspects which, as we may say, constitute the distinctivecore or being of the situation. This is something Ayn Rand herself didbrilliantly. I always thought of her, metaphorically, as possessing a specialpower of vision, which could penetrate beneath the surface data that most peoplesee, just as an X-ray machine penetrates beneath the flesh that meets our eyesto reveal the crucial underlying structures.This kind of penetration is precisely what was lacking in the man I justmentioned, who could see no connection between the steel and the coalindustries. Ayn Rand, by contrast, knew at once that steel in this context is amere detail. She went to the essence of nationalization: government forceunleashed against the minds of productive, thinking men—a practice common tocountless cases beyond steel, and one that will have a certain kind of effect nomatter where it occurs. This is the kind of mental process that is required ifone is to reach a generalization uniting many cases. It is the process that isrequired if one is to champion capitalism as a matter of principle, rather than,like today’s conservatives, clamoring merely for the removal of some randomcontrols.In the deepest epistemological sense, Ayn Rand was the opposite of anegalitarian. She did not regard every aspect of a whole as equal in importanceto every other. Some aspects, she held, are crucial to a proper understanding;others merely clutter up the cognitive landscape and distract lesser minds fromthe truth. So the task of the thinker is to distinguish the two, i.e., toanalyze and process the data confronting him, not to amass mounds of informationwithout any attempt at mental digestion. She herself always functioned like anintellectual detective, a philosophical Hercule Poirot, reading, watching,listening for the fact, the statement, the perspective that would illuminate awhole, tortuous complexity—the one that would reveal the essence and therebysuddenly make that complexity simple and intelligible. The result was oftendramatic. When you were with her, you always felt poised on the brink of somestartling new cognitive adventure and discovery.Here is an example of what I mean. In the 1970s, Ayn Rand and I were watchingthe Academy Awards on television; it was the evening when a streaker flashed byduring the ceremonies. Most people probably dismissed the incident with someremark like: “He’s just a kid” or “It’s a high-spirited prank” or “He wants toget on TV.” But not Ayn Rand. Why, her mind wanted to know, does this “kid” actin this particular fashion? What is the difference between his “prank” and thatof college students on a lark who swallow goldfish or stuff themselves intotelephone booths? How does his desire to appear on TV differ from that of atypical game-show contestant? In other words, Ayn Rand swept aside from theoutset the superficial aspects of the incident and the standard irrelevantcomments in order to reach the essence, which had to pertain to this specificaction in this distinctive setting.“Here,” she said to me in effect, “is a nationally acclaimed occasion repletewith celebrities, jeweled ball gowns, coveted prizes, and breathless cameras, anoccasion offered to the country as the height of excitement, elegance,glamor—and what this creature wants to do is drop his pants in the middle of itall and thrust his bare buttocks into everybody’s face. What then is his motive?Not high spirits or TV coverage, but destruction—the satisfaction of sneering atand undercutting that which the rest of the country looks up to and admires.” Inessence, she concluded, the incident was an example of nihilism, which is thedesire not to have or enjoy values, but to nullify and eradicate them.Nor did she stop there. The purpose of using concepts—and the precondition ofreaching principles—is the integration of observed facts; in other words, thebringing together in one’s mind of many different examples or fields, such asthe steel and the coal industries, for instance. Ayn Rand was expert at thisprocess. For her, grasping the essence of an event was merely the beginning ofprocessing it cognitively. The next step was to identify that essence in other,seemingly very different areas, and thereby discover a common denominatoruniting them all.Having grasped the streaker’s nihilism, therefore, she was eager to point outsome different examples of the same attitude. Modern literature, she observed,is distinguished by its creators’ passion not to offer something new andpositive, but to wipe out: to eliminate plots, heroes, motivation, even grammarand syntax; this represents the brazen desire to destroy an entire art formalong with the great writers of the past by stripping away from literature everyone of its cardinal attributes. Just as Progressive education is the desire foreducation stripped of lessons, reading, facts, teaching, and learning. Just asavant-garde physics is the gleeful cry that there is no order in nature, no law,no predictability, no causality. That streaker, in short, was the very oppositeof an isolated phenomenon. He was a microcosm of the principle ruling modernculture, a fleeting representative of that corrupt motivation which Ayn Rand hasdescribed so eloquently as “hatred of the good for being the good.” And whataccounts for such widespread hatred? she asked at the end. Her answer brings usback to the philosophy we referred to earlier, the one that attacks reason andreality wholesale and thus makes all values impossible: the philosophy ofImmanuel Kant.Listening to Ayn Rand that evening, I felt that I was beginning to understandwhat it means really to understand an event. I went home and proceeded to writethe chapter in The Ominous Parallels dealing with Weimar culture, which developsat length Ayn Rand’s analysis of the modern intellectual trend, The point here,however, is not her analysis, but the method that underlies it: observation offacts; the identification of the essential; the integration of data from manydisparate fields; then the culminating overview, the grasp of principle.I use the term “overview” deliberately, because I always felt as though everyoneelse had their faces pressed up close to an event and were staring at itmyopically, while she was standing on a mountaintop, sweeping the world with asingle glance, and thus was able to identify the most startling connections, notonly between streaking and literature, but also between sex and economics, artand business, William F. Buckley and Edward Kennedy. She was able to unite thekinds of things that other people automatically pigeonhole into separatecompartments. Her universe, as a result, was a single whole, with all its partsinterrelated and intelligible; it was not the scattered fragments and fiefdomsthat are all most people know. To change the image: she was like a ballet dancerof the intellect, leaping from fact to fact and field to field, not by thestrength of her legs, but by the power of logic, a power that most men do notseem fully to have discovered yet.The unity of Ayn Rand’s universe rested on more than I can indicate here. But Iwant to mention a last aspect of her method, one which is crucial in thisregard: thinking in terms of fundamentals.By “fundamental” I mean that on which everything else in a given contextdepends, that which is the base or groundwork on which a whole development isbuilt. This concept is necessary because human knowledge, like a skyscraper, hasa structure: certain ideas are the ground floor or foundation of cognition,while other ideas, like the upper stories of a building, are dependents, nobetter or stronger than the foundation on which they rely. Thinking in terms offundamentals means never accepting a conclusion while ignoring its base; itmeans knowing and validating the deepest ideas on which one’s conclusion rests.For instance, in our discussion of honesty, we said that lying is wrong becauseit is incompatible with the requirements of self-preservation. What base were wecounting on? Clearly, a certain ethical theory, the one that upholdsself-preservation as man’s proper goal—in contrast to the ethics that advocatesself-sacrifice for the sake of others. If you accept this latter theory, ourwhole argument against lying collapses. Why should a man who is committed toselfless service necessarily tell the truth? What if, as often happens, otherswant him to lie and claim that it is essential to their happiness?But this is just the beginning of our quest for fundamentals, because the fieldof ethics itself rests on the basic branches of philosophy, as you can see inthis same example. How did we prove that lying is self-destructive? We said thata policy of lying leads to a war against reality, which no one can win. Well,why can’t anyone? What ideas are we counting on here? Clearly, that there is areality; that it is what it is independent of our desires; and that our mindsare able to know these facts, i.e., to know reality. The issue of lying, in sum,whatever view of it one takes, is merely a consequence. It is a derivative,which rests on a complex philosophic foundation.Thinking in terms of fundamentals is not an independent aspect of Ayn Rand’smethod; it is an inherent part of thinking in principle. If one ignored theissue of fundamentals, his so-called principles would be merely a heap ofdisconnected, random claims—tike a catalog of divine commandments—and they wouldbe of no help in understanding the world or guiding one’s action. One would notbe able to prove or even retain the items in such a heap; they would be nothingbut floating abstractions. Only ideas organized into a logical structure can betied to reality, and only such ideas, therefore, can be of use or value to man;and that means principles based on antecedent principles, going back ultimatelyto the fundamentals of philosophy.Ayn Rand’s real intellectual interest was emphatically not politics. Of course,she was a champion of capitalism and freedom. But unlike today’s libertariansand conservatives, she was a thinker; she was not content to preach liberty orprivate property as though they were self-evident axioms. She wanted to knowwhat they depend on and how they can be proved, all the way back to metaphysicsand epistemology. This is why she admired Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas even morethan she did Thomas Jefferson, and why, to the amazement of today’s businessmen,she hated Kant and Hegel much more than income taxes. It is also why, startingwith an interest in political questions, she was led eventually to formulate anoverall system of thought, expressing a complete philosophy of life.Ayn Rand’s mind had an exalted quality, one shared by only a handful of kindredspirits across the ages. Hers was a mind with the profundity of a truephilosopher; a mind that greeted the deepest issues of man’s life with solemnreverence and ruthless logic; a mind that derived its greatest joy and itspersonal fulfillment from the rational study of fundamentals. In our age ofmediocrity and anti-philosophy, this fact doomed her to a certain loneliness. Itmade her a unique personality, unable to find her equal, just as her product,the philosophy of reason that she called Objectivism, is unique and unequaled.If you want to know what Ayn Rand was like as a person, I can now answer simply:you already know it, because she was just what she had to be given the nature ofher intellectual processes. Ayn Rand the person was an expression and corollaryof Ayn Rand the mind.Ayn Rand herself repudiated any dichotomy between mind and person. Her mind, sheheld, was the essence of her person: it was her highest value, the source of herother values, and the root of her character traits. Thinking, to her, was notmerely an interest or even a passion; it was a lifestyle. When she greeted you,for instance, she often asked not “How are you?” but “How’s your universe?” Hermeaning was: “How’s your view of the universe? Have the problems of daily lifeswamped your philosophical knowledge? Or are you still holding on to the factthat reality is intelligible and that values are possible?” Similarly, when youleft, she would say not “Goodbye,” but “Good premises.” In other words: “Don’tcount on luck or God for success, but on your own thinking.” If self-esteemmeans confidence in the power of one’s mind, then the explanation of Ayn Rand’sprofound self-esteem is obvious: she earned it—both in virtue of the value sheascribed to the mind, and of the meticulous method by which she used her own.Another result of this method was that attribute men call “strength ofcharacter.” Ayn Rand was immutable. I never saw her adapting her personality toplease another individual. She was always the same and always herself, whethershe was talking with me alone, or attending a cocktail party of celebrities, orbeing cheered or booed by a hall full of college students, or being interviewedon national television. She took on the whole world—liberals, conservatives,communists, religionists, Babbitts, and avant-garde alike—but opposition had nopower to sway her. She knew too clearly how she had reached her ideas, why theywere true, and what their opposites were doing to mankind. Nor, like HowardRoark, could she ever be tempted to betray her convictions. Since she hadintegrated her principles into a consistent system, she knew that to violate asingle one would be to discard the totality. A Texas oil man once offered her upto a million dollars to use in spreading her philosophy, if she would only add areligious element to it to make it more popular. She threw his proposal into thewastebasket. “What would I do with his money,” she asked me indignantly, “if Ihave to give up my mind in order to get it?”Dedication to thought and thus to her work was the root of Ayn Rand’s person; itwas not, however, her only passion. As a result of this root, she held intensevalues in every department of life. She loved her husband of fifty years, FrankO‘Connor, a sensitive, intense man, not nearly as intellectual as she but justas independent and deep in his own quiet way. He is the exception to mystatement that she never found an equal. Frank did not have her mind; but hisdedication to his work as a painter, his extravagant Romanticism, his innocent,sunlit sense of life, and, I may add, the visible joy he took in her work and inher person—all this made it plain that he did share her soul.As to Ayn Rand’s other values, I have hardly room here even to mention a sample.Some of them are obvious from her writings, such as America, skyscrapers, moderntechnology, man the hero, the great romantic artists of the nineteenth century,the silent German movies from her childhood that she always tried to find again,Agatha Christie, TV’s Perry Mason—and there were so many more, from her cats toher lion pictures to her Adrian clothes to her vivid, outsize jewelry to herstamp collecting to her favorite candy (Godiva chocolates) and even her favoritecolor (blue-green). In every aspect of life, she once told me, a man should havefavorites; he should define what he likes most and why, and then proceed to getit. She always did just that—from fleeing the Soviet dictatorship for America,to tripping her future husband on a movie set to get him to notice her, toransacking ancient record shops to unearth some lost treasure, to decorating herapartment with an abundance of blue-green pillows, ashtrays, and even walls.Ayn Rand was a woman dominated by values, values that were consistentexpressions of a single view of life—which is what you might expect of a greatthinker who was at once a moralist and an artist. The corollary is that she hadstrong dislikes in every department, too. You cannot love something withoutrejecting just as passionately that which you see as the antithesis of yourlove. Most people do not know their values clearly or hold them consistently;their desires are correspondingly vague, ambivalent, contradictory. To many suchpeople, Ayn Rand’s violent aliveness and assertiveness were shocking, evenintimidating. To me, however, they were a tonic. I felt as though other peoplewere drawn in wishy-washy shades of gray, whereas her soul was made of brilliantcolor.Unfortunately—and here I turn for a moment to a somber topic—the wishy-washypeople often wanted something from Ayn Rand and were drawn to her circle. A fewof them wanted simply to advance their careers by cashing in on her fame andfollowing. Others craved the security they found in her approval. Still othershad an element of sincerity during their youth, but turned anti-intellectual asthey grew older. These people did what they had to do in order to get from AynRand what they wanted.What they did usually was to give her the appearance of being the philosophicalintelligence she desperately wanted to meet. They were glib, articulate,sometimes even brilliant people. They absorbed the surface features of AynRand’s intellectual style and viewpoint as though by osmosis and then mimickedthem. Often, because she was so open, they knew what she wanted them to say, andthey said it convincingly. Though uninterested in philosophy and evencontemptuous of fundamentals, they could put on an expert act to the contrary,most often an act for themselves first of all. Ayn Rand was not the only personto be taken in by it. I knew most of these people well and, to be fair here, Imust admit that I was even more deluded about them than she was.All of these types ended up resenting Ayn Rand, and even hating her. They feltincreasingly bored by the realm of ideas, and chafed under the necessity ofsuppressing their real self in order to keep up the pretense of intellectualpassion. Above all, they found Ayn Rand’s commitment to morality intolerable. Inher mind, moral principles were requirements of man’s survival proved byreference to the deepest premises of philosophy; they were thus the opposite ofa luxury or a social convention; they were life-or-death absolutes. When she sawa moral breach, therefore—such as dishonesty or moral compromise or power lustor selling one’s soul to the Establishment like Peter Keating—she knew what itmeant and where it would lead, and she condemned the individual roundly.To the types of people we are talking about, this was an unbearable reproach.They could accept Objectivism as pure theory for a while, but only as theory.When they were tested by life, they gave in guiltily, one at a time, to thesundry pressures they encountered, and they shrank thereafter from facing her.Usually they ended up artfully concealing their resentment, saying that theystill admired, even adored, Ayn Rand and her philosophy, but not, as they putit, her “moralizing” or her “anger.” Her “moralizing” means the fact that shepronounced moral judgments, i.e., applied her philosophy to real life. Her“anger” in this context means that she took her judgments seriously.Several of these individuals are now publishing their memoirs in the hopes ofgetting even with Ayn Rand at last—and also of cashing in on her corpse. At thislatter goal, regrettably, some of them seem to be succeeding.Ayn Rand refused to make collective judgments. Each time she unmasked one ofthese individuals she struggled to learn from her mistake. But then she would bedeceived again by some new variant.Her basic error was that she took herself as the human standard or norm (as in asense we all must do, since we have no direct contact with any humanconsciousness but our own). So if she saw all the outward signs of philosophicalenthusiasm and activity, she took it to mean that the individual was, in effect,an intellectual equal of hers, who regarded ideas in the same way she did. Aftera long while, I came to understand this error. I realized how extraordinary hermind really was, and I tried to explain to her her many disappointments withpeople.“You are suffering the fate of a genius trapped in a rotten culture,” I wouldbegin. “My distinctive attribute,” she would retort, “is not genius, butintellectual honesty.” “That is part of it,” I would concede, “but after all Iam intellectually honest, too, and it doesn’t make me the kind of epochal mindwho can write Atlas Shrugged or discover Objectivism.” “One can’t look atoneself that way,” she would answer me. “No one can say: ‘Ah me! the genius ofthe ages.’ My perspective as a creator has to be not ‘How great I am’ but ’Howtrue this idea is and how clear, if only men were honest enough to face thetruth.‘ ” So, for understandable reasons, we reached an impasse. She kept hopingto meet an equal; I knew that she never would. For once, I felt, I had the broadhistorical perspective, the perspective on her, that in the nature of the caseshe could not have.In order to be fully clear at this point, I want to make one more comment aboutAyn Rand’s anger. Many times, as I have explained, it was thoroughly justified.But sometimes it was not justified. For instance, Ayn Rand not infrequentlybecame angry at me over some philosophical statement I made that seemed for themoment to ally me with one of the intellectual movements she was fighting. Onmany such occasions, of course, she remained calm because she understood thecause of my statement : that I still had a great deal to learn. But other timesshe did not; she did not grasp fully the gulf that separates the historicmaster, to whom the truth is obvious, from the merely intelligent student. Sinceher mind immediately integrated a remark to the fundamentals it presupposes, shewould project at once, almost automatically, the full, horrendous meaning ofwhat I had uttered, and then she would be shocked at me. Once I explained that Ihad not understood the issue at all, her anger melted and she became intent onclarifying the truth for me. The anger she felt on such occasions was mistaken,but it was not irrational. Its root was her failure to appreciate her ownintellectual uniqueness.I should add here that I never saw her hold an unadmitted grudge. Her angernever festered unexpressed or turned into devious, brooding hatred. It was animmediate, open storm of indignant protest—then it was over. In this respect,she was the easiest person in the world to know and to deal with.Did I ever get angry at Ayn Rand’s anger at me? Certainly I did. But my angerdid not matter to me and did not last. To me, her temper was an infinitesimalprice to pay for the values I was gaining from her. The world, I knew, is fullof kindly souls who specialize in loving everybody and forgiving everything; butthese souls bored me. I wanted out of life that which Ayn Rand alone, in all herfiery genius, had to offer.This brings me to my final topic. Whatever Ayn Rand’s anger, herdisappointments, her pain, they went down, as she said about Roark, only to acertain point. Beneath it was her self-esteem, her values, and her convictionthat happiness, not pain, is what matters. People sometimes ask: “But did sheachieve happiness in her own life?” My answer would consist of three images.One is the memory of a spring day in 1957; we were walking up Madison Avenuetoward the office of Random House, which was in the process of bringing outAtlas Shrugged. She was looking at the city she had always loved most, and now,after decades of rejection and bitter poverty, she had seen the top publishersin that city competing for what she knew, triumphantly, was her masterpiece. Sheturned to me suddenly and said: “Don’t ever give up what you want in life. Thestruggle is worth it.” I never forgot that. I can still see the look of quietradiance on her face.Then I see the image of her one night at a party, perhaps twenty years ago now;she was sitting on a couch with some other guests, looking shy, bored, andmiserable. Then her husband, who had been working late, arrived, and she calledout “Cubbyhole” (her pet name for him), insisting, as she always did, that hesqueeze onto the couch beside her so that they could hold hands. And they smiledat each other, and she relaxed visibly, and he patted her hand and called her“Fluff” (his name for her).Then I see her as she was turning seventy, on the morning when she, Frank, and Icame home from the hospital after her lung surgery. It was still difficult forher to walk, but she wanted to play her “tiddlywink” music, as she always calledit—gay, lighthearted, utterly cheerful popular tunes from the turn of thecentury, which have no counterpart today. And she got up and began to marcharound the living room to the music, tossing her head, grinning at us, markingthe beat by waving her little baton, Frank all the while beaming at her from hiseasy chair. If ever I want to think of a non-tragic spectacle, I remember that.Ayn Rand did experience unhappiness in her life. But if you ask me: was she ahappy person? I have only one answer to give you. She was.Ladies and gentlemen: in my judgment, Ayn Rand did live by her philosophy.Whatever her errors, she practiced what she preached, both epistemologically andmorally. As a result, she did achieve in her life that which she set out toachieve; she achieved it intellectually, artistically, emotionally. But for youto judge these matters yourself and reach an objective view of Ayn Rand, youmust be an unusually philosophical kind of person, because you are living in aKantian, anti-value culture, and you are going to be offered some very oppositeaccounts of the facts of her life. So you have to know: what is objectivity?What sort of testimony qualifies as evidence in this context? What do youbelieve is possible to a man—or a woman? What kind of soul do you think it takesto write Atlas Shrugged? And what do you want to see in a historic figure?I am not a Kantian. I do not believe that we can know Ayn Rand only as sheappeared to somebody or other. But if I were to grant that premise for a splitsecond, if I were to agree that we all construe reality according to our ownpersonal preferences, then I would still draw a fundamental moral distinctionbetween two kinds of preferences: between those of the muckrak ers and those ofthe hero-worshipers. It is the distinction between the people who, confronted bya genius, are seized with a passion to ferret out flaws, real or imaginary,i.e., to find feet of clay so as to justify their own blighted lives—as againstthe people who, desperate to feel admiration, want to dismiss any flaw astrivial because nothing matters to them in such a context but the sight of thehuman greatness that inspires and awes them. In this kind of clash, I am sure,you recognize where I stand.I knew Ayn Rand longer than anyone now alive. I do not believe that my view ofher is subjective. But if I am to go down in history as her apologist orglamorizer, then so be it. I am proud to be cursed as a “cultist,” if the “cult”is unbreached dedication to the mind and to its most illustrious exponents.According to the Objectivist esthetics, a crucial purpose of art is to depictman as he might be and ought to be, and thereby provide the reader or viewerwith the pleasure of contemplating, in concrete, embodied form, his abstractmoral ideal. Howard Roark and John Galt provide this kind of inspiration to me,and to many other people I know. What I want to add in closing is that Ayn Randin person provided it, too. Because of the power of her mind and the purity ofher soul, she gave me, when I was with her, what her novels give me: a sense oflife as exaltation, the sense of living in a clean, uplifted, benevolent world,in which the good has every chance of winning, and the evil does not have to betaken seriously. I often felt, greeting her, as though I were entering theAtlantis of Atlas Shrugged, where the human ideal is not merely an elusiveprojection to be reached somehow, but is real, alive, here—seated across theroom on the blue-green pillows, smiling delightedly, eager to talk philosophywith me, eyes huge, brilliant, penetrating.That is the Ayn Rand I knew. And that is why I loved her."}]
