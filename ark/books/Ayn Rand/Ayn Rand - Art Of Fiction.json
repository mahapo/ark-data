It was the year after the publication ofAtlas Shrugged, and AR was at the peak of her powers as a novelist.She gave the course, by “popular demand,” to some twenty or so friends andacquaintances. She spoke extemporaneously, with only a few written notes namingthe topics she meant to cover. Including questions and discussion, each of thetwelve sessions lasted about four hours.Two kinds of students attended: aspiring young fiction writers, and fictionreaders from a variety of professions. These two groups are the audience to whomthe present book is addressed.The goal of the writers was obvious and practical: to learn everything possibleabout the problems and techniques of their craft. The readers, by contrast, ofwhom I was one, were there strictly as consumers; we wanted to enhance ourenjoyment in reading. We wanted to know from the master what to look for infiction and where it had come from, i.e., what had gone on behind the scenes, inthe creator’s mind, to produce the stories we loved (or hated). We were notcontent to grasp a book as a finished whole; we wanted to hear AR analyze thepleasures (or misery) a book evoked, and explain by what means its effects hadbeen achieved.Since AR held that fiction has four essential elements—theme, plot,characterization, and style—the lectures are organized accordingly, with thegreatest emphasis on plot and style.In regard to plot, AR identifies not only its nature and structure, but also itscrucial relationships to theme and to a critical category of her own creation:“plot-theme.” To concretize her theory, she analyzes many plots, some inventedby her for the course, explaining what makes each good or bad and by what stepsthe bad ones could be methodically improved.The tour de force of the book is its discussion of style, which occupies almostone half of the text. AR analyzes lengthy passages (describing love, nature, orNew York City) from a variety of authors, often one sentence at a time. Byjuxtaposing different authors and by rewriting selected sentences, sheidentifies the essentials of several antithetical literary styles, showing inthe process what different wordings do to a scene (and to a reader). Writerssuch as Victor Hugo, Sinclair Lewis, Thomas Wolfe, and Mickey Spillane arecovered—as well as AR herself. By rewriting her own sentences, she shows instartling terms how seemingly minor, even trivial, changes can utterly destroyor reverse an artistic effect.I can only hint here at other fascinating topics between these covers. ARexplains how to stock one’s own subconscious and thus create one’s own“inspiration” as a writer. She explains what to do when one is blocked, or, inher words, suffering from “the squirms.” She discusses drama versus melodrama;what makes a character intelligible and a characterization profound; thedifference between authors who “tell” and those who “show”; the nature of properversus sick or vicious humor; how to handle, or as reader evaluate, fantasy,tragedy, flashbacks, exposition, slang, metaphors; and much, much more.AR was expert at philosophical detection. Although this course focuses on theprinciples of literature, it identifies—as AR characteristically does—thedeepest philosophic issues involved. Those unfamiliar with philosophy will beastonished to discover the extent to which abstract issues—such as the mind-bodyquestion, or the free will-determinism controversy, or the advocacy of reasonversus of faith—actually influence a writer of fiction, shaping his selection ofevents, his method of characterization, and even his way of combining words intoa sentence.AR’s book on esthetics, The Romantic Manifesto, was based in part on the same1958 lecture course. Because the Manifesto deals largely with art in general,however, there is little overlap with the present book. On the contrary, The Artof Fiction serves as an extended concretization of the Objectivist esthetics,and thus as an invaluable supplement to the Manifesto. Most of its content isunavailable in AR’s other books.Tore Boeckmann has done an outstanding job as editor. I suggested to him anextremely difficult assignment: to give us AR faithfully—the identical pointsand words—but freed of the awkwardness, the repetitions, the obscurities, andthe grammatical lapses inherent in extemporaneous speech. Mr. Boeckmann hasdelivered superlatively. I have personally checked every sentence of the finalmanuscript. Now and then, I thought that some nuance within a sentence of AR’shad been unnecessarily cut (these have been reinstated). Not once, however, didthe editor omit, enlarge, or misrepresent AR’s thought, not even in the subtlestof cases. Using the original lecture transcripts as his base, Mr. Boeckmann hasproduced the virtually impossible: AR’s exact ideas and language—in the form ofwritten expression, as against oral. This, I believe, is the only form in whichAR herself would have wanted these lectures to be published.If anyone wishes to check Mr. Boeckmann’s accuracy, the original lectures arestill available on cassette from Second Renaissance Books, 143 West Street, NewMilford, CT 06776.When I first read the manuscript, I was astonished to find how much, in thedecades since 1958, I had forgotten. I had expected to move nostalgicallythrough familiar material, but I found myself continually arrested by AR’sunique insights and colorful illustrations. I was also moved by passages whoselanguage and passion evoked for me the inimitable personality of AR herself.You too can now experience the joys of attending a course in AR’s living room.You cannot ask her questions, as I could. But you can soak up her answers.If you do not know her philosophy of Objectivism, you will probably be shockedby some of AR’s ideas—but I am certain that you will not be bored. And I thinkthat you will profit from the reading.If you do share AR’s philosophy, I know that you will enjoy this book.—Leonard PeikoffIrvine, CaliforniaSeptember 1998"},{"pageContent":"EDITOR’S PREFACEAyn Rand prepared for each of her lectures on fiction only by making some briefnotes on a sheet or two of paper. For instance, the material presented here asChapter 1 (“Writing and the Subconscious”) was delivered on the basis of thefollowing two sentences in her notes for the first lecture: “Is there an ‘innateliterary talent’? The relationship of the conscious and subconscious in fictionwriting.”Given the extemporaneous nature of Ayn Rand’s lectures, the transcript of thetape recordings had to be edited before publication. My editing was aimed atgiving the material the economy, smoothness, and precision proper to writtenprose; it consisted primarily of cutting, reorganizing, and line editing.In general, I cut discussions of issues that Ayn Rand later covered in TheRomantic Manifesto. Most of my other cuts aimed at eliminating therepetitiveness typical of (and proper to) oral communication. Ayn Rand oftenstated a point several times, in slightly different words, to give her listenerstime to absorb the point. In such cases, I selected the statement I judgedsuperior, sometimes combining the best parts of different statements.In the main, this book follows the structure of Ayn Rand’s course. I did,however, make many minor transpositions within her general structure in order toconjoin related points or achieve a more logical progression of argument. Also,the book’s chapter divisions follow the logic of the material rather than AynRand’s lecture breaks, since she often covered related material across thosebreaks. (The chapter and subchapter titles are mine.)A lecture given by Ayn Rand in early 1959, as an addendum to her course, hasbeen incorporated into this book (it forms the bulk of Chapter 4). Also includedare some comments on fiction that she made in a 1969 course on nonfictionwriting. I am grateful to Robert Mayhew for bringing these to my attention.Finally, when Ayn Rand referred to passages in her own (or Sinclair Lewis’s)novels, I sometimes supplied the relevant quote.I made only a few editorial insertions. These are marked by square brackets,while parentheses always signal Ayn Rand’s own asides.The line editing consisted mainly of eliminating unnecessary words, rearrangingthe order of clauses within sentences, changing the tenses of verbs, etc. I alsoadded words that were clearly implied by the original grammatical context (andnecessary for a thought’s completeness); and within that context, I made wordchanges where this improved the precision or economy of a sentence. I did not,however, freely restate any point in my own words. I am confident that none ofmy changes has altered Ayn Rand’s intended meaning.Nevertheless, the reader must bear in mind that the following pages have beenedited by someone other than Ayn Rand herself. He must also remember theextemporaneous nature of the raw material.In Chapter 8, Ayn Rand compares the conscientiously precise style of her ownpublished works with the style of Victor Hugo, her favorite writer. Using ametaphor from painting, she says that “[Hugo‘s] brushstrokes are wider and more‘impressionistic’ than [hers], whereas while [hers] are wide, someone whoapproached them with a microscope would see that every strand was put there fora purpose.”In this sense, the style of the present book may be described as more Hugoesquethan Randian. The brushstrokes do represent Ayn Rand’s views, but every stranddoes not necessarily reflect her purpose.—Tore Boeckmann"},{"pageContent":"1Writing and the SubconsciousSuppose you start to write a story and your opening sentence describes asunrise. To select the words of that sentence alone, you must have absorbed agreat deal of knowledge which has become so automatic that your conscious mindneed not pause on it.Language is a tool which you had to learn; you did not know it at birth. Whenyou first learned that a certain object is a table, the word table did not cometo your mind automatically; you repeated it many times to get used to it. If younow attempt to learn a foreign language, the English word still leaps into yourmind. It takes many repetitions before the foreign word occurs without yourbeing conscious of groping for it.Before you sit down to write, your language has to be so automatic that you arenot conscious of groping for words or forming them into a sentence. Otherwise,you give yourself an impossible handicap.In your description of a sunrise, you want to convey a certain mood; thesunrise, let us say, is an ominous one. That requires different words than adescription of a bright, cheerful sunrise would. Consider how much knowledgegoes into your ability to differentiate between the two intentions. What isominous? What is cheerful? What kind of concepts, words, metaphors will conveyeach? All that was at one time conscious knowledge. Yet if you had consciouslyto select your words, including all the elements needed to establish a certainmood—if you had to go through the whole dictionary to decide which word to startwith, and the same for the next word, and if you then had to go through all thepossibilities of conveying the mood—your whole lifetime would not be enough tocompose that one description.What then do you do when you write a good description, fitting your purposes,within a reasonable amount of time according to your skill? You call on storedknowledge which has become automatic.Your conscious mind is a very limited “screen of vision”; at any one moment, itcan hold only so much. For instance, if you are now concentrating on my words,then you are not thinking about your values, family, or past experiences. Yetthe knowledge of these is stored in your mind somewhere. That which you do nothold in your conscious mind at any one moment is your subconscious.Why can a baby not understand this discussion? He does not have the necessarystored knowledge. The full understanding of any object of consciousness dependson what is already known and stored in the subconscious.What is colloquially called “inspiration”—namely, that you write without fullknowledge of why you write as you do, yet it comes out well—is actually thesubconscious summing-up of the premises and intentions you have set yourself.All writers have to rely on inspiration. But you have to know where it comesfrom, why it happens, and how to make it happen to you.All writers rely on their subconscious. But you have to know how to work withyour own subconscious.What you will find today is the exact opposite. Most writers cannot account evenfor why they chose to write a particular story, let alone for the manner inwhich they wrote it. In effect, they take the attitude of the worst medievalmystics. You have probably heard the mystic formula: “For those who understand,no explanation is necessary; for those who don’t, none is possible.” That is theslogan of religious mystics—and of artistic mystics. The simple meaning of thatsentence is: “I don’t know why I’m doing it, and I don’t intend to explain.”If you do not want to be reduced to such a condition, you have to be consciousof your premises in general, and of your literary premises in particular. Youhave to train yourself to grasp your premises clearly, not merely as generalrules with a few concretes to illustrate them, but with a sufficient number ofconcretes so that the full meaning of the premises becomes automatic to you.Every premise that you store in your subconscious in this manner—namely,thoroughly understood, thoroughly integrated to the concretes itrepresents—becomes part of your writing capital. When you then sit down towrite, you do not need to calculate everything in a slow, conscious way. Yourinspiration comes to the exact extent of the knowledge you have stored.To describe a sunrise, you must have stored in your mind clear ideas of what youmean by “sunrise,” what elements compose it, what kinds you have seen, what moodyou want to project and why, and what kinds of words will project it. If you areclear on all these elements, they will come to you easily. If you are clear onsome but not others, it will be harder to write. If you are not clear at all—ifyou have nothing but “floating abstractions” in your subconscious (by that Imean abstractions which you do not connect to concretes)—you will sit and stareat a blank sheet of paper. Nothing will come out of your mind because you haveput nothing into it.A writer, therefore, has to know how to use his subconscious, how to make hisconscious mind use it as a Univac [an early computer]. A Univac is a calculatingmachine; but someone has to feed it the material and has to set the stops andmake the selections if he wants a certain answer. You have to make yourconscious mind do exactly that to your subconscious [computer]: you have to knowwhat you are storing there and what kind of answers you are seeking. If you havestored the material properly, it will come to you.Even so, there is no guarantee that you will work from nine to five at your deskand everything will always come out perfectly (unless you are a hack). What isguaranteed is that you will always be able to express exactly what you intendedto express.You have probably heard that no writer can ever fully express what he wanted toexpress; that every book is a disappointment to the author because it is only anapproximation. Sinclair Lewis, a very good writer, once made such a remark. Ifyou read his books, you will understand why. The themes that he wants to expressare clear; the manner in which he expresses them is not always clear,particularly in the realm of emotions. He can express ideas and characterizationup to a certain point, but in regard to deeper values, he is an unhappyrepressor.If a writer feels that he was unable fully to express what he wanted to express,it means that he did not know clearly what he wanted to express. He knew it onlyas a generalized package deal [a conglomeration of logically unrelatedelements]; he had his theme defined approximately, but not sufficientlysupported with full understanding of all the elements of that theme. That whichyou know clearly you can find the words for and you will express exactly.If someone then challenges you and asks, “Why did you describe the sunrise inthis way?” you will be able to answer. You will be able to give a consciousreason for every word in your description; but you did not have to know thereasons while writing.I can give the reason for every word and every punctuation mark in AtlasShrugged—and there are 645,000 words in it by the printer’s count. I did nothave to calculate it all consciously when I was writing. But what I did wasfollow a conscious intention in relation to the novel’s theme and to everyelement involved in that theme. I was conscious of my purpose throughout thejob—the general purpose of the novel and the particular purpose of everychapter, paragraph, and sentence.To master the art of writing, you have to be conscious of why you are doingthings—but do not edit yourself while writing. Just as you cannot change horsesin the middle of a stream, so you cannot change premises in the middle ofwriting. When you write, you have to rely on your subconscious; you cannot doubtyourself and edit every sentence as it comes out. Write as it comes to you—then(next morning, preferably) turn editor and read over what you have written. Ifsomething does not satisfy you, ask yourself then why, and identify the premiseyou missed.Trust your subconscious. If it does not deliver the kind of material you want,it will at least give you the evidence of what is wrong.When you get stuck on a piece of writing, the reason is either that you have notsufficiently concretized the ideas you want to cover or that your purpose inthis particular sequence is contradictory—that your conscious mind has given toyour subconscious contradictory orders. I call this miserable state, which allwriters know, “the squirms.” It consists either of the inability to writeanything or of the fact that your writing suddenly comes out badly—it does notflow as you want it to and does not express your intention.Suppose you start to write a love scene. You write a few lines of dialogue, andsuddenly you do not know what to say next. Let us say that it is a tragic lovescene which has to end with the two characters renouncing each other. You knowthat they have to come to the parting, but not how to bring them there. Anythingyou put down is somehow not what you want; maybe the dialogue seems repetitious,or it is not too meaningful. So you try again, and whatever comes out is stillnot right. That’s the squirms.The trouble might lie in any one of the elements involved. It might be that youhave not fully defined for yourself the attitude of the characters, or that youare not clear on the nature of the tragedy, or on the nature of love, or on therelationship of this particular scene to the rest of the novel. For each sceneof a story, an enormously complex amount of material has to be held in mind;and, again, you cannot do it all consciously. You can hold only the highlightsconsciously, while relying on your subconscious to supply you with the missingconnections and the concretes through which your general intention has to beexpressed. If there is a contradiction in any one of those elements, it mightstop you. And the difficult thing is that, in the nature of the process, you arestopped without having any clear idea of how to solve the problem.The solution is always to think over every aspect of the scene and everyconnection to anything relevant in the rest of the book. Think until your mindalmost goes to pieces; think until you are blank with exhaustion. Then, the nextday, think again—until finally, one morning, you have the solution. Do enoughthinking to give your subconscious ample time to integrate the elementsinvolved. When those elements do integrate, the knowledge of what to do with thescene comes to you, and so do the words to express it. Why? Because you havecleared your subconscious files, your lightning calculator.This experience is not confined to writers. With any kind of problem, you mightthink for days and suddenly, seemingly by accident, find the solution. Theclassic example is Newton and his apple: the apple fell on Newton’s head andgave him the idea of the law of gravitation. As a writer once said: “Luckyaccidents usually happen only to those who deserve them”1[rand_9781101137239_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-1]—meaning that Newton had worked for along time on the problem which led him to the law of gravitation; the appleserved merely as the last link integrating the conclusions he had alreadyreached.The same thing happens with a writer’s inspiration or in breaking the squirms.I have written many scenes which I did not plan in advance, beyond a generaldefinition that “this scene will accomplish such and such a purpose”—yet when Icame to them, they wrote themselves. Those scenes were usually the ones on whichI was so clear—all the elements, intellectual, emotional, and artistic, were sofamiliar to me—that once I had set the general purpose, my subconscious did therest. That is the happiest state a writer can reach and the most wonderfulexperience. You come to a scene and you feel as if somebody else is dictatingit; you do not know what is coming, it is surprising you as it comes, you writealmost in a blind trance—and afterward, when you reread it, it is almostperfect. You might need to change a few words, but the essence of the scene isthere.This is the kind of incident which gives rise to the idea that writing is aninnate talent or that you write because some inner voice dictates to you. Youhave probably heard writers maintain that they are vehicles selected by asuperior power because they hear this dictation. They will say: “I sit down towrite a scene, I don’t know what I’m going to write, and suddenly it comes tome. And it feels as if it’s a voice dictating, so I’m sure it’s the voice ofGod.” In fact, it does feel that way. But what is the real meaning of thisphenomenon?This is a case of the accident that happens only to those who deserve it.The writers who tell you that writing is an innate talent—that if you sit downto write, God either moves you or He does not, and if He does not, there isnothing you can do about it—these writers are not necessarily lying. They aremerely poor introspectors. They do not know what enables them to write.This type of writer usually writes himself out after a few years. As a rule, hestarts rather young; he shows what is called “unusual promise”; and in a fewyears you see him repeating the same thing, less brilliantly and originally eachtime—and soon he finds that he has nothing to write about. That inspirationwhose source he did not know has vanished. He does not know how to replenish it.By imitation more than by understanding, he caught on to the process of writing;he grasped that people can put ideas, feelings, impressions down on paper, andhe did so. If he has enough original observations stored in his subconscious,certain literary values might be present in his work for a while (among a lot ofmeaningless junk). But once he has used up that store of early impressions, hehas nothing more to say. He merely grasped the general idea of what writing is,then coasted on his subconscious for a while, never attempting to analyze wherehis ideas came from, what he was doing, or why. Such a writer is antagonistic toany analysis; he is the type who tells you that “the cold hand of reason” isdetrimental to his inspiration. He cannot function by means of reason, he says;if he begins to analyze, he feels, it will stop his inspiration altogether.(Given the way he functions, it would stop him.)By contrast, if you know where your inspiration really comes from, you willnever run out of material. A rational writer can stoke his subconscious just asone puts fuel in a machine. If you keep on storing things in your mind for yourfuture writing and keep integrating your choice of theme to your generalknowledge, allowing the scope of your writing to grow as your knowledge widens,then you will always have something to say, and you will find ever better waysto say it. You will not coast downhill after one outbreak of something valuable.If part of your mind is still thinking, “Yes, but how do I know writing isn’t aninnate talent?” chances are that either you will not start writing at all, oryou will start, but in perpetual terror. Each time you write something good, youwill ask yourself: “But can I do it next time?”I have heard many famous writers complain that they have literal anxiety attacksbefore starting a book. It does not matter how successful they are; since theydo not fully know what the process of writing consists of—or, incidentally, whya book is or is not successful—they are always at the mercy of this terror:“Yes, ten novels were good, but how do I know that my eleventh one will begood?”Instead of improving, these writers usually either maintain a precarious levelor, more likely, deteriorate over the years. An example is Somerset Maugham. Asfar as one can gather his views from his writing, he does not believe thatwriting is a rational process; and his later works are much less interestingthan his early ones. Though he has not quite written himself out, the qualityhas deteriorated.In order to form your own literary taste and put it under your consciouscontrol, always account for what you do or do not like in your reading—andalways give yourself reasons. At first you might identify only the immediatereasons for your estimate of any given paragraph or book. As you practice, youwill go deeper and deeper. (Do not memorize your premises. Merely store them inyour subconscious; they will be there when you need them.)It is possible for a writer to hold good literary premises by default, meaning:by imitation or by feeling. Many writers do, and thus cannot identify thereasons for their writing. They say, “I write because it just comes to me,” andthey fully believe that they have innate talent or that some mystical powerdictates to them. Do not count on this mystical power to give you that talent.If you are tempted to ask, “Why can’t I just rely on instinct?” my answer isthat your “instinct” has not worked for you so far. You do not have writingpremises; the mere doubt on your part is what indicates it. And even if you dohave writing premises, or show what people conventionally call “indications oftalent,” you would stay on the same level for a whole career and never rise towriting what you really want.To acquire literary premises, or to develop those you already have, what youneed is conscious knowledge. That is what I offer in this course."},{"pageContent":"2Literature as an Art FormLiterature is an art form which uses language as its toot—and language is anobjective instrument.You cannot seriously approach writing without the strict premise that words haveobjective meanings. If you approach it with the idea “I sort of know what I meanand my words sort of express something,” you have only yourself to blame ifpeople fail to grasp your intended meaning, or get the opposite meaning.If you are not sure of a word, look it up in a dictionary (preferably an olddictionary, because the modem ones are nonobjective). But important words likevalue, reason, and morality are defined very loosely even in the betterdictionaries. Do not use them in that loose manner; define specifically what youmean by those words, and make your meaning clear by the context in which you usethem. This is an important rule of thinking for people generally, and aninvaluable one for writers.The writers who complain that they never express their meaning exactly areguilty among other faults of treating words as approximations, even in their ownminds. Most writers today use words loosely; if you sort of get the drift of aparagraph, that is all you can get and all the writer intended. A famous exampleis Thomas Wolfe, who uses a vast number of words, none of them precisely. To seehow not to write, read his descriptive passages. (I will discuss Wolfe ingreater detail under Style.)In regard to precision of language, I think I myself am the best writer today.An exact writer treats words as he would in a legal document. This does not meanusing awkward sentences. It means using words with absolute clarity, while stillprojecting violent emotion, color—any literary quality—by precise means.A sentence in Atlas Shrugged that is applicable to all rational people, butparticularly to writers, is the one where I say that Dagny “regarded language asa tool of honor, always to be used as if one were under oath—an oath ofallegiance to reality.” In regard to words, this should be the motto of everywriter.Since all art is communication, there can be nothing more viciouslycontradictory than the idea of nonobjective art. Anyone who wants to communicatewith others has to rely on an objective reality and on objective language. The“nonobjective” is that which is dependent only on the individual subject, not onany standard of outside reality, and which is therefore incommunicable toothers.When a man announces that he is a nonobjective artist, he is saying that what heis presenting cannot be communicated. Why then does he present it, and why doeshe claim that it is art?A nonobjective artist, whether a painter or a writer, is counting on theexistence of objective art—and using it in order to destroy it.Take a nonobjective painter. He creates some blobs of paint and proclaims thatthey are an expression of his subconscious, that they cannot be defined in anyother terms, and that either you understand their meaning or you do not. Then hehangs them in a gallery. What does his work have in common with real art, whichby definition represents recognizable physical objects? Only that it is hung ona wall. He has switched the definition of painting to “a piece of canvas in aframe.”The art world laughed at the first nonobjective paintings—and today such stuffis practically all that is produced. The result is the destruction of art as ameaningful activity. The field has been taken over by a self-appointed elite ofmystics who are playing a game to delude those with money enough to buy theirproducts. But their basic purpose is not material; it is to establish anunearned artistic aristocracy. (The same purpose was served by Toohey’s clubs inThe Fountainhead.) They want to make the practice of artistic creation availableto anyone [regardless of ability], so that they can form their own little casteof specialists and pronounce, subjectively, what is and is not art. Then theycan go around fooling each other and those who wish to support them.In the field of literature, the nonobjective has not yet been accepted fully;but the elements of reason—and, therefore, of real art—are growing rarer andrarer in present-day writing. If the trend is not stopped, literature willfollow the path of painting (and of all other aspects of our civilization).The best-known example of a nonobjective writer is Gertrude Stein, who combineswords into sentences without any grammatical structure or meaning. She is stillto some extent laughed at, but people are laughing rather respectfully; theirimplied attitude is: “Well, she’s strange, but her writing is probably deep.”Why is it deep? “Because I, the reader, cannot understand it.” (The subjectivismof the audience of nonobjective art is based on an inferiority complex whichtakes the form: “If I don’t understand it, it must be profound.”)A writer who is not laughed at, but taught in universities as something veryserious, is James Joyce. He is worse than Gertrude Stein; going all the way tothe ultimate in nonobjective writing, he uses words from different languages,makes up some words of his own, and calls that literature.When communication by means of language is discarded, what is left as thedefinition of writing? Writing becomes inarticulate sounds printed on paper bymeans of certain black marks.No one can be consistently evil. Since evil is destruction, anyone who attemptedconsistently in his life to follow a bad premise would eliminate himself; hewould be dead, or at best insane. A man can hold bad premises only so long ashis good ones make them possible, support them—and are destroyed in the processof supporting them. Bad premises, if not eliminated, will grow and destroy thegood ones.I mention this for the following reason. If you are not fully committed torationality and objectivity, you might not go as far as Stein and Joyce, butyour writing will then be a combination of the rational and the irrational. Youwill not, say, write a book without any knowledge of its meaning; you know ingeneral what you want to communicate, you stick to rationality in a loose way,and you write something that has the semblance of a story. But in selecting thedetails of that story—the characters, events, and sentences—you rely only onfeelings and unidentified premises. These premises might be right or wrong; thatwhich you do not know consciously is not in your control. If questioned, yousay: “I know my general theme, but not why I wrote this particular sentence thisway. I just felt like it.”This means that you will be a cross between a writer like me and a writer likeGertrude Stein.Insofar as the rational elements predominate in your writing, you might “getaway with” the flaws in your performance. But you should not want to be apart-rational, part-Gertrude Stein writer.Do not let your own talent—your good premises—act in support of your badpremises and of the lazy or the irrational in your mind.If to any extent you hold the premise of nonobjectivity, then by your ownchoice, you do not belong in literature, or in any human activity, or on thisearth. With the exception of proper names, every word is an abstraction. One way tohave words come to you easily—words which express the exact shade of meaning youwant—is to know clearly the concretes that belong under your abstractions.For instance, the word table is an abstraction; it stands for any table you haveever seen or will see. If you try to project what you mean by “table,” you caneasily visualize any number of concrete examples. But in regard to abstractionslike individualism, freedom, or rationality, most people are unable to name asingle concrete. Even knowing one or two is not enough. In order to becompletely free with words, you must know countless concretes under yourabstractions.The issue of the relationship of abstractions to concretes is crucial to allcreative writing—not only to the composition of a sentence, but to thecomposition of a whole story and of its every chapter and paragraph.When you compose a story, you start with an abstraction, then find the concreteswhich add up to that abstraction. For the reader, the process is reversed: hefirst perceives the concretes you present and then adds them up to theabstraction with which you started. I call this a “circle.”For instance, the theme of Atlas Shrugged is “the importance of reason”—a wideabstraction. To leave the reader with that message, I have to show what reasonis, how it operates, and why it is important. The sequence on the constructionof the John Galt Line is included for that purpose—to concretize the mind’s rolein human life. The rest of the novel illustrates the consequences of the mind’sabsence. In particular, the chapter on the tunnel catastrophe shows concretelywhat happens to a world where men do not dare to think or to take theresponsibility of judgment. If, at the end of the novel, you are left with theimpression “Yes, the mind is important and we should live by reason,” theseincidents are the cause. The concretes have summed up in your mind to theabstraction with which I started, and which I had to break down into concretes.Every chapter and paragraph of Atlas Shrugged is set up on the same principle:What abstraction do I want to convey—and what concretes will convey it?Young writers often make the following mistake: if they want a strong,independent, rational hero, they state in narrative that “he is strong,independent, and rational”—or they have other characters pay him thesecompliments in discussion. This does not convey anything. “Strong,”“independent,” and “rational” are abstractions. In order to leave your readerwith those abstractions, you have to provide concretes that will make himconclude: “This man is strong, because he did X; independent, because he defiedY; rational, because he thought Z.”It is on your power to create this kind of circle that your success will rest.The purpose of all art is the objectification of values. The fundamental motiveof a writer—by the implication of the activity, whether he knows it consciouslyor not—is to objectify his values, his view of what is important in life. A manreads a novel for the same reason: to see a presentation of reality slantedaccording to a certain code of values (with which he may then agree ordisagree).(Do not be misled by the fact that many artists present depravity and ugliness:those are their values. If an artist thinks that life is depravity, he will donothing but studies of sewers.)To objectify values is to make them real by presenting them in concrete form.For instance, to say “I think courage is good” is not to objectify a value. Topresent a man who acts bravely, is.Why is it important to objectify values?Human values are abstractions. Before they can become real to or convinceanyone, the concretes have to be given.In this sense, every writer is a moral philosopher."},{"pageContent":"3Theme and PlotA novel’s theme is the general abstraction in relation to which the events serveas the concretes.For instance, the theme of Gone With the Wind is: the impact of the Civil War onthe South—the destruction of the Southern way of life, which vanished with thewind. The theme of Sinclair Lewis’s Babbitt is the characterization of anaverage American small businessman.A novel’s theme is not the same as its philosophical meaning. I could write (andwould like to write) a detective story or a plain action thriller with nophilosophical “message” and no long speeches—yet such a story would stillimplicitly convey all of my philosophy.Fundamentally, what is important is not the message a writer projectsexplicitly, but the values and view of life he projects implicitly. Just asevery man has a philosophy, whether he knows it consciously or not, so everystory has an implicit philosophy. For instance, the theme of Gone With the Windis historical, not philosophical—yet, if analyzed, the nature of the events andof the style would reveal the author’s philosophy. By what he chooses topresent, and by how he presents it, any author expresses his fundamental,metaphysical values—his view of man’s relationship to reality and of what mancan and should seek in life.By contrast, a novel’s theme need not be philosophical; it can be any generalsubject: a historical period, a human emotion, etc.In judging a novel’s esthetic value, all that one has to know is the author’stheme and how well he has carried it out. Other things being equal, the wider anovel’s theme, the better it is as a work of art. But whether one agrees withthe theme or not is a separate question. If a novel presents a marvelousphilosophical message but has no plot, miserable characterization, and a woodenstyle full of bromides, it is a bad work of art. On the other hand, I considerQuo Vadis, technically, one of the best-constructed novels ever written, yet Ido not agree with its message: the rise and glorification of Christian culture.On the subject of theme, I have one warning: Be sure that your story can besummed up to some theme.In today’s literature, many books do not have any abstract theme, which meansthat one cannot tell why they were written. An example is the kind of firstnovel that relates the writer’s childhood impressions and early struggle withlife. If asked why the particular events are included, the author says: “Ithappened to me.” I warn you against writing such a novel. That somethinghappened to you is of no importance to anyone, not even to you (and you are nowhearing it from the archapostle of selfishness). The important thing about youis what you choose to make happen—your values and choices. That which happenedby accident—what family you were born into, in what country, and where you wentto school—is totally unimportant.If an author has something of wider importance to say about them, it is validfor him to use his own experiences (preferably not too literally transcribed).But if he can give his readers no reason why they should read his book, exceptthat the events happened to him, it is not a valid book, neither for the readersnor for himself.Your theme, the abstract summation of your work, should be objectively valid,but otherwise the choice of themes is unlimited. You may write about deep-seadiving or anything you wish, provided you can show in the work why there isobjective reason to be interested in it.003 [rand_9781101137239_oeb_003_r1.jpg]The most important element of a novel is plot. A plot is a purposefulprogression of events. Such events must be logically connected, each being theoutgrowth of the preceding and all leading up to a final climax.I stress the word events because you can have a purposeful progression of ideas,or of conversations, without action. But a novel is a story about human beingsin action. If you do not present your subject matter in terms of physicalaction, what you are writing is not a novel.Let me give a few examples of the difference between theme and plot, startingwith my own works.The theme of We the Living is: the individual against the state, and, morespecifically, the evil of statism. I present the theme by showing that thetotalitarian state destroys the best people: in this case, a girl and the twomen who love her. When I say that the story concerns a girl under a dictatorshipand the men who love her, I am already talking about the plot.Incidentally, if one names only the most general meaning of We the Living—theindividual against the state—one does not indicate on whose side the author is.It could be a communist story showing the evil of the individual; but then theplot would be different. Or it could be a Naturalistic novel, a presentation oflife under a dictatorship with no moral sides taken. The theme, however, wouldstill be: the individual against the state. So when you work on a story of yourown, make sure you define your theme clearly. That will help you judge what toinclude.The theme of The Fountainhead is: individualism and collectivism, not inpolitics, but in man’s soul. I show the effects of each principle on men’scharacter by presenting the struggle of a creative architect against the societyof his time.To go from the theme to the plot line, you simply ask: By what means did theauthor present the theme? By this method, you can also identify a story’splot-theme, the essential line of its events. The plot-theme is the focus of themeans of presenting the theme; for the writer, it is the most important elementin creating a story. Your work as a novelist starts in earnest when you havechosen your story’s plot-theme.The theme of Atlas Shrugged is: the crucial value of the human mind. Theplot-theme is: the mind on strike. The latter names an action—the central actionto which all the other events of the story are related. It, therefore, is theplot-theme.The theme of Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables is: the injustice done to the lowerclasses of society. The plot-theme is: the struggle of an ex-convict to avoidthe persecution of the police. This is the central narrative line, to which allthe events are related.The theme of Gone With the Wind is: the disappearance of the Southern way oflife. The plot-theme is: the relationship of the heroine, Scarlett, to the twomen in her life, Rhett Butler and Ashley Wilkes. These characters symbolize thehistorical forces involved. Scarlett is in love with Ashley, who represents theold South, but she can never win him; she is a Southern woman belonging inspirit with Rhett Butler, who represents the destruction of the old traditionsand who pursues her throughout the story. This is an example of the skillfulintegration of plot to theme.The theme of Sinclair Lewis’s Main Street is the presentation of a typicalAmerican small town. The plot-theme is the struggle of a girl of moreintellectual trends to bring culture to this town—her struggle with thematerialistic small-town attitude of everybody around her. I must stress,however, that Main Street (like all of Lewis’s novels) does not have a plot inthe sense of a structure of events.The main distinction between a Romantic and a Naturalistic novel is that aRomantic novel has a plot whereas a Naturalistic novel is plotless. But althoughit does not have a purposeful progression of events, a good Naturalistic novelstill has a series of events which add up to a story. In such a case, when I say“plot-theme,” I mean the central line of those events.Take Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina, the novel most typical of the Naturalistic school.It is the story of a married woman who falls in love with another man, leavesher husband, and finds herself hopelessly doomed. Since she is ostracized bysociety, she has no friends and nothing to do with her time, and eventually sheand her lover grow bored with each other. The man, an officer by profession,volunteers for an army assignment in some Balkan war. The implication is that hewill be killed; but he wants to go because he cannot stand his solitaryconfinement with the woman he loves. She commits suicide by jumping under thewheels of a train (in a horribly well-written scene).The woman is presented as a sympathetic character; her outstanding quality isher eagerness to live. The husband is deliberately presented as a conventionalmediocrity without any values or distinction; all the evidence is given as towhy the woman’s life with him is boring and meaningless. Yet she dares to breakthe conventions because she wants to be happy—which the author considers aninsufficient reason. There is no life for anyone outside of society, he implies;so, right or wrong, one has to accept social standards. The abstract theme is:the evil of adultery and, more broadly, of the pursuit of happiness. Theplot-theme is: A woman leaves her husband and is destroyed for herunconventionality.The basic philosophical premises which determine whether a writer belongs to theNaturalistic or the Romantic school are the premises of determinism or of freewill. If a writer’s basic conviction is that man is a determined creature—thathe has no choice, but is the plaything of fate or his background or God or hisglands—that writer will be a Naturalist. The Naturalistic school, in essence,presents man as helpless; it has some great writers, but it is an evil schoolphilosophically, and its literary flaw is plotlessness. A plot, being apurposeful progression of events, necessarily presupposes men’s freedom tochoose and their ability to achieve a purpose. If a writer believes that men aredetermined beings, he will not be able to devise a plot.(A writer is governed by his deepest conviction, rather than by some professedbelief. He might claim to be a believer in free will but subconsciously be adeterminist, or vice versa. His subconscious premise is what will show in thestructure of his writing.)The Romantic school of literature approaches life on the premise that man hasfree will, the capacity of choice. The distinguishing mark of this school is agood plot structure.If man has the capacity of choice, then he can plan the events of his life; hecan set himself purposes and achieve them. If so, his life is not a series ofaccidents. Events do not “just happen” to him; he chooses what he makes happen(and if accidents occur, his purpose is to overcome them). He is the architectof his own life.If such is your view of man, you will write about events dealing with a man’spurposes and the steps by which he achieves them. That is what constitutes aplot. A plot is “a purposeful progression of events”—not an accidental string ofoccurrences, but a progression centered on someone’s purpose (usually the hero’sor heroine’s).Here I call your attention to Aristotle’s concepts of efficient and finalcausation.Efficient causation means that an event is determined by an antecedent cause.For instance, if you strike a match to a gasoline tank and it explodes, thestriking of the match is the cause and the explosion is the effect. This is whatwe normally mean by causality as it exists in physical nature.Final causation means that the end result of a certain chain of causesdetermines those causes. Aristotle gave this example: A tree is the final causeof the seed from which that tree will grow. From one perspective, the seed isthe efficient cause of the tree: first there is the seed, and as a result, thetree grows. But from the perspective of final causation, Aristotle said, thefuture tree determines the nature of the seed and of the development it has tofollow in order to end up as that tree.This, by the way, is one of my major differences from Aristotle. It is wrong toassume what in philosophy is known as teleology—namely, that a purpose set inadvance in nature determines physical phenomena. The concept of the future treedetermining the nature of the seed is impossible; it is the kind of concept thatleads to mysticism and religion. Most religions have a teleological explanationof the universe: God made the universe, so His purpose determined the nature ofthe entities in it.But the concept of final causation, properly delimited, is valid. Finalcausation applies only to the work of a conscious entity—specifically of arational one—because only a thinking consciousness can choose a purpose ahead ofits existence and then select the means to achieve it.In the realm of human action, everything has to be directed by final causation.If men allow themselves to be moved by efficient causation—if they act likedetermined beings, propelled by some immediate cause outside themselves—that istotally improper. (Even then, volition is involved: if a man decides to abandonpurpose, that is also a choice, and a bad one.) Proper human action is action bymeans of final causation.An obvious example here pertains to writing. As a writer, you must follow theprocess of final causation: you decide on the theme of your book (your purpose),then select the events and the sentences that will concretize your theme. Thereader, by contrast, follows the process of efficient causation: he goes step bystep through your book being moved toward the abstraction you intended.Any purposeful activity follows the same progression. To make an automobile, aman first has to decide what kind of object he is making—an automobile—and thenselect the elements which, put together, will constitute that automobile. By theprocess of final causation, he makes nature perform the necessary processes ofefficient causation; he puts together certain parts in a certain scientificorder to achieve a vehicle which moves.In nature, there is no final causation; but in man’s action, final causation isthe only proper guide.Observe how this applies to the issue of plot stories versus plotless ones. In aplot story, men and events are pulled forward by a purpose. In a Naturalistic,plotless story, they are pushed from behind, as in physical nature.Take the novels of Sinclair Lewis again. They are not totally formless: theybegin somewhere and end somewhere. But the characters rarely pursue anyparticular goals. They go through certain events, drawing some conclusions,growing or deteriorating mentally, in a haphazard interaction between themselvesand their social background. Their actions do proceed from their characters asthe author sees them, but the protagonists do not determine the course of theirlives.There is a fundamental contradiction in the premise of the Naturalistic school.You are interested in reading a Naturalistic story such as Anna Karenina onlybecause of the implied assumption that the characters have choice. If a womanhesitates between leaving her husband for the man she loves and giving up theman she loves for her husband, this is a crucial choice in her life. It caninterest you only if you assume she has choice about it and you want to know whyshe decides the way she does and whether she is right or wrong. If, however, youhold firmly in mind the idea that she cannot choose but has to do whatever fatedetermines—and that, should you ever be in a comparable situation, your futureaction is unknowable to you because something other than your choice willdetermine your decision—the story will have no meaning for you whatever.If men have no choice, you cannot write a story about them, nor is there anysense in reading one. If they do have choice, there is no sense in reading aboutunchosen events. What you rationally want to read is a story about men’schoices, right or wrong—about their decisions and what they should havedecided—which means: a free-will, Romantic plot story.Now let us consider in more detail the issue of plot.If a man is not a determined being but sets his own purpose, then it is he whohas to achieve that purpose and devise the means to achieve it. This means thatsome action is necessary on his part. If his action meets with no obstacles—if aman decides to go to the comer grocery, and he goes, buys his groceries, andcomes home—this is a purposeful action, but not a story. Why not? Because therewas no struggle involved.To illustrate the achievement of a purpose, you have to show men overcomingobstacles. This statement pertains strictly to writers. Metaphysically—inreality—one does not need obstacles in order to achieve a purpose. But you as awriter need to dramatize purpose, i.e., you have to isolate the particularmeaning that you want your events to illustrate—by presenting it in a stressedaction form.For instance, in The Fountainhead I show the career of a creative, independentarchitect. It is possible (although not probable) that in real life he wouldimmediately find the right clients and achieve great success without anyopposition. But that would be completely wrong artistically. Since my purpose isto show that a man of creative independence will achieve his goal regardless ofany opposition, a story in which there is no opposition would not dramatize mymessage. I have to show the hero in a difficult struggle—and the worse I canmake it, the better dramatically. I have to devise the hardest obstaclespossible, and those of greatest significance to the hero.For instance, if the hero has a distant cousin who disapproves of his career,that is not a great obstacle to overcome. But if the woman he loves objects tohis career and tempts him to give it up, and he says, “No, I prefer to be anarchitect,” and thus risks losing her forever, that is real dramatization. Thenthe hero is in the middle of a clash of two values and has to choose the rightone (which he does).The more struggle a story involves, the better the plot. By showing the kind ofconflicts that a man has to resolve and make the right decision about, theauthor shows which decision is right, or, in the case of characters who make thewrong decision, why the decision is wrong, to what bad consequences it leads.The essence of plot structure is: struggle—therefore, conflict—therefore,climax. A struggle implies two opposing forces in conflict, and it implies aclimax. The climax is the central point of the story, where the conflict isresolved.“Conflict” here means conflict with other men or conflict within a man, but notconflict against nature or coincidence.For the purpose of dramatizing a man’s struggle and choice, a conflict withinhis own mind, which is then expressed and resolved in action, is one of the bestdevices. By that means, you present clearly and in action the man’s freedom—thefact that his decision is what resolves the conflict.A man’s struggle against nature, by contrast, is an issue of free will only onhis part, not on the part of nature. The blind forces of nature can be only whatthey are and do only what they do. A conflict against nature is therefore not adramatic conflict—no choice or suspense is possible on the part of the inanimateadversary. In a fully volitional conflict, both adversaries must have free will;two choices, two sets of values, must be involved.Coincidence is always bad in writing, and it is disastrous in plot writing. Onlylesser plot writers, usually bad mystery novelists, characteristically employcoincidence, though some great writers, like Hugo, are guilty of it at times.But it is to be avoided at all costs. A plot presents free will and a man’sachievement of, or at least struggle for, his purpose—and coincidence isirrelevant to anyone’s choice or purpose. It can happen in life, but it ismeaningless. So do not write the kind of stories in which a conflict is suddenlyresolved by a natural disaster, such as a flood or an earthquake thatconveniently kills the villain at the right moment.A plot, as I have said, is “a purposeful progression of events.” The wordpurposeful here has two meanings: not only must the characters be purposeful,but also, in order to have an integrated story, the author must be purposeful.The events of a plot story are always connected to the main goals of thecharacters and to a growing conflict which directs the events (and which has tobe resolved in some decisive manner at the end).Take Les Misérables. The hero steals a loaf of bread and is sent to prison. Hecannot stand it, so he tries to escape; he draws a longer sentence. When he isfinally released, he is an outcast. He comes to a town where nobody will lodgehim or serve him dinner. Then he sees a house with an open door—the house of thelocal bishop. This very well-drawn, altruistic bishop invites him to stay,serves him a meal, and treats him with all the deference due an honored guest.The ex-convict notices the bishop’s only valuable possessions: real silverwareand two silver candelabra on the mantelpiece. In the middle of the night, thetrusted ex-convict steals the silverware and escapes.Given the man’s enormously embittered state, the reader can understand why hemakes this choice. It is an evil choice, but it proceeds from the previousevents of the story.Then he is caught and brought back to the bishop by local policemen whorecognize the silverware. They tell the bishop: “We’ve caught this ex-convictand he says that you gave him the silverware.” And the bishop says: “Yes, ofcourse I gave it to him. But, my friend, why did you forget to take thecandelabra, which I also gave you?” The police depart, and the bishop tells theex-convict: “Take this silver. With it I am buying your soul from the devil andgiving it to God.”That is a scene. It is a beautifully dramatic example of turning the othercheek.The bishop believes that his action will have a good effect; and the hero doesreform, though not immediately. But everything he does is always conditioned bywhat he concluded (or misconcluded) from a previous event; and the actions ofthe police thereafter are always conditioned by their suspicion of him. Theevents are determined by the goals that the characters want to accomplish, andeach event is necessitated by the preceding one—necessitated notdeterministically, but logically. “If A, then B logically had to follow.”By contrast, the events of a Naturalistic novel do not proceed one from theother, but are largely haphazard. A Naturalist has no principle by which todecide whether to show a family picnic, a day of shopping, a flower show, or abreakfast. The events are intended to present or influence the characters—andthat is the author’s standard of selection. The central line is always thedevelopment of a given character; and the author stops when he thinks that hehas presented the character well enough for the reader to understand him.The predominance of characterization over action is the Naturalist’sdistinguishing premise. Something does happen, but what happens is of lessimportance than what it reveals about the characters. For instance, Babbitt [areal estate agent] sells a new house, and the reader learns a great deal abouthis psychology. The event is not much; the meaning is in the characterization.An event is an action taken in reality. If a character goes to the grocerystore, this is an event, but not a very meaningful one—it is a random,Naturalistic event. If a character meets a man on the street and shoots him,this is a potentially meaningful event, if you discover its motivation. If thecharacter took the action because of a previous event which forced him to make achoice, then the action is a plot event.Closely allied with the issue of plot, as an attribute of it, is the issue ofsuspense.If you cannot put down a novel, or if you sit on the edge of your theater seat,that is your emotional reaction to the fact that the story has suspense. Try torecall any story that held you in this manner. You will find that the story isone in which the author lets you in on his purpose.In a suspenseful story, the events are constructed in such a manner that thereader has reason to wonder about the outcome. If an author tells you what isgoing to happen, the story will not hold your interest. But neither will you beinterested if you do not know at all where the story is going—if it is a jumbleof arbitrary events, or even if it has an inner logic which you discover later,but the author never showed you what to expect.The archetype of a suspense scene is the one in Atlas Shrugged where Reardenenters Dagny’s apartment and meets Francisco. Why must this scene hold thereader’s interest? Because he has long been given grounds to wonder what willhappen to all three when the two men discover each other’s relationship toDagny. I have let him in on what to expect. I have planted that Rearden isanxious to discover the name of Dagny’s past lover, and that Francisco stillloves her and hopes she has waited for him. The reader therefore knows that whenthese three find out the truth, some strong reactions will occur, the nature ofwhich he cannot predict for certain. This is what makes him read the scene withinterest.Suppose, however, that Rearden knew everything about Dagny’s past, and Franciscosuspected that Dagny would fall for Rearden; then, the day after the beginningof the Dagny-Rearden romance, Francisco comes to visit her and learns the truth.Would this be interesting or suspenseful? No. Since the reader has been given noreason to attach any importance to the characters’ learning the truth, there isno conflict, no drama, nothing to wonder about.If you want to hold your readers, give them something to wonder about. I onceknew a Hollywood scenario writer who had a graphic expression of her own forthis point. When she started work on a story, she said, she always established a“worry line”—a line of problems for the audience to worry about.To do that, you have to know not only how to build your suspense—how to feed thereader information step by step—but also how to establish the kind of conflictthat in reason will interest a reader. Suppose Dagny dyed her hair blond andworried how her brother , James would react. If they were the kind of characterswho could worry about such an issue, neither they nor the issue would beinteresting. When you set up a line of suspense, ask yourself: Is there anyreason why anyone should be interested in this conflict? Are these valuesimportant enough to worry about?To illustrate why plot is important and how it relates to a story’s theme andsuspense, I want to project what would happen to some of the issues in AtlasShrugged and The Fountainhead if they were treated plotlessly.For instance, the meaning of the Dagny-Rearden romance in Atlas Shrugged is thattheir shared ideas, values, and struggle is the root of their love. Considerwhat a non-plot writer would have done with this material. Dagny would come toRearden’s office, they would start talking, and suddenly he would draw her intohis arms and they would kiss. This is realistic, it can happen—but it does nothave much dramatic value. The same scene could have happened between any twopeople, including villains such as James Taggart and Betty Pope.By contrast, in Atlas Shrugged I bring about Dagny and Rearden’s love scene atthe height of their mutual triumph, in connection with the achievement whichunites their careers: the opening of the John Galt Line. I make them admit theirlove during an event which presents in action the ideas and values they have incommon. This is an example of presenting an issue in plot terms.Or take the quarry scene in The Fountainhead, where Dominique meets Roark. Sheis an extreme hero-worshiper; she has declared that she will never fall in loveexcept with someone great; and she does not want to find a great man because shethinks he would be doomed. If, while researching one of her newspaper columns,she had met Roark as a rising architect, that would not have been dramatic. Butit is dramatic for her to meet the ideal man at the bottom, as nothing but aquarry worker. She had feared that the world would crush a hero—and the scenebrings her face-to-face with the fact that no matter what the world does to him,a hero is a value, and one she cannot resist.Now take the scene in Atlas Shrugged where Rearden quits. Throughout the story,a man’s going on strike had involved two elements: the victim’s realization thathe is and should stop being a victim, and his conviction that he cannot continuehis work under the present setup. Therefore, when I have Rearden quit, twoelements are necessary: Rearden’s final realization that he should go on strike,and the final atrocity of the looters which makes him decide that the situationis hopeless. The demand that he work at a loss in order to support his worstenemies, plus the government-engineered assault on his mills, dramatizes thewhole issue of the strike, specifically as it applies to Rearden’s life.Consider how a non-plot writer would make Rearden go on strike. Rearden would besitting at his desk or walking down a country road, thinking the situation over,and he would decide: “Things are pretty bad. I can’t stand it any longer. I’llquit.” A decision like this might be perfectly proper in real life, but it makesfor a lousy story. Such a decision is a purely psychological development,without any action to show the nature and elements of the decision.Take Dagny, the last of the strikers. So long as she does not understand thedeath premise in the villains, she thinks, justifiably, that they willultimately recognize that she is right. Only when she understands thetruth—when, at the banquet, she sees the attitude of James Taggart and his crowdtoward John Galt and learns that they are going to torture him—is she ready toquit.If nothing else had happened, however, this would have been a somewhatunsatisfactory way of making her go on strike. That which had represented hertie to the world—her railroad—would not have been directly involved. Todramatize properly Dagny’s act of going on strike, I had to place her in asituation where she must choose between the strike and her railroad. This wasthe right moment, therefore, to bring in the issue of the collapsing bridge.Dagny leaps to the telephone, hesitates for a last moment—and then the strikewins.This moment has emotional appeal because it unites all the issues of Dagny’slife—and does so not merely in her mind, but in action. An event takes place,and she has to make a decision about it.Think of other Romantic plot novels you have read and name to yourself themeaning of the events. Then project what would happen if the same issues werepresented without action—i.e., if the conflicts were resolved merely insomeone’s mind, while the outward event was nothing but someone sitting in aroom or walking down the street. The result would be plotlessness.To write a plot story, you have to be clear on what issues you want to presentand then think of the events that will present those issues in action. In allthe above illustrations, I had to find that which is essential to the issue andthen build an event around it.If Rearden decides to quit while sitting at his desk, the fact that he issitting at his desk is irrelevant to the issue being resolved. Suppose he isdriving his automobile and has a traffic accident which makes him interrupt histhinking long enough to call a garage. He is involved in some action whilemaking his decision about quitting, but the action is totally irrelevant to thedecision. Or suppose nothing happens on the day Rearden quits, except thatWesley Mouch telephones him from Washington and is rude; i.e., the last straw isa bureaucrat’s bad manners. This has something to do with the issue of rebellingagainst the looters, but it is not essential to that issue.Train your mind to think in essentials, not on issues of literature only, but onall issues. This is important for writing a good plot story, and it is even moreimportant for your own life. You do not want a life which is a badly constructedstory—a series of unrelated episodes with no purpose, progression, or climax.You can have a good life structure, as well as a good plot structure, by onemethod only: you must know essentials. You must recognize what is the importantthing in any issue you deal with."},{"pageContent":"4The Plot-ThemeThe plot-theme is the central conflict that determines the events of a plot. Itis the seed enabling you to develop a whole plot structure.I have said that both the author and the characters of a novel have to bepurposeful. In discussing the issue of plot-theme, I am concerned with the firstof these points—with how an author sets himself a plot purpose.Also, I talk here only about plot, not about theme—about you as dramatist, notyou as philosopher. If you have a message, that message determines yourplot-theme; if not, you start with the plot-theme. In either case, however, theproper literary work starts when you begin to construct a plot—and on this partof the job, the plot comes above your message. I do not mean that you can everdecide on a plot which contradicts your message—if it does, you must select adifferent plot. I mean only that the plot must be your sole consideration whileyou are constructing it.Therefore, when I talk here about the author’s purpose, I mean the plot purpose.First I will discuss the nature of conflict.Anything that a man desires and acts to achieve is a value, at least to him.(Whether the value is rational is a different question.) Therefore, a “conflictof values” does not necessarily mean some vast philosophical abstraction. Do notthink that it means at least “communism versus capitalism,” and that nothingless will do.If you look at a menu in a restaurant and have to decide whether to order icecream or cake for dessert, that is a conflict of values. If you do not likecake, only ice cream, there is no conflict. But if you like both and are unableto eat both, you must decide which to choose—and there is a momentary conflictuntil you do.This is not the kind of conflict on which you can build a story. Since thevalues involved in a story should be important enough to interest thecharacters, the author, and the reader, a conflict over a choice of dessertobviously will not do. But the point is that, even in such a small issue, thereis a clash of values.Now observe that stories about criminals usually form good plot structures.Crime stories are the most primitive, and most common, form of suspense dramas.(Today, unfortunately, we have nothing but crime stories if we want to read aplot story.)The reason is that a criminal by definition has a conflict of values. He wants,let us say, to rob a bank for the loot. At the same time, he does not want to bearrested. He wants both his safety and the product of an action which endangershis safety. Therefore, the moment you introduce a crime into a story, you have arudimentary, but proper, conflict of serious values.Project a story in which the lead character is a bank robber who does not carewhether he is arrested. He has decided that he will have security in jail, so hedoes not attempt to hide or escape. The story would be totally static. Or let ussay that he robs a bank in a city where there are no policemen, so that nobodyintends to do anything about it. No plot would be possible.To appreciate what makes a good plot situation, you must identify not only acharacter’s specific purpose, but also all the conflicts that this purposenecessarily engenders. If you say of a criminal, “His purpose is to rob,” thatis not yet a conflict. You must remember that his purpose is also to escape.Consider my short story “Good Copy” [see The Early Ayn Rand]. Laury, the maincharacter, is a small-town reporter. He wants to stir up excitement in order tofurther his career, so he stages a kidnapping. By doing so, he risks arrest,disgrace, and the loss of his career. This is already a simple conflict.Next, he falls in love with the girl whom he has kidnapped, and she falls inlove with him. This introduces a new clash of values. Laury has done somethingevil to the girl he loves (or at least he himself would identify it as evil).And the girl has fallen in love with her own kidnapper, which is not the same asfalling in love with a man whom she immediately recognizes as a real hero. If agirl falls in love with an apparent criminal and then discovers that in fact hejustifies her love, that is a happily resolved conflict, but still a conflict.Next, when a real criminal enters the scene and steals the girl from Laury,Laury is placed in his top conflict; to save the girl, he must surrender to thepolice, go to jail, and perhaps ruin his career. His career is now in conflictwith his love.That is a plot-theme.Consider what would happen to this story if some of its elements were omitted.Suppose Laury kidnapped an adult man—say, a nasty villain. The conflict would bemuch simpler and less serious. Since Laury does not care about his prisoner, heis in an easier position from the start; and if a real criminal then steals theprisoner from him, he might or might not decide to go to the police. Perhaps hemight send in an anonymous tip, but not risk his own arrest. Not too much is atstake.Or suppose Laury is not a reporter, but a real criminal, and he falls in lovewith a girl he has kidnapped. It would not then endanger his career if heconfesses and is arrested. There is no great clash of values.When you look for a plot-theme, you must look for a central conflict—and notmerely a one-line conflict, but a conflict complex enough to make constructing astory possible.Suppose you name as your initial plot assignment: A young man fakes a crime tostir up a dead town. That is an action, but not a conflict. There is no clash ofvalues, neither within the man himself nor between him and others. Maybe thedead town is eager to be stirred up.Or suppose you start with the idea: A young man fakes a crime, which turns intoa real crime when a real criminal interferes. That is not much of a conflict,and not much of a story can be built around it. The young man is put in anuncomfortable position, but one he can correct easily. To make possible aprogression of events, some other element has to be added, such as the man’sfalling in love with the victim of his crime. Then you have a real conflict withmany facets.The best way to see what kind of conflict can serve as a plot-theme is from theinside. So let us start a story from scratch.Suppose you decide to start and you face a blank. You cannot start from nowhere;you must start with something. So you decide, say, on a background: the MiddleAges.Again you face a blank, because from here on you can do anything; you can writeabout any aspect of the Middle Ages. And if something can be anything, it isactually nothing; if you feel, “Now I can write anything,” you will writenothing. Only when you have some specific entity in mind—some germ of a plot—canyou make something out of something and begin to build.Since plot is essentially conflict, you must look for a good conflict. So youdecide that since the Middle Ages was a religious period, the best figure foryour story is, say, a priest. If this priest merely practices his religion, youhave no story. You must put him in a conflict. If he is a medieval priest whotakes his religion seriously, the best possible conflict would be a sexualpassion—because that is what his religion forbids him. If his values all pertainto another dimension, the worst thing for him would be to acquire a strong valuepertaining to this earth—to fall in love.The next question is: with whom? If he falls in love with a young nun who shareshis values, that might be dramatic. But it is much more dramatic if he falls inlove with someone who represents the opposite of his values—with a symbol ofthis earth: a Gypsy dancer.The next question is: does she love him? If she does, he might be in conflictwith his conscience and with society, but at least his love is rewarded.However, if he is tempted to betray his religion for the sake of a guiltypassion, it is a more tragic and therefore stronger conflict if the girl doesnot love him.The next question is: does she love anyone else? Obviously, it is worse for himif she does.The next question is: if he attempts to pursue her, will anyone defend her? Yes,there is more conflict if someone will. Who? If the girl’s defender is astranger to the priest, he poses a mere factual obstruction. But what if herdefender is a protégé whom the priest brought up out of charity—the symbol tothe priest of his own religious duty properly performed?Now consider the conflicts of the other characters. The protégé is in a terribleconflict between his love for the girl and his devotion to his benefactor. Thegirl, being pursued by the priest (who in the Middle Ages would be verypowerful), is torn between her love for the other man and a threat to her life.This is the plot-theme of Notre-Dame de Paris.I am certain that Victor Hugo did not need this kind of logical analysis. Theinexhaustible ingenuity for plot shown in his plays indicates that writing andconflict were nearly synonymous to him. He had such a grasp of the nature ofconflict that its projection became automatic.When a man grasps the nature of conflict, he knows what is dramatic. To him, itmay feel as if a plot idea is inspirational: “I just thought of it.” But youhave to get to the stage where you have earned this kind of inspiration.When you compose a story, your mind does not go through the steps I outlined. Ifyou know a plot in advance, you can easily ask the right questions; but when youstart from scratch, so many possibilities exist at each turn that you cannot gothrough them consciously. You have to let your subconscious be the selector—andit can become the selector, throwing you the right, most dramatic situations,only if you know what conflict is and why it is necessary. When you know this,and when you have practiced by laboriously composing a few plots, yourimagination begins to work automatically and saves you a lot of the steps.What I have so far described of Notre-Dame de Paris is not the plot, but theplot-theme. The writer’s job is not finished. But once you have this kind ofcentral conflict, you do not have an “anything” anymore. You have set a limit tothe nature of your story, a limit that will be your standard of selection inregard to events.If you are not clear on your plot-theme, your story will fall apart; it willhave no logical continuity. Also, you yourself will not know what to do. Youwill start to include events because you feel like it, probably on the principleof association. One scene makes you feel something else, so you write anotherwhich has nothing to do with your central line. Your story is going nowhere, andyou do not know where to go.Before you construct a story, you must decide on the central conflict, whichwill then serve as the standard telling you what you have to include in order tofully develop this conflict, and what is superfluous.Let me give a few more examples of plot-themes.Suppose you want to write a love story. If two persons are in love, that is nota conflict; you have to make their love clash with some serious value of theirs.Suppose they belong to opposite nations at war. A plot is now possible, but notif they merely sit at home and long for each other; what you need is to put theminto an action conflict. Let us say he is an army officer and she a spy for theother side, with a dangerous secret to reveal, and you bring them to a positionwhere he has to either let her escape or shoot her to save his country. This isthe kind of conflict that can serve as a plot-theme—it has enough material in itto give you the line for a story (an unoriginal one, but bromides, it is said,became bromides because they were good the first time).Suppose you want to write a story about unrequited love. If a man is desperatelyin love with a woman, but she is not in love with him, that is not yet aconflict. But suppose she has to marry him for some outside reason—to get aninheritance, or to be allowed to stay in America—and he agrees to marry her inname only. Conflict, and thus the possibility of a good story, is immediatelyintroduced.Plot conflict is not conflict merely in a character’s mind or soul, while hesits at home. A plot conflict has to be expressed in action. When you constructa plot, therefore, you must be a “materialist” and concern yourself only withvalues and issues that can be expressed in physical action.Not everything is dramatizable by means of plot. For instance, the theme ofAnthem is the word I, and the story is built around one idea: What would happenif a man lost the concept I, and how would he regain it? This is not aplot-theme, because it is internal.In Anthem, there is no plot—no conflict of two or more persons against eachother. The hero’s adversary is the collective as such; and the collective has noparticular purpose beyond objecting to him escaping. He is not fightingindividuals, but the whole system. By contrast, We the Living, my most tightlyplotted story, has not only a social message, the evil of a collectivistsociety, but also a conflict among specific persons. The story is not “Kira [theheroine] against the state”; the villain is actually Andrei, along with suchlesser representatives of the communist system as Syerov, Sonia, and Victor. Hadit been “Kira against the state,” the story would have been plotless.Anthem is a psychological fantasy, not a full-scale indictment of collectivism.The collective is brought in only to explain why the hero is in the predicamentof not having the concept I. Had I introduced a plot, I would have taken thestory away from the main subject, because the issue of what happens in your mindwhen you lack a certain concept is not an action theme.In my short story “The Simplest Thing in the World” [see The RomanticManifesto], the hero sits at a desk, struggles to write something, and decidesthat he cannot. The story takes place in his mind; it is strictly anillustration of the psychological process of creation. It is as plotless asanything could be.Let us examine a few more plot-themes.The oldest and tritest is that of the prostitute with a heart of gold. Why is itso popular? Because a prostitute has cut herself off from all human values. Herprofession clashes with any other value she might want—respectability, a career,anything—and the worst clash comes if she falls in love. Then a dramatic storyis an immediate possibility.Usually, the prostitute falls in love, decides to abandon her profession, andthen struggles not to let the man find out the truth about her past. This is thepattern of Anna Christie, Anna Lucasta, and many lesser-known stories. Theconflict is resolved in one of two ways: the man always finds out the truth, andthen he either accepts it and forgives her (a happy ending), or he denounces herand commits suicide, and she jumps out of a window (a tragic ending). This isall that most people have done with this particular conflict.To see how the conflict can be improved, ask yourself how one can make it harderfor the heroine. Suppose her lover knows of her past and has forgiven it, butthen she discovers that if he marries her, he will ruin his career. He willnever be able to succeed at what he wants if his wife is a former prostitute. Hewill not give her up, so she has to make him give her up, which she can do onlyby pretending that she is still a prostitute. She has to hurt him terribly andmake him despise her—for his own sake. Now you have Camille, or La Traviata, oneof the best, most tragic, and most dramatic plot structures ever devised (whichis why that story will live forever and why there are so many bad imitations ofit).Take another trite plot-theme: the woman who sells herself to a man she does notlove for the sake of the man whom she does love. Usually, as in the opera Tosca,some villain who knows of her love tells her that if she sleeps with him, hewill spare her lover. The heroine makes the sacrifice and then has to hide thefact from her lover. This is a good, but simple, one-line conflict.Now ask yourself how one can make it harder for the characters. Suppose thewoman sells herself, not to a villain who forces her into it, but to a man whoreally loves her, whom she respects and whose love she takes seriously. He doesnot want to buy her, and she must hide from him that it is a sale—but she has tosell herself to save the man she really loves, a man who happens to be theparticular person the buyer hates most. This is a much more dramaticconflict—and it is the plot-theme of We the Living.I have asked myself: How can I make the conflict worse for everyone involved? Bycomplicating the conflict, I have made a standard theme original.The more conflicts involved in the same action situation, and the more seriousthe values for the participants, the better the dramatic situation and thetighter the plot you can construct from it. Once an author starts to develop his plot-theme, he has to make the eventsproceed from that plot-theme. For instance, in Notre-Dame de Paris, the priesthas the girl arrested and condemned to death, then offers her escape if she willgive herself to him. This is a dramatization in action of the plot-themeconflict. Suppose the priest was not instrumental in having the girl arrested,but merely stood on the sidelines and wanted to help her escape from jail inorder to have an affair with her. That would not be a plot structure (and threequarters of the book’s drama would be lost).In the novel, the hoboes of Paris attempt to rescue the girl from the cathedralof Notre-Dame, which they besiege. One of their leaders is the priest’s youngbrother, a dissolute, useless playboy, representing the complete opposite of thepriest’s ideals, but his only human value on earth besides the girl. In ahorrible scene, Quasimodo, the priest’s protégé, seizes this boy by the legs andcracks his skull against the façade of the cathedral.If there had been no younger brother, the priest’s conflict of values, and histragedy, would have been lesser. And while the siege of the cathedral wouldstill have had a certain plot value—the suspense of: “Will the heroine escape ornot?”—that incident becomes much more dramatic when it involves a dramatic lossto the priest.Every incident of Notre-Dame de Paris is ruled by the same principle: make it ashard as possible for the characters, and tie the lesser characters’ tragedies tothe main line of events. The best example is the story of the girl’s mother, anold recluse whose only desire is to find her daughter, who was stolen by theGypsies years ago. The woman hates all Gypsies, the heroine in particular. Atthe end, in the climax, by seizing the girl’s arm, she delays her long enough sothat the soldiers pursuing her are able to find her—and in that moment shediscovers that the girl is her daughter. Why is it dramatic? Hugo selects theworst conflict possible for both the old woman and the girl: in that moment,nothing worse could have happened to them than to discover each other in such amanner.This subplot is not involved in or essential to the plot-theme; but Hugo quiteproperly introduced it, in developing the story, since he could integrate it tothe main line of events. By contrast, if the old mother had not served a plotpurpose in the climax, she would have been irrelevant to and improper in thestory.At the end, the priest and Quasimodo watch the girl’s execution from the towerof the cathedral. If the priest had leaned forward too far and fallen off thetower, that would have been a disastrous anticlimax; it would have beencompletely purposeless, and therefore meaningless. But what did Hugo, thedramatist, do? Quasimodo, the devoted protégé, sees the priest gloating over theexecution and pushes him over the side of the tower. That is a resolution inaction of their conflict of values.The scene that follows, in which the priest is caught on a water-spout and hangsover the pavement, is magnificently dramatic. It is a physical illustration ofthe novel’s central conflict, and of its resolution : the girl is being executedon the square below; Quasimodo is standing above, crying; the priest hangsbetween life and death in sheer horror, and finally crashes to punishment.This is one of the most satisfying resolutions in literature (speaking only interms of dramatic values, which one judges by the nature of the conflict theauthor has set up). Hugo’s skill is such that he does not let the priest dieimmediately, without knowing the nature of his punishment. The priest lives longenough to know—his soul (and thus the reader’s soul) realizes consciously for afew minutes the spiritual meaning of the whole central conflict.If you understand the mechanics of what makes this good, you understand theessence of plot construction.In reading Notre-Dame de Paris, one feels interest, tension, horror. Watch forthe means by which these ends are achieved, and, underlying the writing style,you will see the skeleton of the plot structure, which in turn is determined bythe plot-theme. Those scenes at the end of the novel hold your attention becausethey are the logical resolution of the central conflict, the same conflict bywhich the author has held you up to this point. If the final scenes had come outof nowhere, they would not have held you.Of course, the author has to be a good stylist to write the scenes properly; butstyle is a secondary issue. The best style in the world will not save a plotlessstory. You might say of it: “That’s a lovely way of using words”—but nothingmore. The power of the climax of Notre-Dame de Paris comes from the combinationof good writing and that which makes the writing good: the magnificent plotstructure, magnificently resolved. Now I want to clarify the difference between drama and melodrama.A drama involves primarily a conflict of values within a man (as expressed inaction); a melodrama involves only conflicts of a man with other men. (These aremy own definitions. Dictionaries usually define melodrama as “exaggerateddrama,” which is not a proper definition because it leaves open the question ofwhat is or is not exaggerated.)Conflict with other men is the pattern of detective stories and Westerns, wheretwo sides who have nothing in common are set against each other by theiropposition of interests—as when a detective pursues a criminal. There isconflict, and a good plot can be built from it, but all the danger is physicaland external. The detective has only one aim: to catch the criminal; and thecriminal only one aim: to escape. The sole line of interest is: Who willoutsmart whom? There is no real drama, only the drama of action.But suppose the detective learns that the criminal is his own son. Then he iscaught between his love for the son and his duty as a policeman. He has aspiritual conflict, a conflict of values within himself—and the story is liftedfrom detective fiction into drama.My heroes in The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, Roark and Galt, hold nocontradictory values; it is through their friends, or the woman they love, thatthey are put into inner conflicts. The main line of the inner conflict of eachconcerns his (proper) love for a woman who, having not yet reached his level, isin some way still tied to the conventional world. Through her, the hero isthrown into conflict with a world in which he now has something at stake. In thecase of Roark and Dominique, the fault is Dominique’s; she is guilty of holdinga mistaken, though not irrational, philosophy. Once she comes to hold the rightphilosophy, there is no clash, and the hero’s two values, love and career,coincide. (What if the hero fell in love with an irrational woman who nevercorrected her views? A rational man would not do that, or not for long. When hegrasped the woman’s irrationality, he would feel no love.)This illustrates my premise that evil is impotent. It is only the good that (ifmistaken) can hurt the good. As Galt tells Dagny in Atlas Shrugged: “My actualenemies are of no danger to me. You are.”In The Fountainhead, Roark’s struggle for his career is not yet drama; it isreally melodrama. He struggles for his values, and society opposes him in thename of opposite values. But his relationship with Dominique or Wynand orCameron—his struggle for the souls of those people who are between himself andsociety—that is drama.In any properly constructed story of someone’s struggle against society, theelements of drama—of an inner conflict of values—always involve those people whoare partly in both camps. The drama comes from the hero’s concern with the fateof those souls who are torn between his world and an alien world.The physical events of Notre-Dame de Paris are of the kind that today would becalled rank melodrama, but they are actually drama since they are motivated byinner spiritual conflicts. For instance, if someone falls from a building, hangsfor a moment on a pole over the street, and then crashes to his death, this hasa certain physical suspense. Hugo makes the same kind of event spiritual anddramatic, rather than melodramatic. Or take a standard device of melodrama: agirl tied to the railroad tracks, with the train about to run her over. Ifvillains put her there, this is melodrama. But suppose that, for some reason,the man she loves put her there. Even though the physical action is rathercrude, I would then classify it as drama.In Atlas Shrugged, I deliberately use the standard devices of melodrama for aspiritual purpose. To end a part with the heroine crashing in an airplane,leaving the reader in suspense about her fate, is the kind of melodramaticdevice that would have been used in old movie serials (and that I would haveliked even as melodrama, because there is the drama of physical action). Butwhen one adds the spiritual significance—when one knows whom the heroine ofAtlas Shrugged is pursuing and why she is in that position—then her crashing inan airplane is drama. The same applies to the last chapter of the novel, whereRagnar Danneskjöld flies through a window in order to rescue Galt. If nospiritual values had been involved beyond a rescue, this would have beenmelodrama. But when such a physical action is tied to serious, important values,it is drama.In this sense, I believe with Victor Hugo that the more melodramatic the actionin which one can express the drama, the better the story. (By “melodramatic” Ihere mean physical danger or action.) If you can unite the two—if you can give arelevant and logical physical expression to the spiritual conflict youpresent—then you have high-class drama.One could conceivably write a story in which a man struggles against nothing buthimself, i.e., in which the only conflict is within the man, and the othercharacters are passive. The actions he would take in pursuit of one of hisvalues versus the other would create a logical plot progression. He could betorn between two women, one representing sacred love and the other profane; andhe could get himself into very dramatic situations where the two women would benot his antagonists, but only his foils, against whom or for whom he takes theactions. Such a story would be marvelous to write. But I have never seen itdone, and technically it would be difficult to do.The usual pattern of drama is a conflict within the hero himself and a conflictagainst other men. This creates the best, most complex plot structures. Forinstance, when Rearden in Atlas Shrugged hesitates between quitting his job andcontinuing the struggle, this is a conflict against outside forces. At the sametime, his love for Dagny is in conflict with what he thinks is his duty to hiswife. This is an inner conflict which complicates his struggle against theoutside world, ultimately causing him to almost lose that struggle.The important thing here is integration. Suppose Rearden’s romantic conflict hadnothing to do with his economic conflict; one issue was private and the otherpublic, and the two never met in the events of the story. Then the inclusion ofboth conflicts in the same story would be purely coincidental, and the plotwould be badly constructed. To create a plot structure, in sum, you must begin with a conflict; but notevery conflict is sufficient for constructing a novel. Many conflicts are“one-incident” conflicts; they are too simple and, therefore, too easilyresolved to permit a complex development. They might be good for a short story,but nothing more.A short story, being of limited length, should properly deal only with a singleincident—some one problem set up and resolved, without too many complications.To string out a whole series of incidents in the course of a short story makesfor a bad story—a mere synopsis of something that should have been longer.By contrast, a novel necessarily deals with a series of events. It may beconstructed around the events of a single day, but then, by means of flashbacksor otherwise, the events are extended into a complex structure.A novelette is an in-between form, with length as the attribute whichdistinguishes it from a novel or a short story. A novelette, like a novel, canhave more than a single incident, as Anthem does. Anthem presents a long seriesof incidents—in an abbreviated, essentialized, almost “impressionistic” form. Onthe other hand, a single-incident story might require so many details in thetelling that it becomes a novelette.Your central conflict must be complex enough to warrant the development ofevents on the scale you intend. If you want to write a novel, your plot-themehas to be a much more complicated conflict than what would suffice for a shortstory.A plot-theme is a conflict in terms of action, complex enough to create apurposeful progression of events. If you recall that this last is the definitionof plot, you will see that the plot-theme serves as the seed from which the treehas to grow. To test whether you have sufficient seed for a good tree, askyourself: Is this the worst situation in which I can put my hero? If these arehis values, is this the worst clash I can engineer between them?If you have chosen the worst clash possible, and if the values are important,you have a good seed for a good plot structure."},{"pageContent":"5The ClimaxThe climax is that event or development within a story where all the strugglesof the characters are resolved. Naturally, it comes near the end; how neardepends on the nature of the story. Sometimes the climax is the very last event;usually, however, a few closing events are needed to show the consequences ofthe resolution.For instance, the climax of We the Living is the scene where Andrei discoversthat Kira is Leo’s mistress, and, as part of the same development, Andrei’sspeech to the Party, when he rebels openly. The events which follow are merelythe conclusion.The climax of The Fountainhead is the Cortlandt explosion and Roark’s trial.The main issues of The Fountainhead were the following: the conflict of Roarkagainst society; the conflict of Roark against Dominique, who believed that thegood cannot win on earth—that evil is powerful and will always win; the conflictof Roark against Wynand, who believed that the pursuit of power (the power torule men by force) is a practical means of serving his own idealistic values;the contrast between Roark and Keating, the originator versus the second-handerwho attempts to rise by using other people rather than his own mind; theconflict of Roark against Toohey, the man deliberately committed to an evilphilosophy of power.The explosion of the Cortlandt housing project resolves all of these issues.The Cortlandt explosion (and aftermath) shows us Roark winning against society.It brings Dominique back to Roark by convincing her that the good does win,regardless of how terrible its struggle against evil is. When Wynand attempts todefend Roark in the Cortlandt case, he comes to realize that his whole lifepolicy is mistaken, that the kind of power he has sought—power over men—can onlydestroy his values, not serve them. The Cortlandt project is the climax ofKeating’s lifelong attempt to rise as a second-hander—and the final act of hishopeless destruction. As to Toohey, he is at the height of his power, hemobilizes all the collective forces of public opinion that he can in theCortlandt case—and he loses.This is the pattern of a complex plot climax—a climax in action, not merely indiscussion. I had to devise an action that dramatized and resolved all of theabove conflicts (and many smaller ones), showing in each case which side wins,which one loses, and why. Not every novel is as complex as The Fountainhead, butif you understand the method by which all its conflicts were integrated in itsclimax, you will be able to construct climaxes for stories of your own, whichmight involve fewer issues.(On a first novel, I do not advise that you try anything as complex as TheFountainhead. But there are no “shoulds” in a literary career. If you feel youcan, go right ahead.)The climax is that stage at which the worst consequences of the plot-themeconflict come into the open and the characters have to make their final choice.You can judge a story’s climax by asking: Has it resolved the central conflict?If not, the story is badly constructed.If you know the plot-theme of your story, you will know what is the properclimax, and whether or not you are letting your story down. If the centralconflict merely peters out—or if it is resolved un-clearly, so that the readerdoes not really know what final decisions the characters have made—this is animproper ending.A climax does not have to take place in one day or one scene. There is no ruleabout its length, which is determined by the nature of the story and by thenumber of issues which have to be resolved. In a stage play, the climax usuallydoes take place in one scene; in a novel, it can involve several events. Butthese events have to be part of one sequence. For instance, the Cortlandtexplosion and Roark’s trial are several chapters apart; but all the events inthis part of the story are intrinsically connected. The explosion sets off theclimax, and the other events—such as Toohey’s activity, Wynand’s failure,Roark’s trial and victory—follow from or are involved in this one action.The term anticlimax refers to a development after the climax that does notfollow from it. For instance, it would have been an anticlimax if, after theCortlandt trial, I had shown Roark and Wynand quarreling about an unpaidcommission on some building. Considering the issues that had been resolvedbetween them, such an issue could be of no importance. Its only function wouldbe to destroy the importance of the climax.Never resolve a smaller issue after the climax. In a story with multiplethreads, the problems of the lesser characters, if not involved in the climax,have to be solved before the climax. An example is the subplot of Irina andSasha in We the Living. It would have been a bad anticlimax had I shown theirfate—their being sent to Siberia and their parting—after I had shown Kira shoton the border. Or, in The Fountainhead, the romance of Keating and Katie wasimportant throughout the story, and some conclusion to it had to be reached. Butit would have been improper to show their last meeting after Dominique’s ride toRoark at the top of the Wynand building.It is important, however, that every conflict be resolved before the story ends.An annoying aspect of badly constructed novels is that the author often posesminor problems and then leaves them hanging in the air, as if he has forgottenall about them. (Of course, in really bad novels, even the major issues are notresolved.) In this regard, Chekhov had a good rule, which applies just as muchto novels as to plays: “Never hang a gun on the wall in the first act if youdon’t intend to have it go off in the third.” This applies to everything in aplot structure. (The breach of this rule is called a “red herring.”)When you construct a plot, the first event to figure out is always the climax.Suppose you have an idea for the theme and subject of a story but have not yetinvented the climax. Then do not start to outline the story from the beginning.If you set up a lot of interesting conflicts and seemingly connected eventswithout knowing where you are going, and then attempt to devise a climax thatresolves it all, the process will be an excruciating mental torture (and youwill not succeed). Therefore, in planning your story, get to your climax asquickly as possible. First devise an event that dramatizes and resolves theissues of your story, then construct the rest of the plot backward, by askingyourself what events are needed in order to bring your characters to this point.This is a good example of the process of final causation. In order to judge whatincidents to include in your story, you have to know your purpose in thestory—i.e., your climax. Only when you know this can you begin to analyze whichsteps, each serving as the efficient cause of the next, will lead yourcharacters logically to this decisive event.There is no rule about what element has to be the first germ of a story in yourmind. Fortunate writers are sometimes able to devise the climax first; in otherwords, they get a dramatic idea that constitutes the climax of a story, thenwork backward to construct the plot (which is sheer pleasure). This is a matterof pure accident. What kind of story you will tell is not an accident; itdepends on your premises. But whether you first think of a character and thenadd the other elements, or of an abstract theme, or of a conflict situation—thatis accidental. You are free to start at any point, because no matter where youstart, you have to complete the circle and include all the other elements.The only rule is that you have to know your climax (in dramatized terms) beforeyou start to outline the steps by which to arrive there.It has been said that Broadway is full of first acts. Many people can come upwith an intriguing first act but do not know what to do with the playthereafter. By contrast, a good dramatist starts with the third act. He does notnecessarily write the third act, or the climax, first—but he keeps it in mind.I once asked a woman writer of lending-library fiction about her method ofwriting, and she answered airily: “Oh, I throw a bunch of characters up in theair and let them come down.” Her stories read like it. This is a horribleexample of what not to do.In the same school are those modern writers who start with some assignment suchas “a mood of adolescence” or “my search for the meaning of life in prepschool.” When they write, the standard of selection is the mood of the moment.The result is the kind of story where you do not know why one incident wasincluded rather than another, or what is the purpose of it all. Behind such ahodgepodge is always a writer who starts without a defined plan and then writesas his feelings dictate.The best metaphor for the relationship of an outline to a story is blueprints inrelationship to a building. Nobody can start piling up girders or making windowtrimmings without a blueprint; a blueprint is necessary in order to judge whatare the stresses and strains, and what to put where. The same is true of theconstruction of a story.If you can carry the outline in your mind, you do not have to write it down, butit is helpful to do so if the story is complex. You might hold a story in yourmind in a generalized way and think it is all in order; yet when you put it downon paper, you might discover dull stretches in which nothing in particularhappens, or omissions of elements necessary to make later events dramatic.By writing down the outline, I do not mean writing a synopsis in objective termsthat an outsider would understand. I make my outlines as brief as possible, inwhat I call “headline style.” For instance, the events that finally went intoAtlas Shrugged were all present in my outline, but in this form: “[Chapter I]‘Who is John Galt?’ Eddie Willers, Taggart Transcontinental, James Taggart.Trouble on the Colorado line. Taggart’s evasions.”2[rand_9781101137239_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-2] When I write an outline, I know morespecifically than this what will go under the general headings, but I write downonly what I need in order to remember the progression and to get a bird’s-eyeview of the structureThere is no rule about how detailed or concise to make your outline. Trainyourself to know how much you can carry in your head, and how much you need towrite down in order to see the total and keep the structure of your story clearin your mind.When you come to the actual writing, there is no rule which demands that youhave to write from the first chapter onward. If your outline is good and youknow where you are going, the order of execution is optional. Some writers writethe end first, or any scene which they particularly want to write. This ispermissible provided they are skillful enough to hide the seams—i.e., providedthey can edit and integrate the total so that it reads as if the writer hadstarted from the beginning.I myself always start at the beginning. I can make notes on scenes, or ondialogue, in advance, but I cannot do the actual writing out of sequence; I dealwith such complex issues that too much in each scene depends on what has beenestablished earlier. If I started to concretize something in the middle whilethe concretes of the beginning were not firmly set in my mind, I would never beable to integrate the total or to write any scene properly.There is another reason why I cannot write out of sequence, even on a simplestory like Anthem. I am always very aware of what has gone before. One of mymethods is to have plants in the course of a story, on which I play later; i.e.,I have references in later scenes to something that was established earlier. Forinstance, at the end of Atlas Shrugged, Eddie Willers is suddenly talking toDagny [in his imagination], addressing a memory of their childhood that wasplanted in the first chapter. When I wrote that particular passage in the firstchapter, eleven years before I came to the end, I knew that I was planting itfor this purpose. I did the same with Halley’s Fifth Concerto: the descriptionof it in the first chapter of Atlas Shrugged is copied verbatim in the last.When the reader comes to it the second time, the same words have acquired a muchfuller meaning. In the first chapter, they are a generalized emotionalabstraction; by the end, they are a philosophical-emotional summation of theideas of the story.Planting those small touches in a scene to cash in on them later is a personalpreference of mine. Every good writer does not necessarily do it, and I mentionit here only as one reason why I prefer to write from the beginning onward. Butthat is not an absolute rule.The only absolute rule is that, whether you write from the beginning or the endor the middle, you must start plotting from the end."},{"pageContent":"6How to Develop a Plot AbilityYou have heard it said that “art cannot be taught.” There is a sense in whichwriting cannot be taught; but in a different sense, it can.To learn sciences like physics or history is simply to absorb facts consciously.Such sciences can be taught since the facts involved can be communicated.Physical skills like typing can also be taught. But to learn to type, more isrequired than merely listening to a factual lecture: you have to practice. Firstyou learn how to move your fingers and strike the keys—slowly and by consciouseffort. Learning to type then consists of automatizing this skill.At first you have to think of how to crook your fingers, how far to reach foreach letter, how to keep in tempo. Then you practice, faster and faster, so thateventually, when you look at a page of copy which you have to type, your fingersdo the rest “instinctively.” If an experienced typist were to ask herself, “Howdo I do it?” she would answer, “I just do it.”The same is true of dancing, or playing tennis, or any physical skill. First itis learned consciously—and you are in command of the skill when it becomesautomatic, so that conscious attention is no longer required.I pause on this analysis in order to illustrate what kind of automatic“instincts” have to be acquired in the realm of art.I mentioned earlier the complexity involved in writing a single sentence [seepp. 1-2]. I said that you could not figure out the sentence consciously. You sitdown to write, the sentence comes out a certain way, and with editing you canimprove it—but you cannot compose the sentence consciously in the way that youcan pass an examination in physics by stating the facts as you have learned andunderstood them.This is why the process of writing cannot be taught—not because it is a mysticaltalent, but because so complex an integration is involved that no teacher cansupervise the process for you. You can learn all the theory, but unless youpractice—unless you actually write—you will not be able to apply the theory.All that a teacher can do is explain the elements of writing and suggest amethod of thinking and practicing that will enable you to write. I cannot giveyou rules sufficient to make you wake up one day with a talent for plot. But youcan acquire such a talent if you know some general rules and the kind of mentalexercises that will integrate into a plot ability.So let me give you a few general rules for conditioning your plot imagination.CONCRETIZE YOUR ABSTRACTIONSOne rule that you need both as a human being and as a fiction writer is:Concretize your abstractions.In your daily life, in thinking, and in reading, you deal constantly with wideabstractions. If you have only a general idea of how to concretize these, theyare “floating abstractions.” If you can name one or two concretes under someconcept, but no more, it is a semifloating abstraction. You do have someknowledge of how it applies to reality, but your understanding is very limited.For instance, if you are asked what you mean by “independence,” and you say, “Aman who thinks for himself,” that is one good concrete. Much more is necessary,however, in order to understand such an abstraction as “independence.”If you catch yourself using floating or semifloating abstractions, learn toconcretize them. Project in ultimate action what any abstraction means.For instance, it is worthless to say: “Love, well, everybody knows what loveis.” To bring it down to earth, you might first say: “Love is a human emotion ofappreciation for a value.” This is a good philosophical definition, but it isnot yet concrete. To make it concrete, you must project what it means to observelove. Not only: How does it feel? but: How do you know it in other people? Awriter has to project his abstractions in specific concretes. That he knowssomething inwardly is not enough; he has to make the reader know it; and thereader can grasp it only from the outside, by some physical means. Concretize toyourself: If a man and a woman are in love, how do they act? what do they say?what do they seek? why do they seek it? That is the concrete reality, for which“love” is merely a wide abstraction.You do not have to start concretizing all your concepts systematically. Startwith those which interest you most, or proceed at random, whenever you catchyourself using a floating abstraction. Do it whenever your mind is unemployed,on the bus or while brushing your teeth. Train your mind to concretize everyabstraction as a general policy. As with typing, it is only at first that youhave to do it by conscious, measured steps. Eventually it becomes an automaticmental habit.(I recommend that you start with those abstractions all writers deal with butfew understand fully in concrete terms—i.e., all abstractions which pertain toemotions, values, virtues, and actions. Most intelligent adults think theyunderstand the abstractions that relate to human beings—love, hate, fear, anger,independence or dependence, selfishness or unselfishness—but if they try, theycannot easily reduce them to concrete reality.)Not to carry floating abstractions in your mind is the first requisite forinventing a plot—because action is concrete and physical. Abstractions do notact.Once you can relate every abstraction to its concretes, you will know how totranslate general themes into action. Any theme that you want to write a storyabout starts in your mind (once you name it) as an abstraction. To translatethat abstraction into a plot, you need a vast number of concretes at your“instinctive” call so that your subconscious can pick the relevant ones.For instance, to present a conflict between individualism and collectivism, youmust have stored away countless concretes under those abstractions—in thepersonal, political, and philosophical realms. From these stored concretes, yoursubconscious can then select and integrate events that dramatize your theme. Youwill not have to figure out by conscious effort: “Roark is an individualist, soof course he wouldn’t do a housing project; but maybe he would—under whatconditions? Well, what would an individualist do and what is ‘individualism’?”I did not go through this latter process; instead, the idea for the climax ofThe Fountainhead hit me like Newton’s apple. One day, during lunch-I canremember where and in what drugstore—when I was thinking of the climax, the ideafor the housing project suddenly flashed into my mind. But “accidents happenonly to those who deserve them.” In other words, the idea came to me because Ihad done an enormous amount of thinking while working on the outline and themeof The Fountainhead (and long before).This kind of incident is what makes nonintrospective writers say: “Ah, writingis a mystical talent—it just comes to me.” By contrast, since I am a goodintrospector, I can tell exactly how these things happen. I cannot tell whatsubconscious connections are made in my mind preceding the moment an ideastrikes. But I do know that the subconscious works somewhat like a [computer].If you feed it the right data and ask the right question, it gives you theanswer. You do not have to know how the wires connect inside.Fill your subconscious with as many concretes as possible under everyabstraction you deal with—then forget about them. Your subconscious does notforget. The concretes will be there when, dealing with some complex theme andneeding a complex integration, you press the buttons of your [computer]: “I needa climax that resolves issue X, problem Y.” Your thought here is a series ofabstractions. If these are fully in your control—if they are not merely floatingabstractions without content—your subconscious makes the connections and givesyou the answer (sooner or later, depending on the complexity of the problem).You must be able to work backward and forward from the abstract to the concrete.In other words, you must be able to concretize any abstraction you deal withand, vice versa, to draw the abstraction from any concretes you deal with.Train yourself to see what any series of concretes—whether people, events,character traits, or whatever—have in common. “I have seen a number of people doX. The premise behind it is Y.” When you think like this, you are abstracting aconcept or a general principle from a number of concretes.If you do not constantly draw abstractions of your own, you lose a lot of goodmaterial. For instance, you might observe some characteristic thing that peopledo which would be good to include in your writing. But if you store it in yoursubconscious without tying it to anything else, it is lost. It is only aconcrete observation and will be of no value to you.Instead, tie your observations to abstractions. For instance, you observe thatsomeone is aggressive in a nasty way, and that he is also frightened anduncertain. You might conclude that he is putting on a show, that he is a cowardwho is aggressive as a defense. This is classifying a concrete under anabstraction—and this is the kind of observation that will be valuable to you asa writer.When you master the relationship of abstractions to concretes, you will know howto translate an abstract theme into action, and how to attach an abstractmeaning to an action idea. If you start with a philosophical abstraction, youwill be able to translate it into a conflict, a climax, and a plot. Or if youget a plot idea which at first glance has no philosophical meaning, you will beable to discover the meaning and develop the idea into a serious story.If you have to crank the process by hand because you have not yet mastered theabstract-concrete relationship, it will take forever and seem impossible. Onlywhen your mind is geared to dancing back and forth—and I mean dance, with thatkind of ease—between abstractions and concretes will you be able to give thephilosophical meaning to an action idea or the action story to a philosophicalidea.Plot action is not mere physical action, and it is not mere spiritual or mentalaction. Some writers think that if a man takes a trip and comes home, thisconstitutes plot action (he did something!), just as the writers of badmelodramas think it is plot action if someone is chasing someone and there isfive minutes of speeding cars or horses galloping. The counterpart of this erroris conflicts within a man’s mind which are not illustrated in physical action.The arty, modem stream-of-consciousness novels, on the one hand, and badmelodramas on the other, where characters run around hectically, are twoversions of the same error. (The latter is action—so why is it so dull? It isdull because it is mere physical action.) Proper plot action is neither spiritalone nor body alone, but the integration of the two, with the physical actionexpressing the spiritual action involved.To construct a proper plot, you have to be (at least as a dramatist) on thepremise of mind-body integration. If to any extent you hold the premise of amind-body split, it will hamper your plot ability, because it will lead you toconsider dramatic the mere fact that a man experiences something in his ownmind, or that he moves around in some mindless physical action.A story is like a soul-body relationship. Whether you start with the body (theaction) or the soul (the abstract theme), you must be able to integrate the two.And the proper integration of idea to action requires a mind that is notconfined to thinking merely in terms of physical concretes, or merely in termsof floating abstractions.THINK IN TERMS OF CONFLICTA proper plot situation involves a conflict of values. Therefore, the nextpoint—the real fiction writer’s point—is: Learn to think in terms of conflict.A valuable exercise is the following. When you go to modern movies, watchtelevision shows, or read modern novels, which with rare exceptions are plotless(or have inept plots), try to correct them mentally. If a story beginsinterestingly but then peters out, see what you could have done with thatbeginning, how you could have turned that story into a real conflict ofimportant values. You will encounter such wasted opportunities in almost everymodern story (although some are no good even for this purpose because they lackany rudiments of a plot).I am not recommending plagiarism. I recommend this only as a mental exercise,only as training in how to give a purposeful plot structure to some shapelesspresentation of undefined events and people. And the lead to doing it is: Thinkin terms of conflict.At the start of my career, I had a valuable conversation with Cecil DeMille. Itwas my first year in Hollywood, I was twenty-two, and I had already developed astrong plot sense; but although I could recognize a good plot story, I had notconsciously identified what characteristics made it good. DeMille told mesomething that clarified the issue for me.He said that a good story depends on what he called “the situation,” by which hemeant a complicated conflict [a plot-theme], and that the best stories are thosewhich can be told in one sentence. In other words, if the essential situation(not the whole story, of course) can be told in one sentence, this makes for agood plot story.He told me how he happened to buy the story for one of his most successfulsilent-day pictures, Manslaughter. It was originally a novel, and a friend ofhis wired him in Hollywood advising him to buy it for the screen. The friendincluded only one sentence about the story: “A righteous young district attorneyhas to prosecute the woman he loves, a spoiled heiress, for killing a policemanin an automobile accident.” This is all DeMille knew about the story, and hebought it.This kind of sentence contains all the elements of a good story—because it givesyou the conflict. Once you have this much, you can tell what kind of events youmust construct in order to lead the characters to the setup, and what kind ofevents are its possible consequences. You will not grasp all the eventsimmediately, a great many choices are involved—but you see the possibility of adramatically constructed progression.Anyone starting with this kind of idea is safe dramatically. It would take a badwriter to ruin it.This is what you must aim at. Learn how to construct this type of situation,whether on your own or as you read plotless books or watch plotless televisionand movies. That will be your first and probably your most important step towardbecoming a plot writer.TAP YOUR EMOTIONSWhen you try to imagine events, ask yourself what kind of thing you would liketo see happen.The preceding leads have been technical; this one is emotional. You must startwith the abstract idea of a conflict, but thereafter your own values and yourpersonal imagination will be a reliable dramatic selector. Ask yourself,therefore, what kind of conflicts and events you would find interesting. Youwill be surprised at how productive this is.When you ask this question, do not censor yourself or check yourself againstyour moral code. Simply tap your emotions; you can judge later whether they areright or wrong. Take yourself selfishly as the one who has to enjoy thespectacle of your story’s events. Do not ask what kind of events would make thebest propaganda, or what kind your potential audience might like—no, ask whatyou personally would like to see happen.That is the best springboard for inventing events."},{"pageContent":"7CharacterizationCharacterization is the presentation of the nature of the people in a story.Characterization is really the presentation of motives. We understand a personif we understand what makes him act the way he does. To know a person well is toknow “what makes him tick,” as opposed to not seeing beyond the superficialactions of the moment.The main means of characterization are action and dialogue—just as it is only bymeans of their actions and words that one can observe the characters of otherpeople in real life. There is no way to know the soul (the consciousness) ofanother except by means of physical manifestations: his actions and words (nothis words in the sense of philosophical declarations, but his words in thecontext of his actions). The same applies to fiction. As part ofcharacterization, a writer can sum up in narrative passages a character’sthoughts or feelings, but merely to do that is not characterization.The actions that a writer shows must be integrated to his understanding of thecharacters’ motives—which the reader then grasps by means of these actions. Ihave talked about the same kind of circle in relation to plot: to project anabstract theme, you must devise the concrete events from which the reader willin turn derive that theme. The same applies to characterization: to project aconvincing character, you need to have an idea of the basic premises or motiveswhich move his actions—and by means of these actions, the reader will discoverwhat is at the root of the character.The reader can then say: “This action is consistent, but that action is not.” Hecan say it on the grounds of what the actions presented have implied about thecharacter’s motives.This does not mean that you must present every character in a single key, givinghim only one attribute or passion. It means that you must integrate a character.A character comes across as an integrated person when everything he says anddoes is internally consistent.I want to emphasize that a character can have enormous conflicts andcontradictions—but then these have to be consistent. You must select his actionsso that the reader grasps: “This is what’s the trouble with this character.” Forinstance, there are contradictions in Gail Wynand’s actions throughout TheFountainhead, but these contradictions are integrated to their ultimate root. Ifa character has contradictory premises, to say “I understand him” means: “Iunderstand the conflict behind his actions.”When a character “does not jell,” it means that the evidence offered about himis never unified, neither into one whole nor into a comprehensible conflict.In Sinclair Lewis’s Arrowsmith, the hero is supposed to be a medical scientistof unusual stature; yet one is never convinced of his actual devotion toscience.The reader meets him first as a boy: “Cross-legged in the examining-chair in DocVickerson’s office, a boy was reading ‘Gray’s Anatomy.’ His name was MartinArrowsmith.... By sheer brass and obstinacy he had, at fourteen, become theunofficial, also decidedly unpaid, assistant to the Doc.” For a boy of that ageto want to work in a doctor’s office is unusual, and it might indicate a buddingpassion for medicine. But observe the next touch. In the office stands “askeleton with one gaunt gold tooth. On evenings when the Doc was away, Martinwould acquire prestige among [his friends] by leading them into the unutterabledarkness and scratching a sulfur match on the skeleton’s jaw.”I submit that this touch alone destroys the earnestness of the character.It is quite possible that a devoted crusader of science might in childhood havepulled such a stunt—as a prank of the moment, meaning nothing in particular. Butwhen you draw a character, everything that you say about him acquiressignificance by the mere fact of being included in your story. Art isselectivity. You cannot re-create every minute detail about anything, neitherabout an event nor about a person; therefore, that which you choose to include,or to omit, is significant—and you have to watch carefully the implications ofwhat you say or omit. If you introduce a boy as seriously interested in medicineand then show him playing silly, childish pranks, the earnestness of hisdevotion is immediately undercut.The subsequent treatment of Arrowsmith follows the same pattern. His devotion toscience in his college years is presented almost apologetically, in fragmentarybits (the author’s tone being one of friendly, patronizing amusement). On theother hand, his social relationships and his feelings toward his fraternity areshown in great detail. He is presented as an average boy; apart from the factthat he takes medicine seriously while others take it lightly, he is given nocharacter trait that separates him from others. He’s just one of the boys.I question the idea that a man with a great passion for science (as Arrowsmithis later shown to have) would be “one of the boys” in college. Any man with aserious central ambition is more of an outsider in his youth than in lateryears. It is particularly in his youth that he will be misunderstood andresented by others.The attempt to make Arrowsmith a regular fellow, and to separate his private andsocial life from his attitude toward science, undercuts his characterization.Except for a few scenes dealing specifically with medicine, the reader at nopoint feels the presence of any driving force in the man.Throughout Arrowsmith’s later career, and throughout his romantic life, we see aman who blunders helplessly. His main actions do carry him toward his majorlove, which is the pursuit of pure science. But there are passages where hesays, in effect: “To hell with science. I guess I’ll be a small-town doctor andmake money.” Then he is drawn back to science. One might say: Here is a man whois struggling with the decision of whether or not to devote himself to science.But the unanswered question is: Why is he struggling in this manner? Why thedoubts? How are they to be reconciled with his strong basic premise?Arrowsmith’s fumbling helplessness in regard to everything except the laboratoryis never integrated to his strengths as a crusading scientist. The two elementssimply coexist in the character; they do not logically go together, nor are theyin any real conflict. As a result, the characterization is out of focus. At theend of the novel, the reader does not have a clear idea of Arrowsmith’s motivepower—of what makes him tick.By contrast, Leora, Arrowsmith’s wife, is projected clearly. From the moment wefirst meet her, we know that she is a girl who faces life directly, is rationaland brave, goes after what she wants, and states her desires openly. She is avery appealing, and consistent, character; she has a directness and simplicityabout her that remains in all of the story’s different circumstances (includingsome very complicated ones). The reader sees her ever more fully, but she neverchanges in essence.Leora’s actions are self-explanatory. From her introduction onward, the readernever has to wonder why she acts as she does. He feels: “It would be like her todo that.” Why does he feel it? Because her every action, decision, and word isconsistent with the way she has been introduced.(The only exception is certain inexcusable lines of dialogue she is given to theeffect that “I’m just a simple, ordinary woman.” She is not an ordinary woman,but a true heroine; and I resent, philosophically, this manner of labeling acharacter. The fact that Leora is not an ambitious creator on her own does notmake her “just a little woman.” My guess is that Lewis himself felt that Leorawas the opposite of an ordinary woman; that he rather liked her—and had toassure the reader that he was impersonal and “objective,” by the Naturalisticstandard. He in effect says: “Don’t think this is anything much.” To aNaturalist, nothing exists that is “anything much.”)You can project your character only by means of what you say on paper; butbehind every line and action, there is much more than what you put in words. Noaction is taken in a vacuum, and an alert reader is automatically watching forthe meaning of every line and action. He is constantly on the lookout: “I’mmeeting a new character. What makes him tick?” He is constantly makinglightning-like calculations : “What premise does this action come from? What isthe motive of a man who does X? The character says Z. Why does he say it?”In order to show how much is implied between the lines, I have rewritten a scenefrom The Fountainhead. It is the first scene between two of the majorcharacters, Howard Roark and Peter Keating. Read first the dialogue of theoriginal scene (I have omitted the descriptions), and then the rewritten versionof the same scene. Watch for the means of characterization. What do you learnabout the two men, and how do you learn it? What impression do you have of them,and what gave you that impression?3 [rand_9781101137239_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-3][The scene takes place on the day Roark has been expelled from college andKeating has graduated with high honors.] “Congratulations, Peter,” said Roark.“Oh... Oh, thanks ... I mean ... do you know or ... Has mother been tellingyou?”“She has.”“She shouldn’t have!”“Why not?”“Look, Howard, you know that I’m terribly sorry about your being ...”“Forget it.”“I ... there’s something I want to speak to you about, Howard, to ask youradvice. Mind if I sit down?”“What is it?”“You won’t think that it’s awful of me to be asking about my business, whenyou’ve just been ... ?”“I said forget about that. What is it?”“You know, I’ve often thought that you’re crazy. But I know that you know manythings about it—architecture, I mean—which those fools never knew. And I knowthat you love it as they never will.” “Well?”“Well, I don’t know why I should come to you, but—Howard, I’ve never said itbefore, but you see, I’d rather have your opinion on things than the Dean‘s—I’dprobably follow the Dean’s, but it’s just that yours means more to me myself, Idon’t know why. I don’t know why I’m saying this, either.”“Come on, you’re not being afraid of me, are you? What do you want to askabout?”“It’s about my scholarship. The Paris prize I got.”“Yes?”“It’s for four years. But, on the other hand, Guy Francon offered me a job withhim some time ago. Today he said it’s still open. And I don’t know which totake.”“If you want my advice, Peter, you’ve made a mistake already. By asking me. Byasking anyone. Never ask people. Not about your work. Don’t you know what youwant? How can you stand it, not to know?”“You see, that’s what I admire about you, Howard. You always know.”“Drop the compliments.”“But I mean it. How do you always manage to decide?”“How can you let others decide for you?” Now read the rewritten version of the same scene: “Congratulations, Peter,” said Roark.“Oh ... Oh, thanks ... I mean ... do you know or ... Has mother been tellingyou?”“She has.”“She shouldn’t have!”“Oh well, I didn’t mind it.”“Look, Howard, you know that I’m terribly sorry about your being expelled.”“Thank you, Peter.”“I ... there’s something I want to speak to you about, Howard, to ask youradvice. Mind if I sit down?”“Go right ahead. I’ll be glad to help you, if I can.”“You won’t think that it’s awful of me to be asking about my business, whenyou’ve just been expelled?”“No. But it’s nice of you to say that, Peter. I appreciate it.”“You know, I’ve often thought that you’re crazy.”“Why?”“Well, the kind of ideas you’ve got about architecture—there’s nobody that’sever agreed with you, nobody of importance, not the Dean, not any of theprofessors ... and they know their business. They’re always right. I don’t knowwhy I should come to you.”“Well, there are many different opinions in the world. What did you want to askme?”“It’s about my scholarship. The Paris prize I got.”“Personally, I wouldn’t like it. But I know it’s important to you.”“It’s for four years. But, on the other hand, Guy Francon offered me a job withhim some time ago. Today he said it’s still open. And I don’t know which totake.”“If you want my advice, Peter, take the job with Guy Francon. I don’t care forhis work, but he’s a very prominent architect and you’ll learn how to build.”“You see, that’s what I admire about you, Howard. You always know how todecide.”“I try my best.”“How do you do it?”“I guess I just do it.”“But you see, I’m not sure, Howard. I’m never sure of myself. You always are.”“Oh, I wouldn’t say that. But I guess I’m sure about my work.” The plot content is the same in the rewritten scene as in the original, but thecharacters are different. In particular, Roark is changed.In the original scene, Roark is impervious to Keating’s and the conventionalworld’s view of his expulsion. “ ‘Has mother been telling you?’ ‘She has.’ ‘Sheshouldn’t have!’ ‘Why not?’ ” Keating thinks that his own triumph would hurtRoark on the day of Roark’s expulsion. But Roark does not share this comparativestandard; and at first he does not even understand it. His “Why not?” indicatesthe difference between his standards and Keating’s better than any other answercould have done. Even if the reader does not pause to analyze that sentence, itconveys the complete directness of a man who in effect says: “What’s your kindof triumph to me? My standards are different.”In the rewritten scene, Roark says: “Oh well, I didn’t mind it.” He accepts thecomparative standard and agrees (although in a generous manner) that hisexpulsion is a disaster and Keating’s graduation a triumph.If you approach writing a scene like this with the idea that your hero is anindependent man but you have not identified the issue any more clearly, youmight think: “He’s a strong man, so he’ll say: ‘I didn’t mind it.’ ” This iswhere you have to watch your implications. If he says, “I didn’t mind it,” thatimplies something specific about his basic premises and motivation. If he says,“Why not?” that implies something entirely different.In the original scene, Roark is courteous but indifferent. Not only does hereject Keating’s standards, he shows no desire to discuss them; although he willlisten if Keating has something to say. When Keating says, “There’s something Iwant to speak to you about, Howard, to ask your advice. Mind if I sit down?”Roark merely asks, “What is it?” He is courteous to Keating in a mannerconsistent with their difference of standards.In the rewritten scene, Roark says: “Go right ahead. I’ll be glad to help you,if I can.” Here he is courteous beyond politeness—he is actually interested.That is a contradiction, because it raises the question: Why, given theiropposite standards, is he interested?In the original scene, Roark at one point shows friendliness. Observe what thatfriendliness proceeds from. Keating says: “Well, I don’t know why I should cometo you, but—Howard, I’ve never said it before, but you see, I’d rather have youropinion on things than the Dean‘s—I’d probably follow the Dean’s, but it’s justthat yours means more to me myself, I don’t know why. I don’t know why I’msaying this, either.” This is a speech of profound respect for Roark: Keatingacknowledges the superiority of Roark’s standards, and he shows sincerity. Roarkcan reward that with a moment of friendliness, which amounts to saying: “If thisis how you feel, I can talk to you.” Observe also the generous form of hisfriendliness. He says: “You’re not being afraid of me, are you? ” He knows thatKeating is afraid of him, and to make the conversation easier for Keating, heacknowledges this openly.I have seen young writers influenced by me make their hero a monotone. He speaksonly in snappy yeses or noes, never shows anything but a tight grimness, and isalways on the fighting premise. This is bad characterization; it is incomplete.The reader necessarily thinks: “A man cannot be this way all the time—nor canany man have only one premise.”Good characterization is not a matter of giving a character a single attributeor making him monotonous. It is a matter of integrating his every particularaspect to the total, the focus of integration being his basic premises. Forinstance, Roark is not only the man of integrity, fighting everybody. He can befriendly and charming; he can be generous; he even has a few humorous lines(though I think only two in the whole novel). He has all sorts of facets. But hecomes across as a monolith because every facet is consistent with his basicpremises.The above example from the original scene is an illustration of this: Roark canbe generous and friendly to Keating, but only in the context of Keating’sacknowledging his, Roark’s, premises.In the rewritten scene, when Keating says, “You won’t think that it’s awful ofme to be asking about my business, when you’ve just been expelled?” Roarkanswers, “No. But it’s nice of you to say that, Peter. I appreciate it.” Here heshows friendliness in exchange, not for Keating’s tribute to his standards, butfor Keating’s condolences on the bad state to which those standards have broughthim. Instead of being a generous man extending a helping hand when deserved, hebecomes a man accepting charity. In this context, Roark’s friendliness acquiresan entirely different meaning.Again, if you approach a scene like this with the abstract intention “I willshow my hero being friendly,” but you have not concretized the nature of thatfriendliness or integrated it with your hero’s other premises, you might commita contradiction like the above and then wonder why your character does not comeacross as you intended.In the rewritten scene, when Keating says, “You know, I’ve often thought thatyou’re crazy,” Roark asks, “Why?” This shows concern for Keating’s opinion, andeven self-doubt. In some other context where he had a reason to put Keating onthe spot, Roark could have asked this question defiantly or sarcastically. Butin the context of this scene, he accepts a gratuitous insult by saying, ineffect: “Oh, you think I’m crazy. Why? Maybe I am.”In the original scene, Keating says: “You know, I’ve often thought that you’recrazy. But I know that you know many things about it—architecture, I mean—whichthose fools never knew, And I know that youlove it as they never will.” This shows what a context can do to a single line:accompanied by such an explanation, the statement “you’re crazy” is a greatcompliment. But if Keating merely says, “I’ve often thought that you’re crazy,”Roark should stop talking to him then and there—if he is the Roark intendedoriginally.In the original scene, when Keating finally asks his question, Roark takes hisproblem seriously and gives him advice, not about a concrete, but about thewider principle involved. “If you want my advice, Peter, you’ve made a mistakealready. By asking me. By asking anyone. Never ask people. Not about your work.”Roark gives Keating the benefit of his own convictions, telling him that thereis a more serious issue involved than merely the choice of the twopossibilities. The line “If you want my advice, Peter, you’ve made a mistakealready” is unexpected, arresting, and unconventional; and since Roark backs itup by giving his reasons, the reader not only sees the nature of Roark’spremises, but also a boy who is thinking—and thinking in much wider terms thanthe particular choice of a job.In the rewritten scene, Roark does the conventional thing: he gives Keatingspecific advice. This implies that there is nothing wrong in Keating’s askingfor such advice or following another man’s opinion.(In the book, Roark later gives Keating the same advice, but contemptuously andindifferently, simply to end the conversation. By that time, Keating’s sincerityis gone; he is putting on an act for Roark; and Roark merely dismisses him. Thisagain is an issue of the implications of a context.)In the original scene, my best touch of characterization is the followingexchange. Keating says, “How do you always manage to decide?” and Roark answers,“How can you let others decide for you?” These two lines convey the essence ofthe two characters. In the rewritten scene, I dropped them.I want to pause on these lines in order to show how to integrate philosophicalpropaganda into fiction.Such an issue as “I always decide for myself” versus “I go by the opinions ofothers” is extremely wide. If two characters started discussing it out of aclear sky, that would be sheer propaganda. But in the above scene, the two menare stating an abstract issue as it applies to their own problems and to theconcrete situation before the reader’s eyes. The abstract discussion is naturalin the context, and, therefore, almost unnoticeable.This is the only way to state abstract principles in fiction. If the concreteillustration is given in the problems and actions of the story, you can affordto have a character state a wide principle. If, however, the action does notsupport it, that wide principle will stick out like a propaganda poster.How much philosophy you can present without turning into a propagandist, asopposed to a proper fiction writer, depends on how much of an event thephilosophy is covering. In the above scene, it would have been too early for thetwo boys to make more of a statement than they did, even though the issue statedis independence versus second-handedness, which is the theme of the whole book.Given what is specifically concretized in the scene, one exchange of lines isenough abstract philosophy.A speech like John Galt’s in Atlas Shrugged would have been too much for Roark’scourtroom speech in The Fountainhead. The events of The Fountainhead do notillustrate as many issues as do the events of Atlas Shrugged.To judge how long a philosophical speech should be, go by the followingstandard: How detailed and complex are the events which you have offered toconcretize the speech? If the events warrant it, you can make as long astatement as you wish without taking the reader outside the framework of thestory.Now look again at the rewritten scene. I depart blatantly from the originalRoark when he says: “Well, there are many different opinions in the world.” Thisimplies a tolerant respect for all differences of opinion, and thus anonobjective, nonabsolute view of ideas—as contrasted to such absolutism in theoriginal scene that Roark does not even bother to argue about ideas withKeating.Next, Keating says: “You always know how to decide.” Roark answers : “I try mybest.” If you are presenting a man who is independent and who will go on tofight the whole world, and if in one of the first scenes he says, “I try mybest,” you give yourself a handicap in characterization that no amount of heroicactions on your hero’s part can overcome. It is a blatant contradiction: astrong man who relies only on his own judgment would never utter such a modestline.Next, Keating asks: “How do you do it?” Roark answers: “I guess I just do it.”Journalistically, this line can pass almost unnoticed; that is the normal wayfor men of average premises to speak. But no heroic rebel, particularly not arepresentative of rationality, will ever say “I guess I just do it” about hisown career.Then Keating says: “But you see, I’m not sure, Howard. I’m never sure of myself.You always are. ” Roark answers: “Oh, I wouldn’t say that. But I guess I’m sureabout my work.” This line characterizes Roark as a man who does not holdself-confidence as an absolute virtue; he sees no reason why he should beconfident about anything except his work. The result is that he becomessuperficial and concrete-bound. He might be principled in regard to his work,but he has no wider idea of principles, no basic philosophical convictions orvalues. In effect, he becomes like Arrowsmith. As I said, Arrowsmith too has acertain integrity and determination in regard to his work, but the (totallyunexplained) difference between his professional attitude and his behavior as aman is so vast that the character does not integrate.To understand a personality is like peeling off one onion skin after another.First you understand the immediate motive behind his actions. Then you ask: Whythis motive? You peel off another skin and go into deeper motivation—until youcome to grasp the fundamentals of the personality. The same applies tocharacterization in fiction.To allow Roark such a line as “I’m not always sure, but I am about my work” isto say that he has integrity professionally, but not otherwise. That is aone-layer, one-onion-skin explanation: for some un-stated reason, Roark hasintegrity in regard to architecture. But left open are the wider questions: Whyin regard to architecture? and: Why not in regard to other matters?This brings us to the difference between Naturalism and Romanticism incharacterization. The Naturalistic method is to present only one layer ofmotivation; the Romantic method is to look not only at the immediate onion skin,but as deep as the author can go.The Naturalist presents merely the immediate reason for a character’s actions;for instance, if a man is unscrupulous about money, it is because he is“greedy.” The Romanticist goes deeper and indicates why a man is greedy, andperhaps even what is the nature of greed.In The Fountainhead, I show that Roark is motivated by his love for theprofession of architecture—but I do not stop there. I go deeper: What is themeaning of a love for a creative profession? And deeper: What does such loverest on? It rests on an independent mind. And deeper: What is the moral meaningof an independent mind?Similarly, I show that Peter Keating wants prestige, money, and conventionalsuccess, but I also go several onion skins deeper. I ask: Why does a man goafter money and prestige? Why is Peter Keating so anxious for popular approval?I show that a second-hander has no independent judgment and can derive hisself-esteem only from the approval of others. And I go deeper: Why does a mandecide to depend on the judgment of others? Ultimately, because of his refusalto think for himself.I show Roark’s motives and the motives of his enemies; and I show why the twohave to clash. Starting from the first layer of the action—the struggle of anarchitect—I go all the way down to the fundamental, metaphysical issue: theindependent mind versus the second-hand mind.The characterizations in The Fountainhead can be read on as many levels as thereader’s understanding permits. If he is interested only in the immediatemotivation and meaning of actions, he can see that Roark is motivated by art andKeating by money. But if he wants to see more, he can also see the meaning ofthese choices and, deeper, what in human nature is at their root.In Arrowsmith, by contrast, we learn that Arrowsmith is motivated by love forpure science—period. We learn nothing deeper about his motivation. The sameapplies to some of his fellow college students, who are motivated differently,by love for money or the desire for an easy practice. All this is motivation;and within the limits of these motives, the characters are well drawn. Forinstance, the character Angus Duer is the Peter Keating of the story—the smart,unscrupulous young man who is after money and prestige through manipulatingpeople. He is presented clearly and consistently. The author does indicate whatmoves him. But he indicates merely the first onion skin.If you are a perceptive but superficial observer and you look at people in reallife, you can deduce one or two layers of motivation behind their actions. Thisis all that Lewis presents. By a “superficial” observer, I do not mean a stupidone (Lewis is by no means stupid). I mean “nonphilosophical.” I mean someone whodoes not think too abstractly about the nature of man or of human motivation.In Romantic characterization, the reader is given as much human psychology as awriter’s ambition and ability permit. In Naturalistic characterization, bycontrast, great physical detail is given about moving figures without any realpsychology.Observe what Tolstoy does in Anna Karenina. The central conflict is that a womanof stronger life energy leaves her mediocre husband to elope with a youngofficer. We never learn anything about the psychology of the characters. All welearn is that Anna Karenina has a desire for happiness and is impatient with herconventional husband; that her husband has a helpless, grasping desire to holdher; and that the young lover is sort of dashing and is really in love.What is the meaning of a woman’s desire for happiness? Does a husband have theright to hold his wife by sheer convention, and what would that mean? If a youngofficer in nineteenth-century Russia (which was more mid-Victorian than anyother European country) would ruin his career in order to elope with a marriedwoman, what would make him do it?“Sexual passion.” The book gives answers like that.The subtler details of the psychological relationships, such as who says what atwhich moment, are very skillfully presented; Tolstoy’s characterizations arefull of the kind of minute details one would observe if one watched a familytragedy through a transparent wall. But such details merely give one the firstlayer of motivation in the persons involved—which is all that Tolstoy presents.The deeper meaning of the motives is never given.This is why I say that Naturalistic characters have no human psychology. Theyare human beings who have certain motives—and that’s that. The author goes nodeeper than their immediately available motivation, nor do the charactersthemselves ever question their own souls or the deeper meaning behind theirsouls.The reason why a Naturalist approaches characterization this way is his basicphilosophical determinism. If one views man as a determined being, onenecessarily does not go deeply into what makes him move. He is what he is. If heacts in a certain way, one says: “Well, then he has this kind of passion.” Whatmakes a mind center on such a passion? A Naturalist does not ask this question;it is not relevant to his view of man. He takes men ready-made.A Naturalist tells you that men act in a certain way, but not why they do so; or(if he is a serious Naturalist) he gives some indication, but a comparativelysuperficial one. He always stops short of any fundamental “Why?”—of any issuepertaining to all human beings. He never touches the universals of humanbehavior, because to do so would be contrary to the premise that men aredetermined. There is no place in the philosophy of determinism for wide,universal abstractions that govern human behavior and among which men have thepower to choose.The Romantic method, by contrast, goes down to fundamental abstractions. This isnot to say that every Romanticist does so; but every Romanticist goes as deep ashis personal ambition or his subject requires. The essence of the Romanticmethod is to present the universals motivating human action.This is true even of Romantic literature that is not too serious. For instance,take Victor Hugo, who is not a serious student of human nature, but more theRomantic dramatist—and take Notre-Dame de Paris, which is the nearest parallelto Anna Karenina. Being the story of a priest’s love for a Gypsy girl, it alsohas the conflict of guilty passion as a general theme.Even though Hugo does not give a detailed study of the priest’s psychology, hepresents the essentials of the conflict of a man torn between a great religiousdevotion and a guilty bodily passion for a beautiful woman. By means of hisstory, he presents not merely the conflict of this priest with this dancer, butthe whole soul-body issue, including the meaning of such a conflict; and hischaracterizations, while not too perceptive, are built on a level consonant withsuch a purpose.Hugo presents the abstraction behind the particular conflict of the priest in away that Tolstoy would never dream of doing. Being on the free-will premise,Hugo knows that a man’s actions are motivated by his choices, and that hischoices go deeper than the immediate impulse of the moment. It is not anaccident that this man is a priest. Why is he a priest? What basic view of lifehas made him devote his life to religion? And what conflict in that devotion hasmade him capable of betraying his religion? Hugo makes characterization an issueof free will all the way down to the roots of a human personality.Tolstoy, by contrast, spends volumes detailing every movement and emotion andshading of voice of a woman torn between her duty to her husband and her lovefor another man—and we learn nothing about what in a human psychology would puta woman in such a position. We learn only that this woman happened to be caughtin it because “she wanted to live.” Why did she want to live? One does not ask“Why?” Men are what they are.Characters who represent moral or philosophical issues are usually called“archetypes.” I object to that word in this context, because an “archetype” issupposed to be a walking abstraction without individuality. The art (anddifficulty) of Romantic characterization is to present the archetypical—thatwhich is typical of any individualist like Roark or any second-hander likeKeating—while at the same time giving enough specific detail so that thecharacter comes across as this particular human being.People refer to Romantic characterizations as “archetypes” not because theindividuality is lacking, but because the abstraction shows, and shows by theauthor’s intention. The particular details of a personality are given, but theyare never accidental or irrelevant; they are related to the wider abstractionand deeper motivation of the type of man presented.Any reader can tell that The Fountainhead is a book not only about an architectfrom the 1920s to 1940s, but about any innovator in any period or profession.Why? Because I cover the essence of all the issues involved, starting with themost basic issue: the independent mind versus the second-hand mind. Everything Ipresent relating to the conflict of Roark and Keating can be translated(changing only the professional details) into the struggle between any menrepresenting these human attitudes in any profession at any time.I present characters—in The Fountainhead and in everything else I havewritten—by means of that which is essential to men on certain kinds of premises.Contrast this to the characterization of Arrowsmith, which contains a great dealthat is totally accidental. Arrowsmith’s devotion to medicine can, as anabstraction, pertain to other doctors, or to any idealist in any profession. Buthis feelings toward his fraternity, his troubles in deciding what job to take,his hesitations in regard to women—these do not pertain to the issues of“ambitious doctor” or “struggling idealist,” or to anything else of a thematicnature. They are accidental details of the kind that might be present in anypersonality, but that have no wider significance.This is the essence of a Naturalist’s approach to characterization. He presentsa character whose universality—i.e., application to other men—is onlystatistical. For instance, he presents a typical Midwestern young man of acertain period, or a typical ambitious doctor. Then he gives that characteraccidental traits within the range of the statistical assignment. If thesetraits are consistent with the particular statistical type, the result is a goodcontemporary characterization. The reader feels: “Yes, I’ve seen that type ofman.” But what comes across from the jumble of accidental details is merely thecharacter’s immediate motivation, plus his temporal and geographicalaverageness.Arrowsmith is an extremely intelligent presentation of the atmosphere of medicalschools and medical careers of a certain period. When I first read it [in the1920s], it seemed quite interesting, in the sense that an intelligent newspaperarticle about contemporary personalities is interesting. Today, Arrowsmith islike last year’s newspaper.If one were to ask, “How does this story apply to any other profession thanmedicine, or to medicine in any other period than the one presented?” one couldgive only the most generalized answer. One could say: “In essence, everyidealist, every man of integrity, will face a struggle.” That is all. Beyond thegeneral conception of an idealist’s struggle, everything in the book is devotedto the minute details of Arrowsmith’s profession and period.There are two ways in which people can regard characters in fiction andrecognize them. For instance, one often hears that character X is “just like thefolks next door.” This is the slogan of the Naturalistic school: its charactersare “like the folks next door.” The people who consider such characters “real”are usually those who do not consider abstract characters real. They are theones who tell me that I write about men who do not exist.On the other hand, people who can think in terms of essentials tell me that Iwrite about the kind of men they see all over the place. A number of people havetold me the names of architects I never heard of, swearing that I copied PeterKeating from them. You can see why. Since I present the essence of that whichcreates a second-hander like Keating, they can recognize in him many men who donot have his particular appearance, mannerisms, or personal problems, but whohave the same essence.Now compare the following two scenes from Arrowsmith and The Fountainhead. Inboth, the author’s assignment is to present the relationship of the novel’shero—a young student who will later become a brilliant scientist (Arrowsmith) orarchitect (Roark)—to the particular teacher whom he has selected and from whomhe will get the proper training.Read first the scene from Arrowsmith, which portrays Arrowsmith’s initialmeeting with Max Gottlieb, the most brilliant and most unpopular professor athis school. “Vell? Yes?”“Oh, Professor Gottlieb, my name is Arrowsmith. I’m a medic freshman, WinnemacB.A. I’d like awfully to take bacteriology this fall instead of next year. I’vehad a lot of chemistry—”“No. It is not time for you.”“Honest, I know I could do it now.”“There are two kinds of students the gods give me. One kind they dump on me likea bushel of potatoes. I do not like potatoes, and the potatoes they do not everseem to have great affection for me, but I take them and teach them to killpatients. The other kind—they are very few!—they seem for some reason that isnot at all clear to me to wish a liddle bit to become scientists, to work withbugs and make mistakes. Those, ah, those, I seize them, I denounce them, I teachthem right away the ultimate lesson of science, which is to wait and doubt. Ofthe potatoes, I demand nothing; of the foolish ones like you, who think I couldteach them something, I demand everything. No. You are too young. Come back nextyear.”“But honestly, with my chemistry—”“Have you taken physical chemistry?”“No, sir, but I did pretty well in organic.”“Organic chemistry! Puzzle chemistry! Stink chemistry! Drugstore chemistry!Physical chemistry is power, it is exactness, it is life. But organicchemistry—that is a trade for potwashers. No. You are too young. Come back in ayear.” Now read the scene from The Fountainhead, which portrays Roark’s initial meetingwith Henry Cameron. “Well?” said Cameron at last. “Did you come to see me or did you come to look atpictures?”Roark turned to him.“Both,” said Roark.He walked to the desk. People had always lost their sense of existence inRoark’s presence; but Cameron felt suddenly that he had never been as real as inthe awareness of the eyes now looking at him.“What do you want?” snapped Cameron.“I should like to work for you,” said Roark quietly. The voice said:“I should like to work for you.” The tone of the voice said: “I’m going to workfor you.”“Are you?” said Cameron, not realizing that he answered the un-pronouncedsentence. “What’s the matter? None of the bigger and better fellows will haveyou?”“I have not applied to anyone else.”“Why not? Do you think this is the easiest place to begin? Think anybody canwalk in here without trouble? Do you know who I am?”“Yes. That’s why I’m here.”“Who sent you?”“No one.”“Why the hell should you pick me?”“I think you know that.” Roark then shows his drawings to Cameron. Now read the conclusion of the scene: “God damn you,” said Cameron softly.“God damn you!” roared Cameron suddenly, leaning forward. “I didn’t ask you tocome here! I don’t need any draftsmen! There’s nothing here to draft! I don’thave enough work to keep myself and my men out of the Bowery Mission! I don’twant any fool visionaries starving around here! I don’t want the responsibility.I didn’t ask for it. I never thought I’d see it again. I’m through with it. Iwas through with that many years ago. I’m perfectly happy with the droolingdolts I’ve got here, who never had anything and never will have and it makes nodifference what becomes of them. That’s all I want. Why did you have to comehere? You’re setting out to ruin yourself, you know that, don’t you? And I’llhelp you to do it. I don’t want to see you. I don’t like you. I don’t like yourface. You look like an insufferable egotist. You’re impertinent. You’re too sureof yourself. Twenty years ago I’d have punched your face with the greatest ofpleasure. You’re coming to work here tomorrow at nine o’clock sharp.”“Yes,” said Roark, rising.“Fifteen dollars a week. That’s all I can pay you.”“Yes.”“You’re a damn fool. You should have gone to someone else. I’ll kill you if yougo to anyone else. What’s your name?”“Howard Roark.”“If you’re late, I’ll fire you.”“Yes.”Roark extended his hand for the drawings.“Leave these here!” bellowed Cameron. “Now get out!”In this scene, Cameron is speaking about a concrete—his own and Roark’sparticular position in the world—but at the same time he is stating andemphasizing a wider issue—their stand against society as individualists andnonconformists. Cameron is saying: “We’re outcasts, we’ll have a terriblebattle, I don’t want you to suffer as I did—but you have no choice, because Iwon’t let you sell yourself by going to anyone else.” This is the essence of thebond between the two men and the key to their fate in the book.Compare this to the scene from Arrowsmith. Gottlieb too is a nonconformist and alonely, idealistic fighter, although this is indicated more in the precedingnarrative than in the scene itself. What is projected in the scene is Gottlieb’scontempt for the average students (“the potatoes”) and his eagerness to findserious disciples (those who wish “to become scientists”). In other words, hefeels strongly about his science and is bitterly opposed to the conventionalstandards. However, since he is talking in concretes which illustrate merelythat one level of abstraction, his speech has a nonphilosophical aura. He likesone type of student and is bitter about the other—period.Cameron says openly that he and Roark are victims of society and fighters fortheir art; Gottlieb says nothing that indicates his wider position as a fighterfor science. Instead, he focuses on the minutiae of his particular profession,such as the requirements for his course or the issue of organic versus physicalchemistry. From a Naturalistic standpoint, these technical details are whatmakes the scene “real”; from a Romantic standpoint, they clutter it up. Observethat I do not have Cameron say: “I’ll teach you to design corner windows ratherthan Greek pediments.” But the Naturalist’s approach is precisely the inclusionof such details. “To be real,” he would say, “you’ve got to give theparticulars.”If the scene from Arrowsmith had been longer and fuller, and if it had shown theessence of the two men’s encounter, it could, even by the Romantic standard,have absorbed some of the technical details. The number of concrete detailsproper to include in a scene depends on its scale. But as the scene stands, onecan only infer the essence, since what is shown directly is merely the technicaldialogue. This is why I say that the scene is cluttered with details.Whether a writer draws a character in essentials or in minute detail isdetermined by the depth of motivation he covers.A Romantic characterization must not include too many particulars ; it caninclude only that which is essential to each layer of the onion skins—of thecharacter’s motives.For instance, the characterization of Cameron in The Fountainhead is verygeneralized. The reader is not told much about his life, his office, or hisclothes. But what do I show about him? Not merely that he is a great man who ismisunderstood by society and then drinks himself to death—but also the reasonsbehind it. Cameron is an independent man who has been broken by [an inimical]society; he is a man who could have been like Roark, but his premises andconfidence were not strong enough. I bring everything I say about him down tothe basic issue: a man’s mind against the minds of others.All I present is the essentials. Therefore, while Cameron is Cameron, he alsostands for any great man who, after a devoted struggle, is broken by society.Gottlieb is presented much more intimately by Lewis. For instance, he makes aspecial kind of delicate European sandwich for Arrowsmith, he uses expressionslike “Father Nietzsche” and “Father Schopenhauer,” and he refers to his days asa student in Heidelberg. This is good characterization; one does get the pictureof the man, and in great detail—almost as if one had seen his photograph. Butwhat does one learn about his motivation? Only one thing: that he is devoted toscience and has contempt for worldly goods and human relationships.Sinclair Lewis will beat me hollow on the perception of the particular. But theparticular is all that the reader gets from him, with merely one or twounderlying levels of motivation.Incidentally, there are instances of crossbreeding in literature, Shakespearebeing the best example. He presents his characters by means of their essence—theessence of a dominating father (King Lear), of a doubting intellectual (Hamlet),or of a jealous man (Othello). Yet Shakespeare is a determinist, and a[precursor] of the Naturalistic school; he believes that man is a plaything offate, carrying within himself some tragic flaw that ultimately destroys him. Forinstance, Othello is jealous, but it is never explained why; he is simplypossessed by jealousy as other men are possessed by greed or love. It’s in hisnature, and he is helpless against it. Shakespeare presents human essences onthe basis of the kind of determinist philosophy that most of mankind shares,which is one reason for his immortality. He is the grandest literaryrepresentative of that philosophy.The critics who complain that Romantic characters are oversimpli fied“archetypes”—“just heroes and villains”—would say about the Roark-Cameron scenethat it portrays merely “gruff old professor” and “idealistic student.” But itis actually the Arrowsmith-Gottlieb scene that portrays such stock characters.Roark and Cameron are abstractions of profound issues—and the concretes whichare shown indicate those issues. By contrast, Lewis presents many more details,but they do not add up to any consistent depth. The result is precisely a woodenarchetype like “gruff old professor”—because nobody can retain all the tiny,insignificant details. They vanish from the reader’s mind, and the abstractionthat remains represents merely the first onion skin of motivation. Thecharacters are overdetailed and never fully real.Now observe that nobody would normally speak the way Cameron does, nor would aprofessor in Gottlieb’s position normally speak as he does merely because he sawsomething promising in a student. What, then, would make an admirer ofNaturalism consider Gottlieb realistic, as opposed to Cameron? The touch of theludicrous.When Gottlieb says, “I do not like potatoes, and the potatoes they do not everseem to have great affection for me, but I take them and teach them to killpatients,” his idea is simply: “They send me too many mediocrities. I don’t likemediocrities.” But his use of a homey, undignified metaphor—“potatoes”—gives hima touch of the ludicrous, the vulgar, the nonheroic. He is made “human”; he isgiven verbal feet of clay. That is what would make a reader on the Naturalistpremise say: “Yes, he’s real. People do talk that way.”In fact, they do not talk that way. Further, Gottlieb is not supposed to be anaverage man; he is supposed to be a man of genius. But to a Naturalist, a mancannot be an exception; he has to be a statistical average. Just as, accordingto the saying, no man can be a hero to his valet, so, according to Naturalism,no character can be a hero to his author. In Naturalistic literature, therefore,if a man is presented as great, he will always have a tragic flaw, a humaninfirmity, feet of clay. There will always be an undercutting touch—and noundercutting is more deadly, artistically, than humor. Nothing is bettercalculated to make a great man appear ludicrous than a touch of humor at thewrong time.On the other side, what a Naturalist would object to in Cameron’s speech is notanything Cameron specifically says, but the fact that his speech is direct,undiluted, purposeful. It is not a method of Naturalism to focus anythingsharply.Let us now ask: Is Arrowsmith a realistic character and Roark an unrealisticone?Both of the above scenes present a young man with a serious purpose, startingout on a serious career, and I would say that Arrowsmith is ten times moreunrealistic and unnatural than Roark. He says: “I’d like awfully to takebacteriology this fall instead of next year,” and “Honest, I know I could do itnow.” I submit that no serious, dedicated young man ever talks that way.An intelligent young man with a purpose is, in his late teens and earlytwenties, particularly solemn and formal. He might be shy and unable to expresshimself fully, but then, the shyer and more uncertain he is, the more formal hewill be. If such a young man approaches someone he admires in his profession, hedoes not come across like a college football player, saying: “Oh, gee, honest.”Had Lewis genuinely been watching reality, he would have presented Arrowsmith inany way but this.Arrowsmith’s stammering embarrassment and nonserious enthusiasm reflects theatmosphere of collegiate dialogue of his period. It represents Lewis’sstatistical abstraction of an average college kid; it does not representanyone’s realistic picture of a serious young man approaching a professor hereveres.Now consider Roark. He comes to the man he worships and calmly says, “I shouldlike to work for you,” implying: “I’m going to work for you.” No young man, aNaturalist would object, could be that poised and self-assured. My answer is:That depends on what kind of young man one is talking about and what premises hehas set himself.When I say that no serious young man would act like Arrowsmith, am I going bythe statistical method? No; I am going by logic. It is in the nature of aserious young mind not to be casual about its concerns.But if I were to follow the Naturalistic method of studying real people, I wouldsubmit as an example Leonard Peikoff, whom I met when he was seventeen and whowas very much afraid of meeting me—afraid in the sense of “awed.” He had a longlist of philosophical questions he wanted me to answer, but when he came to myhouse, he asked his companions if they would please go in and let him stay inthe car. (I learned this only years later.) When he did come in, he wasobviously ill at ease, in the sense not of foolishness, but of tension. So Iasked him: “How did you like the drive?”—trying to do a little small talk tohelp him relax. And it was he, at seventeen, who said: “Well, let’s get down tobusiness.”That is what I would present if I were a Naturalist—only then it would beRomanticism. Like everything else in writing, a characterization cannot be created byconscious calculation.Take the Roark-Keating scene. Suppose you made a list of Roark’svirtues—independent, rational, just, honest—and decided to consult that listeach time you came to a line of dialogue. You would not be able to make Roarkutter a single line. Nothing would occur to you; and even if something did, youwould have to spend a month figuring out: “If Roark says, ‘Why not?’ does thatconform to the list? Or if he says, ‘Oh well, I didn’t mind it,’ does thatconform?”In other words, you cannot figure out consciously the kind of implications Iexplained when I compared the two Roark-Keating scenes—and I mentioned only thecrucial points of difference between the scenes. I could spend two full lecturesexplaining the implications of and motivations behind the lines in those twoscenes alone. It is as complex as that.You cannot create a character from philosophical abstractions alone; you cannotapproach characterization merely by telling yourself: “My hero will beindependent, just, rational.” The process is indirect—you must know how to useyour subconscious. You must know how consciously to prepare it so that it willmake the right selections for you.Your characterizations will never be better than your power of observation. Ahuman mind does not first conceive of floating abstractions and then, by meansof them, recognize the concretes; in order properly to grasp an abstraction, youmust derive it from concretes. To prepare your subconscious for writing propercharacterization, therefore, you must be a good observer and introspector.You constantly react to people—you approve or disapprove, like or dislike, areencouraged or uneasy. You estimate emotionally everyone you meet. Learn tointrospect in the sense of accounting for what in a person causes your reaction.Do not go through life saying: “I don’t like X. Why? How do I know? I just don’tlike him.” That will never make you a writer. Instead, if you feel a strongdislike for someone, then, as your artistic assignment, identify what youdislike, and by what means you observed it.For instance, a man is rude to you, and you do not like it. What in particularis rude? Is it the implication of what the man says? Is it his voice or manner?Why do you dislike it? File this in your subconscious. Another time, you meet aman who is charming. Do not merely say: “I don’t know why, but I like this man.He’s wonderful.” Identify: What is charming about him? How does he convey it?How did you observe it? File this away. By being a constant, conscious valuer ofpeople, you gather the material from which you will draw your futurecharacterizations.If you have learned a great many abstractions that you have not yet connected toconcretes, do the reverse. For instance, if you decide that you favorindependence, observe which words or gestures or manners of people conveyindependence to you. And, conversely, observe what conveys dependence. Whatconveys honesty? What conveys dishonesty? You can observe these characteristicsonly by their outward manifestations—by the words, actions, gestures, andsubtler mannerisms of people.When your subconscious is stocked with such well-filed material—when yourconcretes are filed under the proper abstractions and your abstractions areamply illustrated by concretes—then you can approach an assignment such as“present a characterization of Roark.” And then, if you tell yourself that he isindependent, honest, and just, your subconscious will throw at you the kind ofconcretes that make you feel, while writing a scene: “Yes, Roark would say this,but he would not say that.”The best, most natural dialogue is usually written as if the writer is listeningto dictation. You might get stuck on any particular point and have to questionyourself; but normally, dialogue writes itself. You have an idea of the scene,and when you write, the dialogue “just comes” to you—exactly as, in aconversation, your own answers come to you. That is, you speak from yourpremises, knowledge, and estimate of the situation.In writing dialogue, you must react on two or more premises. As Roark, you speakfrom a certain premise; as Keating, you say something else. Your mind must knowthe connection between certain abstractions and their concrete expressions sowell that you can write for three or five or any number of people, constantlyswitching premises in your mind. You cannot do this by conscious intention. Youmust reach the stage where the process feels “instinctive”—where, the momentwhen you speak for Roark, you have a sense of what he would say, and whenKeating has to answer, you have a sense of what he would say.This sudden “feel” of a character is not a mystical talent. In the process ofwriting, you feel that you “just know” what Roark or Keating would say; but thisfeeling means only that your understanding of the premises involved has becomeautomatic.When I wrote the Roark-Keating scene, I did not think consciously of thoseimplications of each line that I explained earlier. But when I write a lineinspirationally, I can tell myself why it is in character, and why another linewould be out of character. To judge the objective validity of what you write,you must be able afterward to tell yourself why a given line is right for onecharacter (what it conveys) and why something else is right for anothercharacter (what it conveys). After the writing, you must be able to do the kindof analysis I did of the Roark-Keating scene.At first you should do this kind of analysis every time you write something, inorder to train yourself in the process. Later, all your rational justificationswill be in order and available to your conscious mind, but you will not have tocheck on them each time. You will know by a lightning-like sum what kind oftouch is right, and why it is right.Also, when you begin writing, write only as much as you are sure of. Do notforce your characters into artificial behavior; do not say arbitrarily: “I don’tknow what he’d say, so I’ll put in the first line available.” If you do not knowwhat a character would do or say, you simply have to give it some more thought. When I create a character, I find it helpful to project him visually. This givesme a concrete focus so that the character does not float in my mind as a merecollection of abstract virtues or vices. Seeing his appearance is like having aphysical body on which I can hang the abstractions.That is how Roark was created. I did not base him on any particular human being;but the start of the character in my mind was the image of a redheaded man withlong legs and gaunt cheekbones. I formed as clear an image of his figure as Icould, and this became the focus for all the abstract characteristics I had togive him. I have done the same for all of my heroes.In regard to villains and characters who are neither particularly good nor bad,I find it helpful to focus on some acquaintance or public figure—not on thedetails of this person, but only on the essence. In the case of Toohey, I had inmind four living journalists and writers. I did not think of any one of them inspecific detail, nor did I study their writings or lives. But my totalimpression of them gave me valuable clues to the manifestations of certain basicpremises. These figures were the concretes that helped me to hold it all in mymind. This was the preliminary gathering of material.Then, one day, some acquaintances invited me to a lecture by a liberal at theNew School for Social Research. I felt that it would be immoral to go; but theyinsisted that the lecturer was not leftist, that he was a brilliant speaker, andthat they had already bought the tickets, so I went. And there was Toohey in theflesh, in personal appearance and manner. [The speaker was the British LabourParty politician Harold Laski.]When he spoke, that man projected infinitely more than the specific content ofhis ideas. It is true that he was not particularly liberal—that is, he was themost vicious liberal I have ever heard in public, but not blatantly so. He wasvery subtle and gracious, he rambled on a great deal about nothing inparticular—and then he made crucial, vicious points once in a while. My foolishacquaintances did not know what was going on, but I did, and I thought: “Thereis my character.”I did not read anything about him; I did not care to know much. But what Igained from his appearance and way of speaking was the lightning-like sum of thekind of personality that certain premises would produce. Anytime I would askmyself, for instance, how Toohey would act toward his niece, or what hisattitude would be toward young love, I had only to remember the image of thatman on the speaker’s pulpit and I would know unerringly what his type would do.I was using an abstraction, not a concrete. I was not copying a real-life model;from a political lecture, I had no way of knowing what the speaker’s attitudewould be toward a niece or young love. He served merely to concretize and anchorcertain abstractions in my mind.Years later, I learned that the speaker’s career was in fact somewhat likeToohey’s: he was always the man behind the scenes, much more influential thananybody knew publicly, pulling the strings behind the governments of severalcountries. Finally he was proved to be a communist, which he did not announcehimself as or blatantly sound like. This demonstrates my “writer’s instinct.” Iobserved the total impression of the man, I derived my own concretes, and inmany instances they were similar to the facts—proving not that I wasclairvoyant, but that I had grasped the right abstractions and translated themcorrectly.This is the method I recommend (but if it seems too cumbersome, do not treat itas a duty). You do not literally copy a person; you use him as a concretizationof something too complex to hold in your mind as a mere philosophical orliterary description.The result is that you have a sense of what your character would do or saywithout having to figure it all out in advance. You have caught the basic tone,the key, of a personality."},{"pageContent":"8Style I: Depictions of LoveWhen I was writing Atlas Shrugged, I spent a long time planning the scene whereFrancisco comes to Dagny in the country. Many issues had to be integrated inthis very complex scene, and I was exhausted after days of walking and thinkingon the road in front of my house in California. One day I told [my husband]Frank that I was tired of planning the scene. He knew about its content, and,not too seriously, he told me: “Oh, that’s simple. All you have to say is: ‘Herushes up the hill, he seizes her in his arms, he kisses her—and she likes it.’”Everything between that sentence and what you read in Atlas Shrugged comes underthe department of style.The swiftness of Francisco’s movements was carrying him toward the hill while hewas raising his head to glance up. He saw her above, at the door of the cabin,and stopped. She could not distinguish the expression on his face. He stoodstill for a long moment, his face raised to her. Then he started up the hill.She felt—almost as if she had expected it—that this was a scene from theirchildhood. He was coming toward her, not running, but moving upward with a kindof triumphant, confident eagerness. No, she thought, this was not theirchildhood—it was the future as she would have seen it then, in the days when shewaited for him as for her release from prison. It was a moment’s view of amorning they would have reached, if her vision of life had been fulfilled, ifthey had both gone the way she had then been so certain of going. Heldmotionless by wonder, she stood looking at him, taking this moment, not in thename of the present, but as a salute to their past.When he was close enough and she could distinguish his face, she saw the look ofthat luminous gaiety which transcends the solemn by proclaiming the greatinnocence of a man who has earned the right to be light-hearted. He was smilingand whistling some piece of music that seemed to flow like the long, smooth,rising flight of his steps. The melody seemed distantly familiar to her, shefelt that it belonged with this moment, yet she felt also that there wassomething odd about it, something important to grasp, only she could not thinkof it now.“Hi, Slug!”“Hi, Frisco!”She knew—by the way he looked at her, by an instant’s drop of his eyelidsclosing his eyes, by the brief pull of his head striving to lean back andresist, by the faint, half-smiling, half-helpless relaxation of his lips, thenby the sudden harshness of his arms as he seized her—that it was involuntary,that he had not intended it, and that it was irresistibly right for both ofthem.The desperate violence of the way he held her, the hurting pressure of his mouthon hers, the exultant surrender of his body to the touch of hers, were not theform of a moment’s pleasure—she knew that no physical hunger could bring a manto this—she knew that it was the statement she had never heard from him, thegreatest confession of love a man could make. No matter what he had done towreck his life, this was still the Francisco d’Anconia in whose bed she had beenso proud of belonging—no matter what betrayals she had met from the world, hervision of life had been true and some indestructible part of it had remainedwithin him—and in answer to it, her body responded to his, her arms and mouthheld him, confessing her desire, confessing an acknowledgment she had alwaysgiven him and always would.In effect, what takes place in the scene is exactly what Frank said. Thedifference between his sentence and the final execution depends on the style.That which can be synopsized in a brief sentence—theme, plot,characterization—is the “what” of a novel or play. Style is the “how”—it is thatwhich cannot be synopsized.You have probably heard that some story “isn’t much, but it’s the way it’sdone.” This remark is warranted when the plot or message is slight, but thestyle good.I divide the issue of style into two broad categories: the selection of contentand the selection of words.The “selection of content” is those aspects of an assignment that a writerchooses to communicate. For instance, in describing a room, one writer mightgive a minute catalogue of its every object. Another writer might select theessentials, that which gives the room its character. A third writer might saysomething neither exhaustive nor essential, but inconclusive, such as: “It was anarrow room with pale walls and some chairs.”In the Dagny-Francisco scene, what I really had to present was Frank’s synopsissentence. But what kind of elements would I include in order to describe howFrancisco rushes up the hill, or how he seizes Dagny in his arms, or what shefeels? Would I describe the scenery? include dialogue? narrate their thoughts?That is selection of content.The “selection of words” is what is commonly understood by “style”: a writer’schoice of words and method of constructing sentences. Here you will see, as westudy examples, the most startling variations. As with fingerprints, there areas many possible styles as there are men. No matter what the number of peoplewho share the same philosophy, no one need ever be imitative of another’s style.In the selection and order of words, so many possibilities exist that you neverhave to worry about whether you will achieve an individual style. You willachieve it; but only if you do not aim at it consciously.Style is the most complex of the elements of writing, and must be left to“instinct.” I have explained why even plot and characterization cannot becreated fully by conscious calculation, but depend on subconscious, automatizedpremises. This is even more true of style.In style, form follows function. In other words, what determines your style isyour purpose—both in the book as a whole and in each paragraph or sentence. Butgiven the number of issues involved in even the simplest story, there is no wayto calculate the function and form consciously. Therefore, you have to set yourliterary premises and then write without self-consciousness. Write as it comesto you, on such premises as you have.Do not decide to have a “brusque” style, a “dramatic” style, a “sensitive”style, or whatever nonsense you might have heard in literary schools. No suchlines can be drawn. Above all, never imitate anyone else’s style. Some writingschools ask students to write a story in the style of Sinclair Lewis, andanother one in the style of Thomas Mann, and another one in thestream-of-consciousness style. Nothing could be deadlier: this is a sure waynever to acquire a style of your own. A style comes from the combination of allof a writer’s purposes and premises (and not only his literary ones). You cannotborrow another man’s soul, and you cannot borrow his style. You would only be acheap imitator.Write as purposefully and clearly as you can, on your own premises, and yourstyle will develop with practice. If you have set yourself some literarypremises, the elements of your future style will be apparent in your firstattempts. But it is impossible for anyone to have a recognizable style of hisown prior to practicing. Given the complexity involved, a style has to becomeautomatic before it can be thoroughly individual and polished.If, after some years of work, you feel that your way of expression is not right,you have to do more thinking about what you do and do not like in literature.Identify what your style is missing, what category the error belongs to; thenidentify the right premise, which will enable you to express things more exactlyor colorfully.But never try to force a style. When someone is writing in a phony manner, it isas apparent as a neon sign. It is much better, even if your writing is slightlyawkward, to be natural. I have selected some passages which I consider stylistically typical. They fallinto three groups: the first six quotations deal with the subject of love, thenext two are descriptions of nature, and the last four are descriptions of NewYork City. By seeing different writers treat the same subjects, you will be ableto better identify their stylistic differences.Look for what is accomplished in each quotation, and for the means by which itis accomplished. Identify first the “what”—the author’s assignment; and then the“how”—the selection of content and of words.In the first six quotations, as I said, the author’s assignment is to presentlove, particularly the intensity of love.FROM ATLAS SHRUGGED BY AYN RAND[The woman in these two different passages is Dagny Taggart, the man is JohnGalt. The “temple” is a powerhouse containing a motor which runs on atmosphericelectricity and which has been invented by Galt.]She was suddenly aware that they were alone; it was an awareness that stressedthe fact, permitting no further implication, yet holding the full meaning of theunnamed in that special stress. They were alone in a silent forest, at the footof a structure that looked like an ancient temple—and she knew what rite was theproper form of worship to be offered on an altar of that kind. She felt a suddenpressure at the base of her throat, her head leaned back a little, no more thanto feel the faint shift of a current against her hair, but it was as if she werelying back in space, against the wind, conscious of nothing but his legs and theshape of his mouth. He stood watching her, his face still but for the faintmovement of his eyelids drawing narrow as if against too strong a light. It waslike the beat of three instants—this was the first—and in the next, she felt astab of ferocious triumph at the knowledge that his effort and his struggle wereharder to endure than hers—and then he moved his eyes and raised his head tolook at the inscription on the temple....She collapsed, face down, on the bed. It was not the mere fact of physicalexhaustion. It was the sudden monomania of a sensation too complete to endure.While the strength of her body was gone, while her mind had lost the faculty ofconsciousness, a single emotion drew on her remnants of energy, ofunderstanding, of judgment, of control, leaving her nothing to resist it with orto direct it, making her unable to desire, only to feel, reducing her to a meresensation—a static sensation without start or goal. She kept seeing his figurein her mind—his figure as he had stood at the door of the structure—she feltnothing else, no wish, no hope, no estimate of her feeling, no name for it, norelation to herself—there was no entity such as herself, she was not a person,only a function, the function of seeing him, and the sight was its own meaningand purpose, with no further end to reach.My method here is to lead the reader to a certain abstraction—that this is astrong, violent love—by giving him a special kind of concretes. I select thosetouches of Dagny’s experience that are essential to the nature of her feeling.How does the reader know that her feeling is not, say, a light infatuation? Theconcretes given do not pertain to infatuation.To project the full reality of the scene, I present not merely what Dagny feels,but also that which she is responding to. Her emotion is not an introspectiveone; she feels it because she is looking at Galt in a certain place in a certaincontext. So I present, by means of essentials, a setting that creates a moodconsonant with her emotion.Possibly, a bird flew across the trees in this moment, or a butterfly flutteredsomewhere. Dagny might even have been aware of these, on the edge of herconsciousness. But to include them would have been disastrous. That would havebeen to follow the Naturalistic method of including accidental details; whereasI focus only on the essentials of Dagny’s feeling and of the setting.I always reproduce human awareness as it is experienced in reality, assuming acertain kind of character. (For instance, Dagny is not a woman who would beunaware of the exact nature of what she experiences. I showed that kind ofpsychology in the passages dealing with James Taggart.) In this moment, whenDagny is fully aware for the first time of her feeling for Galt, she would notthink, “I’m madly in love,” or “Love is an important value.” One does not thinklike that. I project and reproduce that which would be the focus of Dagny’sawareness.The beginning of the first passage suggests Dagny’s sudden physical awareness ofGalt. “She was suddenly aware that they were alone; it was an awareness thatstressed the fact, permitting no further implication, yet holding the fullmeaning of the unnamed in that special stress. They were alone in a silentforest, at the foot of a structure that looked like an ancient temple—and sheknew what rite was the proper form of worship to be offered on an altar of thatkind.” I suggest sex; it is a deliberate hint, without using the word. Thispassage follows a description of Galt’s temple, which contains his invention;and I have planted earlier that Dagny regards sex as the expression ofachievement and of one’s highest values. The statement “she knew what rite wasthe proper form of worship to be offered on an altar of that kind” reminds thereader that the sight of a great achievement would lead Dagny to think of sex;my use of words like temple, rite, and altar, which connote religion or highvalues, reminds him that she considers sex a sacred value. The reader connectsit all lightning-like in his mind: “Yes, she would feel that way, because of herattitude toward love and achievement.”The statement “she knew what rite was the proper form of worship to be offeredon an altar of that kind” is literarily much stronger than, say, “she felt thatshe wanted to sleep with him.” It is stronger because I make the reader draw theconclusion.The next sentence brings the passage from the abstract down to the immediatemoment, giving the sensory reality of Dagny’s experience. Observe the slant:“She felt a sudden pressure at the base of her throat”—obviously a sexualemotion—“her head leaned back a little, no more than to feel the faint shift ofa current against her hair”—a purely sensuous description—“but it was as if shewere lying back in space, against the wind”—a deliberate stress on sexualconnotations—“conscious of nothing but his legs and the shape of his mouth.” HadI said “conscious of nothing but him,” it would have been too generalized (andnot worth a cent). What is she conscious of? His legs and his mouth. Theseconcretes emphasize her consciousness of one particular aspect of him, and thusone purpose. (In a more intellectual context, she would perhaps have been moreconscious of his eyes.)In the next sentence, I do the same in regard to him. “He stood watching her,his face still but for the faint movement of his eyelids drawing narrow”—first aphysical description—“as if against too strong a light.” Since no strong lightis involved in the scene, the implication is: “against too strong a feeling.”That is all I want to suggest; the context does the rest.A difficult problem in emotional scenes is how to project that which, thoughmade of different elements, would be experienced as one impact. In the nextsentence, my technique is almost self-explanatory : “It was like the beat ofthree instants—this was the first—and in the next, she felt a stab of ferocioustriumph at the knowledge that his effort and his struggle were harder to endurethan hers—and then he moved his eyes and raised his head to look at theinscription on the temple.” Here I want the reader to think that he experiencedthe whole sentence as one. But he cannot experience it as one; I have to givethe steps. So I start by unifying the steps into one whole—“It was like the beatof three instants”—and then I break it down into the three instants, which addup to the kind of progression that in real life would be experienced as oneemotional impact.In the second passage, I had one of the most difficult assignments: to present aviolent emotion. The more violent an emotion, the less one is able to identifywhat it is made of. One just feels it, as a unity. “I feel something violent,and there are no words for it, and it can’t be broken down into anything.” I hadto break the emotion down into the kind of concretes that Dagny would not reallybe thinking of, but that the reader would sum up into monomania.I do it partly by means of negatives; I say what it is that Dagny does not have.“A single emotion drew on her remnants of energy, of understanding, of judgment,of control”—by concretizing the elements which are normally present in aconsciousness, but which Dagny is now losing, I convey that hers is a violentemotion—“leaving her nothing to resist it with or to direct it.” I remind thereader that Dagny normally would not be at the mercy of a single emotion; butnow she is.Then I project that what she feels is love: “She kept seeing his figure in hermind—his figure as he had stood at the door of the structure—she felt nothingelse, no wish, no hope, no estimate of her feeling, no name for it, no relationto herself—there was no entity such as herself, she was not a person, only afunction, the function of seeing him. ” To have said that she wanted to sleepwith him, or that she realized she loved him, would have been weaker than sayingthat she is reduced to nothing but seeing his figure in her mind. Suchconclusions as “I am in love with him” or “I want to marry him” areabstractions. They are thoughts, and would come later. The actual emotion wouldbe experienced precisely as an extreme awareness of the other person, which isthe essence of falling in love.The conclusion conveys just that: “and the sight was its own meaning andpurpose, with no further end to reach. ” This is the extreme state of being inlove, where the issue is not sex, or any purpose, but (to put it colloquially)only the awareness that the loved one exists—which then fills the whole world.I make human epistemology my guide—in the selection of content and of words. Ipresent the material as a human mind would perceive it in reality. Allperception is selective. We are not cameras; in any given situation, no one seeseverything. We see that which interests us, that which our values require us tofocus on. When I write, I substitute my selectivity for the reader’s; I presentthose highlights I want him to observe and leave him no room to focus onanything else. His awareness will then follow as if the material were actualreality. But he will be observing reality as I observe it—i.e., from myviewpoint, according to my value choice. (He can then decide what he thinks ofthese values, which is a different, private matter.)My writing is both highly slanted and objective. It is slanted in that I selectthe focus; it is objective in that I do not tell the reader what to see or feel.I show it.If I have an unimportant connecting sentence such as “They walked toward thecar,” that is telling, not showing—but then, by virtue of the matter’sunimportance, there is nothing to show. Given the selectivity of humanperception, this is how you do in fact experience a transition. If, in themiddle of an important conversation, you are walking toward a car, you areaware, barely, of your direction; but that is not where your focus is. I use thesame method to choose my content and my words.I do not present the reader with anything but direct sensory evidence. Theauthor, in my style, never speaks—yet the author is consciously pulling everystring. I give the reader nothing but concrete, objective facts—slanted in sucha way that he will have only the impression I intend him to have.FROM NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS BY VICTOR HUGO [TRANSLATED BY AYN RAND]From that day on, there was in me a man whom I did not know. I tried to use allmy remedies, the cloister, the altar, the work, the books. Folly! Oh! sciencerings so hollow when one beats against it in despair a head full of passion! Doyou know, young girl, what I always saw thenceforth between the book and me?You, your shadow, the image of the luminous apparition that had once movedacross the space before me. But that image did not have the same color anylonger; it was somber, ominous, dark like the black circle that pursues for along time the sight of the reckless one who has looked fixedly at the sun.Unable to get rid of it, always hearing your song humming in my head, alwaysseeing your feet dancing on my prayer book, always feeling at night, in dreams,your shape slipping against my flesh, I wanted to see you again, to touch you,to know who you were, to see whether I would find you comparable to the idealimage I had kept of you, to shatter my dream perhaps by means of reality. In anycase, I hoped that a new impression would efface the first, and the first hadbecome unbearable to me. I sought you. I saw you again. Disasier! When I hadseen you twice, I wished to see you a thousand times, I wished to see youalways. Then—how can one stop on that steep descent into hell?—then I did notbelong to myself any longer. The other end of the string that the devil hadattached to my wings, he had tied it to your foot. I became a vagrant like you.I waited for you in doorways, I looked for you on street comers, I watched youfrom the top of my tower. Each evening, I returned to myself more charmed, moredesperate, more bewitched, more lost! ...Oh, young girl, have pity on me! You believe that you are unhappy, alas! alas!you do not know what unhappiness is. Oh! to love a woman! to be a priest! to behated! to love her with all the fury of one’s soul, to feel that for the leastof her smiles one would give one’s blood, one’s guts, one’s character, one’ssalvation, immortality and eternity, this life and the next; to regret that oneis not king, genius, emperor, archangel, God, that one might place a greaterslave under her feet; to embrace her night and day with one’s dreams and withone’s thoughts; and to see her enamored of a soldier’s uniform! and to havenothing to offer her but the squalid cassock of a priest that will arouse herfear and her disgust! ... Do you know what it’s like, that agony you are made toendure, through the long nights, by your arteries that boil, by your heart thatbursts, by your head that splits, by your teeth that bite your hands; by theserelentless tortures that keep turning you without respite, as upon a red-hotgrid-iron, upon a thought of love, of jealousy and of despair! Young girl,mercy! relax for a moment! toss a few ashes on that flame! ... Child! torture mewith one hand, but caress me with the other! Have pity, young girl! have pity onme!Hugo’s assignment here is to convey the priest’s intense passion and conflict.He conveys it by means of concretes—the priest does not merely say, “I sufferedand I thought of you,” he gives concretes—and the concretes are not irrelevantdetails; they underscore the essence of the priest’s feelings. So Hugo and Ihave this in common: we deal in concretes and in essences.For instance: “I tried to use all my remedies, the cloister, the altar, thework, the books.” The priest does not say, “I tried to fight it,” which wouldhave been a generalization; he states the particular remedies he tried.“Do you know, young girl, what I always saw thenceforth between the book and me?You, your shadow.” This is a typically Romantic touch. Had he said, “I keptseeing your picture in my mind,” that would not have been as strong as “betweenthe book and me.” One can almost see the girl dancing across a prayer book; theimage is extremely colorful, and convincing, because it is specific. It givesone a sense of how he experienced his emotion—of how his concentration wasbroken by her image—which one would not get from a generality like “I constantlythought of you and nothing helped.”“Unable to get rid of it, always hearing your song humming in my head, alwaysseeing your feet dancing on my prayer book”—again, concretizations which conveyexactly what he experienced—“always feeling at night, in dreams, your shapeslipping against my flesh.” In one English-language edition, the translator says“seeing you in my dreams,” which is a bromidic generalization and exactly thekind of sentence that Hugo would not write.Observe the dramatic simplicity and concretization with which the priest giveshis reasons for wanting to see the girl again: “I wanted to see you again, totouch you, to know who you were, to see whether I would find you comparable tothe ideal image I had kept of you, to shatter my dream perhaps by means ofreality.... I sought you. I saw you again.” Then he describes the consequences,and again he makes them concrete. He does not say: “From then on, I washelplessly committed to my passion.” He says: “I waited for you in doorways, Ilooked for you on street comers, I watched you from the top of my tower.”Preceding this scene, a great deal has been established about the cathedral ofNotre-Dame and its towers. The line “I watched you from the top of my tower” isthus an excellent concretization that evokes the whole context in the reader’smind: he can see the priest standing on the tower and the girl dancing in thesquare below.“Oh! to love a woman! to be a priest! to be hated!” Strong concretes, naming theessence of the conflict. “To feel that for the least of her smiles one wouldgive one’s blood, one’s guts, one’s character, one’s salvation, immortality andeternity, this life and the next.” Had he said, “I would give anything for yourfavor,” it would have been a floating abstraction. “And to see her enamored of asoldier’s uniform!”—not “of a stupid soldier,” which would have been a weakerstatement of the same idea—“and to have nothing to offer her but the squalidcassock of a priest. ” By contrasting the garments, he projects the wholedifference between the two lives: his own austere life versus the glamorous (inthe girl’s eyes) life of the soldier. This skillful use of two small concretesconveys the essence of the whole situation. “Do you know what it’s like, thatagony you are made to endure, through the long nights, by your arteries thatboil, by your heart that bursts, by your head that splits, by your teeth thatbite your hands.” He does not say: “I was tortured by the thought of you, nightand day”; he gives particulars of how he experienced his torture—strong,startling particulars. The line “by your teeth that bite your hands” is a verygood touch. The others are all exaggerations—arteries do not literally boil, aheart does not break, his head was not splitting—but one feels that he did bitehis hands, and this conveys his agony very convincingly.The line “torture me with one hand, but caress me with the other!” states thewhole issue of the priest’s conflict. It is an impossible thing to ask, but thatis what makes it so dramatic an expression of his predicament: what he is askingof the girl is the impossible.Although the priest does terrible things in the novel, one is never convincedthat he is a total villain. Hugo obviously intended him as a villain, but,psychologically and philosophically, he was not sold on the idea. This conflictbetween Hugo’s conscious convictions and his deepest, subconscious view of lifeshows in his style.If Hugo’s full conviction had been that the priest’s passion is evil, thepriest’s way of speaking of his passion would have been much less attractive. Hewould have projected something ugly or sadistic—a perverted or evil feeling. Butinstead he speaks of his love in so romantic a way—the examples selected are soglowing and beautiful—that the reader necessarily feels sympathy for him (and sodoes the author).In this passage, there are no exalted sentences in defense of religion. When thepriest mentions religion, it is always in a blasphemous manner. In thisparticular projection, religion means nothing to him; he wants to put God underthe girl’s feet—which is wonderful, but not the way to project an evil passion.If Hugo’s own viewpoint had been what it ostensibly is—if he had reallyconsidered the priest a villain for his conflict—he would have presented thepassion less attractively and religion more forcefully. But Hugo’s subconsciousis so much on the side of love and of this earth that I say: “May his God helphim!”Throughout the novel, the priest keeps announcing that his passion is “fate.” Infact, earlier in his speech to the girl, he states that he lost the battleagainst temptation because God did not give to man a power as strong as thedevil’s. This is a deterministic premise. But what an author might have hischaracters say, or even what his own stated philosophy might be, is an issuetotally different from what his actual, subconscious premises are—as this speechillustrates.The speech expresses a violence of emotion that can come only from thepossibility of choice. An automaton does not experience violent emotions. Inliterature written on the determinist premise, emotions of pain can beconvincingly portrayed, but never a violent passion for a specific object onearth.Observe the priest’s self-assertion. He constantly tells how he tried to fighthis passion; then, when he felt the desire to see the girl again, he watched andwaited for her. He constantly talks about what he did; and he is begging her tohave pity on him, by which he means: consent to love him. He is acting on hispassion. He has decided that he cannot fight it any longer, so now he will tryto win her. And his emotional violence has one purpose: “If I can convince herof the greatness of my love, then maybe I can win her.” This is a man in chargeof his own destiny.If a man in a Naturalistic novel has a passion he cannot resist, there is anenormous tone of whining, amounting to: “Poor little me, I couldn’t help it.”Here, although the priest uses begging terms like have pity on me and mercy, histone is not one of complaint.I have already identified the method common to Hugo and me. Let me now point outcertain differences between us.First, Hugo permits more comment from the character himself—and thus from theauthor—than I would have done. For instance, the priest says: “But that imagedid not have the same color any longer; it was somber, ominous, dark like theblack circle that pursues for a long time the sight of the reckless one who haslooked fixedly at the sun. A man talking of a passion might possibly use ametaphor. But here the priest is too literary: he turns an elegant phrase thatHugo himself might have written in narrative. This somewhat detracts from thereality of a man talking desperately and passionately.Hugo is less concerned than I am with the exact (although slanted) re-creationof reality; he tends to interfere with his own presentation rather than stick toshowing. This is more apparent in his narrative passages than in dialogue: innarrative, he often editorializes to the point of it being Hugo speaking.Incidentally, he comes across as the most fascinating speaker: the writing isbrilliant; he always has something colorful to say. But he is nonobjective inpermitting the presence of the author as a narrator.Most nineteenth-century novelists did that. They editorialized constantly, evenusing expressions like “Now, gentle reader, we will let you in on a secret.”This is a method of fiction writing which cannot be justified logically.In the nineteenth century, writers were on the premise of writing as raconteurs,almost like the medieval troubadours who went around singing sagas. The authorprojected himself as a charming or witty personality—or an erudite one, likeHugo. But since the author did project himself, you have to read the novels ofthat time on two levels—which interrupts the reality. You are constantly takenout of the story itself, because you are listening to the narrator, and then yougo back into the story.This was merely a literary fashion, which was dropped—and ought to stay dropped.(Some people attempt to revive it, in a bad manner.) To remind the reader thatsomebody is telling him the story is to introduce an irrelevant element thatdestroys the attempt to re-create reality; it is as if a painter were to leavehis brush in a comer of the canvas to remind you that he painted it. Fiction isan atheistic universe: you are the God who is creating it, but there must not beany God in your writing.(If you write in the first person, you incorporate the narrator into the fabricof the story. In effect, the author becomes a character. Dostoevsky often doesit; he writes a novel from the viewpoint of some character in a small town whonever takes any part in the action, but who is the local chronicler—and thatpermits him to have editorial asides.)The other difference between Hugo and me concerns a certain kind of repetition,which goes beyond what is necessary to convey the confusion of a priestconfessing a guilty love to a girl. Some things are said over and over, in wayswhich do not fully add to the preceding.Hugo’s style consists in projecting above all the emotion involved. As aRomanticist of the first order, he knows that one does not project emotions quaemotions; he knows that emotions come from one’s premises and one’s evaluationsof concretes. But he is much less concerned than I am with the intellectualmeaning of the emotions he projects, and with the intellectual method ofprojecting them.Of the two styles, mine is more masculine, if by “masculine” we mean a tighteconomy of intellectual content. Even if I write about violent emotions, I weighevery word for its direct meaning, for its connotations, for what it adds to thesentence. Mine is a more controlled presentation; Hugo’s is much freer.The second of the two passages I quoted from Atlas Shrugged was writteninspirationally. It was written as I advise: write as it comes to you, thenedit. But when I edit, I consider every word: “Is this word extraneous ornecessary? Why do I want to keep it?” That particular passage I went over tentimes, and few changes were made. But I could write it that way only because mypremises were set to this kind of purposefulness and economy of expression; as aresult, my subconscious did not produce much that was extraneous.On other passages, my subconscious did not function as well—and that meant tenrewrites. I do not even have a manuscript page copied until I have made so manycorrections on it that I can no longer use that sheet of paper; I experiment onthe same page with ten different ways of wording a sentence. The reason is thatI cannot compose a sentence word for word. I can only write it, then weigh it:“Sounds right. Why is it right?” If I can give the answer, it stays. If it isnot quite right, why is it not? If I can grasp why, I rewrite it on the newpremise. Sometimes I cannot grasp why, but the sentence simply does not soundright. Then I try writing it different ways, until I suddenly see: “Yes, this iswhat was missing.”Hugo would not work like this; as is obvious through all of his writing, he doesnot strive for such minute precision. It is as if his brushstrokes are wider andmore “impressionistic” than mine, whereas while mine are wide, someone whoapproached them with a microscope would see that every strand was put there fora purpose.Offhand, I will not say which method is better. It is a metaphysical issue. Thefact that Hugo is consciously on the Christian-altruist code of values, andsubconsciously not at all on it, is one reason why he would not look for extremerational precision. That would not be part of his view of life, or, therefore,of his writing. Granting him his values and premises, his method is right forhim. In the above passages from Atlas Shrugged and Notre-Dame de Paris, the theme—theemotion of love—was conveyed by means of particulars chosen to represent theessence of that abstraction. This method is the essence of the Romantic approachto style.The next passage, in contrast, is by Thomas Wolfe.FROM OF TIME AND THE RIVER BY THOMAS WOLFEAh, strange and beautiful, the woman thought, how can I longer bear this joyintolerable, the music of this great song unpronounceable, the anguish of thisglory unimaginable, which fills my life to bursting and which will not let mespeak! ... Oh magic moment that is so perfect, unknown, and inevitable, to standhere at this ship’s great side, here at the huge last edge of evening andreturn, with this still wonder in my heart and knowing only that somehow we arefulfilled of you, oh time! ... Ah secret and alone, she thought—how lean withhunger, and how fierce with pride, and how burning with impossible desire hebends there at the rail of night—and he is wild and young and foolish andforsaken, and his eyes are starved, his soul is parched with thirst, his heartis famished with a hunger that cannot be fed, and he leans there on the rail anddreams great dreams, and he is mad for love and is athirst for glory, and he isso cruelly mistaken—and so right! ... Oh passionate and proud!—how like thewild, lost soul of youth you are, how like my wild lost father who will notreturn!He turned, and saw her then, and so finding her, was lost, and so losing self,was found, and so seeing her, saw for a fading moment only the pleasant image ofthe woman that perhaps she was, and that life saw. He never knew: he only knewthat from that moment his spirit was impaled upon the knife of love. From thatmoment on he never was again to lose her utterly, never to wholly re-possessunto himself the lonely, wild integrity of youth which had been his. At thatinstant of their meeting, that proud inviolability of youth was broken, not tobe restored. At that moment of their meeting she got into his life by some darkmagic, and before he knew it, he had her beating in the pulses of hisblood—somehow thereafter—how he never knew—to steal into the conduits of hisheart, and to inhabit the lone, inviolable tenement of his one life; so, likelove’s great thief, to steal through all the adyts of his soul, and to become apart of all he did and said and was—through this invasion so to touch allloveliness that he might touch, through this strange and subtle stealth of lovehenceforth to share all that he might feel or make or dream, until there was forhim no beauty that she did not share, no music that did not have her being init, no horror, madness, hatred, sickness of the soul, or grief unutterable, thatwas not somehow consonant to her single image and her million forms—and no finalfreedom and release, bought through the incalculable expenditure of blood andanguish and despair, that would not bear upon its brow forever the deep scar,upon its sinews the old mangling chains, of love.One can gather that, on seeing each other for the first time, these two personsfeel something violent for each other; at least the author’s loud words conveythat such was his intention. But he has not carried out his intention.The reason is: floating abstractions. Take the first sentence. “Ah, strange andbeautiful, the woman thought.” What is strange and beautiful? Is it life, orlove, or the man she sees? “How can I longer bear this joy intolerable, themusic of this great song unpronounceable, the anguish of this gloryunimaginable, which fills my life to bursting and which will not let me speak!”One does not know the joy of what, the music of what song, what glory; one canonly gather that the woman is feeling an emotion of some kind.Wolfe is trying to convey an emotion directly, primarily by means of adjectives.You can observe here the unsatisfactory result of having adjectives withoutnouns and specific content—i.e., attributes without entities. One cannot conveythe quality of something without conveying what that something is.It is a bromide among editors that bad writing can be judged by the number ofadjectives used. This is not an absolute standard, but it is true that beginnersoften use too many adjectives. Why? Because it is the easiest and laziest methodof describing something. When Wolfe wrote “joy intolerable,” “songunpronounceable,” and “glory unimaginable,” he evidently felt that if he put inthree of these adjectives, they would somehow do something. Properly speaking,one would do—or ten, if each said something that contributed to the sentence.Observe also the archaism of putting the adjective last: “joy intolerable,”“song unpronounceable,” “glory unimaginable.” This is permissible when thecontent warrants it (there is nothing that one can never do in writing, unlessit is irrational). But here the author attempts to substitute form for content:he attempts to convey the importance of the moment by substituting the form ofan exalted feeling for the content which he has not conveyed.In style, form follows function. If you convey the content of a strong emotion,you can use as loud a form as you wish because the content will support it.Similarly, if you wonder whether an adjective is superfluous, remember that youcan do anything if your content permits it. But never substitute words formeaning.Also, the easiest thing on earth is to call something “a song” or to speak about“the music” of something, “music” always connoting strong emotion. “Love is likemusic” or “architecture is music” or “poetry is music”—you have seen this adnauseam. If warranted by the content, and if done in an original manner, it ispermissible to compare something to music. But do not attempt to conveyexaltation simply by saying “the music of this great song.” What song?Someone once told me that no writer should ever say “indescribable” —if it isnot describable, then do not describe it. Here the author spends a wholesentence on “song unpronounceable,” “glory unimaginable.” When an author says,“This is unutterable,” he is confessing inadequacy. It can have no othermeaning; unutterable to whom? An author should not intrude his personal writingproblems on the reader; the reader is following the events of the story, not themechanics of the author’s mind.“Oh magic moment that are so perfect, unknown, and inevitable.” Why is themoment “perfect,” “unknown,” and “inevitable”? There is no reason for theseadjectives, except that they vaguely suggest something exalted or important. Andwhat is meant by “somehow we are fulfilled of you, oh time!”? The author givesus the form of a sentence but no actual meaning; he is counting only on theconnotations of the words. That is improper by the rules not only of literature,but of plain grammar.Words are means of communication and must be used for their denotation. One ofthe beauties of a good literary style, as opposed to a dry synopsis, is that itcombines clear denotation with the skillful use of connotation. But one canconnote something only in relation to something. One cannot have connotations,which are relationships, without specifying any of the entities bearing theserelationships.“Oh magic moment.” It is permissible, and can be very effective, to use the wordoh as an extreme expression of a particular emotion—when justified by thecontent. Observe that when Hugo used it—“Oh, young girl, have pity on me!”—therewas a definite reason for the exclamation; the priest was appealing for pity.Here, by contrast, Wolfe uses the word oh merely to describe an emotion.Also, never use the word magic in a positive sense. It is a lazy writer’s word.To say that something is “magical” is too easy, just as mysticism is too easy away out of philosophical problems. Mysticism is not at all easy psychologically,but it is, philosophically. Similarly, the word magic is not easy if you want toachieve a proper effect, but it is very easy literarily: if you do not know howto describe something, you say: “Oh, it’s magical.”“Ah secret and alone, she thought.” The intention of this description is clear:the young man looks as if he has something secret about him. But to call him a“secret” man is an indefensible foreshortening. I do not mean that the authorshould have used an overprecise sentence like “The man looked as if he had asecret”; to be overprecise here would be out of the emotional key. And it isdifficult to maintain clarity while conveying a strong emotional mood. But it isnot proper to convey it by means of bad grammar. An old literary bromide saysthat when you write about boring people, you, the writer, do not have to beboring. The same applies here: you cannot convey an incoherent emotion by meansof incoherent writing.Incidentally, the one good line up to this point is in the preceding sentence:“to stand here at this ship’s great side, here at the huge last edge of eveningand return.” An evening and a return do not literally have an edge, but here oneneed not be grammatically pedantic. This whole passage is preceded by thedescription of a ship docking in the evening, and therefore the meaning of “thehuge last edge of evening and return” is clear: the vastness of returning homein the evening. Here Wolfe does combine an emotion with a specific, physicaldescription.,But then he repeats the same trick, very badly: “he bends there at the rail ofnight.” This is too foreshortened.Next, the author states one idea three times by means of synonyms: “his eyes arestarved, his soul is parched with thirst, his heart is famished with a hungerthat cannot be fed.” This is an example of not writing by means of essences. IfWolfe wanted to convey the idea of spiritual hunger, and convey it strongly, histask was to find the strongest expression he could for such a hunger. Hisdilemma here was that none of these metaphors is strong enough by itself toconvey what he wanted. But stating something three times does not make itstronger; it makes it three times weaker.The last part of this sentence contains some specific meaning, and it is almostgood: “he is mad for love and is athirst for glory, and he is so cruellymistaken—and so right!” Here the author indicates what about the man impressesthe woman. With direct simplicity, the sentence conveys her impression of him,her estimate of his future, and her philosophy (her view is that he is right toexpect love and glory, but is destined for disappointment—which indicates amalevolent view of the universe on her part). The author says somethingspecific, and he says it once. If, in the preceding, he had given some groundsfor the woman’s conclusion by describing the man’s face or expression, thiswould have been a good sentence.“Oh passionate and proud!—how like the wild, lost soul of youth you are, howlike my wild lost father who will not return!” The reference to the woman’sfather spoils the emotional mood of the passage and destroys the precedingdescription of the young man, which emphasizes his youth, ambition, and future.A hymn to a woman’s first meeting with her beloved cannot end on a familyrecollection. That is a real anticlimax.Then the meeting is taken up from the standpoint of the young man. “He turned,and saw her then, and so finding her, was lost, and so losing self, was found.”Again, the author is playing for effect by means of words instead of content. Ittakes minutes to figure out what the sentence means: “Well, finding her, he waslost. How? Oh, by falling in love. Losing self, he was found. By whom?”“He never knew: he only knew that from that moment his spirit was impaled uponthe knife of love.” This is an extremely ugly image: it connotes meat on askewer or a soldier in a bad movie falling on a sword through his stomach.Admittedly, the metaphor is philosophical: the author regards love as a knifebecause it leads to disaster. But to make it so specific that one sees the man’sspirit falling on that knife is inexcusably ugly.“From that moment on he never was again to lose her utterly, never to whollyre-possess unto himself the lonely, wild integrity of youth which had been his.”Observe the overuse of the word wild. It is bad to “ride” a word—to use it overand over, so that the reader becomes conscious of the repetition. In most books,editors have told me, the author rides some particular expression. Here, Wolfedoes it within one page.The above sentence does at least convey a specific thought: that this is the endof the man’s youthful independence. But then the next sentence expresses exactlythe same thought: “At that instant of their meeting, that proud inviolability ofyouth was broken, not to be restored.” Wolfe should have used one sentence orthe other, but not both.“... henceforth to share all that he might feel or make or dream, until therewas for him no beauty that she did not share, no music that did not have herbeing in it, no horror, madness, hatred, sickness of the soul, or griefunutterable, that was not somehow consonant to her single image and her millionforms.” The thought is good: the woman will hereafter be part of every importantmoment of the man’s life. It is also good that Wolfe tries to specify themoments; here he is writing by means of essential details. But the terribleoverwriting destroys the dignity of the thought: “horror, madness, hatred,sickness of the soul, or grief unutterable. ” A writer has to know when to stop.The best part of this sentence is: “that was not somehow consonant to her singleimage and her million forms.” Wolfe has communicated not only his meaning, butalso its emotional quality. To have said “her personality and its differentaspects” would have been a dry synopsis; “her single image and her millionforms” is both specific and Romantic. But to reach the meaning of the emotionWolfe is conveying, the reader has to break through some dreadful verbal weeds.“—and no final freedom and release, bought through the incalculable expenditureof blood and anguish and despair, that would not bear upon its brow forever thedeep scar, upon its sinews the old mangling chains, of love.” Wolfe is trying tosuggest some great suffering, but it cannot be done by piling up synonyms. Neveruse words like blood, anguish, and despair together; one means essentially thesame as the others. And if you mean despair, then anguish is too weak a word; ifyou mean blood, then both anguish and despair are anticlimaxes.What kind of philosophy comes across in Wolfe’s style? First, a malevolent viewof the universe, which he reveals not merely in such particular statements as“he is so cruelly mistaken,” but in the whole tone of “This is torture, but it’swonderful,” “This is fate, and we’re helpless.” Inherent in his style is animplication of human helplessness in the face of emotion and destiny.But the main philosophical implication of Wolfe’s style is subjectivism. A manwho approached reality objectively would not write this way; he would not, forinstance, relate what the two persons saw in each other without giving anyindication of the physical means by which they inferred it all. Wolfe, however,does not identify what causes his own emotions, and therefore has no idea how tocommunicate those emotions to others; all he knows is that certain semipoeticexpressions appeal to him, and he tries to communicate emotions by means ofthese. They are not the proper means.In this whole passage from Wolfe, there is a very meager selection of contentand an enormous overweight of language. The content could be conveyed in twosentences; the rest is extra words. This is not to say that a first meetingbetween lovers must be described in two sentences. No, you can write four pageson it—if you have something to say.Thomas Wolfe’s style is the archetype of what I call, borrowing from modemsculpture, the “mobile” style: it is so vague that anyone can interpret it asanything he wishes. This is why his appeal is usually to people under twenty.Wolfe presents an empty mold to be filled by any reader, the general intentionbeing aspiration, undefined idealism, the desire to escape from the commonplaceand to find “something better in Life”—none of it given any content. A youngreader recognizes the intention and supplies his own concretes—if he does nothold the writer responsible for conveying his own meaning, but is willing totake him merely as a springboard.I cannot do that. I do not collaborate with what I read in any such manner.FROM ARROWSMITH BY SINCLAIR LEWISSound of mating birds, sound of spring blossoms dropping in the tranquil air,the bark of sleepy dogs at midnight; who is to set them down and make themanything but hackneyed? And as natural, as conventional, as youthfully gauche,as eternally beautiful and authentic as those ancient sounds was the talk ofMartin and Leora in that passionate half-hour when each found in the other apart of his own self, always vaguely missed, discovered now with astonished joy.They rattled like hero and heroine of a sticky tale, like sweat-shop operatives,like bouncing rustics, like prince and princess. Their words were silly andinconsequential, heard one by one, yet taken together they were as wise andimportant as the tides or the sounding wind.The purpose of this passage, which follows the first meeting of Martin andLeora, is to present the essence of their romance.“Sound of mating birds, sound of spring blossoms dropping in the tranquil air,the bark of sleepy dogs at midnight; who is to set them down and make themanything but hackneyed?” Here the author openly confesses incompetence, sayingin effect: “I have only the hackneyed to say about this, but that’s in thenature of things. Nobody could do otherwise.” Not all Naturalists reveal theirwriting problems by telling the reader about them (which is improper from anyliterary standpoint); nevertheless, it is the Naturalist premise that makesLewis do it. On the Naturalist premise, a writer describes “things as they are,”not things as they ought to be. The method of selection is not a value judgment,but a statistical one. Consequently, when Lewis wants to present a setting orconnotation proper to love, he will think only of the hackneyed—which is thestatistically average.“And as natural, as conventional, as youthfully gauche, as eternally beautifuland authentic as those ancient sounds was the talk of Martin and Leora.” HereLewis confesses the Naturalist premise: “This is hackneyed, but it is naturaland authentic.” Natural and authentic to whom? As a Naturalist, he does not askthis question. He describes love from the statistical viewpoint.His fidelity to what he thinks is reality—meaning: the statistical and theaverage—is also obvious when he says “youthfully gauche.” The majority of younglovers may be youthfully gauche, but that is not a law of human nature. I submitthat any outstanding young people are more romantic and dramatically outspokenthan they become later on. Yet the kind of young man or girl who will say, “Oh,gee, darling, you know, I’m kind of smitten,” that is Lewis’s (and Hollywood’s)idea of young love.Calling this “eternally beautiful” is again a confession of the statisticalstandard. “This is what most lovers act like; and, of course, love is beautiful;therefore, this is its beautiful form.” The Naturalist does not project thevalues which ought to be, and so he presents love not in its highest form, butstrictly in its statistical form.The last part of this sentence is good in that it says something specific (andtrue) about the nature of love: “each found in the other a part of his own self,always vaguely missed, discovered now with astonished joy.” This is specific—andgeneral. It pertains to the essence of love more than do “mating birds” and“spring blossoms.”The next sentence is the writing of a repressor. “They rattled like hero andheroine of a sticky tale, like sweat-shop operatives, like bouncing rustics,like prince and princess. ” Lewis wants to convey that love is important andthat a romance is happening between Martin and Leora, but at the same time he isapologizing to any cynical “realist” who is not in sympathy with romanticfeeling. He in effect says: “Romantic scenes might be accused by thesophisticated of being sticky. All right, I’ll admit it, I’ll smile at itmyself—so don’t take it too seriously. But still I consider love important.” Tomake the scene more “true to life,” he then selects the lowest possible forms ofcouples: “sweat-shop operatives” and “bouncing rustics.” He in effectacknowledges: “By the statistical standard, there are more sweat-shop operativesand bouncing rustics than princes and princesses, so I’ll include them. I ampaying my dues to reality. But still Martin and Leora were like a prince andprincess, or at least that is how they felt.”The last sentence is again the confession of a writer’s impotence: “Their wordswere silly and inconsequential, heard one by one, yet taken together they wereas wise and important as the tides or the sounding wind. ” Lovers usually have akidding romantic code which might be silly objectively, but which has meaning tothe two persons subjectively. This phenomenon is one of the hardest things forany writer to communicate on paper, so Lewis solves the problem by sayingdescriptively: “Yes, the individual words are probably silly, but the sum isimportant because it expresses intimacy and love.” This is inexcusableliterarily. A writer who wants to be true to reality should undertake here toconvey the romantic code of lovers. It would be difficult, but it can be done.Observe that the two Romantics I have presented, and the in-between case ofThomas Wolfe, all made a big to-do (to put it in Sinclair Lewis’s style) aboutthe issue of love; they focused on it in detail. By contrast, Lewis spends pagesdescribing Martin’s school and Leora’s hospital [he is a medical student and shea nurse]; then, when the Naturalist comes to that which makes lifeimportant—their first romance—he gives it a short, semisatirical paragraph. Thisis not an accident. Not all Naturalists are as inhibited as Lewis, who has aquality here of the repressed Romantic, but the essence of their method isalways the same.FROM STAR MONEY BY KATHLEEN WINSORThey went into his room and took off their clothes, smiling at each other andwithout self-consciousness. Johnny was undressed first and he lay down on thebed, his hands behind his head, watching her. Shireen turned, stepped out of herpetticoat and faced him. Her eyes had turned dark and her face lapsed intosudden serious intensity, as if she wondered how he would find her; but also asif she had lost Shireen Delaney and came toward him only as a woman, a part oftime and every woman who ever lived. She sat beside him on the bed, leaningforward, one hand lifting and moving to touch his hair. He reached out and tookhold of her and all at once he grinned.“Chocolate cake with peppermint frosting—that’s you.” His hands touched herbreasts lightly. “You’re all the favors wrapped up in one package.”Shireen gave a sudden triumphant ringing laugh and he pulled her down againsthim.This passage is typical of what is known as “magazine writing.” The words arecompletely inconsequential; the style, lacking any emotional or intellectualsignificance, is merely one step above a plain synopsis. The particular qualityof magazine writing is that almost anything can be said or can happen.The author does show—I assume, unintentionally—what love means to the woman inthe scene. In a moment of passion, all she is thinking about is how the man willfind her when she takes off her clothes; and when he finds her to be a chocolatecake, she gives a triumphant ringing laugh. She passed the test. All that lovemeans to this woman is reassurance to her ego—a self-esteem derived fromsomebody else’s appreciation.The description here is totally meaningless and unemotional—but then the authorapparently remembers that she is writing a love scene and that somethingimportant has to be said. So she slings some tired, superficial generalities:“as if she had lost Shireen Delaney and came toward him only as a woman, a partof time and every woman who ever lived.” I think she was trying to say somethinglike “This is love, which would have the same meaning for every woman in everytime.” Then, having done her duty by love’s significance, she goes back to themagazine style: “She sat beside him on the bed, leaning forward, one handlifting and moving to touch his hair. ”The dialogue is Naturalism (if one can call it anything at all) in that theauthor is using what she considers realistic slang. She probably thought: “Thisis how a real he-man talks.” Of course, nobody talks like that, not even in abad Hollywood movie. (Even magazine fiction is not that ridiculous.)If you ever attempt to write without full awareness of what you are saying, whyyou are saying it, and what you are writing about, this will be the result. Thisis somebody who is writing in a half-dazed state, not projecting the reality orthe emotional or intellectual meaning of her subject matter, but merely slingingwords together while drawing on the subconscious residue of her impressions ofsimilar scenes from other stories.FROM BY LOVE POSSESSED BY JAMES GOULD COZZENSIn recollection’s light, first to be noted was the plain fact that, by standardsof what was later learned, the feelings affording a young man his state of love,of being in love, were largely factitious. This was not by any means to say thatthey were false or pretended; but, still, they had not, as the young man himselfwas likely to imagine, arisen spontaneously. In theory, the feelings resultedwhen love magically and mysteriously seized on him; in theory, that was whatlove did. In practice, love did nothing of the kind. He, the truth usually was,seized on love. A young man heard and read of a thing called love. Love waspraised everywhere as pure, noble, and beautiful. Love did have to do with thecommerce between the sexes; but love as described clearly could not have to dowith sex—the physical urges of nature that he knew about. Those had beendenounced to him as evil and impure, the associates of what he joined in calling(even if he fairly frequently indulged in them) dirty jokes, dirty thoughts,dirty practices. What those were, must be everything true love wasn’t. Love knewthem not. Love, manifestly, was out of this world. Love’s high feelings, at onceso exciting and so presentable, could, moreover, be had, apparently, by anyone.A young man would not be long in resolving to have some....... To the rules of high-mindedness, the flesh is imperfectly amenable. Kisseshowever chaste, caresses however decent, if the exchange of them is kept up,must have the flesh soon shaping to its natural end, projecting its actualobjective. A discipline of mind was required. The witching hour was to be savedintact by a division of consciousness; one part excluding rigidly all thatengaged the other part. Held separate, thoughts on the plane of moonlight androses could proceed regardless of the lower animal. Or, at least, they could soproceed to a point. Due to that blameless neglect of Hope’s to call the halt she(the fair, the chaste, the inexpressive she!) had no need to call; and to herpartner in petting’s reluctance to leave, since he was free to remain, there hadbeen awkward occasions when the animal (disregarded by the hour and teased toofar) reacted of a sudden, put to the shilly-shally so long imposed its ownunpreventable end. Arthur Winner Junior—confusion in the moonlight; dismay amongthe roses!—was obliged to conceal as well as he could a crisis about which hissingle shamed consolation was that Hope, anything but knowing, would never knowwhat had happened.This is not an unselective, unvaluing recording. The author’s value judgmentsare obvious. Yet it is intended as a Naturalistic recording of “things as theyare.”Observe all the slanted writing. For instance, the author describes as a fact ofnature the hero’s attitude toward love. He does not say that this was theattitude of a particular young man—he describes it in generalized terms, as ifall young men fall in love only because they have heard about it. “A young manheard and read of a thing called love. Love was praised everywhere as pure,noble, and beautiful.” Since love is praised, according to the author, a youngman will be motivated by such praise.All young men in fact feel nothing, Cozzens implies; they merely tell themselvesthey feel something because they hear that other people feel it. This amounts tosaying that the psychology of all young men is ten times worse than what Ipresented, in The Fountainhead, in the character of Peter Keating.“Love as described clearly could not have to do with sex—the physical urges ofnature that he knew about. Those had been denounced to him asevil and impure.” This is a false and awful view of sex—the Christian-mysticalview. Cozzens presents the most vicious code of values—man is helpless, sex is astupid physical urge belonging to his lower animal nature, his “high” feelingsare merely a silly romantic illusion—yet he does not state that this is the viewof his hero or of the hero’s social group. These value judgments are the onesconventionally held by most people, Cozzens believes, and so he does notconsider them estimates. He considers them facts of human nature.The two elements which constitute style are content (what an author chooses tosay) and use of words (the way he says it). Not only is what Cozzens says aboutman and love horrible; there is something extremely repulsive about the mannerin which he says it. If one were to identify the essence of his style in oneword, that word would be sneer. Cozzens is sneering—at love, and at man as such.Observe his repetitions, which are not accidental (nor are they as innocent asthose of Thomas Wolfe, who repeated things for poetic or rhythmical purposes).At the beginning, he says: “the feelings affording a young man his state oflove, of being in love, were largely factitious.” He uses the phrase “state oflove, which is a formal statement of his subject, then adds the colloquial“being in love.” Why? In order to sneer at the reader on the side: “If you’re sostupid that you don’t know what the ‘state of love’ is, I am making fun of thatstate which you will recognize better as ‘being in love.’ ” (The repetition alsoadds another element: awkwardness; deliberately planned awkwardness.)“In theory, the feelings resulted when love magically and mysteriously seized onhim; in theory, that was what love did.” The purpose of this repetition is againto imply the stupidity of the reader. Cozzens is saying: “In theory, love doessuch and such. In theory, that’s what love does. You can’t get a thought thefirst time, so I’ll tell it to you with a patronizing sneer a second time.”Cozzens claims that love, in theory, comes magically out of nowhere, and then hesays: “In practice, love did nothing of the kind.” Since “theory” here meansreason or thought, the implied conclusion is that man is unable to think.This is a good example of how the alleged opposition between theory and practiceis always presented. A foolish and illogical theory is first set up, and thenthe author triumphantly shows that it does not work in practice. In thispassage, Cozzens takes the tritest, most superficial of theories—that love isblind—and proceeds to say that it is not so. His purpose—and the purpose of thewhole theory-practice opposition—is to show that man’s mind is impotent to dealwith reality or with his own emotions. A man believed one thing about love and,in reality, found something else. The question to ask is: If he believed thekind of nonsense which Cozzens presents, is the fault in man’s mind or in thisparticular man’s foolishness? But Cozzens does not ask that question. Hisintention is the undercutting of the mind and the degradation of man.The next stylistic trait to observe is Cozzens’s stodgy writing style—a satireon the long, involved, awkward sentences of mid-Victorian novels—which heintersperses with deliberately vulgar bromides like “moonlight and roses,” “thelower animal,” and “out of this world.” They are included to remind the readerthat “I, the author, am now condescending to speak your language, which would be‘moonlight and roses’ and ‘out of this world.’ ” The implication is that thereader will not understand such ponderous talk as “manifestly” or “state oflove” or “commerce between the sexes,” so the author will let his hair down oncein a while with vulgarities which the reader will understand. This deliberateuse of ugly, inexpressive bromides in the middle of the awkward archaic style isone reason why the writing is so unattractive. And it is another means forCozzens to convey his metaphysical sneer.The style of this quotation will make any sensitive reader uncomfortable. Theinsult to his intelligence is built into the sentences; it is there in thechoice both of what the author says and of the way he says it.One cannot grasp the author’s meaning at the first reading, not because hisstyle is so subtle and profound, but because it is so involved grammatically.For instance: “Due to that blameless neglect of Hope’s to call the halt she (thefair, the chaste, the inexpressive she!) had no need to call; and to her partnerin petting’s reluctance to leave, since he was free to remain, there had beenawkward occasions when the animal (disregarded by the hour and teased too far)reacted of a sudden, put to the shilly-shally so long imposed its ownunpreventable end.” This is not bad writing in the sense that Cozzens could notdo any better; it is good writing by his standard, i.e., it is what he intended,and it probably took hard work, because no one writes like this naturally. If by“art” we mean an intention purposefully carried out, this is high art. What onecan quarrel with is the intention.The intention is the deliberate destruction of the reader’s mental efficacy. Thegrammatical structures make it impossible for the reader to follow a thought.“Due to that blameless neglect of Hope’s to call the halt she (the fair, thechaste, the inexpressive she!) had no need to call.” By phrasing the sentencedifferently, the author could have left the reader grammatical time to rememberthe character of Hope, then said what Hope failed to do—which would have beenthe logical order. Instead, he interrupts the thought at the most awkward point,between the subject and the verb, she and had. Why? Precisely to throw thereader off for a moment; i.e., not to allow his mind to proceed to a completethought.He does the same in the second half of the sentence: “there had been awkwardoccasions when the animal (disregarded by the hour and teased too far) reactedof a sudden.” For the reader to grasp it, a thought has to progress in a certaintime sequence; but here the author again interrupts in the middle of thethought, throwing the reader into an aside and making him scramble mentally tocatch the original intention. Cozzens deliberately puts the reader’s mind intoan unfocused, nonrational state of wandering all over the map.One has to watch carefully the between-the-lines implications to know whatCozzens is actually talking about in this sentence. In this respect, he isimitating the special kind of mid-Victorian prissiness which consists of beingvery bashfully indirect in talking about sex—and the more indirect, the dirtierthe implications of what one dares not say openly.What he is doing is illustrating the theory of love expressed in the first partof the quotation. That is, even though the young man had decided that love hasnothing to do with sex, and even though the young couple tried to keep theirrelationship chaste, things would happen against the young man’s will; andCozzens does not mean normal intercourse. The style of this—the mere fact thathe is not talking about an actual affair, but about something totallyunnecessary to mention—makes this passage typical of Cozzens. Writing in thespiritual style of four-letter words, he goes out of his way to make somethingugly which is not necessarily ugly at all. The best-drawn character in anyone’s writing is the author himself. None of theabove passages deals with philosophy directly, yet the author’s philosophy ispresent—in what he chooses to say and in how he says it. In this sense, afiction writer cannot hide himself. He stands naked spiritually.You cannot create a style artificially, composing each sentence word by word andthen weighing each word: “How does this fit with my official dogma?” A writer’sstyle comes from his accepted philosophy—accepted in his subconscious.Just as, in your general behavior as a human being, your premises “willout”—they will come out in many subtle ways, and any conflict you might havewill show, particularly in emergencies—so in your writing your premises willout. If your conscious philosophy has sunk into your subconscious and becomeautomatic, that will show in your style. If your conscious philosophy is notfully assimilated—if you have premises contradictory to it in yoursubconscious—that will show. If you have good premises, that will show. If youhave god-awful premises, then, in the passage from Cozzens, you have just seenan example of the result.If you are not satisfied with what comes out of your subconscious, you cancorrect it by conscious thinking. But do not censor yourself in the process ofwriting. That cannot be done successfully. To be the kind of writer you want tobe, you must first be the kind of thinker you want to be.Just as man is a being of self-made soul, so a writer is a being of self-madestyle. Both are made by the same process—by a man’s being fully convinced ofcertain premises to the point where they become subconscious and automatic."},{"pageContent":"9Style II: Descriptions of Nature and of New YorkFROM ATLAS SHRUGGED BY AYN RANDShe sat at the window of the train, her head thrown back, not moving, wishingshe would never have to move again.The telegraph poles went racing past the window, but the train seemed lost in avoid, between a brown stretch of prairie and a solid spread of rusty, grayingclouds. The twilight was draining the sky without the wound of a sunset; itlooked more like the fading of an anemic body in the process of exhausting itslast drops of blood and light. The train was going west, as if it, too, werepulled to follow the sinking rays and quietly to vanish from the earth. She satstill, feeling no desire to resist it.This description illustrates the art of combining denotation and connotation.My assignment was to describe a sunset seen from the window of a train—a dismalsunset that would match Dagny’s mood in this scene. I give the reader preciseinformation about the sight by means of those details which convey its essence;and I convey the mood by the kind of words and metaphor I select. Unlike ThomasWolfe, I do not try to convey the mood apart from that which creates the mood.Instead, I carefully select words that both convey the exact physical detailsand have specific connotations.For instance, in the phrase “a solid spread of rusty, graying clouds,” the wordrusty conveys not only the color, but also something dismal. In the nextsentence, the word twilight has connotations of sadness. And the best part ofthis description is: “The twilight was draining the sky without the wound of asunset.” Since a sunset would look like a wound across the sky, the metaphor isvisually appropriate and helps the reader visualize a sunset; and by saying thatthe sky was being drained without the wound of a sunset, I convey, by means of anegative, both the exact description and the mood. Then I continue the metaphorin the same style: “it looked more like the fading of an anemic body in theprocess of exhausting its last drops of blood and light. ” When I say “andlight,” I bring the metaphor back to the concrete reality of the sunset and theevening.Suppose I had started by saying: “It was evening and she sat at the window of atrain. The twilight was draining the sky without the wound of a sunset.” Thatwould have been a floating abstraction. I first have to give specific details:there is a brown stretch of prairie, the sky is covered with clouds, they are ofa rusty shade so that one would not see the sun setting. Then the metaphor“without the wound of a sunset” becomes convincing. To start with such ametaphor would be vague and unclear, because the question would be: Where didthe sunset go?In the next sentence, the words all have a downbeat, twilight feeling. “Thetrain was going west”—this connotes the sunset and evening—“as if it, too, werepulled”—it is not even going of its own power—“to follow the sinking rays andquietly to vanish from the earth. ” This is a literal description, since thetrain is going west, but by saying “quietly to vanish from the earth,” I implymore than merely vanishing into the sunset. I imply destruction andhopelessness, and the feeling of “your days are numbered,” which is theemotional key of this chapter.According to my metaphysical view, nature is of interest to a human being onlyas his material or setting. I therefore always describe nature as a backgroundfor man, never as an end in itself considered separately from the characters orthe scene taking place. (This is a point open to debate. If a writer attachessome special value to the description of nature, I would say that he has a wrongpremise; but one could not say that, in carrying out his premise, he is guiltyof overwriting.)The above description is written from Dagny’s viewpoint; she is sitting at thewindow of a train, and this is what she sees. However, observe that I could havewritten the same description without referring to anyone sitting at a window,since I describe what the place and the sunset actually look like. I do notproject Dagny’s emotions into the description.When we come to the last quotation, from Thomas Wolfe, you will see a differentapproach. In his description of New York, he does not differentiate between whatis being seen and what the character feels.FROM SEVEN GOTHIC TALES BY ISAK DINESENThe road from Closter Seven to Hopballehus rises more than five hundred feet andwinds through tall pine forest. From time to time this opens and affords amagnificent view over large stretches of land below. Now in the afternoon sunthe trunks of the fir trees were burning red, and the landscape far away seemedcool, all blue and pale gold. Boris was able now to believe what the oldgardener at the convent had told him when he was a child: that he had once seen,about this time of the year and the day, a herd of unicorns come out of thewoods to graze upon the sunny slopes, the white and dappled mares, rosy in thesun, treading daintily and looking around for their young, the old stallion,darker roan, sniffing and pawing the ground. The air here smelled of fir leavesand toadstools, and was so fresh that it made him yawn. And yet, he thought, itwas different from the freshness of spring; the courage and gaiety of it weretinged with despair. It was the finale of the symphony.This is one of the most beautiful descriptions I have read in the Romanticstyle. (Primarily a writer of fantastic stories, Isak Dinesen is hard toclassify; but she is certainly nearer to being a Romanticist than a Naturalist.)First the author gives a general idea of the setting: it is a winding roadrising through pine forest. Then she begins to give particulars: “Now in theafternoon sun the trunks of the fir trees were burning red, and the landscapefar away seemed cool, all blue and pale gold.” By means of a few essentials, thereader gets an attractive generalized picture.The author then does something unusual and difficult. To convey the mood of thelandscape and to give the reader a wider, more essential impression of it thanshe could have done by describing more leaves or branches or grass, sheintroduces this peculiar device: “Boris was able now to believe what the oldgardener at the convent had told him when he was a child: that he had once seen,about this time of the year and the day, a herd of unicorns come out of thewoods to graze upon the sunny slopes.” Observe the connotations. That an oldgardener at a convent tells something to a child has in itself a fantasticquality; and when he tells him that he has seen unicorns, this impossiblefantasy projects the exact eerie quality of the afternoon. “A herd of horses”would not have produced the same effect, because the purpose is to suggestsomething supernatural, odd, almost decadently frightening, but very attractive.The words “about this time of the year and the day” skillfully show the author’sintention: it is not to indulge in a fantasy for its own sake, but to conveythat at this time of year and day, the sunlight on these trees and this slopehas the eerie, fantastic quality that could make one expect the supernatural.As the author goes on to describe the unicorns, they are made specific in anunusually artistic way. The description is almost overdetailed, but byessentials: “the white and dappled mares, rosy in the sun, treading daintily andlooking around for their young, the old stallion, darker roan, sniffing andpawing the ground.” Observe how carefully the color scheme is projected: thatthe mares are “white and dappled” but “rosy in the sun” is another reminder ofthe late afternoon sunlight. That they are “treading daintily” connotes thesteps of elegant racehorses; yet the mares are unicorns, which makes them evenmore dainty. This amount of detail gives reality to the fantastic; and by sodoing, the author conveys the mood of the afternoon.The next sentence is completely realistic: “The air here smelled of fir leavesand toadstools, and was so fresh that it made him yawn.” It is a brilliantsentence: with great economy of words, the very essentials are selected so thatone can almost smell the forest.“And yet, he thought, it was different from the freshness of spring; the courageand gaiety of it were tinged with despair.” Since the freshness is differentfrom that of spring, one can infer that it is fall. But what would imply,without the author saying it, that this is fall, is all the eerie fantasy thathas gone before: the air of something supernatural, in gold, pink, redshades—the air of something decadent. The last sentence sums up the wholeeffect: “It was the finale of the symphony.”The author has given a specific description of this hillside and no other—atthis time of year and day. To convey the mood, she gives specific images, suchas the fir trees, the unicorns, their colors and gestures, and even theperspective, and the smell of the forest. These are concretes, as distinguishedfrom: “It was an eerie, fantastic landscape; beautiful but tragic; lovely butheartbreaking.” Those would be floating abstractions.FROM THE FOUNTAINHEAD BY AYN RANDFrom the train, he looked back once at the skyline of the city as it flashedinto sight and was held for some moments beyond the windows. The twilight hadwashed off the details of the buildings. They rose in thin shafts of a soft,porcelain blue, a color not of real things, but of evening and distance. Theyrose in bare outlines, like empty molds waiting to be filled. The distance hadflattened the city. The single shafts stood immeasurably tall, out of scale tothe rest of the earth. They were of their own world, and they held up to the skythe statement of what man had conceived and made possible. They were emptymolds. But man had come so far; he could go farther. The city on the edge of thesky held a question—and a promise.Here I present first a visual description by means of essentials and then thesymbolic or philosophical meaning of that description.The first part of this passage describes the city, the second part conveys themeaning. The two are tied together by the concept of “empty molds,” which islegitimate in both contexts. “They rose in bare outlines, like empty moldswaiting to be filled.” This is what buildings do look like at a distance, whenthe details are not seen. The transition to the philosophical meaning is done inthis sentence: “The single shafts stood immeasurably tall, out of scale to therest of theearth. They were of their own world”—this could apply both to their size andtheir meaning—“and they held up to the sky the statement of what man hadconceived and made possible. They were empty molds. But man had come so far; hecould go farther.” Here, “empty molds” is used strictly in the symbolic sense,to represent a promise.This passage comes at the end of Part I of The Fountainhead, when Roark has toleave the city to work in the granite quarry. The meaning of the passage istherefore clear: “The city on the edge of the sky held a question—and apromise.” A question since Roark, given his position, cannot be sure of what thefuture holds; a promise since man (meaning Roark) “could go farther.”What I am conveying here is the inspirational quality of the sight of thecity—inspirational to Roark in the particular context of the novel; andinspirational in a wider sense, since I stress that the city is a symbol ofhuman achievement.This passage illustrates the method by which you can integrate, yet keepseparately clear, a physical description and its philosophical meaning. Observethat the meaning is legitimately derived from the description. After describingtall buildings that rise above and out of scale to the rest of the earth, theconclusion that they represent the shape of human achievement is logicallyjustified. (Again, keep this in mind when we come to the last quotation, fromThomas Wolfe, which follows a different method.)FROM ATLAS SHRUGGED BY AYN RAND[The following analysis of a paragraph from Atlas Shrugged, originally given inconnection with this course, was later written out by Ayn Rand herself. It isreprinted here as written (except for minor changes in punctuation).]Clouds had wrapped the sky and had descended as fog to wrap the streets below,as if the sky were engulfing the city. She could see the whole of ManhattanIsland, a long, triangular shape cutting into an invisible ocean. It looked likethe prow of a sinking ship; a few tall buildings still rose above it, likefunnels, but the rest was disappearing under gray-blue coils, going down slowlyinto vapor and space. This was how they had gone—she thought—Atlantis, the citythat sank into the ocean, and all the other kingdoms that vanished, leaving thesame legend in all the languages of men, and the same longing.This description had four purposes: (1) to give an image of the view fromDagny’s window, namely, an image of what New York looks like on a foggy evening;(2) to suggest the meaning of the events which have been taking place, namely,the city as a symbol of greatness doomed to destruction; (3) to connect New Yorkwith the legend of Atlantis; (4) to convey Dagny’s mood. So the description hadto be written on four levels: literal, connotative, symbolic, emotional.The opening sentence of the description sets the key for all four levels:“Clouds had wrapped the sky and had descended as fog to wrap the streets below,as if the sky were engulfing the city.” On the literal level, the sentence isexact: it describes a foggy evening. But had I said something like “There wereclouds in the sky, and the streets were full of fog,” the sentence would haveachieved nothing more. By casting the sentence into an active form, by wordingit as if the clouds were pursuing some goal, I achieve the following: (1) on theliteral level, a more graphic image of the view, because the sentence suggeststhe motion, the progressive thickening of the fog; (2) on the connotative level,it suggests the conflict of two adversaries and the grandeur of the conflict,since the adversaries are sky and city, and it suggests that the city is doomed,since it is being engulfed; (3) on the symbolic level, the word engulfingstrikes the keynote for the tie to Atlantis, suggesting the act of sinking and,by connotation, blending the motion of the fog with the motion of waves; (4) onthe emotional level, the use of so quiet a verb as to wrap in the context of anominous, engulfing conflict establishes a mood of quiet, desolate hopelessness.“She could see the whole of Manhattan Island, a long, triangular shape cuttinginto an invisible ocean.” This sentence is a literal, realistic description—butby the words “cutting into an invisible ocean,” I prepare the way for thecomparison in the next sentence, I mention the word ocean as another link toAtlantis, and the fact that it is an invisible ocean does two things: conveysthe density of the actual fog and suggests the symbolic, legendary meaning.“It looked like the prow of a sinking ship; a few tall buildings still roseabove it, like funnels, but the rest was disappearing under gray-blue coils,going down slowly into vapor and space.” Here I allow my purpose to come outinto the open, but since it is prepared for, it reads like a legitimate,unforced description of a view. Yet it accomplishes the following: (1) on theliteral level, a good description of the view of New York, since it is specificenough to be sensuously real; (2) on the connotative level, “a few tallbuildings still rose above it” suggests the heroic, the few lone fightersholding out against that to which all the lesser elements have succumbed; (3) onthe symbolic level, the tie between a “sinking” ship and a sinking city isobvious; “disappearing under gray-blue coils” applies equally to coils of fog orto the waves of an ocean; “going down slowly into vapor and space” is myintegration of all four levels, slanted just enough to make the reader noticeit: the word vapor still ties the sentence to the literal description of thefog, but the thought of “going down slowly into space” cannot actually apply tothe view nor to a sinking ship, it applies to the destruction of New York and toAtlantis, that is, to the vanishing of greatness, of the ideal; (4) theemotional mood is obvious.“This was how they had gone—she thought—Atlantis, the city that sank into theocean, and all the other kingdoms that vanished, leaving the same legend in allthe languages of men, and the same longing.” This is the conclusion of thedescription, the “cashing-in” sentence; it is not brought in arbitrarily, butsums up the meaning of the elements which the reader has been given in thepreceding three sentences, to form, in effect, the following impression in thereader’s mind: “Yes, I see why she would feel that way.”The above are merely the main considerations that went into the writing of thisparagraph. There were many, many other considerations directing the choice andplacement of every single word; it would take pages to list them all.As an example, let us take the last sentence and try to rewrite it. Suppose Ichanged it to: “This is how Atlantis had gone, she thought.” This would havebeen jarring and artificial, since it would have picked up Dagny’s thoughts tooconveniently and directly on the subject of Atlantis, in the form of a full, patsentence. The words with which I actually begin the sentence, “This was how theyhad gone—she thought,” serve as a bridge from the description of the view tointrospection, to Dagny’s thoughts—and suggest that the thought of Atlantis cameto her suddenly, involuntarily, by emotional association rather than byconscious deliberation.Suppose I reduced that sentence to a mere mention of Atlantis and of nothingelse. This would have left the real meaning of the whole paragraph toimplication—a vague, optional implication which the reader would not necessarilynotice. By saying “and all the other kingdoms that vanished,” I made my mainpurpose explicitly clear: that the paragraph refers to that lost ideal whichmankind had always been pursuing, struggling for, seeking and never finding.Suppose I had ended the sentence on “leaving the same legend in all thelanguages of men.” This would have made it merely a thought of an historicalnature, with no emotional meaning for Dagny and no indication of the emotionalcause that brought this particular thought to her mind. The interpretation ofher emotional reaction would then have been left at the mercy of any particularreader’s subjective inclinations: it could have been sadness, fear, anger,hopelessness, or nothing in particular. By adding the words “and the samelonging,” I indicated her specific mood and the essence of her emotionalreaction to her present situation in the world: a desperate longing for an idealthat has become unattainable.Suppose I rewrote the end of the sentence in a different order, thus: “and allthe other kingdoms that vanished, leaving the same legend and the same longingin all the languages of men.” This would have placed the emphasis on theuniversality of the quest for the ideal, on the fact that it is shared by allmankind. But what I wanted to emphasize was the quest for the ideal, not itsuniversality; therefore, the words “and the same longing” had to be featured,had to come last, almost as a painfully reluctant confession and a climax.No, I do not expect the reader of that paragraph to grasp consciously all thespecific considerations listed above. I expect him to get a general impression,an emotional sum—the particular sum I intended. A reader has to be concernedonly with the end result; unless he chooses to analyze it, he does not have toknow by what means that result was achieved—but it is my job to know.No, I did not calculate all this by a conscious process of thought while writingthat paragraph. I will not attempt here to explain the whole psychologicalcomplexity of the process of writing; I will merely indicate its essence: itconsists of giving one’s subconscious the right orders in advance, or of settingthe right premises. One must hold all the basic elements of the book’s theme,plot, and main characters so firmly in one’s mind that they become automatic andalmost “instinctual.” Then, as one approaches the actual writing of any givenscene or paragraph, one has a sense or “feel” of what it has to be by the logicof the context—and one’s subconscious makes the right selections to express it.Later, one checks and improves the result by means of conscious editing.FROM ONE LONELY NIGHT BY MICKEY SPILLANENobody ever walked across the bridge, not on a night like this. The rain wasmisty enough to be almost fog-like, a cold gray curtain that separated me fromthe pale ovals of white that were faces locked behind the steamed-up windows ofthe cars that hissed by. Even the brilliance that was Manhattan by night wasreduced to a few sleepy, yellow lights off in the distance.Some place over there I had left my car and started walking, burying my head inthe collar of my raincoat, with the night pulled in around me like a blanket. Iwalked and I smoked and I flipped the spent butts ahead of me and watched themarch to the pavement and fizzle out with one last wink. If there was life behindthe windows of the buildings on either side of me, I didn’t notice it. Thestreet was mine, all mine. They gave it to me gladly and wondered why I wantedit so nice and all alone.This is Romantic writing: the author selects the essentials (and does so verywell).For instance, when a man is walking alone in the rain, there are a great manysights around him: wet pavements, streetlights, tin cans, garbage pails. Butwhat is most typical of the setting the author wants to establish? The faces inthe cars—“the pale ovals of white that were faces locked behind the steamed-upwindows of the cars that hissed by.” Where a lesser writer would have saidmerely “the faces,” Spillane describes the way they would actually be seen; itis exactly what those faces would look like under the circumstances: “pale ovalsof white.” The words “locked behind the steamed-up windows” are very artistic:that would be one’s impression of faces going by in small compartments. Usingthe word locked rather than some conventional word like visible is an economicalway of projecting the exact description. And “the cars that hissed by” conveyswhat cars sound like on wet pavement.I have always wanted to throw this particular description in the faces of thecritics who attack Spillane, because it reveals real literary talent.Unfortunately, he does not always live up to it; he has some sloppy passages inhis writing. But you judge a person’s literary talent as you judge hisintelligence: by what he has demonstrated as his best potential. If he can dothis, he could bring all of his writing up to the same standard.In the next paragraph, “burying my head in the collar of my raincoat, with thenight pulled in around me like a blanket” is again a colorful description.Spillane names the essentials and gives the reader a feel of what it is like towalk with a raised collar on a foggy night.The next sentence is the best: “I walked and I smoked and I flipped the spentbutts ahead of me and watched them arch to the pavement and fizzle out with onelast wink.” This accomplishes two things: it indicates the character of the manwalking and it conveys the exact description. The phrase “arch to the pavement”achieves its effect through great economy and precision. Spillane could havesaid that the butts “fell in an arched line” or merely “fell”; instead, heselects one verb that describes exactly how they fell (it is a slightlymanufactured verb, but legitimate in the context). And the “last wink” is hisbest touch: that one last spark sets the mood of the whole scene.From this point on, Spillane lets his standard slip.“If there was life behind the windows of the buildings on either side of me, Ididn’t notice it.” Although adequate, this is an easier, less distinguished wayof describing something.What is very bad is the grammatical error of saying “why I wanted it so nice andall alone.” The colloquial style is proper, particularly in a story written inthe first person; but it is not proper to use colloquialism in the form of crudegrammar.For instance, the sentence “I walked and I smoked and I flipped the spent butts”is colloquial, yet of high literary quality; it is said simply, in a tone whichthis type of character would use, but there is great artistic care behind it. Bycontrast, “why I wanted it so nice and all alone” is not a clear sentence. It isthe kind of sentence a writer might get away with by his tone of voice if he isdictating, but it does not work on paper. It is off-focus; one sort of knowswhat it means, but only sort of; and after the precision and economy of thepreceding, it is particularly out of key.Such carelessness in combination with the better writing is unfortunatelycharacteristic of Spillane. The lesson is: No matter how much talent you have,if you let your focus slip on any sentence or paragraph, it will show in aslacking of your workmanship. So focus equally on every part of your writing,whether it is the key paragraph or the little transition paragraph. Not all ofthem have to be equally brilliant or significant, but they all have to bewritten with the same care.FROM THE WEB AND THE ROCK BY THOMAS WOLFEThat hour, that moment, and that place struck with a peerless coincision uponthe very heart of his own youth, the crest and zenith of his own desire. Thecity had never seemed as beautiful as it looked that night. For the first timehe saw that New York was supremely, among the cities of the world, the city ofthe night. There had been achieved here a loveliness that was astounding andincomparable, a kind of modem beauty, inherent to its place and time, that noother place nor time could match. He realized suddenly that the beauty of othercities of the night—of Paris spread below one from the butte of Sacré Coeur, inits vast, mysterious geography of lights, fumed here and there by drowsy,sensual, and mysterious blossoms of nocturnal radiance; of London with its smokynimbus of fogged light, which was so peculiarly thrilling because it was sovast, so lost in the illimitable—had each its special quality, so lovely andmysterious, but had yet produced no beauty that could equal this.The city blazed there in his vision in the frame of night, and for the firsttime his vision phrased it as it had never done before. It was a cruel city, butit was a lovely one; a savage city, yet it had such tenderness; a bitter, harsh,and violent catacomb of stone and steel and tunneled rock, slashed savagely withlight, and roaring, fighting a constant ceaseless warfare of men and ofmachinery; and yet it was so sweetly and so delicately pulsed, as full ofwarmth, of passion, and of love, as it was full of hate.This is as subjective a description as one could put on paper: it is allestimates, and the reader is never told what the author is estimating.Imagine that Wolfe is talking about a view not of a city, but of a plain atnight. “The plains of New Jersey were incomparable to the plains of Brittany orNormandy.” He could use the same description, with the same adjectives andemotions, since the reader is never told why he is saying any of these things.Wolfe does not offer a single concrete to differentiate New York from anythingelse.The author here cannot distinguish between object and subject, between the sightof New York and what that sight makes him feel. He projects his feeling as if itwere a description of the city—as if he has said something about New York bysaying that New York makes him feel that it is lovely. But this “lovely” is anestimate based on something. He has not told the reader what.When one examines the particular things he states, there is a whole series ofunanswered whys.“The city had never seemed as beautiful as it looked that night.” He never sayswhy. “For the first time he saw that New York was supremely, among the cities ofthe world, the city of the night.” He does not say why, or what a city of thenight is, as distinguished from a city of the day. ”There had been achieved herea loveliness that was astounding and incomparable“—why?—“a kind of modernbeauty, inherent to its place and time, that no other place nor time couldmatch.” What is “modem beauty”? “He realized suddenly that the beauty of othercities of the night”—why are Paris and London cities of the night?—“had each itsspecial quality, so lovely and mysterious.” He does not say what specialqualities, or what is lovely and mysterious about them. Instead, he gives thereader two interchangeable generalities about Paris and London: “vast,mysterious geography of lights, fumed here and there by drowsy, sensual, andmysterious blossoms of nocturnal radiance” and “smoky nimbus of fogged light,which was so peculiarly thrilling because it was so vast, so lost in theillimitable.” Is there any specific difference between the two? None.One can guess from the names of New York, Paris, and London, and from the words“modern beauty,” that Wolfe saw some difference between a city of skyscrapersand cities of older monuments. Had he contrasted the lights and angularstructures of skyscrapers to ancient domes and the spires of churches, thiswould have given meaning to what he is implying. He must have seen somethingthat made him call one city modern and the others not, and also some differencebetween Paris and London. But he did not identify it even to himself, let aloneto the reader. All he focused on was that the three sights made him feeldifferently.One cannot convey an emotion as such; one can convey it only through that whichproduced it, or through a conclusion drawn from the emotion. Here the authordoes try to project an emotion as such—and what is the result? “Blossoms ofnocturnal radiance,” which is neither emotion, thought, nor description, butmerely words.Now observe the words “Paris spread below one from the butte of Sacré Cœur.”Given the absence of any specific description, this reference presupposes thatthe reader has been to Paris, stood on this elevation, and seen this sight. Toexpect that kind of knowledge from the reader is to step outside the confines ofobjectivity; the reader has to learn the concretes of the story from what theauthor writes. This kind of reference actually implies: “I’m a cosmopolitantraveler and I know the sight, and if you local yokels don’t, that’s yourfault.” I doubt that this was Wolfe’s intention, but such is always theimplication of any dropping of foreign or scientific allusions which presupposespecial knowledge on the reader’s part.Do not mention any landmark unless you describe it for the benefit of theuninitiated; otherwise, it is merely a label stuck on your luggage to impressyour friends. Even if you write about New York, do not merely say “the EmpireState Building rising above the skyline.” For the benefit of those who have notseen New York, give a brief description first of the shape of the Empire StateBuilding. If you then want to use the actual name, it will be proper. But it isnever proper merely to sling names.Now observe, in the second paragraph, a peculiar sentence which supports mystatement that Wolfe does not distinguish between object and subject: “The cityblazed there in his vision in the frame of night, and for the first time hisvision phrased it as it had never done before.” A vision cannot phrase anything.Wolfe believes that his vision is providing him with all his estimates—that themere sight of a city can tell him that the city is cruel and lovely, full oflove and of hate. That is not possible.What is missing here is why and how he saw all of this. He should have given aspecific description to make the reader conclude that it is a cruel, savagecity, etc.—if this estimate is based on Wolfe’s vision of this particular night.Or, if the estimate is based on memory or on his knowledge of the city, heshould similarly have shown why he was drawn to make the estimate at this timeand in connection with this view.The following description is too wide: “a bitter, harsh, and violent catacomb ofstone and steel and tunneled rock, slashed savagely with light. ” To say aboutsomething that “it’s stone, steel, and tunneled rock” might be an effectivesummary if some particulars are given. Left by itself, it is too easy, by whichI mean “too generalized.”The last of this sentence is ridiculous: “it was so sweetly and so delicatelypulsed”—if by “pulse” he means the noise or vibrations, what can be sweet ordelicate about the pulse of a city?—“as full of warmth, of passion, and of love,as it was full of hate.” This sounds like a bad politician slinging immensegeneralities with no content.This whole passage is the archetype of floating abstractions, and of adescription which describes nothing.NATURALISTIC DESCRIPTIONThe essence of Naturalistic description is cataloguing. Take the description ofa doctor’s office in the first chapter of Sinclair Lewis’s Arrowsmith,particularly the following description of the doctor’s sink:“The most unsanitary comer was devoted to the cast-iron sink, which was oftenerused for washing eggy breakfast plates than for sterilizing instruments. On itsledge were a broken test-tube, a broken fishhook, an unlabeled and forgottenbottle of pills, a nail-bristling heel, a frayed cigar-butt, and a rusty lancetstuck in a potato.”This catalogue would give one a clear description if one were a mover and had topack those things. But it does not jell into an overall impression of what kindof place the office was.In Dodsworth, Lewis has an account of Dodsworth’s impression of an Englishtrain:“And the strangeness of having framed pictures of scenery behind the seats; ofhaving hand straps—the embroidered silk covering so rough to the finger-tips,the leather inside so smooth and cool—beside the doors. And the greaterstrangeness of admitting that these seats were more comfortable than the flintyPullman chairs of America.”These are observant concretes of the kind a returning traveler would tell hisfriends about. But they are not an artistic description of the essence of anEnglish train compartment.A Naturalistic writer may sometimes have a good description. Tolstoy, thearchetype of a Naturalist, often has very eloquent ones. But to the extent towhich they are good, they are done by the Romantic method—i.e., by means ofcarefully selected, well-observed concretes that capture the essentials of ascene.ANALYSIS OF “A LETTER ON STYLE” BY SINCLAIR LEWISI suspect that no competent and adequately trained writer ever, after hisapprenticeship, uses the word “style” in regard to his own work. If he did, hewould become so self-conscious that he would be quite unable to write. He may—ifI myself am normal he certainly does—consider specific problems of “style.” Hemay say, “That sentence hasn’t the right swing,” or “That speech is toohighfalutin’ for a plain chap like this character,” or “That sentence isbanal—got it from that idiotic editorial I was reading yesterday.” The genericconcept of “style,” as something apart from, distinguishable from, the matter,the thought, the story, does not come to his mind.He writes as God lets him. He writes—if he is good enough!—as Tilden playstennis or as Dempsey fights, which is to say, he throws himself into it withnever a moment of the dilettante’s sitting back and watching himself perform.This whole question of style vs. matter, of elegant style vs. vulgar, ofsimplicity vs. embroidering, is as metaphysical and vain as the outmoded (and Isuspect the word “outmoded” is a signal of “bad style”) discussions of Body andSoul and Mind. Of such metaphysics, we have had enough. Today, east and north ofKansas City, Kansas, we do not writhe in such fantasies. We cannot see thatthere is any distinction between Soul and Mind. And we believe that we know thatwith a sick Soul-Mind, we shall have a sick Body; and that with a sick Body, theMind-Soul cannot be sane. And, still more, we are weary of even such aclarification of that metaphysics. We do not, mostly, talk of Body generically,but say, prosaically, “My liver’s bad and so I feel cross.”So is it with that outworn conception called “style.”“Style” is the manner in which a person expresses what he feels. It is dependenton two things: his ability to feel, and his possession, through reading orconversation, of a vocabulary adequate to express his feeling. Without adequatefeeling, which is a quality not to be learned in schools, and withoutvocabulary, which is a treasure less to be derived from exterior instructionthan from the inexplicable qualities of memory and good taste, he will have nostyle.There is probably more nonsense written regarding the anatomy of “style” thaneven the anatomies of virtue, sound government, and love. Instruction in“style,” like instruction in every other aspect of education, cannot be given toanyone who does not instinctively know it at the beginning.This is good style:John Smith meets James Brown on Main Street, Sauk Centre, Minnesota, andremarks, “Mornin’! Nice day!” It is not merely good style; it is perfect. Werehe to say, “Hey, youse,” or were he to say, “My dear neighbor, it refreshes thesoul to encounter you this daedal mom, when from yon hill the early sun itsbeams displays,” he would equally have bad style.And this is good style: In The Principles and Practice of Medicine by Osler andMcCrae, it stands:“Apart from dysentery of the Shiga type, the amoebic and terminal forms, thereis a variety of ulcerative colitis, sometimes of great severity, not uncommon inEngland and the United States.”And this to come is also good style, no better than the preceding and no worse,since each of them completely expresses its thought:A savage place! as holy and enchanted As e’er beneath a waning moon was hauntedBy woman wailing for her demon-lover!That I should write ever as absolutely as Coleridge, as Osler and McCrae, or asJack Smith at ease with Jim Brown, seems to me improbable. But at least I hopethat, like them, I shall ever be so absorbed in what I have to say that I shall,like them, write without for one moment stopping to say, “Is this good style?”4[rand_9781101137239_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-4] When Lewis says that no competent writer uses the word style in regard to hisown work, he means that a writer cannot think of a style when he works. This isproper advice; you must not aim self-consciously at a style while you areexpressing a thought. But it does not follow, as Lewis implies, that a writercannot ever hold in his mind a concept of style—that he cannot ever think ofstyle, or judge his own writing, or hold literary standards.Lewis says that a writer may “consider specific problems of ‘style.’ ” He maysay, “That sentence hasn’t the right swing,” or “That speech is toohighfalutin’,” or “That sentence is banal.” Lewis knows that these concretespertain to style. Why then does he refuse to recognize the general abstractionthat unites them? He in effect says: “I just work by rule of thumb. I somehowknow when a sentence hasn’t the right swing or when another sentence is banal;but I must not call it ‘style.’ ” Why not?The antiabstraction premise of his article is typical of a Naturalist. ANaturalist is concerned with concrete details and is reluctant ever to explain awider “why.” There are, he holds, no wider “whys.” Observe Lewis’s defiant,almost angry tone when he denies the necessity of being concerned with broadabstractions. He clearly had certain valid stylistic habits, which he couldidentify, but was militantly reluctant to do any further thinking oridentification. (His antiabstraction approach is one reason why he was oftenguilty of sloppy writing, and why he was never fully satisfied with his ownwork.)Lewis makes it appear that style is something precious, something too“literary,” and that he is simply throwing out an old-fashioned word—when he isin fact throwing out the whole abstraction of style, and all abstract standardsof writing. The author of Babbitt, the arch-satirist of the mediocre and vulgar,talks in this article like a Babbitt.He says that a writer writes “as God lets him.” He was not religious, so this isa humorous line—but what does it imply? That we do not know where writing comesfrom. He says that a writer writes “as Tilden plays tennis or as Dempsey fights,which is to say, he throws himself into it with never a moment of thedilettante’s sitting back and watching himself perform.” If you are critical ofyour own work—not in the process of writing, but before and after—that is notthe sign of the dilettante; it is the sign of the professional. Tilden andDempsey had to do an enormous amount of studying and practice before they couldthrow themselves into a match without any thought about their technique. Thecomparison is valid: you have to do all your practice and studying beforehand.But you cannot throw yourself into a ring, or a story, without thinking about itand simply act “as God lets you.” It was not God that made Dempsey aprizefighter.Lewis says: “ ‘Style’ is the manner in which a person expresses what he feels.It is dependent on two things: his ability to feel, and his possession, throughreading or conversation, of a vocabulary adequate to express his feeling.”Observe that he does not mention thinking; to him, feeling is a primary.“Without adequate feeling, which is a quality not to be learned in schools, andwithout vocabulary, which is a treasure less to be derived from exteriorinstruction than from the inexplicable qualities of memory and good taste, [awriter] will have no style” (emphasis added). According to Lewis, feelings areinexplicable; so is good taste; so is memory; so is the acquisition of avocabulary.“Instruction in ‘style,’ ” Lewis says, “like instruction in every other aspectof education, cannot be given to anyone who does not instinctively know it atthe beginning.” Again, he assumes that one’s capacity for any subject is innateand therefore cannot be acquired or taught. If a young writer went by thisadvice, he would be entering a career as a horse race, on a blind guess: “Do Ihave talent? Do I have memory? Do I have good taste?”—with none of these thingsto be explained or acquired.All the things Lewis takes as inexplicable and irreducible primaries are in factexplicable and acquirable. Your ability to feel is a function of your ability tothink, and thinking is volitional and can be learned. Your taste depends on yourpremises. Memory is a function of valuing; the hardest thing on earth is toremember something that is of no importance to you—for instance, forcingyourself to memorize by automatic rote. And you acquire a vocabulary simply bybeing convinced of the importance of words, so that you pay attention to theirshadings when you read or speak.When Lewis gives examples of good style, he says that these are good becauseeach sentence completely expresses its thought. This is correct; as I put it,good style is form following function.Clarity, however, is not the only important attribute of style. What constitutesthe heart of any style is the clarity of the thoughts a writer expresses—plusthe kind of thoughts he chooses to express. In the lines Lewis quotes fromColeridge, a vastly greater amount of information—of thought, emotion,connotation—is conveyed than in his medical quotation or in the “John Smithmeets James Brown” sentence. For a textbook, a legal document, or a synopsis,Lewis’s medical quotation is good style; for fiction, the same style would bemiserable—not because it is not clear, but because too little is said. With thesame amount of words, a fiction writer can say much more.A good style is one that conveys the most with the greatest economy of words. Ina textbook, the ideal is to communicate one line of thought or set of facts asclearly as possible. For a literary style, much more is necessary. A greatliterary style is one that combines five or more different meanings in one clearsentence (I do not mean ambiguity but the communication of different issues).Observe how many issues I cover in any one sentence in Atlas Shrugged, and onhow many levels. In this context, I want to repeat an eloquent compliment thatAlan Greenspan once gave me: he said that I do with words what Rachmaninoff doeswith music. Rachmaninoff’s compositions are complex; he combines so manyelements in his music that one has to stretch one’s mind to hear them all atonce. I always try to do the same in writing. (I am not here comparing degreesof talent, but merely pointing out the principle.)I never waste a sentence on saying: “John Smith meets James Brown.” That is tooeasy; it is playing the piano with one finger. Say much more, just asclearly—say it in chords, with a whole orchestration. That is good style."},{"pageContent":"10Particular Issues of StyleNARRATIVE VERSUS DRAMATIZATIONI use the word narrative in two senses. From the standpoint of form, narrativeis that which is not dialogue; everything said by the author, as opposed to thecharacters, is narrative (including the “he said” and “she said in a tremblingvoice” between the dialogue lines). From the standpoint of structure, however,narrative is that which is not dramatized.To dramatize something is to show it as if it were happening before the reader’seyes, so that he is in the position of an observer at the scene. To narrate, bycontrast, is to synopsize: you tell the reader about something which hashappened, but you do not let him be a witness. This is a legitimate device; infact, you could not write a novel without using narrative. If a story werepresented exclusively in terms of dramatic action, it would be a play.A silent action—an escape, say, from a burning building, with no dialogue—isdramatized if it is described in detail. Predominantly, however, the dramatizedscenes of a novel are those in which dialogue is reproduced.Conversely, dialogue usually occurs only in dramatized scenes, but there areexceptions. When you synopsize a conversation in narrative, you can quote asingle sentence to feature the essence of the conversation, or to sharpen somesalient point. A whole exchange of dialogue—four or more lines—constitutes adramatized scene. But the quotation, for emphasis, of just one line of dialoguein a narrative passage does not make the passage a dramatization.When is it proper to narrate and when to dramatize an event? There can be asmany variations as there are stories, but the one rule is: Always dramatizeimportant events.Dramatization serves as the emphasis of your story. The key events should bedramatized. The less important material, such as transitions, can be narrated.The beginning of the chapter “Account Overdrawn” in Atlas Shrugged is a montageof the progressive economic destruction of the country. In order to make thedescription colorful, I give semi-dramatization to particular details, but theoverall passage is merely a narrative of what happens during that winter to thewhole country. Then I come to the meeting where the board of directors decide toclose the John Galt Line. That is dramatized. In the preceding months, no eventwas important enough to focus the story on. But the closing of the John GaltLine is an important point in the story; therefore, I dramatize it—I reproducethe dialogue so that you, the reader, are present at that meeting.Many nineteenth-century novels, such as Quo Vadis and The Scarlet Letter, arewritten too much in straight narrative. (This is a minor flaw compared to theliterary values of these two works.) One good aspect of the old silent movie ofThe Scarlet Letter, starring Lillian Gish, was that it dramatized (in most casesquite well) important events that in the novel are merely told about.You must be careful and skillful when you combine dramatization and narrative.Sometimes an author presents a scene in detail, the dialogue is reproducedverbatim, and then there is a paragraph saying: “They argued in this manner lateinto the night, but reached no conclusion.” This is switching from dramatizationto narrative, summing up the ending of a scene in narrative form. Sometimes anauthor begins with detailed dialogue, then switches to narrative, then goes backto the dramatized scene. All of this is legitimate—but be careful of yourbalance. Be sure to narrate only that which is unimportant. In other words, besure that your highlights are dramatized.Do not start a scene in dialogue and then cover something more crucial innarrative. Suppose you reproduce the opening dialogue of a marital quarrel andthen you say: “They argued into the night, and finally she declared that shewould leave him.” This is bad writing. I do not mean that there is a rule aboutnever narrating a quarrel or a decision; it can be narrated if it is only anincidental development in the progress of the story. But if you stop on a sceneat all, if you bring the reader in to witness it, do not cheat him of thescene’s climax.There is another danger I want to warn you against.I once read a story by a beginner in which a father comes back from Europe tohis wife and little son after a long absence. The narrative says: “The boy wasfascinated by the sophisticated, cosmopolitan conversation of his father.” Thenthe dialogue says: “ ‘The English sure have a wonderful way of cooking beef,’said the father. ‘Yes,’ said the mother, ‘but on the other hand, I hear that theFrench restaurants are pretty good.’ ‘Well, I wouldn’t say so,’ answered thefather. ‘The French go more for sauces and trimmings, but for real beefsteak,give me English cooking.’ ”In the same category are the many stories, usually about a poet, where theauthor spends a lot of time in narrative telling the reader what a genius thatpoet is—and then he gives some samples which are dreadful.Never declare in narrative the opposite of what you illustrate in action ordialogue. Whenever you make estimates in narrative-whenever you announce thatyour character is brave or a genius or good or noble—be sure that the action anddialogue support your estimate. If you say that a man’s conversation issophisticated—show it. Otherwise, do not make the estimate.In general, it is inadvisable to make such estimates—and you can never countprimarily on your narrative to convey characterization. To show a man of genius,you have to show by his actions and words that that is what he is; to show abrave man, you have to give him some actions displaying courage. But there areinstances where it is necessary to summarize something in narrative. If so, besure that what is dramatized supports your estimate. The principle here is thatof assertion versus proof. Do not assert anything which you cannot prove.EXPOSITIONExposition is the communication of knowledge which the reader requires in orderto understand a scene. At the start of a story, it is the communication of whathas happened before the start. You can also have exposition during a story.After a time lapse, for instance, the reader might need to know what hashappened in the preceding year.The one rule about exposition is: Do not let it show. Exposition is like theseams in clothing: in a well-made garment, the seams are not glaring at you;they are skillfully hidden, yet they hold the garment together.By “Do not let your exposition show,” I mean: Do not devote any action or linemerely to explaining something. Make the exposition part of some statement whichhas a different point—a point necessary for the progress of the scene.For instance, do not have two characters talk about something that they bothknow. It is bad exposition to have a businessman say to his partner: “As youwell know, our bills are long overdue.” Instead, have him give instructions tohis new secretary about a letter to the bank, telling her: “We are in a hurrybecause our bills are overdue.”Whenever one character communicates something in dialogue to another, there mustbe a reason why the second character has to be told the information—a reasonrelated to the action of the scene. The communication should be part of somepurpose with which the scene is concerned, and all the necessary informationshould be conveyed in the discussion of that purpose.The best example of this in my own work is the scene between James Taggart andEddie Willers in the first chapter of Atlas Shrugged, where Eddie is urgingTaggart to do something about their Colorado branch line and Taggart is evading.If you read that scene, you will be surprised to see how much you arelearning—under the guise of their argument—about the overall situation ofTaggart Transcontinental.An example of bad exposition is the kind of old-fashioned play which opens withtwo servants talking onstage: “ ‘The master is away.’ ‘The pearls are in thesafe.’ ‘The mistress is entertaining a suspicious character on the veranda.’ ”Shortly thereafter, the pearls are stolen.Devoting a line to explaining something is sometimes proper. An example is theexposition right after the names of the various intellectuals at the party atRearden’s in Atlas Shrugged.“Bertram Scudder stood slouched against the bar. His long, thin face looked asif it had shrunk inward, with the exception of his mouth and eyeballs, whichwere left to protrude as three soft globes. He was the editor of a magazinecalled The Future and he had written an article on Hank Rearden, entitled ‘TheOctopus.’ ”This is a proper use of exposition since it is done in the nature of aparenthesis, without stopping the action.If you have a complex exposition to give, you will in the beginning be anxiousto give it all at once. It will seem to you that you have to tell the readereverything or he will not understand you. Do not be fooled by this; the storywill carry if you make just one point clear. A few sentences later, you divulgesomething else, and so on. Feed one bit of information at a time.There are no rules about where to feed information or at what tempo; you have togauge this by the general structure of your story. Some of the informationconveyed in the scene between Eddie Willers and James Taggart I could haveplanted in advance, by having Eddie worry about the Colorado branch line, orstop outside Taggart’s office to discuss something with an underling. But sinceI could impart all the necessary information in the major scene, it was betterto do so than to give the exposition special emphasis. Also, I had alreadyplanted enough ominous overtones to convey that something is going on whichdisturbs Eddie. I would have weakened the drama had I given the reader anyinkling of the specifics until he sees them in action, in the form of aconflict.The ingenuity you can exhibit in regard to exposition is unlimited. You can makean advantage out of a liability: instead of being burdened with your exposition,you can feed it at the points where it fits the narrative or the dialogue andmakes the scene more dramatic.But be careful to be objective. Do not rely on any knowledge which the readerdoes not yet have. You might deliberately make two characters talk for a whilein a mysterious way until you clarify what they are talking about; that islegitimate. But watch for when you have held the mystery—or withheld theinformation—for too long. Instead of being intriguing, a scene that isbewildering for too long becomes boring.FLASHBACKSA flashback is a scene taken from the past. It is a dramatized exposition.The story of Dagny and Francisco’s childhood in Atlas Shrugged is an example.Since their relationship in the novel is based on what happened in theirchildhood, I want the reader to know about this before he meets Francisco as acharacter. Had I merely summarized their childhood in a paragraph, that wouldhave been exposition. But since I wanted to cover their childhood in detail, Iliterally had to go back into the past, and that is a flashback.The only standard for when to use flashbacks is the importance of theinformation you want to convey. Incidental information you cover in narrative.If the information is important to the story, it is better to go into a detailedflashback.But do not burden a story with unnecessary flashbacks. If in every other chapteryou go into a flashback, you confuse the reader. Some writers have flashbackswithin flashbacks: they start with a middle-aged person in the present, thenshow a flashback from his youth, during which they show a flashback from hischildhood, then come back to the youth, then to the present. This can be gottenaway with, but it is not advisable.There is no rule that limits the length of a flashback in proportion to the restof the story. Suppose that the events of a story span several years and come toa conclusion in one last meeting between two characters. In order to focus thatmeeting, the author might first establish in a few lines the fact that thesecharacters are about to meet; then, in a long flashback, present everything thathappened in the past; and then, coming back to the present and the meeting,describe the conclusion in a final few lines. While reading the flashback, thereader waits for the story to reach the present again, anticipating thatsomething will happen at the promised meeting between the two characters. Andsince the proper focus has been established from the outset, the final linescome across much more forcefully than they would have done had the story beentold in chronological order.The suspense and heightened interest of such a structure depends on the reader’sunspoken assumption that the writer is rational and has a reason forconstructing his story this way. By contrast, a modem writer would start a storyas described above and never come back to the present; or he would come back,but then nothing significant would happen.It is legitimate now and then to remind the reader of the present during a longflashback—but only if you have a reason for it and you advance the story by thatmeans.The only rule for going into a flashback is to avoid confusing the reader. Markclearly when you go from the present to the past and when you go back to thepresent again. The simplest way is to say: “He remembered the time when ...” or“He thought of the days of his childhood.” This is not bromidic, because it isdirect. But there are more interesting ways of doing it.One of my best flashback transitions is the one to Dagny and Francisco’schildhood. She is walking to his hotel, and yet she is thinking that she shouldbe running:“She wondered why she felt that she wanted to run, that she should be running;no, not down this street; down a green hillside in the blazing sun to the roadon the edge of the Hudson, at the foot of the Taggart estate. That was the wayshe always ran when Eddie yelled, ‘It’s Frisco d’Anconia!’ and they both flewdown the hill to the car approaching on the road below.”Although the reader notices the transition, it comes naturally.Now consider the scene in Atlas Shrugged where James Taggart spills water on thetable before Cherryl starts thinking about the events of the past year.“ ‘Oh, for Christ’s sake!’ he screamed, smashing his fist down on the table.‘Where have you been all these years? What sort of world do you think you’reliving in?’ His blow had upset his water glass and the water went spreading indark stains over the lace of the tablecloth.”I do not have Cherryl go into the past by means of the spilled water, but I useit later to bring her back to the present:“What do you want of me?—she asked, looking at the whole long torture of hermarriage that had not lasted the full span of one year.“ ‘What do you want of me?’ she asked aloud—and saw that she was sitting at thetable in her dining room, looking at Jim, at his feverish face, and at a dryingstain of water on the table.”I planted the spilled water early in the scene in order to mention it later, asa touch pertaining to this particular dining room at this moment. Recognizing itas such, the reader knows that Cherryl is now back at dinner with James, whereshe was before she started thinking of the past. Had I not used the water, orsome equivalent device, it would not have been clear that Cherryl is now back inthe present; it might have seemed as if I were describing some other scene ofthe past year.A tricky transition is good when it is warranted by the material, so that itappears natural; but avoid artificial tricks that are planted only for thepurpose of the transition. For instance, the spilled water in the above scene islegitimate because it serves another purpose: to illustrate James’s bad temperand violence. Had I written a scene between a calm, polite, happy couple, andsuddenly, by sheer accident, the man spilled water because I later needed it asa signpost, that would have been artificial.TRANSITIONSA difficult problem that one usually does not think of until one comes upagainst it is how to take the action from one point to another—for instance, howto take a person out of a room and down to the street, or have him cross a roomto pick up something on the other side. On the stage, those small movements aretaken care of unobtrusively by the director, who has to plan them so that theyare unobtrusive. In a novel, they are the writer’s responsibility.When you write a scene, you must preserve the reality of the setting. Forinstance, you have said that the heroine is by the fireplace to the left of theroom and that some document is on a table to the right, and now she has to crossthe room and seize the document. If you do not mention that she walks across theroom, the reader will notice an inconsistency in the scene. But to mention itmight be a bad interruption.When you do not want to interrupt a scene with a technical reminder like that,“think outside the square.” Do not limit yourself to the dry assignment ofsaying, like a stage direction: “She crosses to the table.” Instead of saying“She rushed across the room and seized the document,” say something like “Herdress swished with the speed of her steps as she rushed across the room andseized the document.” Then the purpose of the sentence appears to be thedescription of the movement, which might tie in with the emotional violence ofthe scene (or whatever the mood is). But you have covered the point of takingthe heroine to the other side.In other words, when you need a “stage indication,” always tie it to someelement of the scene—any element other than the dry factual reminder. As withexposition, you bring in a transition when your focus is on something elsepertaining to the scene.Suppose you finish a scene played in a house and you have to take the heroineoutside. You need to give the reader some sense of transition, but you do notwant to describe the heroine going down the stairs. So start the next paragraphwith “The street looked lonely and deserted as she emerged from the house.”The following is an example from the first chapter of Atlas Shrugged. Dagny, whohas fallen asleep on a train, awakens and asks a passenger: “How long have webeen standing?” Then:“The man looked after her, sleepily astonished, because she leaped to her feetand rushed to the door.“There was a cold wind outside, and an empty stretch of land under an empty sky.She heard weeds rustling in the darkness. Far ahead, she saw the figures of menstanding by the engine—and above them, hanging detached in the sky, the redlight of a signal.”She is out already. I did not cover the technicalities of her opening the doorand rushing down the steps; I switched viewpoint.Do not say: “Six months later.” Instead, present your characters swimming at thebeach, and at the beginning of the next scene, say: “It was snowing heavily.”There are other such devices, but the principle is always: Don’t let your seamsshow. You cover the seams by connecting them to some other pertinent aspect ofthe scene. Do not, however, make your transitions so indirect that the result isawkward and forced. Then the seams will show more than ever.METAPHORSThe purpose of metaphors, or comparisons, is epistemological. If I describe aspread of snow and I say, “The snow was white like sugar,” the comparisonconveys a sensory focus on the whiteness of the snow. It is more colorful thanmerely saying “The snow was white.” If I describe sugar, I can do it in reverse:“The sugar in the bowl was white like snow.” This conveys a better impression ofthe sugar than if I merely said: “The sugar was white.”The operative principle here is that of abstraction. If you describe only oneobject, in concrete terms, it is difficult to convey a sensuous impression: youtell about the object, but you do not show it. The introduction of anotherconcrete with the same attribute makes the two together give a clear sensuousimage—it isolates the attribute by making the reader’s mind form an abstraction.The reader’s lightning-like visualization of the whiteness of snow and thewhiteness of sugar makes that whiteness stand out in his mind as if he had seenit.When you select a comparison, you must consider not only the exact attribute youwant to feature, but also the connotations that will be raised in the reader’smind. For instance, the old bromide “Her lips were like ripe cherries” was notbad when said the first time. Cherries connote something red, sensuous,glistening, and attractive. But suppose I said: “Her lips were like ripetomatoes.” Tomatoes are also red and shining, but the comparison soundsridiculous because the connotations are wrong. Ripe tomatoes make you think ofsomething squashy, of the kitchen, of an unappetizing salad. The thingsconnected with the concept of a vegetable are not romantic.If you want something to sound attractive, be sure to make your comparisonglamorous and attractive. If you want to destroy something, do the opposite.An example of the latter is the undignified comparison in my description ofEllsworth Toohey in The Fountainhead: his ears “flared out in solitarynakedness, like the handles of a bouillon cup.” It would be bad writing to say“His ears stuck out like wings,” because the attribute described isunattractive, but a comparison to wings suggests something soaring andattractive. To bring connotations of something good into a derogatorydescription is the opposite mistake of comparing the lips of a beautiful womanto ripe tomatoes.It is by means of the connotations of your comparisons that you can do the bestobjective slanted writing. By “objective,” I mean that the reader’s mind drawsthe conclusion—it is not you, the writer, who calls his attention to the factthat a certain person is ugly or undignified. To be objective, you have to show,not tell. You do it by selecting the connotations of your comparisons.You can do the same with simple adjectives, which have definite connotations orshades of meaning. “The man was tall and slender” is an attractive description,whereas “He was tall, lanky, and gawky” is not. In description by means ofcomparisons, the field of selection is much wider, but the identical principleapplies. You can describe the same quality as attractive or not according towhat metaphors you use.As a smaller matter, do not overload a paragraph with metaphors. Instead ofmaking the description more colorful, this blunts the perception of the reader.He is lost among so many concretes out of different categories that they ceaseto work on him, and he has no impression left in his mind. It is like showingtoo many pictures too fast.Above all, avoid two metaphors to describe the same thing. Sometimes, two cleverimages might occur to you to describe an object. You have to be ruthless andselect the one you think is better. A repetition is always weakening; it has theeffect of projecting the author’s doubt, his uncertainty that the firstdescription is good enough.DESCRIPTIONSI describe my characters at their first appearance. Since I want the reader toperceive the scene as if he were there, I indicate as soon as possible what thecharacters look like.Sometimes I depart from this deliberately. In Atlas Shrugged, Wesley Mouch isnot described in his introductory scene; I give him a few insipid lines andnothing more. The next time he is mentioned, as the new economic dictator of thecountry, I cash in on the fact that the reader, if he remembers him at all,remembers a total nonentity.But my heroes and heroines I always describe at their introduction.I decide how long a description should be by the nature of the buildup—by howmuch significance the context has prepared the reader to attach to a character.In Atlas Shrugged, I prepare James Taggart’s description in the followingmanner. Eddie Willers has been thinking about the oak tree in his childhood andabout his shock upon discovering that it was only the shell of its formerstrength. Then he comes to the Taggart building, and I describe that he feelsthe same about this building as he used to feel about the oak. And then he walksinto the heart of the building, into the office of the president:“James Taggart sat at his desk. He looked like a man approaching fifty, who hadcrossed into age from adolescence, without the intermediate stage of youth. Hehad a small, petulant mouth, and thin hair clinging to a bald forehead. Hisposture had a limp, decentralized sloppiness, as if in defiance of his tall,slender body, a body with an elegance of line intended for the confident poiseof an aristocrat, but transformed into the gawkiness of a lout. The flesh of hisface was pale and soft. His eyes were pale and veiled, with a glance that movedslowly, never quite stopping, gliding off and past things in eternal resentmentof their existence. He looked obstinate and drained. He was thirty-nine yearsold.”I have warned the reader that Eddie Willers is inclined to rely on strength longafter it is gone, and that he thinks of the Taggart building as a powerful oak.Then I tell the reader about the gray dust at the heart of this oak.Because of the buildup, the reader is willing to read the description withoutimpatience. Also, when he meets the president of a big railroad and sees aneurotic nonentity, this has some significance. If the president were aconventional man, one could not pause on a long description. But when anobviously vicious man is in charge of an organization that has just been builtup as very impressive, a lengthy description is warranted.My longest description of a character in any of my novels is that of John Gaitat the beginning of Part III of Atlas Shrugged. Having spent two parts of thebook hearing about this man—and having just seen the heroine crash in anairplane, pursuing him—the reader is willing to read in detail what he lookslike (provided the description makes it worthwhile).When I introduce minor characters, I usually give them a single line namingsomething that is characteristic of the type, like “a woman who had largediamond earrings” or “a portly man who wore a green muffler.” By implying thatone brief characteristic is all that is noteworthy about the person, I establishhis unimportance. These lesser types you must not pause on for long.I recently reread Ivanhoe, which I had not read since age twelve. It is amarvelous story, but I mention it here because the first thirteen pages of myedition are devoted to a description of four characters, only one of whom is aprincipal—and it is not even a description of their faces or personalities, butof their clothes, the harnesses of their horses, and the weapons of theirretinues. To include thirteen pages of such descriptions, without any actionhaving yet started and without the reader having been given any reason to beinterested in the characters, is very unbalanced.Never pause on descriptions, whether of characters or locales or anything else,unless you have given the reader reason to be interested.DIALOGUEEven when you select dialogue you think is in style with the class, education,and character of a certain person, your own style plays an enormous role.Sinclair Lewis thinks that a small-town man would say “Mornin’! Nice day!” [seep. 140]. This is Lewis stylizing dialogue in the bad folks-next-door way. If Iwere to project a small-town man, I would have him say “Good morning” (orperhaps even “Hey, you” if it fitted the particular character and relationship).You do not make an illiterate ruffian talk in abstract, academic terms. Butwhether you select the kind of vulgar sentences which represent the essentialstyle of his character, or the narrow, local colloquialisms of his day, dependson your own style. (If you compare the illiterate talk of villains or ruffiansin a Romantic and a Naturalistic novel, you will see the difference.)Even in dialogue, your own style rules your selection. Do not give yourself ablank check of this kind: “I’ll merely reproduce what I think a character likeso-and-so would say.” You have to reproduce it in the way your literary premisesdictate. Do not attempt to be a Romantic writer, then give your charactersNaturalistic dialogue—and, if criticized, say: “Oh, but I heard them talk atKlein’s [department store] just like that.” You have to reproduce the way womentalk at Klein’s according to your own style.I do not mean that you should make all your characters talk in the same way, ortalk like yourself. You have to make them talk differently according to theirparticular characterizations. But the overall style and selectivity of thedialogue must be yours.SLANGIf you are writing in the first person and the narrator is supposed to talkcolloquially, it is colorful to use slang (the best example is Mickey Spillane).But do not use slang in straight narrative.There are, however, slang words which are (or are becoming) part of thelanguage, and in those cases you have to exercise your judgment. The slang wordsthat eventually find general acceptance are those for which there is nolegitimate equivalent. Some slang words are created precisely to fill alinguistic need. When no respectable English word will give you the exact shadeof meaning you want, it is legitimate to use a slang word, provided it has beenin circulation for some time and is generally known.The slang which changes every year is the kind that is used for some purposeother than the communication of meaning. It is always a local affectation—somecollege or Midwestern expression which is not needed and is repeated strictlybecause it is an affectation. This kind vanishes; a year later, nobody knowswhat the expression means. Do not use such words unless you are writing somejournalistic story of the split second and you intend it to be dead within ayear.The use of slang in dialogue depends on the character speaking. For instance,you can use the word swanky in the dialogue of a certain type of person. Theword has been used for years and remains in the language. But never use it innarrative, since there is a formal equivalent. (The slang of the split secondshould not be used even as characterization. It is too perishable and phony.)Similarly, in regard to swear words and words of insult, you have to judgewhether or not a character would speak that kind of language.Incidentally, there is no word in English to denote a worthless man, except forbastard. Scoundrel, blackguard, and rotter are more British than American; andpeople never use them; they are antiquated and literary. I think this is onereason why bastard became formal English (it is no longer an obscenity and doesnot involve illegitimate birth, although that is the root of the word). Thelanguage did not have a word to express a negative value judgment on a man.In Russian, I can think of ten or twelve words on the order of the Englishbastard; and there is even more polite usage: words that can be used in adrawing room—all of them expressions of contempt for a man’s moral character.This is a significant indication of the opposite metaphysics and morality of thetwo languages.The number of words to express human evil is much greater in other languagesthan in English. For that fact, I give great credit to America.OBSCENITIESDo not use obscenities—and never mind all the arguments about “realism.”Obscenities are language which implies a value judgment of condemnation orcontempt, usually in regard to certain parts of the body and sex. Four-letterwords all have non-obscene synonyms; they are obscene not by content, but bytheir intention—the intention being to convey that what is referred to isimproper or evil.Obscene language is based on the metaphysics and morality of the anti-bodyschool of thought. Observe that the more religious a nation is, the more variedand violently obscene is its four-letter-word repertoire. It is said that theSpanish are the most obscene. I do not know Spanish, but I know that Russianshave a whole sublanguage—not just single words, but ready-made sentences—all ofit concerning sex. (I myself know only a few examples.)Obscene language is not an objective language which you can use to express yourown value judgments. It is a language of prefabricated value judgmentsconsisting of the denunciation of sex and this earth and conveying that theseare low or damnable. You do not want to subscribe to this premise.If you write about slum inhabitants or men in the army, you have a difficultliterary problem. Modern writers specialize in conveying that men in the armytalk in nothing but four-letter words. That I do not believe, but I have heardmen of that sort use obscene words under stress. If you have to establish suchan atmosphere, a few “darns” or “damns” will not quite do it. It is not,however, necessary to use prefabricated language for the sake of “realism.”The trick is to suggest by the context of what is being said that it is abusiveor obscene. Do not use the actual terms. Avoid them on the principle by whichyou would avoid describing horrible operations or ghastly physical illnesses.You may suggest these if you want a description of horror—but you do not go intoevery detail of the color of an infected wound or the maggots on a dead body.If you are ever tempted to describe something ghastly, ask yourself what yourpurpose is. If it is to suggest horror, one or two generalized lines will do. Itis sufficient to say that someone stumbles upon a half-decomposed corpse; todescribe that corpse in every horrible detail is horror for horror’s sake. Allyou will achieve is that your book, no matter what the rest of it consists of,will always connote in the reader’s mind that particular touch of horror.FOREIGN WORDSDo not use foreign words in narrative to show your erudition. Phonies like tostud their conversation with foreign words. If you do that in narrative, you,the author, will sound like a phony.The same applies to dialogue. If you are characterizing a phony, it islegitimate to have him use foreign words occasionally. I did that with GuyFrancon in The Fountainhead. But do not insert foreign words in the dialogue ofcharacters if the story is laid in a foreign country, as many bad television andmovie writers do. For instance, a story is laid in Germany; the characters arespeaking in English, under the assumption that in fact they are speaking inGerman; and suddenly they utter words like liebchen in the middle of an Englishdialogue which is supposed to be German anyway. This has the same effect as theone achieved for Guy Francon, who would suddenly use French words to show thathe could speak French—the effect of the author showing off that he knows a fewGerman words or has just looked them up in the dictionary.Sometimes a foreign character [who is actually supposed to be speaking inEnglish] might mispronounce words or have a slightly Germanic way of sentenceconstruction. Some foreigners have a characteristic way of talking if they donot know English well. It is legitimate to convey that, provided you devise yourown means of doing it, instead of merely using a bromidic shorthand as asubstitute for characterization, and provided you present the character’sparticular grammatical structure, rather than just the mispronunciation.JOURNALISTIC REFERENCESBy “journalistic references,” I mean the names of living authors, politicalfigures, song hits—any proper names which pertain concretely to a given period.The rule is: Do not use anything of this nature more recent than a hundredyears. Anything that has survived for a long time becomes an abstraction, butthe fame of the moment is too temporary to include in a story which deals withessentials, not with particular details.It is all right to use Chopin, but not any contemporary composers, artists, orwriters. Even if you are convinced that some contemporary writer is going to beimmortal, he will in your story project something too much of the moment. Avoidthe names of actual restaurants (which modem Naturalists love to use). You donot want to have your big scene laid in the restaurant that closed last week.Especially bad are references to political issues. Nothing is as old asyesterday’s newspaper, and the issues that are big today are barely rememberedtwo years later. Avoid names like “McCarthy,” “Hoover,” or “Truman.” They areincluded in most modern writing; read it five years later—it is more dated thanladies’ fashions.(If for some reason you do use something of today, explain what it is, ratherthan rely on the immediate journalistic context in the reader’s mind. That willgive the reference a certain feeling of distance and abstraction.)Every writer, including me, has sometimes been guilty of using journalisticreferences. In The Fountainhead, I should not have described the devil as “acorner lout sipping a bottle of Coca-Cola,” and I also regret Coty’s powderpuffs on Toohey’s dressing gown:“Ellsworth Toohey sat spread out on a couch, wearing a dressing gown.... Thedressing gown was made of silk bearing the trademarked pattern of Coty’s facepowder, white puffs on an orange background; it looked daring and gay, supremelyelegant through sheer silliness.”There was in fact that kind of material on the market. Today, I would ratherhave invented some perfume company that used not a powder puff, but somethingelse.In my original manuscript of The Fountainhead, I had references to Nazism andcommunism, and even to Hitler and Stalin. [Novelist and political writer] IsabelPaterson, to whom I showed the abstract speeches before the book was published,said to me: “Do not use those narrow political terms, because the theme of yourbook is wider than the politics of the moment. Granted that the book is directedagainst fascism and communism, you are really writing about collectivism—anypast, present, or future form of it. Do not narrow your subject down to theparticular figures of the moment.”I had to think this over for two days before I absorbed the idea; I was so usedto the other method that it took quite an effort to cut out those journalisticreferences. But it was one of the most valuable pieces of advice I ever got inregard to writing. Imagine reading The Fountainhead today with references toHitler and Stalin—it would not be the same novel.You have to be guided by your theme and by how abstract a level you are writingon. In We the Living, I had a lot of journalistic references: specific dates,the Lenin-Trotsky split, and so forth. But that novel deals specifically withthe politics of a certain period, so there such references were legitimate. Whenyou deal with history, you obviously mention the concretes of the period.In Atlas Shrugged, I hardly mentioned anybody younger than Plato and Aristotle.More recent references were proper in The Fountainhead because the fight formodem architecture occurred in a specific historical period. But Atlas Shruggedis of no period and therefore had to be kept the most abstract."},{"pageContent":"11Special Forms of LiteratureHUMORHumor is a metaphysical negation. We regard as funny that which contradictsreality: the incongruous and the grotesque.Take the crudest example of humor: a dignified gentleman in top hat and tailswalks down the street, slips on a banana peel, and falls down in a ludicrousposition. Why is this supposed to be amusing? Because of the incongruity: if adignified man falls down over a stupid object like a banana peel, it establisheshim as contradictory to and unfit to deal with reality. That is what one laughsat.In another bromide of two-reel comedies, a man comes home while his wife isentertaining a lover. Hiding the lover in a closet, the wife then tries to keepher husband from opening it: he wants to hang up his coat and she prevents him,etc. Why is this supposed to be funny? Because you (the audience) and the womanknow the truth of the situation. You are in control of reality; the husband isnot. That is the essence of humor.Observe that man is the only being who can laugh. There is no such thing as alaughing animal. Only man has a volitional consciousness, and thus a choicebetween that which he regards as serious and that which he does not. Only manhas the power to identify: This is reality—and this is a contradiction ofreality. An animal does not have the concept contradiction (or even the conceptreality, except by implication); it cannot grasp the issue of being volitionallyunfit for reality. But a man can find other men ludicrous if they indulge incontradictions. Why? Because they have the choice of being consistent or not.Their contradictions are sometimes tragic; the smaller ones are funny.What you find funny depends on what you want to negate. It is proper to laugh atevil (the literary form of which is satire) or at the negligible. But to laughat the good is vicious. If you laugh at any value that suddenly shows feet ofclay, such as in the example of the dignified gentleman slipping on a bananapeel, you are laughing at the validity of values as such. On the other hand, ifa pompous villain walks down the street—a man whose established attributes arenot dignity, hut pretentiousness and stuffiness—you may properly laugh if hefalls down because what is then being negated is a pretense, not an actualvalue.Observe that some people have a good-natured sense of humor, and others amalicious one. Good-natured, charming humor is never directed at a value, butalways at the undesirable or negligible. It has the result of confirming values;if you laugh at the contradictory or pretentious, you are in that act confirmingthe real or valuable. Malicious humor, by contrast, is always aimed at somevalue. For instance, when someone laughs at something that is important to you,that is the undercutting of your value.The best statement of the difference between the two types of humor occurs inAtlas Shrugged when Dagny thinks of the opposite ways in which Francisco and Jimlaugh: “Francisco seemed to laugh at things because he saw something muchgreater. Jim laughed as if he wanted to let nothing remain great.”In this context, you can see why one of Ellsworth Toohey’s most evil lines inThe Fountainhead is his advice that “we must be able to laugh at everything,particularly at ourselves.” The fact that one hears that line so often is theworst symptom of our nonvalue age. When that line is repeated too often in asociety, it is a sign of the collapse of all values.Observe modem magazines when they do profiles on celebrities whom they supportor agree with: they always do it in a snide manner of laughing at the verypeople they are glamorizing. This style was once reserved for enemies; the presswould do a ridiculing article only on someone they disagreed with or wanted todenounce. Today, it is the accepted style for those whom they want to glorify.That is a devastating sign of the policy that says: “Permit nothing to havevalue.”To say that one does not take something seriously means: “Never mind, it’s notimportant, it doesn’t matter one way or another.” You can say that only aboutthe things you do not value. If you take nothing seriously, it means that youhave no values. If you have no values, then the first value, the base of all theothers—namely, your life—has no value for you.Let me give a few examples of the two types of humor.Jean Kerr, the author of Please Don’t Eat the Daisies, is a benevolent humorist.She is allegedly complaining about the hard lot of a mother and the difficultyof coping with children. For instance, when her children eat the daisies, thatis supposed to be a great evil on their part. But is that in fact what she issaying? No; she is really conveying the adventurousness and imagination of herchildren—their high spirits, which she has such a “hard” time controlling. Atone point, when she describes how impossible it is to talk to one of her boyswho is very literal-minded, I fell in love with that boy. She tells him to throwall of his clothes into the washing machine, and their conversation then goessomething like the following. He says: “All my clothes?” She says: “Yes.” “Myshoes, too?” “Well, no, not your shoes.” “All right, but I’ll put in the belt.”What comes across from their dialogue is an extremely intelligent, rationalchild. What Jean Kerr is actually laughing at is the kind of mother who wouldreally consider this bad or difficult. She is negating the difficulty of thesituation, and she is glorifying the good qualities of her children.O. Henry is a benevolent humorist, as is Oscar Wilde in many of his plays,particularly The Importance of Being Earnest. Cyrano de Bergerac contains a lotof comedy, all of it aimed at destroying the pretentious or the cowardly. Cyranolaughs at villains, not at values or heroes.Ernst Lubitsch was the only screen director famous for romantic comedies.Ninotchka, the Greta Garbo picture he directed, is a good example: it is comedy,but also high romance. What is laughed at is the sordid, undesirable aspects oflife—and what comes across by means of the humor is the glamour, the romance,and the positive aspects.In the benevolent type of humor, something good is always involved, as inNinotchka, where the hero and heroine are quite glamorous. They are notfunny—some of their adventures are; or they are acting humorously toward certainthings, but not in a way that undercuts their own dignity, value, orself-esteem.On the other hand, Swift is a humorist of a dubious kind. I read Gulliver’sTravels so long ago that I remember little of it, but I do remember that it is asatire against something—which does not project what the author is for. Hesatirizes all kinds of social weaknesses, but upholds nothing.In a more modern style, Dorothy Parker laughs in a nasty, bitter way. She isregarded as a sensitive writer, yet manages to deal humorously with the mostheartbreaking subjects possible, like lonely old maids or ugly, undesired women.Humor as the exclusive ingredient of a story is a dubious form of writing. Whilesome people have acquired great skill at it, such humor is philosophically emptybecause it is merely destruction in the name of nothing.In sum, humor is a destructive element. If the humor of a literary work is aimedat the evil or the inconsequential—and if the positive is included—then thehumor is benevolent and the work completely proper. If the humor is aimed at thepositive, at values, the work might be skillful literarily, but it is to bedenounced philosophically. This is true also of satire for the sake of satire.Even if the things satirized are bad and deserve to be destroyed, a work thatincludes no positive, but only the satirizing of negatives, is also improperphilosophically.FANTASYSeveral different forms of literature can be classified as fantasy.To begin with, there are stories laid in the future, as, for instance, AtlasShrugged and Anthem, Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-four, and a whole string of olderbooks. Strictly speaking, this type of fiction is not fantasy, but merely theprojection of something in time. Its justification is to show the ultimateconsequences of some existing trend, or some other application to actualreality. The only rule about it is that it should not be purposeless (which isso general a rule that it applies to all literature). To place something in thefuture merely for the sake of placing it in the future would be irrational.Then there is science fiction, which projects future inventions. There are magicstories, which project supernatural powers (fairy tales would be an example).There are ghost and horror stories. And there are stories about thehereafter—about heaven and hell.All of these forms are rational when they serve some abstract purpose applicableto reality.Most of Jules Verne’s science fiction presented extensions of the discoveries ofhis time; for instance, he wrote stories about dirigibles and submarines beforethese were actually invented. This was merely a literary exaggeration of anexisting fact. Since inventions exist, it is legitimate for a writer to projectnew and greater ones.The same principle applies to fairy tales. Stories like The Magic Carpet andCinderella are justified even though the events are metaphysically impossible,because those events are used to project some idea which is rationallyapplicable to human beings. The author indulges in metaphysical exaggeration,but the meaning of the story is applicable to human life.The best example of this kind of fantasy is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The literalsubject of the story—a man who changes himself physically into a monster—isimpossible, but this is only a symbolic device to convey a psychological truth.The story is a study of a man with contradictory premises. By drinking a specialmedicine, Dr. Jekyll indulges in the fun of turning himself into a monster. Atfirst he is able to control the process, but then he reaches a stage where hecannot control it anymore, where he turns into the monster whether he wants toor not. This is what in fact happens to bad premises: at first they might behidden or controlled, but if unchecked, they take control of a personality.Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a brilliant psychological study projected into afantastic form. The issue of the story is rationally applicable to human life,and very important.A similar example is Frankenstein, the story of a man who creates a monster thatgets out of his control. The meaning of the story is valid: a man must bear theconsequences of his actions and should be careful not to create monsters thatdestroy him. This is a profound message, which is why the name Frankenstein hasbecome almost a generic word (like Babbitt).There are some interesting stories which project heaven or hell—for instance,the play Outward Bound. The characters are passengers on a ship who discoverthat they are in fact all dead and are now going to the Last Judgment. Theystart as a superficial collection of people—and then the author projects them insharp, essential relief as they learn that they are soon to meet an examiner whowill decide what happens thereafter. It is not a profound play, but its purposeis human characterization. Again, this fantasy has an application to actualhuman reality.The movie Here Comes Mr. Jordan [1941] was a fascinating psychological storyabout a deceased prizefighter whose soul comes back to earth. He is not supposedto be dead—there has been some mistake in heavenly bookkeeping—so he is sentback in the body of a millionaire who has just died. By assuming thatmillionaire’s existence, he learns a different way of life. Since a rationalhuman issue was involved, the story was very interesting.What kinds of fantasies are not justified? Those with no intellectual or moralapplication to human life—for instance, the movies about man-sized ants fromanother planet invading the earth. “Wouldn’t it be horrible if ants suddenlyconquered the earth?” Well, what if they did? If those ants at least symbolizedsome special evil—if, like animals in a fable, they represented dictators orhumanitarians or other human monsters—such a story would be valid. But fantasyfor the sake of fantasy is neither valid nor interesting.In H. G. Wells’s The War of the Worlds, men cannot defeat the Martian invaders,but the germs of the common cold can. Like the rest of Wells’s novels, this oneappears to have profound meaning, but it actually does not. That the Martiansare killed by cold germs is a nasty satirical touch, suitable at most for aclever short story. All it says is that nature can do what man cannot—and you donot write a whole novel merely to illustrate that one point. Wells tucks hismessage in at the end to give an allegedly redeeming meaning to what is onlyfantasy for fantasy’s sake.I know of no ghost or horror stories that I would classify as valid.In The Song of Bernadette, the author presents the story of Bernadette ofLourdes [including her divine visions] as if it were fact. The story has novalidity for anyone except those who choose to believe it, but it is not afantasy. It is a religious tract.One could make the point that all religion is a fantasy. Religion is not,however, fantasy for fantasy’s sake. It has a much more vicious motive: thedestruction of human life and the human mind. Religion uses fantastic means toprescribe a code of morality; therefore, it claims a relationship to human life.This raises the issue: Should man be guided by mystical dogma? But speaking inliterary, not philosophical, terms, religious stories are distortions of realityfor a purpose applicable to human life—although one would certainly be justifiedin fighting the purpose.Pulp-magazine thrillers, which often have good plots, are devoid of any valueapplication to reality. An example is a little pocketbook Leonard Peikoff oncegave me. I had asked him if he knew of a good plot story, because I am miserablybored by any other kind, and he gave me one called Seven Footprints to Satan. Itis the story of a man who becomes the prisoner of an archvillain who pretendsthat he is Satan and creates horrible evils for the sole purpose of stealingjewelry from museums and amusing himself by playing chess with human beings. Thestory is exciting in the sense that the writer knows how to keep up his suspenseand mystery and when to introduce the unexpected—but the total has no meaningwhatever. It lacks even the meaning of a good detective story or Western, whichpresents, in primitive terms, the conflict of good and evil.A detective story is applicable to human life since crimes and murders arecommitted, and it has a crude moral pattern: the good fights the evil and alwayswins. But in the above type of science fiction or fantasy thriller, the messageis not that the good wins in human life, even though the hero might escape. Thevalues involved are meaningless and inapplicable to this earth.You have probably heard the Romantic school of writing called “escapeliterature.” The pulp-magazine type of thriller is an escape, but not in theusual sense. It is not merely an escape from the drudgery of one’s existence(which would be a legitimate form of enjoyment); it is an escape from values andfrom the mind. The only thing that can make a story exciting and hold a reader’sinterest is some value at stake. In a thriller of the above kind, which featuresa fantastic and impossible villain, the escape for the reader consists ofdropping all concern with values. He has the advantage of reading about astruggle, yet he can learn from the story no abstraction applicable to himself.This school of literature tells the reader that there are values, except thatthey do not apply to his life. “Yes, you can have thrilling purposes andadventures, but they have nothing to do with your life on earth.” Strangelyenough, this cheap pulp literature is the expression of a religious metaphysicsand morality: values do exist somewhere—on Mars or in another dimension—but noton earth.This school includes all fantasies and all science fiction or general adventurethrillers which present issues without any possible counterpart inreality—issues without any application, abstract or symbolic, to the reader’sown life. It also includes the lesser costume dramas. The better ones do presentsome issue that applies to modern life (usually in a very generalized way); butthe cheaper historical novels, which consist of nothing but duels and swingingfrom chandeliers, have no moral beyond the hero winning the girl or the buriedgold.SYMBOLISMSymbolism is the concretization of an idea in an object or person representingthat idea.An example of symbolic writing is morality plays. Just as fairy tales presentthe good fairy and the bad fairy, so morality plays present moral abstractionsby means of human figures like an embodied Justice or an embodied Virtue. Thefigures do not represent characteristics [as in Romantic fiction]; theyrepresent the abstractions themselves as a kind of Platonic archetype. This is acrude dramatic form, but legitimate if the symbolism is made clear.Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is symbolic insofar as physical shapes represent apsychological conflict, Mr. Hyde being a symbol of psychological evil.The one absolute in the use of symbolism is that a symbol should be legible;otherwise, the form is a contradiction in terms. This applies also to symbolismwithin works which are not symbolic as a whole. My use of the dollar sign inAtlas Shrugged is an example: I establish its meaning, and when I later refer toit, I do so on that basis. Similarly, when writers of religious stories use thecross, it is clear what that cross stands for. But when authors introduce allkinds of triangles or sawed-off pyramids, and nobody knows what it means, thatis outside the bounds of rational propriety. Or take Kafka, or any suchmodernist; if nobody knows what the alleged symbol represents, one cannot evencall it symbolism.When, at the end of Part II of Atlas Shrugged, Dagny follows Galt into thesunrise, that is symbolism. It is even a trite symbol, but so appropriate thatit was legitimate. Literally, she is following his plane late at night, and bythe locale of the action he has to go east (which I carefully planned long inadvance). Symbolically, she has been in the dark during all of the story, butnow she is about to see the sunrise—and the first light comes from the wings ofGalt’s plane.Using the sunrise, or any form of light, as a symbol of the good or therevelation is a bromide, but it is a bromide of the kind that love is: it is sowide and fundamental that you cannot avoid it. What will make your use of it abromide or not is whether or not you bring any originality to the subject.It is not a good method to introduce symbolic sequences into an otherwiserealistic story. For instance, some books have dream sequences which aresupposed to be symbolic, but which are always completely unclear. This is a badmixture of methods. It cannot be justified because it destroys the reality ofthe story. (It is proper, however, in musicals. In musicals, anything goes, theonly rule being imagination.)TRAGEDY AND THE PROJECTION OF NEGATIVESThe justification for presenting tragic endings in literature is to show, as inWe the Living, that the human spirit can survive even the worst ofcircumstances—that the worst that the chance events of nature or the evil ofother people can do will not defeat the proper human spirit. To quote fromGalt’s speech in Atlas Shrugged: “Suffering as such is not a value; only man’sfight against suffering, is.”Here I speak of philosophical justification, not literary. As far as literaryrules go, you can present anything you wish—you can write a story in whicheverybody is destroyed, the theme then being that man has no chance anddestruction is his fate. There are many such stories, some of them well written.But to present suffering for the sake of suffering is totally wrongphilosophically; and literarily it makes for a pointless story.In We the Living, all the good people are defeated. The philosophicaljustification of the tragedy is the fact that the story denounces thecollectivist state and shows, metaphysically, that man cannot be destroyed byit; he can be killed, but not changed or negated. The heroine dies radiantlyendorsing life, feeling happiness in her last moment because she has known whatlife properly should be.Another proper tragedy is Cyrano de Bergerac, where the hero dies frustratedboth as a lover and in his career as a poet. But he maintains his values to theend. The justification for this tragedy is precisely that nothing broke thehero’s spirit—yet the author put every kind of disaster in his way.Victor Hugo, who usually has unhappy endings, always presents his characters’suffering somewhat in the way that I do in We the Living. Even if a particularcharacter meets with disaster, the tragedy and pain are never complete; they arenot, metaphysically, the final word on man. Hugo never projects the overwhelminghorror of pain that one finds in Naturalistic novels—for instance, in thesuicide scene in Anna Karenina. (Conversely, enjoyment and happiness never gounchallenged in Naturalistic novels.)In general, the creation of only the negative is a flaw, both philosophicallyand literarily.The best example is Dostoevsky, who was a moralist, but who was never able toproject what he considered good. (He attempted it in several novels, withoutsuccess.) However, in presenting the evils he denounced, he was a master.This is a flaw in his novels. They are, in a way, incomplete works of fiction. Ilike them as a spectacle of human intelligence and perceptiveness at work—thespectacle of what Dostoevsky’s mind is able to identify and present. But afterone finishes, one has only the satisfaction of having learned something abouthuman nature, not the artistic satisfaction of having lived through anexperience which is an end in itself. Reading his novels is anything but an endin itself.The purpose of Dostoevsky’s novels is more didactic than artistic. The artisticmeans are superlative; his technique is magnificent. But since art is primarilya presentation of values, Dostoevsky fails because he can project his valuesonly by means of negatives. We know what he is against, but not what he is for;he is not able to project it. (The reason is that he is much too intelligent aman, and too good an artist, to do what he wanted, namely, to projectsuccessfully a Christian ideal.)An example from another field is Goya, the artist who is a master at presentingunspeakable horrors. You might be familiar with the horrible scenes he paintedof the Napoleonic Wars in Spain. It is said—and is probably truebiographically—that his purpose was to denounce the horror of war. But I wouldquestion Goya’s motive, and Dostoevsky’s. An artist, whether he identifies it ornot, is, after all, busy projecting his values—and it requires a certain amountof fascination with evil, of holding evil as a value, to devote a whole workexclusively to that. Dostoevsky openly projected such fascination. I read a novel for one purpose only, and to me no amount of literary skill is ofequal importance.I read a novel for the purpose of seeing the kind of people I would want to seein real life and living through the kind of experience I would want to livethrough. To those who say that this is a limited use of fiction, my answer is:No—because for any other purpose, nonfiction is better. If I want to learnsomething, I can learn it from nonfiction. But in the one realm where nonfictioncannot do as well—the realm of values and their concretization in humanreality—nothing can take the place of art, and specifically of fiction.Since that is the primary purpose of art, that is what I personally enjoy mostand the only thing that counts.I would not want to live through a story by Dostoevsky. I admire him very much,but only literarily; I do not enjoy reading his stories. I enjoy Victor Hugo. Ido not share his ideas and do not always approve of his tragic endings;nevertheless, he is the writer nearest to creating the kind of people and eventsI would like to observe or live with.That is my personal enjoyment of literature, and it is not subjective. By“personal,” I only mean “mine”—and I can defend and prove my standard in everyrespect.This course is part of the proof."},{"pageContent":"INDEX“A LETTER ON STYLE” (LEWIS)ABSTRACTIONSAND CONCRETESFLOATINGAND VALUESAND METAPHORSSEE ALSO “CIRCLE”; PROPAGANDA VERSUS ARTANNA CHRISTIE (O’NEILL)ANNA KARENINA (TOLSTOY)ANNA LUCASTA (YORDAN)ANTHEM (AYN RAND)ANTICLIMAXSEE ALSO CLIMAXARISTOTLEARROWSMITH (LEWIS)CHARACTERIZATION INSTYLE OFARTAND LITERATURENONOBJECTIVEATLAS SHRUGGED (AYN RAND)THEME OFPLOT OFSTYLE OFBABBITT (LEWIS)BY LOVE POSSESSED (COZZENS)CAMILLE (DUMAS FILS)CHARACTERIZATIONCHEKHOV, ANTON“CIRCLE”SEE ALSO ABSTRACTIONS AND CONCRETESCLIMAXAND PLOT-THEMESEE ALSO ANTICLIMAXCOINCIDENCECOLERIDGE, SAMUEL TAYLORCOLLOQUIALISMCONCRETES.
