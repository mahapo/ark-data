It is a collection of essays on themoral aspects of capitalism.Our approach can best be summarized by my statement in the first issue of TheObjectivist Newsletter (January 1962):“Objectivism is a philosophical movement; since politics is a branch ofphilosophy, Objectivism advocates certain political principles—specifically,those of laissez-faire capitalism—as the consequence and the ultimate practicalapplication of its fundamental philosophical principles. It does not regardpolitics as a separate or primary goal, that is: as a goal that can be achievedwithout a wider ideological context.“Politics is based on three other philosophical disciplines: metaphysics,epistemology and ethics—on a theory of man’s nature and of man’s relationship toexistence. It is only on such a base that one can formulate a consistentpolitical theory and achieve it in practice. . . . Objectivists are not‘conservatives.’ We are radicals for capitalism; we are fighting for thatphilosophical base which capitalism did not have and without which it was doomedto perish.”I want to stress that our primary interest is not politics or economics as such,but “man’s nature and man’s relationship to existence”—and that we advocatecapitalism because it is the only system geared to the life of a rational being.In this respect, there is a fundamental difference between our approach and thatof capitalism’s classical defenders and modern apologists. With very fewexceptions, they are responsible—by default—for capitalism’s destruction. Thedefault consisted of their inability or unwillingness to fight the battle whereit had to be fought: on moral-philosophical grounds.No politico-economic system in history has ever proved its value so eloquentlyor has benefited mankind so greatly as capitalism—and none has ever beenattacked so savagely, viciously, and blindly. The flood of misinformation,misrepresentation, distortion, and outright falsehood about capitalism is suchthat the young people of today have no idea (and virtually no way of discoveringany idea) of its actual nature. While archeologists are rummaging through theruins of millennia for scraps of pottery and bits of bones, from which toreconstruct some information about prehistorical existence—the events of lessthan a century ago are hidden under a mound more impenetrable than thegeological debris of winds, floods, and earthquakes: a mound of silence.To obliterate the truth on such a large scale, to hide an open secret from theworld, to hide—without any power of censorship, yet without any significantsound of protest—the fact that an ideal social system had once been almostwithin men’s reach, cannot be done by any conspiracy of evildoers; it cannot bedone except with the tacit compliance of those who know better.By their silence—by their evasion of the clash between capitalism andaltruism—it is capitalism’s alleged champions who are responsible for the factthat capitalism is being destroyed without a hearing, without a trial, withoutany public knowledge of its principles, its nature, its history, or its moralmeaning. It is being destroyed in the manner of a nightmare lynching—as if ablind, despair-crazed mob were burning a straw man, not knowing that thegrotesquely deformed bundle of straw is hiding the living body of the ideal.The method of capitalism’s destruction rests on never letting the world discoverwhat it is that is being destroyed—on never allowing it to be identified withinthe hearing of the young.The purpose of this book is to identify it.The guilt for the present state of the world rests on the shoulders of those whoare over forty years old today (with a very few exceptions)—those who, when theyspoke, said less than they knew and said it less clearly than the subjectdemanded.This book is addressed to the young—in years or in spirit—who are not afraid toknow and are not ready to give up.What they have to discover, what all the efforts of capitalism’s enemies arefrantically aimed at hiding, is the fact that capitalism is not merely the“practical,” but the only moral system in history. (See Atlas Shrugged.)The political aspects of Atlas Shrugged are not its theme. Its theme isprimarily ethical-epistemological: the role of the mind in man’s existence—andpolitics, necessarily, is one of the theme’s consequences. But theepistemological chaos of our age, fostered by modern philosophy, is such thatmany young readers find it difficult to translate abstractions into politicalprinciples and apply them to the evaluation of today’s events. This present bookmay help them. It is a nonfiction footnote to Atlas Shrugged.Since every political system rests on some theory of ethics, I suggest to thosereaders who are actually interested in understanding the nature of capitalism,that they read first The Virtue of Selfishness, a collection of essays on theObjectivist ethics, which is a necessary foundation for this present book. Sinceno political discussion can be meaningful or intelligible without a clearunderstanding of two crucial concepts: “rights” and “government”—yet these arethe two most strenuously evaded in today’s technique of obfuscation—I suggestthat you begin this book by reading (or rereading) two essays from that earliercollection, which you will find here reprinted in the appendix: “Man’s Rights”and “The Nature of Government.”Most of the essays in this book appeared originally in The ObjectivistNewsletter (now, in magazine format, The Objectivist); others are based onlectures or papers, as indicated. Some of the essays cover, in brief summary,the answers to the most widely spread fallacies about the economics ofcapitalism. These essays appeared in the “Intellectual Ammunition Department” ofThe Objectivist Newsletter and were written in answer to questions from ourreaders. Those who are interested in studying political economy will find, inthe appendix, a recommended bibliography on that subject.Now a word about the contributors to this book.

WHAT IS CAPITALISM?by Ayn Rand The disintegration of philosophy in the nineteenth century and its collapse inthe twentieth have led to a similar, though much slower and less obvious,process in the course of modern science.Today’s frantic development in the field of technology has a quality reminiscentof the days preceding the economic crash of 1929: riding on the momentum of thepast, on the unacknowledged remnants of an Aristotelian epistemology, it is ahectic, feverish expansion, heedless of the fact that its theoretical account islong since overdrawn—that in the field of scientific theory, unable to integrateor interpret their own data, scientists are abetting the resurgence of aprimitive mysticism. In the humanities, however, the crash is past, thedepression has set in, and the collapse of science is all but complete.The clearest evidence of it may be seen in such comparatively young sciences aspsychology and political economy. In psychology, one may observe the attempt tostudy human behavior without reference to the fact that man is conscious. Inpolitical economy, one may observe the attempt to study and to devise socialsystems without reference to man.The Objectivist Newsletter, November and December 1965.It is philosophy that defines and establishes the epistemological criteria toguide human knowledge in general and specific sciences in particular. Politicaleconomy came into prominence in the nineteenth century, in the era ofphilosophy’s post-Kantian disintegration, and no one rose to check its premisesor to challenge its base. Implicitly, uncritically, and by default, politicaleconomy accepted as its axioms the fundamental tenets of collectivism.Political economists—including the advocates of capitalism—defined their scienceas the study of the management or direction or organization or manipulation of a“community’s” or a nation’s “resources.” The nature of these “resources” was notdefined; their communal ownership was taken for granted—and the goal ofpolitical economy was assumed to be the study of how to utilize these“resources” for “the common good.”The fact that the principal “resource” involved was man himself, that he was anentity of a specific nature with specific capacities and requirements, was giventhe most superficial attention, if any. Man was regarded simply as one of thefactors of production, along with land, forests, or mines—as one of the lesssignificant factors, since more study was devoted to the influence and qualityof these others than to his role or quality.Political economy was, in effect, a science starting in midstream: it observedthat men were producing and trading, it took for granted that they had alwaysdone so and always would—it accepted this fact as the given, requiring nofurther consideration—and it addressed itself to the problem of how to devisethe best way for the “community” to dispose of human effort.There were many reasons for this tribal view of man. The morality of altruismwas one; the growing dominance of political statism among the intellectuals ofthe nineteenth century was another. Psychologically, the main reason was thesoul-body dichotomy permeating European culture: material production wasregarded as a demeaning task of a lower order, unrelated to the concerns ofman’s intellect, a task assigned to slaves or serfs since the beginning ofrecorded history. The institution of serfdom had lasted, in one form or another,till well into the nineteenth century; it was abolished, politically, only bythe advent of capitalism; politically, but not intellectually.The concept of man as a free, independent individual was profoundly alien to theculture of Europe. It was a tribal culture down to its roots; in Europeanthinking, the tribe was the entity, the unit, and man was only one of itsexpendable cells. This applied to rulers and serfs alike: the rulers werebelieved to hold their privileges only by virtue of the services they renderedto the tribe, services regarded as of a noble order, namely, armed force ormilitary defense. But a nobleman was as much chattel of the tribe as a serf: hislife and property belonged to the king. It must be remembered that theinstitution of private property, in the full, legal meaning of the term, wasbrought into existence only by capitalism. In the pre-capitalist eras, privateproperty existed de facto, but not de jure, i.e., by custom and sufferance, notby right or by law. In law and in principle, all property belonged to the headof the tribe, the king, and was held only by his permission, which could berevoked at any time, at his pleasure. (The king could and did expropriate theestates of recalcitrant noblemen throughout the course of Europe’s history.)The American philosophy of the Rights of Man was never grasped fully by Europeanintellectuals. Europe’s predominant idea of emancipation consisted of changingthe concept of man as a slave of the absolute state embodied by a king, to theconcept of man as a slave of the absolute state embodied by “the people”—i.e.,switching from slavery to a tribal chief into slavery to the tribe. A non-tribalview of existence could not penetrate the mentalities that regarded theprivilege of ruling material producers by physical force as a badge of nobility.Thus Europe’s thinkers did not notice the fact that during the nineteenthcentury, the galley slaves had been replaced by the inventors of steamboats, andthe village blacksmiths by the owners of blast furnaces, and they went onthinking in such terms (such contradictions in terms) as “wage slavery” or “theantisocial selfishness of industrialists who take so much from society withoutgiving anything in return”—on the unchallenged axiom that wealth is ananonymous, social, tribal product.That notion has not been challenged to this day; it represents the implicitassumption and the base of contemporary political economy.As an example of this view and its consequences, I shall cite the article on“Capitalism” in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The article gives no definition ofits subject; it opens as follows:CAPITALISM, a term used to denote the economic system that has been dominant inthe western world since the breakup of feudalism. Fundamental to any systemcalled capitalist are the relations between private owners of nonpersonal meansof production (land, mines, industrial plants, etc., collectively known ascapital) [italics mine] and free but capitalless workers, who sell their labourservices to employers. . . . The resulting wage bargains determine theproportion in which the total product of society will be shared between theclass of labourers and the class of capitalist entrepreneurs. 1[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-1](I quote from Galt’s speech in Atlas Shrugged, from a passage describing thetenets of collectivism: “An industrialist—blank-out—there is no such person. Afactory is a ‘natural resource,’ like a tree, a rock or a mud-puddle.”)The success of capitalism is explained by the Britannica as follows:Productive use of the “social surplus” was the special virtue that enabledcapitalism to outstrip all prior economic systems. Instead of building pyramidsand cathedrals, those in command of the social surplus chose to invest in ships,warehouses, raw materials, finished goods and other material forms of wealth.The social surplus was thus converted into enlarged productive capacity.This is said about a time when Europe’s population subsisted in such povertythat child mortality approached fifty percent, and periodic famines wiped outthe “surplus” population which the pre-capitalist economies were unable to feed.Yet, making no distinction between tax-expropriated and industrially producedwealth, the Britannica asserts that it was the surplus wealth of that time thatthe early capitalists “commanded” and “chose to invest”—and that this investmentwas the cause of the stupendous prosperity of the age that followed.What is a “social surplus”? The article gives no definition or explanation. A“surplus” presupposes a norm; if subsistence on a chronic starvation level isabove the implied norm, what is that norm? The article does not answer.There is, of course, no such thing as a “social surplus.” All wealth is producedby somebody and belongs to somebody. And “the special virtue that enabledcapitalism to outstrip all prior economic systems” was freedom (a concepteloquently absent from the Britannica’s account), which led, not to theexpropriation, but to the creation of wealth.I shall have more to say later about that disgraceful article (disgraceful onmany counts, not the least of which is scholarship). At this point, I quoted itonly as a succinct example of the tribal premise that underlies today’spolitical economy. That premise is shared by the enemies and the champions ofcapitalism alike; it provides the former with a certain inner consistency, anddisarms the latter by a subtle, yet devastating aura of moral hypocrisy—aswitness, their attempts to justify capitalism on the ground of “the common good”or “service to the consumer” or “the best allocation of resources.” (Whoseresources?)If capitalism is to be understood, it is this tribal premise that has to bechecked—and challenged.Mankind is not an entity, an organism, or a coral bush. The entity involved inproduction and trade is man. It is with the study of man—not of the looseaggregate known as a “community”—that any science of the humanities has tobegin.This issue represents one of the epistemological differences between thehumanities and the physical sciences, one of the causes of the former’swell-earned inferiority complex in regard to the latter. A physical sciencewould not permit itself (not yet, at least) to ignore or bypass the nature ofits subject. Such an attempt would mean: a science of astronomy that gazed atthe sky, but refused to study individual stars, planets, and satellites—or ascience of medicine that studied disease, without any knowledge or criterion ofhealth, and took, as its basic subject of study, a hospital as a whole, neverfocusing on individual patients.A great deal may be learned about society by studying man; but this processcannot be reversed: nothing can be learned about man by studying society—bystudying the inter-relationships of entities one has never identified ordefined. Yet that is the methodology adopted by most political economists. Theirattitude, in effect, amounts to the unstated, implicit postulate: “Man is thatwhich fits economic equations.” Since he obviously does not, this leads to thecurious fact that in spite of the practical nature of their science, politicaleconomists are oddly unable to relate their abstractions to the concretes ofactual existence.It leads also to a baffling sort of double standard or double perspective intheir way of viewing men and events: if they observe a shoemaker, they find nodifficulty in concluding that he is working in order to make a living; but aspolitical economists, on the tribal premise, they declare that his purpose (andduty) is to provide society with shoes. If they observe a panhandler on a streetcorner, they identify him as a bum; in political economy, he becomes “asovereign consumer.” If they hear the communist doctrine that all propertyshould belong to the state, they reject it emphatically and feel, sincerely,that they would fight communism to the death; but in political economy, theyspeak of the government’s duty to effect “a fair redistribution of wealth,” andthey speak of businessmen as the best, most efficient trustees of the nation’s“natural resources.”This is what a basic premise (and philosophical negligence) will do; this iswhat the tribal premise has done.To reject that premise and begin at the beginning—in one’s approach to politicaleconomy and to the evaluation of various social systems—one must begin byidentifying man’s nature, i.e., those essential characteristics whichdistinguish him from all other living species.Man’s essential characteristic is his rational faculty. Man’s mind is his basicmeans of survival—his only means of gaining knowledge.Man cannot survive, as animals do, by the guidance of mere percepts. . . . Hecannot provide for his simplest physical needs without a process of thought. Heneeds a process of thought to discover how to plant and grow his food or how tomake weapons for hunting. His percepts might lead him to a cave, if one isavailable—but to build the simplest shelter, he needs a process of thought. Nopercepts and no “instincts” will tell him how to light a fire, how to weavecloth, how to forge tools, how to make a wheel, how to make an airplane, how toperform an appendectomy, how to produce an electric light bulb or an electronictube or a cyclotron or a box of matches. Yet his life depends on suchknowledge—and only a volitional act of his consciousness, a process of thought,can provide it.2 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-2]A process of thought is an enormously complex process of identification andintegration, which only an individual mind can perform. There is no such thingas a collective brain. Men can learn from one another, but learning requires aprocess of thought on the part of every individual student. Men can cooperate inthe discovery of new knowledge, but such cooperation requires the independentexercise of his rational faculty by every individual scientist. Man is the onlyliving species that can transmit and expand his store of knowledge fromgeneration to generation; but such transmission requires a process of thought onthe part of the individual recipients. As witness, the breakdowns ofcivilization, the dark ages in the history of mankind’s progress, when theaccumulated knowledge of centuries vanished from the lives of men who wereunable, unwilling, or forbidden to think.In order to sustain its life, every living species has to follow a certaincourse of action required by its nature. The action required to sustain humanlife is primarily intellectual: everything man needs has to be discovered by hismind and produced by his effort. Production is the application of reason to theproblem of survival.If some men do not choose to think, they can survive only by imitating andrepeating a routine of work discovered by others—but those others had todiscover it, or none would have survived. If some men do not choose to think orto work, they can survive (temporarily) only by looting the goods produced byothers—but those others had to produce them, or none would have survived.Regardless of what choice is made, in this issue, by any man or by any number ofmen, regardless of what blind, irrational, or evil course they may choose topursue—the fact remains that reason is man’s means of survival and that menprosper or fail, survive or perish in proportion to the degree of theirrationality.Since knowledge, thinking, and rational action are properties of the individual,since the choice to exercise his rational faculty or not depends on theindividual, man’s survival requires that those who think be free of theinterference of those who don’t. Since men are neither omniscient norinfallible, they must be free to agree or disagree, to cooperate or to pursuetheir own independent course, each according to his own rational judgment.Freedom is the fundamental requirement of man’s mind.A rational mind does not work under compulsion; it does not subordinate itsgrasp of reality to anyone’s orders, directives, or controls; it does notsacrifice its knowledge, its view of the truth, to anyone’s opinions, threats,wishes, plans, or “welfare.” Such a mind may be hampered by others, it may besilenced, proscribed, imprisoned, or destroyed; it cannot be forced; a gun isnot an argument. (An example and symbol of this attitude is Galileo.)It is from the work and the inviolate integrity of such minds—from theintransigent innovators—that all of mankind’s knowledge and achievements havecome. (See The Fountainhead.) It is to such minds that mankind owes itssurvival. (See Atlas Shrugged.)The same principle applies to all men, on every level of ability and ambition.To the extent that a man is guided by his rational judgment, he acts inaccordance with the requirements of his nature and, to that extent, succeeds inachieving a human form of survival and well-being; to the extent that he actsirrationally, he acts as his own destroyer.The social recognition of man’s rational nature—of the connection between hissurvival and his use of reason—is the concept of individual rights.I shall remind you that “rights” are a moral principle defining and sanctioninga man’s freedom of action in a social context, that they are derived from man’snature as a rational being and represent a necessary condition of his particularmode of survival. I shall remind you also that the right to life is the sourceof all rights, including the right to property.3[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-3]In regard to political economy, this last requires special emphasis: man has towork and produce in order to support his life. He has to support his life by hisown effort and by the guidance of his own mind. If he cannot dispose of theproduct of his effort, he cannot dispose of his effort; if he cannot dispose ofhis effort, he cannot dispose of his life. Without property rights, no otherrights can be practiced.Now, bearing these facts in mind, consider the question of what social system isappropriate to man.A social system is a set of moral-political-economic principles embodied in asociety’s laws, institutions, and government, which determine the relationships,the terms of association, among the men living in a given geographical area. Itis obvious that these terms and relationships depend on an identification ofman’s nature, that they would be different if they pertain to a society ofrational beings or to a colony of ants. It is obvious that they will beradically different if men deal with one another as free, independentindividuals, on the premise that every man is an end in himself—or as members ofa pack, each regarding the others as the means to his ends and to the ends of“the pack as a whole.”There are only two fundamental questions (or two aspects of the same question)that determine the nature of any social system: Does a social system recognizeindividual rights?—and: Does a social system ban physical force from humanrelationships? The answer to the second question is the practical implementationof the answer to the first.Is man a sovereign individual who owns his person, his mind, his life, his workand its products—or is he the property of the tribe (the state, the society, thecollective) that may dispose of him in any way it pleases, that may dictate hisconvictions, prescribe the course of his life, control his work and expropriatehis products? Does man have the right to exist for his own sake—or is he born inbondage, as an indentured servant who must keep buying his life by serving thetribe but can never acquire it free and clear?This is the first question to answer. The rest is consequences and practicalimplementations. The basic issue is only: Is man free?In mankind’s history, capitalism is the only system that answers: Yes.Capitalism is a social system based on the recognition of individual rights,including property rights, in which all property is privately owned.The recognition of individual rights entails the banishment of physical forcefrom human relationships: basically, rights can be violated only by means offorce. In a capitalist society, no man or group may initiate the use of physicalforce against others. The only function of the government, in such a society, isthe task of protecting man’s rights, i.e., the task of protecting him fromphysical force; the government acts as the agent of man’s right of self-defense,and may use force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate itsuse; thus the government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of forceunder objective control.4 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-4]It is the basic, metaphysical fact of man’s nature—the connection between hissurvival and his use of reason—that capitalism recognizes and protects.In a capitalist society, all human relationships are voluntary. Men are free tocooperate or not, to deal with one another or not, as their own individualjudgments, convictions, and interests dictate. They can deal with one anotheronly in terms of and by means of reason, i.e., by means of discussion,persuasion, and contractual agreement, by voluntary choice to mutual benefit.The right to agree with others is not a problem in any society; it is the rightto disagree that is crucial. It is the institution of private property thatprotects and implements the right to disagree—and thus keeps the road open toman’s most valuable attribute (valuable personally, socially, and objectively):the creative mind.This is the cardinal difference between capitalism and collectivism.The power that determines the establishment, the changes, the evolution, and thedestruction of social systems is philosophy. The role of chance, accident, ortradition, in this context, is the same as their role in the life of anindividual: their power stands in inverse ratio to the power of a culture’s (oran individual’s) philosophical equipment, and grows as philosophy collapses. Itis, therefore, by reference to philosophy that the character of a social systemhas to be defined and evaluated. Corresponding to the four branches ofphilosophy, the four keystones of capitalism are: metaphysically, therequirements of man’s nature and survival—epistemologically, reason—ethically,individual rights—politically, freedom.This, in substance, is the base of the proper approach to political economy andto an understanding of capitalism—not the tribal premise inherited fromprehistorical traditions.The “practical” justification of capitalism does not lie in the collectivistclaim that it effects “the best allocation of national resources.” Man is not a“national resource” and neither is his mind—and without the creative power ofman’s intelligence, raw materials remain just so many useless raw materials.The moral justification of capitalism does not lie in the altruist claim that itrepresents the best way to achieve “the common good.” It is true that capitalismdoes—if that catch-phrase has any meaning—but this is merely a secondaryconsequence. The moral justification of capitalism lies in the fact that it isthe only system consonant with man’s rational nature, that it protects man’ssurvival qua man, and that its ruling principle is: justice.Every social system is based, explicitly or implicitly, on some theory ofethics. The tribal notion of “the common good” has served as the moraljustification of most social systems—and of all tyrannies—in history. The degreeof a society’s enslavement or freedom corresponded to the degree to which thattribal slogan was invoked or ignored.“The common good” (or “the public interest”) is an undefined and undefinableconcept: there is no such entity as “the tribe” or “the public”; the tribe (orthe public or society) is only a number of individual men. Nothing can be goodfor the tribe as such; “good” and “value” pertain only to a living organism—toan individual living organism—not to a disembodied aggregate of relationships.“The common good” is a meaningless concept, unless taken literally, in whichcase its only possible meaning is: the sum of the good of all the individual meninvolved. But in that case, the concept is meaningless as a moral criterion: itleaves open the question of what is the good of individual men and how does onedetermine it?It is not, however, in its literal meaning that that concept is generally used.It is accepted precisely for its elastic, undefinable, mystical character whichserves, not as a moral guide, but as an escape from morality. Since the good isnot applicable to the disembodied, it becomes a moral blank check for those whoattempt to embody it.When “the common good” of a society is regarded as something apart from andsuperior to the individual good of its members, it means that the good of somemen takes precedence over the good of others, with those others consigned to thestatus of sacrificial animals. It is tacitly assumed, in such cases, that “thecommon good” means “the good of the majority” as against the minority or theindividual. Observe the significant fact that that assumption is tacit: even themost collectivized mentalities seem to sense the impossibility of justifying itmorally. But “the good of the majority,” too, is only a pretense and a delusion:since, in fact, the violation of an individual’s rights means the abrogation ofall rights, it delivers the helpless majority into the power of any gang thatproclaims itself to be “the voice of society” and proceeds to rule by means ofphysical force, until deposed by another gang employing the same means.If one begins by defining the good of individual men, one will accept as properonly a society in which that good is achieved and achievable. But if one beginsby accepting “the common good” as an axiom and regarding individual good as itspossible but not necessary consequence (not necessary in any particular case),one ends up with such a gruesome absurdity as Soviet Russia, a countryprofessedly dedicated to “the common good,” where, with the exception of aminuscule clique of rulers, the entire population has existed in subhuman miseryfor over two generations.What makes the victims and, worse, the observers accept this and other similarhistorical atrocities, and still cling to the myth of “the common good”? Theanswer lies in philosophy—in philosophical theories on the nature of moralvalues.There are, in essence, three schools of thought on the nature of the good: theintrinsic, the subjective, and the objective. The intrinsic theory holds thatthe good is inherent in certain things or actions as such, regardless of theircontext and consequences, regardless of any benefit or injury they may cause tothe actors and subjects involved. It is a theory that divorces the concept of“good” from beneficiaries, and the concept of “value” from valuer andpurpose—claiming that the good is good in, by, and of itself.The subjectivist theory holds that the good bears no relation to the facts ofreality, that it is the product of a man’s consciousness, created by hisfeelings, desires, “intuitions,” or whims, and that it is merely an “arbitrarypostulate” or an “emotional commitment.”The intrinsic theory holds that the good resides in some sort of reality,independent of man’s consciousness; the subjectivist theory holds that the goodresides in man’s consciousness, independent of reality.The objective theory holds that the good is neither an attribute of “things inthemselves” nor of man’s emotional states, but an evaluation of the facts ofreality by man’s consciousness according to a rational standard of value.(Rational, in this context, means: derived from the facts of reality andvalidated by a process of reason.) The objective theory holds that the good isan aspect of reality in relation to man—and that it must be discovered, notinvented, by man. Fundamental to an objective theory of values is the question:Of value to whom and for what? An objective theory does not permitcontext-dropping or “concept-stealing”; it does not permit the separation of“value” from “purpose,” of the good from beneficiaries, and of man’s actionsfrom reason.Of all the social systems in mankind’s history, capitalism is the only systembased on an objective theory of values.The intrinsic theory and the subjectivist theory (or a mixture of both) are thenecessary base of every dictatorship, tyranny, or variant of the absolute state.Whether they are held consciously or subconsciously—in the explicit form of aphilosopher’s treatise or in the implicit chaos of its echoes in an averageman’s feelings—these theories make it possible for a man to believe that thegood is independent of man’s mind and can be achieved by physical force.If a man believes that the good is intrinsic in certain actions, he will nothesitate to force others to perform them. If he believes that the human benefitor injury caused by such actions is of no significance, he will regard a sea ofblood as of no significance. If he believes that the beneficiaries of suchactions are irrelevant (or interchangeable), he will regard wholesale slaughteras his moral duty in the service of a “higher” good. It is the intrinsic theoryof values that produces a Robespierre, a Lenin, a Stalin, or a Hitler. It is notan accident that Eichmann was a Kantian.If a man believes that the good is a matter of arbitrary, subjective choice, theissue of good or evil becomes, for him, an issue of: my feelings or theirs? Nobridge, understanding, or communication is possible to him. Reason is the onlymeans of communication among men, and an objectively perceivable reality istheir only common frame of reference; when these are invalidated (i.e., held tobe irrelevant) in the field of morality, force becomes men’s only way of dealingwith one another. If the subjectivist wants to pursue some social ideal of hisown, he feels morally entitled to force men “for their own good,” since he feelsthat he is right and that there is nothing to oppose him but their misguidedfeelings.Thus, in practice, the proponents of the intrinsic and the subjectivist schoolsmeet and blend. (They blend in terms of their psycho-epistemology as well: bywhat means do the moralists of the intrinsic school discover theirtranscendental “good,” if not by means of special, non-rational intuitions andrevelations, i.e., by means of their feelings?) It is doubtful whether anyonecan hold either of these theories as an actual, if mistaken, conviction. Butboth serve as a rationalization of power-lust and of rule by brute force,unleashing the potential dictator and disarming his victims.The objective theory of values is the only moral theory incompatible with ruleby force. Capitalism is the only system based implicitly on an objective theoryof values—and the historic tragedy is that this has never been made explicit.If one knows that the good is objective—i.e., determined by the nature ofreality, but to be discovered by man’s mind—one knows that an attempt to achievethe good by physical force is a monstrous contradiction which negates moralityat its root by destroying man’s capacity to recognize the good, i.e., hiscapacity to value. Force invalidates and paralyzes a man’s judgment, demandingthat he act against it, thus rendering him morally impotent. A value which oneis forced to accept at the price of surrendering one’s mind, is not a value toanyone; the forcibly mindless can neither judge nor choose nor value. An attemptto achieve the good by force is like an attempt to provide a man with a picturegallery at the price of cutting out his eyes. Values cannot exist (cannot bevalued) outside the full context of a man’s life, needs, goals, and knowledge.The objective view of values permeates the entire structure of a capitalistsociety.The recognition of individual rights implies the recognition of the fact thatthe good is not an ineffable abstraction in some supernatural dimension, but avalue pertaining to reality, to this earth, to the lives of individual humanbeings (note the right to the pursuit of happiness). It implies that the goodcannot be divorced from beneficiaries, that men are not to be regarded asinterchangeable, and that no man or tribe may attempt to achieve the good ofsome at the price of the immolation of others.The free market represents the social application of an objective theory ofvalues. Since values are to be discovered by man’s mind, men must be free todiscover them—to think, to study, to translate their knowledge into physicalform, to offer their products for trade, to judge them, and to choose, be itmaterial goods or ideas, a loaf of bread or a philosophical treatise. Sincevalues are established contextually, every man must judge for himself, in thecontext of his own knowledge, goals, and interests. Since values are determinedby the nature of reality, it is reality that serves as men’s ultimate arbiter:if a man’s judgment is right, the rewards are his; if it is wrong, he is hisonly victim.It is in regard to a free market that the distinction between an intrinsic,subjective, and objective view of values is particularly important tounderstand. The market value of a product is not an intrinsic value, not a“value in itself” hanging in a vacuum. A free market never loses sight of thequestion: Of value to whom? And, within the broad field of objectivity, themarket value of a product does not reflect its philosophically objective value,but only its socially objective value.By “philosophically objective,” I mean a value estimated from the standpoint ofthe best possible to man, i.e., by the criterion of the most rational mindpossessing the greatest knowledge, in a given category, in a given period, andin a defined context (nothing can be estimated in an undefined context). Forinstance, it can be rationally proved that the airplane is objectively ofimmeasurably greater value to man (to man at his best) than the bicycle—and thatthe works of Victor Hugo are objectively of immeasurably greater value thantrue-confession magazines. But if a given man’s intellectual potential canbarely manage to enjoy true confessions, there is no reason why his meagerearnings, the product of his effort, should be spent on books he cannot read—oron subsidizing the airplane industry, if his own transportation needs do notextend beyond the range of a bicycle. (Nor is there any reason why the rest ofmankind should be held down to the level of his literary taste, his engineeringcapacity, and his income. Values are not determined by fiat nor by majorityvote.)Just as the number of its adherents is not a proof of an idea’s truth orfalsehood, of an art work’s merit or demerit, of a product’s efficacy orinefficacy—so the free-market value of goods or services does not necessarilyrepresent their philosophically objective value, but only their sociallyobjective value, i.e., the sum of the individual judgments of all the meninvolved in trade at a given time, the sum of what they valued, each in thecontext of his own life.Thus, a manufacturer of lipstick may well make a greater fortune than amanufacturer of microscopes—even though it can be rationally demonstrated thatmicroscopes are scientifically more valuable than lipstick. But—valuable towhom?A microscope is of no value to a little stenographer struggling to make aliving; a lipstick is; a lipstick, to her, may mean the difference betweenself-confidence and self-doubt, between glamour and drudgery.This does not mean, however, that the values ruling a free market aresubjective. If the stenographer spends all her money on cosmetics and has noneleft to pay for the use of a microscope (for a visit to the doctor) when sheneeds it, she learns a better method of budgeting her income; the free marketserves as her teacher: she has no way to penalize others for her mistakes. Ifshe budgets rationally, the microscope is always available to serve her ownspecific needs and no more, as far as she is concerned: she is not taxed tosupport an entire hospital, a research laboratory, or a space ship’s journey tothe moon. Within her own productive power, she does pay a part of the cost ofscientific achievements, when and as she needs them. She has no “social duty,”her own life is her only responsibility—and the only thing that a capitalistsystem requires of her is the thing that nature requires: rationality, i.e.,that she live and act to the best of her own judgment.Within every category of goods and services offered on a free market, it is thepurveyor of the best product at the cheapest price who wins the greatestfinancial rewards in that field—not automatically nor immediately nor by fiat,but by virtue of the free market, which teaches every participant to look forthe objective best within the category of his own competence, and penalizesthose who act on irrational considerations.Now observe that a free market does not level men down to some commondenominator—that the intellectual criteria of the majority do not rule a freemarket or a free society—and that the exceptional men, the innovators, theintellectual giants, are not held down by the majority. In fact, it is themembers of this exceptional minority who lift the whole of a free society to thelevel of their own achievements, while rising further and ever further.A free market is a continuous process that cannot be held still, an upwardprocess that demands the best (the most rational) of every man and rewards himaccordingly. While the majority have barely assimilated the value of theautomobile, the creative minority introduces the airplane. The majority learn bydemonstration, the minority are free to demonstrate. The “philosophicallyobjective” value of a new product serves as the teacher for those who arewilling to exercise their rational faculty, each to the extent of his ability.Those who are unwilling remain unrewarded—as well as those who aspire to morethan their ability produces. The stagnant, the irrational, the subjectivist haveno power to stop their betters.(The small minority of adults who are unable rather than unwilling to work haveto rely on voluntary charity; misfortune is not a claim to slave labor; there isno such thing as the right to consume, control, and destroy those without whomone would be unable to survive. As to depressions and mass unemployment, theyare not caused by the free market, but by government interference into theeconomy.)The mental parasites—the imitators who attempt to cater to what they think isthe public’s known taste—are constantly being beaten by the innovators whoseproducts raise the public’s knowledge and taste to ever higher levels. It is inthis sense that the free market is ruled, not by the consumers, but by theproducers. The most successful ones are those who discover new fields ofproduction, fields which had not been known to exist.A given product may not be appreciated at once, particularly if it is tooradical an innovation; but, barring irrelevant accidents, it wins in the longrun. It is in this sense that the free market is not ruled by the intellectualcriteria of the majority, which prevail only at and for any given moment; thefree market is ruled by those who are able to see and plan long-range—and thebetter the mind, the longer the range.The economic value of a man’s work is determined, on a free market, by a singleprinciple: by the voluntary consent of those who are willing to trade him theirwork or products in return. This is the moral meaning of the law of supply anddemand; it represents the total rejection of two vicious doctrines: the tribalpremise and altruism. It represents the recognition of the fact that man is notthe property nor the servant of the tribe, that a man works in order to supporthis own life—as, by his nature, he must—that he has to be guided by his ownrational self-interest, and if he wants to trade with others, he cannot expectsacrificial victims, i.e., he cannot expect to receive values without tradingcommensurate values in return. The sole criterion of what is commensurate, inthis context, is the free, voluntary, uncoerced judgment of the traders.The tribal mentalities attack this principle from two seemingly opposite sides:they claim that the free market is “unfair” both to the genius and to theaverage man. The first objection is usually expressed by a question such as:“Why should Elvis Presley make more money than Einstein?” The answer is: Becausemen work in order to support and enjoy their own lives—and if many men findvalue in Elvis Presley, they are entitled to spend their money on their ownpleasure. Presley’s fortune is not taken from those who do not care for his work(I am one of them) nor from Einstein—nor does he stand in Einstein’s way—nordoes Einstein lack proper recognition and support in a free society, on anappropriate intellectual level.As to the second objection, the claim that a man of average ability suffers an“unfair” disadvantage on a free market—Look past the range of the moment, you who cry that you fear to compete with menof superior intelligence, that their mind is a threat to your livelihood, thatthe strong leave no chance to the weak in a market of voluntary trade. . . .When you live in a rational society, where men are free to trade, you receive anincalculable bonus: the material value of your work is determined not only byyour effort, but by the effort of the best productive minds who exist in theworld around you. . . .The machine, the frozen form of a living intelligence, is the power that expandsthe potential of your life by raising the productivity of your time. . . . Everyman is free to rise as far as he’s able or willing, but it’s only the degree towhich he thinks that determines the degree to which he’ll rise. Physical laboras such can extend no further than the range of the moment. The man who does nomore than physical labor, consumes the material value-equivalent of his owncontribution to the process of production, and leaves no further value, neitherfor himself nor others. But the man who produces an idea in any field ofrational endeavor—the man who discovers new knowledge—is the permanentbenefactor of humanity. . . . It is only the value of an idea that can be sharedwith unlimited numbers of men, making all sharers richer at no one’s sacrificeor loss, raising the productive capacity of whatever labor they perform. . . .In proportion to the mental energy he spent, the man who creates a new inventionreceives but a small percentage of his value in terms of material payment, nomatter what fortune he makes, no matter what millions he earns. But the man whoworks as a janitor in the factory producing that invention, receives an enormouspayment in proportion to the mental effort that his job requires of him. And thesame is true of all men between, on all levels of ambition and ability. The manat the top of the intellectual pyramid contributes the most to all those belowhim, but gets nothing except his material payment, receiving no intellectualbonus from others to add to the value of his time. The man at the bottom who,left to himself, would starve in his hopeless ineptitude, contributes nothing tothose above him, but receives the bonus of all of their brains. Such is thenature of the “competition” between the strong and the weak of the intellect.Such is the pattern of “exploitation” for which you have damned the strong.(Atlas Shrugged)And such is the relationship of capitalism to man’s mind and to man’s survival.The magnificent progress achieved by capitalism in a brief span of time—thespectacular improvement in the conditions of man’s existence on earth—is amatter of historical record. It is not to be hidden, evaded, or explained awayby all the propaganda of capitalism’s enemies. But what needs special emphasisis the fact that this progress was achieved by non-sacrificial means.Progress cannot be achieved by forced privations, by squeezing a “socialsurplus” out of starving victims. Progress can come only out of individualsurplus, i.e., from the work, the energy, the creative over-abundance of thosemen whose ability produces more than their personal consumption requires, thosewho are intellectually and financially able to seek the new, to improve on theknown, to move forward. In a capitalist society, where such men are free tofunction and to take their own risks, progress is not a matter of sacrificing tosome distant future, it is part of the living present, it is the normal andnatural, it is achieved as and while men live—and enjoy—their lives.Now consider the alternative—the tribal society, where all men throw theirefforts, values, ambitions, and goals into a tribal pool or common pot, thenwait hungrily at its rim, while the leader of a clique of cooks stirs it with abayonet in one hand and a blank check on all their lives in the other. The mostconsistent example of such a system is the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.Half a century ago, the Soviet rulers commanded their subjects to be patient,bear privations, and make sacrifices for the sake of “industrializing” thecountry, promising that this was only temporary, that industrialization wouldbring them abundance, and Soviet progress would surpass the capitalistic West.Today, Soviet Russia is still unable to feed her people—while the rulersscramble to copy, borrow, or steal the technological achievements of the West.Industrialization is not a static goal; it is a dynamic process with a rapidrate of obsolescence. So the wretched serfs of a planned tribal economy, whostarved while waiting for electric generators and tractors, are now starvingwhile waiting for atomic power and interplanetary travel. Thus, in a “people’sstate,” the progress of science is a threat to the people, and every advance istaken out of the people’s shrinking hides.This was not the history of capitalism.America’s abundance was not created by public sacrifices to “the common good,”but by the productive genius of free men who pursued their own personalinterests and the making of their own private fortunes. They did not starve thepeople to pay for America’s industrialization. They gave the people better jobs,higher wages, and cheaper goods with every new machine they invented, with everyscientific discovery or technological advance—and thus the whole country wasmoving forward and profiting, not suffering, every step of the way.Do not, however, make the error of reversing cause and effect: the good of thecountry was made possible precisely by the fact that it was not forced on anyoneas a moral goal or duty; it was merely an effect; the cause was a man’s right topursue his own good. It is this right—not its consequences—that represents themoral justification of capitalism.But this right is incompatible with the intrinsic or the subjectivist theory ofvalues, with the altruist morality and the tribal premise. It is obvious whichhuman attribute one rejects when one rejects objectivity; and, in view ofcapitalism’s record, it is obvious against which human attribute the altruistmorality and the tribal premise stand united: against man’s mind, againstintelligence—particularly against intelligence applied to the problems of humansurvival, i.e., productive ability.While altruism seeks to rob intelligence of its rewards, by asserting that themoral duty of the competent is to serve the incompetent and sacrifice themselvesto anyone’s need—the tribal premise goes a step further: it denies the existenceof intelligence and of its role in the production of wealth.It is morally obscene to regard wealth as an anonymous, tribal product and totalk about “redistributing” it. The view that wealth is the result of someundifferentiated, collective process, that we all did something and it’simpossible to tell who did what, therefore some sort of equalitarian“distribution” is necessary—might have been appropriate in a primordial junglewith a savage horde moving boulders by crude physical labor (though even theresomeone had to initiate and organize the moving). To hold that view in anindustrial society—where individual achievements are a matter of publicrecord—is so crass an evasion that even to give it the benefit of the doubt isan obscenity.Anyone who has ever been an employer or an employee, or has observed menworking, or has done an honest day’s work himself, knows the crucial role ofability, of intelligence, of a focused, competent mind—in any and all lines ofwork, from the lowest to the highest. He knows that ability or the lack of it(whether the lack is actual or volitional) makes a difference of life-or-deathin any productive process. The evidence is so overwhelming— theoretically andpractically, logically and “empirically,” in the events of history and inanyone’s own daily grind—that no one can claim ignorance of it. Mistakes of thissize are not made innocently.When great industrialists made fortunes on a free market (i.e., without the useof force, without government assistance or interference), they created newwealth—they did not take it from those who had not created it. If you doubt it,take a look at the “total social product”—and the standard of living—of thosecountries where such men are not permitted to exist.Observe how seldom and how inadequately the issue of human intelligence isdiscussed in the writings of the tribal-statist-altruist theoreticians. Observehow carefully today’s advocates of a mixed economy avoid and evade any mentionof intelligence or ability in their approach to politico-economic issues, intheir claims, demands, and pressure-group warfare over the looting of “the totalsocial product.”It is often asked: Why was capitalism destroyed in spite of its incomparablybeneficent record? The answer lies in the fact that the lifeline feeding anysocial system is a culture’s dominant philosophy and that capitalism never had aphilosophical base. It was the last and (theoretically) incomplete product of anAristotelian influence. As a resurgent tide of mysticism engulfed philosophy inthe nineteenth century, capitalism was left in an intellectual vacuum, itslifeline cut. Neither its moral nature nor even its political principles hadever been fully understood or defined. Its alleged defenders regarded it ascompatible with government controls (i.e., government interference into theeconomy), ignoring the meaning and implications of the concept of laissez-faire.Thus, what existed in practice, in the nineteenth century, was not purecapitalism, but variously mixed economies. Since controls necessitate and breedfurther controls, it was the statist element of the mixtures that wrecked them;it was the free, capitalist element that took the blame.Capitalism could not survive in a culture dominated by mysticism and altruism,by the soul-body dichotomy and the tribal premise. No social system (and nohuman institution or activity of any kind) can survive without a moral base. Onthe basis of the altruist morality, capitalism had to be—and was—damned from thestart.5 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-5]For those who do not fully understand the role of philosophy inpolitico-economic issues, I offer—as the clearest example of today’sintellectual state—some further quotations from the Encyclopaedia Britannica’sarticle on capitalism.Few observers are inclined to find fault with capitalism as an engine ofproduction. Criticism usually proceeds either from moral or cultural disapprovalof certain features of the capitalist system, or from the short-run vicissitudes(crises and depressions) with which long-run improvement is interspersed.[Italics mine.]The “crises and depressions” were caused by government interference, not by thecapitalist system. But what was the nature of the “moral or culturaldisapproval”? The article does not tell us explicitly, but gives one eloquentindication:Such as they were, however, both tendencies and realizations [of capitalism]bear the unmistakable stamp of the businessman’s interests and still more thebusinessman’s type of mind. Moreover it was not only policy but the philosophyof national and individual life, the scheme of cultural values, that bore thatstamp. Its materialistic utilitarianism, its naive confidence in progress of acertain type, its actual achievements in the field of pure and applied science,the temper of its artistic creations, may all be traced to the spirit ofrationalism that emanates from the businessman’s office. [Italics mine.]The author of the article, who is not “naive” enough to believe in acapitalistic (or rational) type of progress, holds, apparently, a differentbelief:At the end of the middle ages western Europe stood about where manyunderdeveloped countries stand in the 20th century. [This means that the cultureof the Renaissance was about the equivalent of today’s Congo; or else, it meansthat people’s intellectual development has nothing to do with economics.] Inunderdeveloped economies the difficult task of statesmanship is to get under waya cumulative process of economic development, for once a certain momentum isattained, further advances appear to follow more or less automatically.Some such notion underlies every theory of a planned economy. It is on some such“sophisticated” belief that two generations of Russians have perished, waitingfor automatic progress.The classical economists attempted a tribal justification of capitalism on theground that it provides the best “allocation” of a community’s “resources.” Hereare their chickens coming home to roost:The market theory of resource allocation within the private sector is thecentral theme of classical economics. The criterion for allocation between thepublic and private sectors is formally the same as in any other resourceallocation, namely that the community should receive equal satisfaction from amarginal increment of resources used in the public and private spheres. . . .Many economists have asserted that there is substantial, perhaps overwhelming,evidence that total welfare in capitalist United States, for example, would beincreased by a reallocation of resources to the public sector—more schoolroomsand fewer shopping centers, more public libraries and fewer automobiles, morehospitals and fewer bowling alleys.This means that some men must toil all their lives without adequatetransportation (automobiles), without an adequate number of places to buy thegoods they need (shopping centers), without the pleasures of relaxation (bowlingalleys)—in order that other men may be provided with schools, libraries, andhospitals.If you want to see the ultimate results and full meaning of the tribal view ofwealth—the total obliteration of the distinction between private action andgovernment action, between production and force, the total obliteration of theconcept of “rights,” of an individual human being’s reality, and its replacementby a view of men as interchangeable beasts of burden or “factors ofproduction”—study the following:Capitalism has a bias against the public sector for two reasons. First, allproducts and income accrue [?] initially to the private sector while resourcesreach the public sector through the painful process of taxation. Public needsare met only by sufferance of consumers in their role as taxpayers [what aboutproducers?], whose political representatives are acutely conscious of theirconstituents’ tender feelings [!] about taxation. That people know better thangovernments what to do with their income is a notion more appealing than thecontrary one, that people get more for their tax money than for other types ofspending. [By what theory of values? By whose judgment?] . . .Second, the pressure of private business to sell leads to the formidable arrayof devices of modern salesmanship which influence consumer choice and biasconsumer values toward private consumption . . . [This means that your desire tospend the money you earn rather than have it taken away from you, is a merebias.] Hence, much private expenditure goes for wants that are not very urgentin any fundamental sense. [Urgent—to whom? Which wants are “fundamental,” beyonda cave, a bearskin, and a chunk of raw meat?] The corollary is that many publicneeds are neglected because these superficial private wants, artificiallygenerated, compete successfully for the same resources. [Whose resources?] . . .A comparison of resource allocation to the public and private sectors undercapitalism and under socialist collectivism is illuminating. [It is.] In acollective economy all resources operate in the public sector and are availablefor education, defense, health, welfare, and other public needs without anytransfer through taxation. Private consumption is restricted to the claims thatare permitted [by whom?] against the social product, much as public services ina capitalist economy are limited to the claims permitted against the privatesector. [Italics mine.] In a collective economy public needs enjoy the same sortof built-in priority that private consumption enjoys in a capitalist economy. Inthe Soviet Union teachers are plentiful, but automobiles are scarce, whereas theopposite condition prevails in the United States.Here is the conclusion of that article:Predictions concerning the survival of capitalism are, in part, a matter ofdefinition. One sees everywhere in capitalist countries a shifting of economicactivity from the private to the public sphere. . . . At the same time [afterWorld War II] private consumption appeared destined to increase in communistcountries. [Such as the consumption of wheat?] The two economic systems seemedto be drawing closer together by changes converging from both directions. Yetsignificant differences in the economic structures still existed. It seemedreasonable to assume that the society which invested more in people wouldadvance more rapidly and inherit the future. In this important respectcapitalism, in the eyes of some economists, labours under a fundamental but notinescapable disadvantage in competition with collectivism.The collectivization of Soviet agriculture was achieved by means of agovernment-planned famine—planned and carried out deliberately to force peasantsinto collective farms; Soviet Russia’s enemies claim that fifteen millionpeasants died in that famine; the Soviet government admits the death of sevenmillion.At the end of World War II, Soviet Russia’s enemies claimed that thirty millionpeople were doing forced labor in Soviet concentration camps (and were dying ofplanned malnutrition, human lives being cheaper than food); Soviet Russia’sapologists admit to the figure of twelve million people.This is what the Encyclopaedia Britannica refers to as “investment in people.”In a culture where such a statement is made with intellectual impunity and withan aura of moral righteousness, the guiltiest men are not the collectivists; theguiltiest men are those who, lacking the courage to challenge mysticism oraltruism, attempt to bypass the issues of reason and morality and to defend theonly rational and moral system in mankind’s history—capitalism—on any groundsother than rational and moral."},{"pageContent":"2. THE ROOTS OF WARby Ayn Rand It is said that nuclear weapons have made wars too horrible to contemplate. Yetevery nation on earth feels, in helpless terror, that such a war might come.The overwhelming majority of mankind—the people who die on the battlefields orstarve and perish among the ruins—do not want war. They never wanted it. Yetwars have kept erupting throughout the centuries, like a long trail of bloodunderscoring mankind’s history.Men are afraid that war might come because they know, consciously orsubconsciously, that they have never rejected the doctrine which causes wars,which has caused the wars of the past and can do it again—the doctrine that itis right or practical or necessary for men to achieve their goals by means ofphysical force (by initiating the use of force against other men) and that somesort of “good” can justify it. It is the doctrine that force is a proper orunavoidable part of human existence and human societies.Observe one of the ugliest characteristics of today’s world: the mixture offrantic war preparations with hysterical peace propaganda, and the fact thatboth come from the same source—from the same political philosophy. The bankrupt,yet still dominant, political philosophy of our age is statism.The Objectivist, June 1966.Observe the nature of today’s alleged peace movements. Professing love andconcern for the survival of mankind, they keep screaming that thenuclear-weapons race should be stopped, that armed force should be abolished asa means of settling disputes among nations, and that war should be outlawed inthe name of humanity. Yet these same peace movements do not opposedictatorships; the political views of their members range through all shades ofthe statist spectrum, from welfare statism to socialism to fascism to communism.This means that they are opposed to the use of coercion by one nation againstanother, but not by the government of a nation against its own citizens; itmeans that they are opposed to the use of force against armed adversaries, butnot against the disarmed.Consider the plunder, the destruction, the starvation, the brutality, theslave-labor camps, the torture chambers, the wholesale slaughter perpetrated bydictatorships. Yet this is what today’s alleged peace-lovers are willing toadvocate or tolerate—in the name of love for humanity.It is obvious that the ideological root of statism (or collectivism) is thetribal premise of primordial savages who, unable to conceive of individualrights, believed that the tribe is a supreme, omnipotent ruler, that it owns thelives of its members and may sacrifice them whenever it pleases to whatever itdeems to be its own “good.” Unable to conceive of any social principles, savethe rule of brute force, they believed that the tribe’s wishes are limited onlyby its physical power and that other tribes are its natural prey, to beconquered, looted, enslaved, or annihilated. The history of all primitivepeoples is a succession of tribal wars and intertribal slaughter. That thissavage ideology now rules nations armed with nuclear weapons should give pauseto anyone concerned with mankind’s survival.Statism is a system of institutionalized violence and perpetual civil war. Itleaves men no choice but to fight to seize political power—to rob or be robbed,to kill or be killed. When brute force is the only criterion of social conduct,and unresisting surrender to destruction is the only alternative, even thelowest of men, even an animal—even a cornered rat—will fight. There can be nopeace within an enslaved nation.The bloodiest conflicts of history were not wars between nations, but civil warsbetween men of the same nation, who could find no peaceful recourse to law,principle, or justice. Observe that the history of all absolute states ispunctuated by bloody uprisings—by violent eruptions of blind despair, withoutideology, program, or goals—which were usually put down by ruthlessextermination.In a full dictatorship, statism’s chronic “cold” civil war takes the form ofbloody purges, when one gang deposes another—as in Nazi Germany or SovietRussia. In a mixed economy, it takes the form of pressure-group warfare, eachgroup fighting for legislation to extort its own advantages by force from allother groups.The degree of statism in a country’s political system, is the degree to which itbreaks up the country into rival gangs and sets men against one another. Whenindividual rights are abrogated, there is no way to determine who is entitled towhat; there is no way to determine the justice of anyone’s claims, desires, orinterests. The criterion, therefore, reverts to the tribal concept of: one’swishes are limited only by the power of one’s gang. In order to survive undersuch a system, men have no choice but to fear, hate, and destroy one another; itis a system of underground plotting, of secret conspiracies, of deals, favors,betrayals, and sudden, bloody coups.It is not a system conducive to brotherhood, security, cooperation, and peace.Statism—in fact and in principle—is nothing more than gang rule. A dictatorshipis a gang devoted to looting the effort of the productive citizens of its owncountry. When a statist ruler exhausts his own country’s economy, he attacks hisneighbors. It is his only means of postponing internal collapse and prolonginghis rule. A country that violates the rights of its own citizens, will notrespect the rights of its neighbors. Those who do not recognize individualrights, will not recognize the rights of nations: a nation is only a number ofindividuals.Statism needs war; a free country does not. Statism survives by looting; a freecountry survives by production.Observe that the major wars of history were started by the more controlledeconomies of the time against the freer ones. For instance, World War I wasstarted by monarchist Germany and Czarist Russia, who dragged in their freerallies. World War II was started by the alliance of Nazi Germany with SovietRussia and their joint attack on Poland.Observe that in World War II, both Germany and Russia seized and dismantledentire factories in conquered countries, to ship them home—while the freest ofthe mixed economies, the semi-capitalistic United States, sent billions worth oflend-lease equipment, including entire factories, to its allies.6[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-6]Germany and Russia needed war; the United States did not and gained nothing. (Infact, the United States lost, economically, even though it won the war: it wasleft with an enormous national debt, augmented by the grotesquely futile policyof supporting former allies and enemies to this day.) Yet it is capitalism thattoday’s peace-lovers oppose and statism that they advocate—in the name of peace.Laissez-faire capitalism is the only social system based on the recognition ofindividual rights and, therefore, the only system that bans force from socialrelationships. By the nature of its basic principles and interests, it is theonly system fundamentally opposed to war.Men who are free to produce have no incentive to loot; they have nothing to gainfrom war and a great deal to lose. Ideologically, the principle of individualrights does not permit a man to seek his own livelihood at the point of a gun,inside or outside his country. Economically, wars cost money; in a free economy,where wealth is privately owned, the costs of war come out of the income ofprivate citizens—there is no overblown public treasury to hide that fact—and acitizen cannot hope to recoup his own financial losses (such as taxes orbusiness dislocations or property destruction) by winning the war. Thus his owneconomic interests are on the side of peace.In a statist economy, where wealth is “publicly owned,” a citizen has noeconomic interests to protect by preserving peace—he is only a drop in thecommon bucket—while war gives him the (fallacious) hope of larger handouts fromhis masters. Ideologically, he is trained to regard men as sacrificial animals;he is one himself; he can have no concept of why foreigners should not besacrificed on the same public altar for the benefit of the same state.The trader and the warrior have been fundamental antagonists throughout history.Trade does not flourish on battlefields, factories do not produce underbombardments, profits do not grow on rubble. Capitalism is a society oftraders—for which it has been denounced by every would-be gunman who regardstrade as “selfish” and conquest as “noble.”Let those who are actually concerned with peace observe that capitalism gavemankind the longest period of peace in history—a period during which there wereno wars involving the entire civilized world—from the end of the Napoleonic warsin 1815 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914.It must be remembered that the political systems of the nineteenth century werenot pure capitalism, but mixed economies. The element of freedom, however, wasdominant; it was as close to a century of capitalism as mankind has come. Butthe element of statism kept growing throughout the nineteenth century, and bythe time it blasted the world in 1914, the governments involved were dominatedby statist policies.Just as, in domestic affairs, all the evils caused by statism and governmentcontrols were blamed on capitalism and the free market—so, in foreign affairs,all the evils of statist policies were blamed on and ascribed to capitalism.Such myths as “capitalistic imperialism,” “warprofiteering,” or the notion thatcapitalism has to win “markets” by military conquest are examples of thesuperficiality or the unscrupulousness of statist commentators and historians.The essence of capitalism’s foreign policy is free trade—i.e., the abolition oftrade barriers, of protective tariffs, of special privileges—the opening of theworld’s trade routes to free international exchange and competition among theprivate citizens of all countries dealing directly with one another. During thenineteenth century, it was free trade that liberated the world, undercutting andwrecking the remnants of feudalism and the statist tyranny of absolutemonarchies.As with Rome, the world accepted the British empire because it opened worldchannels of energy for commerce in general. Though repressive (status)government was still imposed to a considerable degree on Ireland with very badresults, on the whole England’s invisible exports were law and free trade.Practically speaking, while England ruled the seas any man of any nation couldgo anywhere, taking his goods and money with him, in safety.7[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-7]As in the case of Rome, when the repressive element of England’s mixed economygrew to become her dominant policy and turned her to statism, her empire fellapart. It was not military force that had held it together.Capitalism wins and holds its markets by free competition, at home and abroad. Amarket conquered by war can be of value (temporarily) only to those advocates ofa mixed economy who seek to close it to international competition, imposerestrictive regulations, and thus acquire special privileges by force. The sametype of businessmen who sought special advantages by government action in theirown countries sought special markets by government action abroad. At whoseexpense? At the expense of the overwhelming majority of businessmen who paid thetaxes for such ventures, but gained nothing. Who justified such policies andsold them to the public? The statist intellectuals who manufactured suchdoctrines as “the public interest” or “national prestige” or “manifest destiny.”The actual war profiteers of all mixed economies were and are of that type: menwith political pull who acquire fortunes by government favor, during or after awar—fortunes which they could not have acquired on a free market.Remember that private citizens—whether rich or poor, whether businessmen orworkers—have no power to start a war. That power is the exclusive prerogative ofa government. Which type of government is more likely to plunge a country intowar: a government of limited powers, bound by constitutional restrictions—or anunlimited government, open to the pressure of any group with warlike interestsor ideologies, a government able to command armies to march at the whim of asingle chief executive?Yet it is not a limited government that today’s peace-lovers are advocating.(Needless to say, unilateral pacifism is merely an invitation to aggression.Just as an individual has the right of self-defense, so has a free country ifattacked. But this does not give its government the right to draft men intomilitary service—which is the most blatantly statist violation of a man’s rightto his own life. There is no contradiction between the moral and the practical:a volunteer army is the most efficient army, as many military authorities havetestified. A free country has never lacked volunteers when attacked by a foreignaggressor. But not many men would volunteer for such ventures as Korea orVietnam. Without drafted armies, the foreign policies of statist or mixedeconomies would not be possible.)So long as a country is even semi-free, its mixed-economy profiteers are not thesource of its warlike influences or policies, and are not the primary cause ofits involvement in war. They are merely political scavengers cashing-in on apublic trend. The primary cause of that trend is the mixed-economyintellectuals.Observe the link between statism and militarism in the intellectual history ofthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Just as the destruction of capitalismand the rise of the totalitarian state were not caused by business or labor orany economic interests, but by the dominant statist ideology of theintellectuals—so the resurgence of the doctrines of military conquest and armedcrusades for political “ideals” were the product of the same intellectuals’belief that “the good” is to be achieved by force.The rise of a spirit of nationalistic imperialism in the United States did notcome from the right, but from the left, not from big-business interests, butfrom the collectivist reformers who influenced the policies of TheodoreRoosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. For a history of these influences, see The Declineof American Liberalism by Arthur A. Ekirch, Jr.8[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-8]In such instances [writes Professor Ekirch] as the progressives’ increasingacceptance of compulsory military training and of the white man’s burden, therewere obvious reminders of the paternalism of much of their economic reformlegislation. Imperialism, according to a recent student of American foreignpolicy, was a revolt against many of the values of traditional liberalism. “Thespirit of imperialism was an exaltation of duty above rights, of collectivewelfare above individual self-interest, the heroic values as opposed tomaterialism, action instead of logic, the natural impulse rather than the pallidintellect.”9 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-9]In regard to Woodrow Wilson, Professor Ekirch writes:Wilson no doubt would have preferred the growth of United States foreign tradeto come about as a result of free international competition, but he found iteasy with his ideas of moralism and duty to rationalize direct Americanintervention as a means of safeguarding the national interest.10[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-10]And: “He [Wilson] seemed to feel that the United States had a mission to spreadits institutions—which he conceived as liberal and democratic—to the morebenighted areas of the world.”11 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-11] Itwas not the advocates of capitalism who helped Wilson to whip up a reluctant,peace-loving nation into the hysteria of a military crusade—it was the “liberal”magazine The New Republic. Its editor, Herbert Croly, used such arguments as:“The American nation needs the tonic of a serious moral adventure.”Just as Wilson, a “liberal” reformer, led the United States into World War I,“to make the world safe for democracy”—so Franklin D. Roosevelt, another“liberal” reformer, led it into World War II, in the name of the “FourFreedoms.” In both cases, the “conservatives”—and the big-businessinterests—were overwhelmingly opposed to war but were silenced. In the case ofWorld War II, they were smeared as “isolationists,” “reactionaries,” and“America-First’ers.”World War I led, not to “democracy,” but to the creation of three dictatorships:Soviet Russia, Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany. World War II led, not to “FourFreedoms,” but to the surrender of one-third of the world’s population intocommunist slavery.If peace were the goal of today’s intellectuals, a failure of that magnitude—andthe evidence of unspeakable suffering on so large a scale—would make them pauseand check their statist premises. Instead, blind to everything but their hatredfor capitalism, they are now asserting that “poverty breeds wars” (andjustifying war by sympathizing with a “material greed” of that kind). But thequestion is: what breeds poverty? If you look at the world of today and if youlook back at history, you will see the answer: the degree of a country’s freedomis the degree of its prosperity.Another current catch-phrase is the complaint that the nations of the world aredivided into the “haves” and the “have-nots.” Observe that the “haves” are thosewho have freedom, and that it is freedom that the “havenots” have not.If men want to oppose war, it is statism that they must oppose. So long as theyhold the tribal notion that the individual is sacrificial fodder for thecollective, that some men have the right to rule others by force, and that some(any) alleged “good” can justify it—there can be no peace within a nation and nopeace among nations.It is true that nuclear weapons have made wars too horrible to contemplate. Butit makes no difference to a man whether he is killed by a nuclear bomb or adynamite bomb or an old-fashioned club. Nor does the number of other victims orthe scale of the destruction make any difference to him. And there is somethingobscene in the attitude of those who regard horror as a matter of numbers, whoare willing to send a small group of youths to die for the tribe, but screamagainst the danger to the tribe itself—and more: who are willing to condone theslaughter of defenseless victims, but march in protest against wars between thewell-armed.So long as men are subjugated by force, they will fight back and use any weaponsavailable. If a man is led to a Nazi gas chamber or a Soviet firing squad, withno voices raised to defend him, would he feel any love or concern for thesurvival of mankind? Or would he be more justified in feeling that acannibalistic mankind, which tolerates dictatorships, does not deserve tosurvive?If nuclear weapons are a dreadful threat and mankind cannot afford war anylonger, then mankind cannot afford statism any longer. Let no man of good willtake it upon his conscience to advocate the rule of force—outside or inside hisown country. Let all those who are actually concerned with peace—those who dolove man and do care about his survival—realize that if war is ever to beoutlawed, it is the use of force that has to be outlawed."},{"pageContent":"3. AMERICA’S PERSECUTED MINORITY: BIG BUSINESSby Ayn Rand If a small group of men were always regarded as guilty, in any clash with anyother group, regardless of the issues or circumstances involved, would you callit persecution? If this group were always made to pay for the sins, errors, orfailures of any other group, would you call that persecution? If this group hadto live under a silent reign of terror, under special laws, from which all otherpeople were immune, laws which the accused could not grasp or define in advanceand which the accuser could interpret in any way he pleased—would you call thatpersecution? If this group were penalized, not for its faults, but for itsvirtues, not for its incompetence, but for its ability, not for its failures,but for its achievements, and the greater the achievement, the greater thepenalty—would you call that persecution?If your answer is “yes”—then ask yourself what sort of monstrous injustice youare condoning, supporting, or perpetrating. That group is the Americanbusinessmen.The defense of minority rights is acclaimed today, virtually by everyone, as amoral principle of a high order. But this principle, which forbidsdiscrimination, is ap-plied by most of the “liberal” intellectuals in adiscriminatory manner: it is applied only to racial or religious minorities. Itis not applied to that small, exploited, denounced, defenseless minority whichconsists of businessmen.Lecture given at The Ford Hall Forum, Boston, on December 17, 1961, and atColumbia University on February 15, 1962. Published by Nathaniel BrandenInstitute, New York, 1962.Yet every ugly, brutal aspect of injustice toward racial or religious minoritiesis being practiced toward businessmen. For instance, consider the evil ofcondemning some men and absolving others, without a hearing, regardless of thefacts. Today’s “liberals” consider a businessman guilty in any conflict with alabor union, regardless of the facts or issues involved, and boast that theywill not cross a picket line “right or wrong.” Consider the evil of judgingpeople by a double standard and of denying to some the rights granted to others.Today’s “liberals” recognize the workers’ (the majority’s) right to theirlivelihood (their wages), but deny the businessmen’s (the minority’s) right totheir livelihood (their profits). If workers struggle for higher wages, this ishailed as “social gains”; if businessmen struggle for higher profits, this isdamned as “selfish greed.” If the workers’ standard of living is low, the“liberals” blame it on the businessmen; but if the businessmen attempt toimprove their economic efficacy, to expand their markets, and to enlarge thefinancial returns of their enterprises, thus making higher wages and lowerprices possible, the same “liberals” denounce it as “commercialism.” If anon-commercial foundation—i.e., a group which did not have to earn itsfunds—sponsors a television show, advocating its particular views, the“liberals” hail it as “enlightenment,” “education,” “art,” and “public service”;if a businessman sponsors a television show and wants it to reflect his views,the “liberals” scream, calling it “censorship,” “pressure,” and “dictatorialrule.” When three locals of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters deprivedNew York City of its milk supply for fifteen days—no moral indignation orcondemnation was heard from the “liberal” quarters; but just imagine what wouldhappen if businessmen stopped that milk supply for one hour—and how swiftly theywould be struck down by that legalized lynching or pogrom known as“trust-busting.”Whenever, in any era, culture, or society, you encounter the phenomenon ofprejudice, injustice, persecution, and blind, unreasoning hatred directed atsome minority group—look for the gang that has something to gain from thatpersecution, look for those who have a vested interest in the destruction ofthese particular sacrificial victims. Invariably, you will find that thepersecuted minority serves as a scapegoat for some movement that does not wantthe nature of its own goals to be known. Every movement that seeks to enslave acountry, every dictatorship or potential dictatorship, needs some minority groupas a scapegoat which it can blame for the nation’s troubles and use as ajustification of its own demands for dictatorial powers. In Soviet Russia, thescapegoat was the bourgeoisie; in Nazi Germany, it was the Jewish people; inAmerica, it is the businessmen.America has not yet reached the stage of a dictatorship. But, paving the way toit, for many decades past, the businessmen have served as the scapegoat forstatist movements of all kinds: communist, fascist, or welfare. For whose sinsand evils did the businessmen take the blame? For the sins and evils of thebureaucrats.A disastrous intellectual package-deal, put over on us by the theoreticians ofstatism, is the equation of economic power with political power. You have heardit expressed in such bromides as: “A hungry man is not free,” or “It makes nodifference to a worker whether he takes orders from a businessman or from abureaucrat.” Most people accept these equivocations—and yet they know that thepoorest laborer in America is freer and more secure than the richest commissarin Soviet Russia. What is the basic, the essential, the crucial principle thatdifferentiates freedom from slavery? It is the principle of voluntary actionversus physical coercion or compulsion.The difference between political power and any other kind of social “power,”between a government and any private organization, is the fact that a governmentholds a legal monopoly on the use of physical force. This distinction is soimportant and so seldom recognized today that I must urge you to keep it inmind. Let me repeat it: a government holds a legal monopoly on the use ofphysical force.No individual or private group or private organization has the legal power toinitiate the use of physical force against other individuals or groups and tocompel them to act against their own voluntary choice. Only a government holdsthat power. The nature of governmental action is: coercive action. The nature ofpolitical power is: the power to force obedience under threat of physicalinjury—the threat of property expropriation, imprisonment, or death.Foggy metaphors, sloppy images, unfocused poetry, and equivocations—such as “Ahungry man is not free”—do not alter the fact that only political power is thepower of physical coercion and that freedom, in a political context, has onlyone meaning: the absence of physical coercion.The only proper function of the government of a free country is to act as anagency which protects the individual’s rights, i.e., which protects theindividual from physical violence. Such a government does not have the right toinitiate the use of physical force against anyone—a right which the individualdoes not possess and, therefore, cannot delegate to any agency. But theindividual does possess the right of self-defense and that is the right which hedelegates to the government, for the purpose of an orderly, legally definedenforcement. A proper government has the right to use physical force only inretaliation and only against those who initiate its use. The proper functions ofa government are: the police, to protect men from criminals; the militaryforces, to protect men from foreign invaders; and the law courts, to protectmen’s property and contracts from breach by force or fraud, and to settledisputes among men according to objectively defined laws.These, implicitly, were the political principles on which the Constitution ofthe United States was based; implicitly, but not explicitly. There werecontradictions in the Constitution, which allowed the statists to gain anentering wedge, to enlarge the breach, and, gradually, to wreck the structure.A statist is a man who believes that some men have the right to force, coerce,enslave, rob, and murder others. To be put into practice, this belief has to beimplemented by the political doctrine that the government—the state—has theright to initiate the use of physical force against its citizens. How oftenforce is to be used, against whom, to what extent, for what purpose and forwhose benefit are irrelevant questions. The basic principle and the ultimateresults of all statist doctrines are the same: dictatorship and destruction. Therest is only a matter of time.Now let us consider the question of economic power.What is economic power? It is the power to produce and to trade what one hasproduced. In a free economy, where no man or group of men can use physicalcoercion against anyone, economic power can be achieved only by voluntary means:by the voluntary choice and agreement of all those who participate in theprocess of production and trade. In a free market, all prices, wages, andprofits are determined—not by the arbitrary whim of the rich or of the poor, notby anyone’s “greed” or by anyone’s need—but by the law of supply and demand. Themechanism of a free market reflects and sums up all the economic choices anddecisions made by all the participants. Men trade their goods or services bymutual consent to mutual advantage, according to their own independent,uncoerced judgment. A man can grow rich only if he is able to offer bettervalues—better products or services, at a lower price—than others are able tooffer.Wealth, in a free market, is achieved by a free, general, “democratic” vote—bythe sales and the purchases of every individual who takes part in the economiclife of the country. Whenever you buy one product rather than another, you arevoting for the success of some manufacturer. And, in this type of voting, everyman votes only on those matters which he is qualified to judge: on his ownpreferences, interests, and needs. No one has the power to decide for others orto substitute his judgment for theirs; no one has the power to appoint himself“the voice of the public” and to leave the public voiceless and disfranchised.Now let me define the difference between economic power and political power:economic power is exercised by means of a positive, by offering men a reward, anincentive, a payment, a value; political power is exercised by means of anegative, by the threat of punishment, injury, imprisonment, destruction. Thebusinessman’s tool is values; the bureaucrat’s tool is fear.America’s industrial progress, in the short span of a century and a half, hasacquired the character of a legend: it has never been equaled anywhere on earth,in any period of history. The American businessmen, as a class, havedemonstrated the greatest productive genius and the most spectacularachievements ever recorded in the economic history of mankind. What reward didthey receive from our culture and its intellectuals? The position of a hated,persecuted minority. The position of a scapegoat for the evils of thebureaucrats.A system of pure, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism has never yet existedanywhere. What did exist were only so-called mixed economies, which means: amixture, in varying degrees, of freedom and controls, of voluntary choice andgovernment coercion, of capitalism and statism. America was the freest countryon earth, but elements of statism were present in her economy from the start.These elements kept growing, under the influence of her intellectuals who werepredominantly committed to the philosophy of statism. The intellectuals—theideologists, the interpreters, the assessors of public events—were tempted bythe opportunity to seize political power, relinquished by all other socialgroups, and to establish their own versions of a “good” society at the point ofa gun, i.e., by means of legalized physical coercion. They denounced the freebusinessmen as exponents of “selfish greed” and glorified the bureaucrats as“public servants.” In evaluating social problems, they kept damning “economicpower” and exonerating political power, thus switching the burden of guilt fromthe politicians to the businessmen.All the evils, abuses, and iniquities, popularly ascribed to businessmen and tocapitalism, were not caused by an unregulated economy or by a free market, butby government intervention into the economy. The giants of Americanindustry—such as James Jerome Hill or Commodore Vanderbilt or Andrew Carnegie orJ. P. Morgan—were self-made men who earned their fortunes by personal ability,by free trade on a free market. But there existed another kind of businessmen,the products of a mixed economy, the men with political pull, who made fortunesby means of special privileges granted to them by the government, such men asthe Big Four of the Central Pacific Railroad. It was the political power behindtheir activities—the power of forced, unearned, economically unjustifiedprivileges—that caused dislocations in the country’s economy, hardships,depressions, and mounting public protests. But it was the free market and thefree businessmen that took the blame. Every calamitous consequence of governmentcontrols was used as a justification for the extension of the controls and ofthe government’s power over the economy.If I were asked to choose the date which marks the turning point on the road tothe ultimate destruction of American industry, and the most infamous piece oflegislation in American history, I would choose the year 1890 and the ShermanAct—which began that grotesque, irrational, malignant growth of unenforceable,uncompliable, unjudicable contradictions known as the antitrust laws.Under the antitrust laws, a man becomes a criminal from the moment he goes intobusiness, no matter what he does. If he complies with one of these laws, hefaces criminal prosecution under several others. For instance, if he chargesprices which some bureaucrats judge as too high, he can be prosecuted formonopoly, or, rather, for a successful “intent to monopolize”; if he chargesprices lower than those of his competitors, he can be prosecuted for “unfaircompetition” or “restraint of trade”; and if he charges the same prices as hiscompetitors, he can be prosecuted for “collusion” or “conspiracy.”I recommend to your attention an excellent book entitled The Antitrust Laws ofthe U.S.A. by A. D. Neale.12 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-12] It is ascholarly, dispassionate, objective study; the author, a British civil servant,is not a champion of free enterprise; as far as one can tell, he may probably beclassified as a “liberal.” But he does not confuse facts with interpretations,he keeps them severely apart; and the facts he presents are a horror story.Mr. Neale points out that the prohibition of “restraint of trade” is the essenceof antitrust—and that no exact definition of what constitutes “restraint oftrade” can be given. Thus no one can tell what the law forbids or permits one todo; the interpretation of these laws is left entirely up to the courts. Abusinessman or his lawyer has to study the whole body of the so-called caselaw—the whole record of court cases, precedents, and decisions—in order to geteven a generalized idea of the current meaning of these laws; except that theprecedents may be upset and the decisions reversed tomorrow or next week or nextyear. “The courts in the United States have been engaged ever since 1890 indeciding case by case exactly what the law proscribes. No broad definition canreally unlock the meaning of the statute. . .”13[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-13]This means that a businessman has no way of knowing in advance whether theaction he takes is legal or illegal, whether he is guilty or innocent. It meansthat a businessman has to live under the threat of a sudden, unpredictabledisaster, taking the risk of losing everything he owns or being sentenced tojail, with his career, his reputation, his property, his fortune, theachievement of his whole lifetime left at the mercy of any ambitious youngbureaucrat who, for any reason, public or private, may choose to startproceedings against him.Retroactive (or ex post facto) law—i.e., a law that punishes a man for an actionwhich was not legally defined as a crime at the time he committed it—is rejectedby and contrary to the entire tradition of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence. It is aform of persecution practiced only in dictatorships and forbidden by everycivilized code of law. It is specifically forbidden by the United StatesConstitution. It is not supposed to exist in the United States and it is notapplied to anyone—except to businessmen. A case in which a man cannot know untilhe is convicted whether the action he took in the past was legal or illegal iscertainly a case of retroactive law.I recommend to you a brilliant little book entitled Ten Thousand Commandments byHarold Fleming.14 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-14] It is written forthe layman and presents—in clear, simple, logical terms, with a wealth ofdetailed, documented evidence—such a picture of the antitrust laws that“nightmare” is too feeble a word to describe it.One of the hazards [writes Mr. Fleming] that sales managers must now take intoaccount is that some policy followed today in the light of the best legalopinion may next year be reinterpreted as illegal. In such case the crime andthe penalty may be retroactive. . . . Another kind of hazard consists in thepossibility of treble damage suits, also possibly retroactive. Firms which, withthe best of intentions, run afoul of the law on one of the above counts, areopen to treble damage suits under the antitrust laws, even though their offensewas a course of conduct that everyone considered, at the time, quite legal aswell as ethical, but that a subsequent reinterpretation of the law found to beillegal.15 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-15]What do businessmen say about it? In a speech entitled “Guilty Before Trial”(May 18, 1950), Benjamin F. Fairless, then President of United States SteelCorporation, said:Gentlemen, I don’t have to tell you that if we persist in that kind of a systemof law—and if we enforce it impartially against all offenders—virtually everybusiness in America, big and small, is going to have to be run from Atlanta,Sing Sing, Leavenworth, or Alcatraz.The legal treatment accorded to actual criminals is much superior to thataccorded to businessmen. The criminal’s rights are protected by objective laws,objective procedures, objective rules of evidence. A criminal is presumed to beinnocent until he is proved guilty. Only businessmen—the producers, theproviders, the supporters, the Atlases who carry our whole economy on theirshoulders—are regarded as guilty by nature and are required to prove theirinnocence, without any definable criteria of innocence or proof, and are left atthe mercy of the whim, the favor, or the malice of any publicity-seekingpolitician, any scheming statist, any envious mediocrity who might chance towork his way into a bureaucratic job and who feels a yen to do sometrust-busting.The better or more honorable kind of government officials have repeatedlyprotested against the non-objective nature of the antitrust laws. In the samespeech, Mr. Fairless quotes a statement made by Lowell Mason, who was then amember of the Federal Trade Commission:American business is being harassed, bled, and even blackjacked under apreposterous crazyquilt system of laws, many of which are unintelligible,unenforceable and unfair. There is such a welter of laws governing interstatecommerce that the Government literally can find some charge to bring against anyconcern it chooses to prosecute. I say that this system is an outrage.Further, Mr. Fairless quotes a comment written by Supreme Court Justice Jacksonwhen he was the head of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice:It is impossible for a lawyer to determine what business conduct will bepronounced lawful by the Courts. This situation is embarrassing to businessmenwishing to obey the law and to Government officials attempting to enforce it.That embarrassment, however, is not shared by all members of the government. Mr.Fleming’s book quotes the following statement made by Emanuel Celler, Chairmanof the House Judiciary Committee, at a symposium of the New York State BarAssociation, in January 1950:I want to make it clear that I would vigorously oppose any antitrust laws thatattempted to particularize violations, giving bills of particulars to replacegeneral principles. The law must remain fluid, allowing for a dynamic society.16[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-16]I want to make it clear that “fluid law” is a euphemism for “arbitrarypower”—that “fluidity” is the chief characteristic of the law under anydictatorship—and that the sort of “dynamic society” whose laws are so fluid thatthey flood and drown the country may be seen in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia.The tragic irony of that whole issue is the fact that the antitrust laws werecreated and, to this day, are supported by the so-called “conservatives,” by thealleged defenders of free enterprise. This is a grim proof of the fact thatcapitalism has never had any proper, philosophical defenders—and a measure ofthe extent to which its alleged champions lacked any political principles, anyknowledge of economics, and any understanding of the nature of political power.The concept of free competition enforced by law is a grotesque contradiction interms. It means: forcing people to be free at the point of a gun. It means:protecting people’s freedom by the arbitrary rule of unanswerable bureaucraticedicts.What were the historical causes that led to the passage of the Sherman Act? Iquote from the book by Mr. Neale:The impetus behind the movement for the earliest legislation gathered strengthduring the 1870’s and the 1880’s. . . . After the Civil War the railways withtheir privileges, charters, and subsidies became the main objects of suspicionand hostility. Many bodies with revealing names like “The National Anti-MonopolyCheap Freight Railway League” sprang up.17[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-17]This is an eloquent example of the businessmen serving as scapegoat, taking theblame for the sins of the politicians. It was the politically grantedprivileges—the charters and subsidies of the railroads—that people rebelledagainst; it was these privileges that had placed the railroads of the Westoutside the reach of competition and had given them a monopolistic power, withall its consequent abuses. But the remedy, written into law by a RepublicanCongress, consisted of destroying the businessmen’s freedom and of extending thepower of political controls over the economy.If you wish to observe the real American tragedy, compare the ideologicalmotivation of the antitrust laws to their actual results. I quote from Mr.Neale’s book:It seems likely that American distrust of all sources of unchecked power is amore deep-rooted and persistent motive behind the antitrust policy than anyeconomic belief or any radical political trend. This distrust may be seen inmany spheres of American life . . . It is expressed in the theories of “checksand balances” and of “separation of powers.” In the United States the fact thatsome men possess power over the activities and fortunes of others is sometimesrecognized as inevitable but never accepted as satisfactory. It is always hopedthat any particular holder of power, whether political or economic, will besubject to the threat of encroachment by other authorities. . . . [Italicsmine.]At one with this basic motivation of antitrust is its reliance on legal processand judicial remedy rather than on administrative regulation. The famousprescription of the Massachusetts Bill of Rights—“to the end it may be agovernment of laws and not of men”—is a favourite American quotation and anessential one for understanding antitrust. Without this factor it would beimpossible to explain the degree of acceptance—so astonishing to those outsidethe United States—that is accorded to the antitrust policy by those interests,especially “big business” interests, which are frequently and expensivelysubject to its discipline.18 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-18]Here is the tragedy of what happens to human intentions without a clearlydefined philosophical theory to guide their practical implementation. The firstfree society in history destroyed its freedom—in the name of protecting freedom.The failure to differentiate between political and economic power allowed men tosuppose that coercion could be a proper “balance” to production, that both wereactivities of the same order which could serve as a “check” on each other, thatthe “authority” of a businessman and the “authority” of a bureaucrat wereinterchangeable rivals for the same social function. Seeking “a government oflaws and not of men,” the advocates of antitrust delivered the entire Americaneconomy into the power of as arbitrary a government of men as any dictatorshipcould hope to establish.In the absence of any rational criteria of judgment, people attempted to judgethe immensely complex issues of a free market by so superficial a standard as“bigness.” You hear it to this day: “big business,” “big government,” or “biglabor” are denounced as threats to society, with no concern for the nature,source, or function of the “bigness,” as if size as such were evil. This type ofreasoning would mean that a “big” genius, like Edison, and a “big” gangster,like Stalin, were equal malefactors: one flooded the world with immeasurablevalues and the other with incalculable slaughter, but both did it on a very bigscale. I doubt whether anyone would care to equate these two—yet this is theprecise difference between big business and big government. The sole means bywhich a government can grow big is physical force; the sole means by which abusiness can grow big, in a free economy, is productive achievement.The only actual factor required for the existence of free competition is: theunhampered, unobstructed operation of the mechanism of a free market. The onlyaction which a government can take to protect free competition is:Laissez-faire!—which, in free translation, means: Hands off! But the antitrustlaws established exactly opposite conditions—and achieved the exact opposite ofthe results they had been intended to achieve.There is no way to legislate competition; there are no standards by which onecould define who should compete with whom, how many competitors should exist inany given field, what should be their relative strength or their so-called“relevant markets,” what prices they should charge, what methods of competitionare “fair” or “unfair.” None of these can be answered, because these preciselyare the questions that can be answered only by the mechanism of a free market.With no principles, standards, or criteria to guide it, the antitrust case lawis the record of seventy years of sophistry, casuistry, and hair-splitting, asabsurd and as removed from any contact with reality as the debates of medievalscholastics. With only this difference: the scholastics had better reasons forthe questions they raised—and no specific human lives or fortunes hung on theoutcome of their debates.Let me give you a few examples of antitrust cases. In the case of AssociatedPress v. United States of 1945, the Associated Press was found guilty, becauseits bylaws restricted its membership and made it very difficult for newlyestablished newspapers to join. I quote from Mr. Neale’s book:It was argued in defense of the Associated Press that there were other newsagencies from which new entrants might draw their news. . . . The Court heldthat . . . Associated Press was collectively organized to secure competitiveadvantages for members over non-members and, as such, was in restraint of trade,even though the non-members were not necessarily prevented altogether fromcompeting. [The Associated Press news service was considered so important afacility that] by keeping it exclusive to themselves the members of theassociation impose a real hardship on would-be competitors. . . . It is nodefense that the members have built up a facility . . . for themselves; newentrants must still be allowed to share it on reasonable terms unless it ispracticable for them to compete without it. [Italics mine.]19[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-19]Whose rights are here being violated? And whose whim is being implemented by thepower of the law? What qualifies one to be “a would-be competitor”? If I decidedto start competing with General Motors tomorrow, what part of their facilitieswould they have to share with me in order to make it “practicable” for me tocompete with them?In the case of Milgram v. Loew’s, of 1951, the consistent refusal of the majordistributors of motion pictures to grant first-runs to a drive-in theater washeld to be a proof of collusion. Each company had obviously valid reasons forits refusal, and the defense argued that each had made its own independentdecision without knowing the decisions of the others. But the Court ruled that“consciously parallel business practices” are sufficient proof of conspiracy andthat “further proof of actual agreement among the defendants is unnecessary.”The Court of Appeals upheld this decision, suggesting that evidence of parallelaction should transfer the burden of proof to the defendants “to explain awaythe inference of joint action,” which they had not, apparently, explained away.Consider for a moment the implications of this case. If three businessmen reachindependently the same blatantly obvious business decision—do they then have toprove that they did not conspire? Or if two businessmen observe an intelligentbusiness policy originated by the third—should they refrain from adopting it,for fear of a conspiracy charge? Or if they do adopt it, should he then findhimself dragged into court and charged with conspiracy, on the ground of theactions taken by two men he had never heard of? And how, then, is he “to explainaway” his presumed guilt and prove himself innocent?In the case of patents, the antitrust laws seem to respect a patent owner’sright—so long as he is alone in using his patent and does not share it withanyone else. But if he decides not to engage in a patent war with a competitorwho holds patents of the same general category—if they both decide to abandonthat alleged “dog-eat-dog” policy of which businessmen are so often accused—ifthey decide to pool their patents and to license them to a few othermanufacturers of their own choice—then the antitrust laws crack down on themboth. The penalties, in such patent-pool cases, involve compulsory licensing ofthe patents to any and all comers—or the outright confiscation of the patents.I quote from Mr. Neale’s book:The compulsory licensing of patents—even valid patents lawfully acquired throughthe research efforts of the company’s own employees—is intended not aspunishment but as a way in which rival companies may be brought into the market.. . . In the I.C.I. and duPont case of 1952, for example, Judge Ryan . . .ordered the compulsory licensing of their existing patents in the fields towhich their restrictive agreements applied and improvement patents but not newpatents in these fields. In this case an auxiliary remedy was awarded which hasbecome common in recent years. Both I.C.I. and duPont were ordered to provideapplicants, at a reasonable charge, with technical manuals which would show indetail how the patents were practiced.20[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-20]This, mind you, is not regarded as “punitive”!Whose mind, ability, achievement, and rights are here sacrificed—and for whoseunearned benefit?The most shocking court decision in this grim progression (up to, but notincluding, the year 1961) was written—as one would almost expect—by adistinguished “conservative,” Judge Learned Hand. The victim was ALCOA. The casewas United States v. Aluminum Company of America of 1945.Under the antitrust laws, monopoly, as such, is not illegal; what is illegal isthe “intent to monopolize.” To find ALCOA guilty, Judge Learned Hand had to findevidence that ALCOA had taken aggressive action to exclude competitors from itsmarket. Here is the kind of evidence which he found and on which he based theruling that has blocked the energy of one of America’s greatest industrialconcerns. I quote from Judge Hand’s opinion:It was not inevitable that it [ALCOA] should always anticipate increases in thedemand for ingot and be prepared to supply them. Nothing compelled it to keepdoubling and redoubling its capacity before others entered the field. It insiststhat it never excluded competitors; but we can think of no more effectiveexclusion than progressively to embrace each new opportunity as it opened, andto face every newcomer with new capacity already geared into a greatorganization, having the advantage of experience, trade connections and theelite of personnel.21 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-21]Here, the meaning and purpose of the antitrust laws come blatantly andexplicitly into the open, the only meaning and purpose these laws could have,whether their authors intended it or not: the penalizing of ability for beingability, the penalizing of success for being success, and the sacrifice ofproductive genius to the demands of envious mediocrity.If such a principle were applied to all productive activity, if a man ofintelligence were forbidden “to embrace each new opportunity as it opened,” forfear of discouraging some coward or fool who might wish to compete with him, itwould mean that none of us, in any profession, should venture forward, or rise,or improve, because any form of personal progress—be it a typist’s greaterspeed, or an artist’s greater canvas, or a doctor’s greater percentage ofcures—can discourage the kind of newcomers who haven’t yet started, but whoexpect to start competing at the top.As a small, but crowning touch, I will quote Mr. Neale’s footnote to his accountof the ALCOA case:It is of some interest to note that the main ground on which economic writershave condemned the aluminum monopoly has been precisely that ALCOA consistentlyfailed to embrace opportunities for expansion and so underestimated the demandfor the metal that the United States was woefully short of productive capacityat the outset of both world wars.22 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-22]Now I will ask you to bear in mind the nature, the essence, and the record ofthe antitrust laws, when I mention the ultimate climax which makes the rest ofthat sordid record seem insignificant: the General Electric case of 1961.The list of the accused in that case reads like a roll call of honor of theelectrical-equipment industry: General Electric, Westinghouse, Allis-Chalmers,and twenty-six other, smaller companies. Their crime was that they had providedyou with all the matchless benefits and comforts of the electrical age, frombread toasters to power generators. It is for this crime that they werepunished—because they could not have provided any of it, nor remained inbusiness, without breaking the antitrust laws.The charge against them was that they had made secret agreements to fix theprices of their products and to rig bids. But without such agreements, thelarger companies could have set their prices so low that the smaller ones wouldhave been unable to match them and would have gone out of business, whereuponthe larger companies would have faced prosecution, under these same antitrustlaws, for “intent to monopolize.”I quote from an article by Richard Austin Smith entitled “The IncredibleElectrical Conspiracy,” in Fortune (April and May 1961): “If G.E. were to drivefor 50 per cent of the market, even strong companies like I-T-E Circuit Breakermight be mortally wounded.” This same article shows that the price-fixingagreements did not benefit General Electric, that they worked to itsdisadvantage, that General Electric was, in effect, “the sucker” and that itsexecutives knew it, wanted to leave the “conspiracy,” but had no choice (byreason of antitrust and other government regulations).The best evidence of the fact that the antitrust laws were a major factor inforcing the “conspiracy” upon the electrical industry, can be seen in theaftermath of that case—in the issue of the “consent decree.” When GeneralElectric announced that it now intended to charge the lowest prices possible, itwas the smaller companies and the government, the Antitrust Division, whoobjected.Mr. Smith’s article mentions the fact that the meetings of the “conspirators”started as a result of the O.P.A. During the war, the prices of electricalequipment were fixed by the government, and the executives of the electricalindustry held meetings to discuss a common policy. They continued this practice,after the O.P.A. was abolished.By what conceivable standard can the policy of price-fixing be a crime, whenpracticed by businessmen, but a public benefit, when practiced by thegovernment? There are many industries, in peacetime—trucking, for instance—whoseprices are fixed by the government. If price-fixing is harmful to competition,to industry, to production, to consumers, to the whole economy, and to the“public interest”—as the advocates of the antitrust laws have claimed—then howcan that same harmful policy become beneficial in the hands of the government?Since there is no rational answer to this question, I suggest that you questionthe economic knowledge, the purpose, and the motives of the champions ofantitrust.The electrical companies offered no defense to the charge of “conspiracy.” Theypleaded “nolo contendere,” which means: “no contest.” They did it, because theantitrust laws place so deadly a danger in the path of any attempt to defendoneself that defense becomes virtually impossible. These laws provide that acompany convicted of an antitrust violation can be sued for treble damages byany customer who might claim that he was injured. In a case of so large a scaleas the electrical industry case, such treble damage suits could, conceivably,wipe all the defendants out of existence. With that kind of threat hanging overhim, who can or will take the risk of offering a defense in a court where thereare no objective laws, no objective standards of guilt or innocence, noobjective way to estimate one’s chances?Try to project what clamor of indignation and what protests would be heardpublicly all around us, if some other group of men, some other minority group,were subjected to a trial in which defense was made impossible—or in which thelaws prescribed that the more serious the offense, the more dangerous thedefense. Certainly the opposite is true in regard to actual criminals: the moreserious the crime, the greater the precautions and protections prescribed by thelaw to give the defendant a chance and the benefit of every doubt. It is onlybusinessmen who have to come to court, bound and gagged.Now what started the government’s investigation of the electrical industry? Mr.Smith’s article states that the investigation was started because of complaintsby T.V.A. and demands by Senator Kefauver. This was in 1959, under Eisenhower’sRepublican Administration. I quote from Time of February 17, 1961:Often the Government has a hard time gathering evidence in antitrust cases, butthis time it got a break. In October 1959, four Ohio businessmen were sentencedto jail after pleading nolo contendere in an antitrust case. (One of themcommitted suicide on the way to jail.) This news sent a chill through theelectrical-equipment executives under investigation, and some agreed to testifyabout their colleagues under the security of immunity. With the evidencegathered from them (most are still with their companies), the Government sewedup its case.It is not gangsters, racketeers, or dope peddlers that are here being discussedin such terms, but businessmen—the productive, creative, efficient, competentmembers of society. Yet the antitrust laws, now, in this new phase, areapparently aimed at transforming business into an underworld, with informers,stool pigeons, double-crossers, special “deals,” and all the rest of theatmosphere of The Untouchables.Seven executives of the electrical industry were sentenced to jail. We shallnever know what went on behind the scenes of this case or in the negotiationsbetween the companies and the government. Were these seven responsible for thealleged “conspiracy”? If it be guilt, were they guiltier than others? Who“informed” on them—and why? Were they framed? Were they double-crossed? Whosepurposes, ambitions, or goals were served by their immolation? We do not know.Under a set-up such as the antitrust laws have created, there is no way to know.When these seven men, who could not defend themselves, came into the courtroomto hear their sentences, their lawyers addressed the judge with pleas for mercy.I quote from the same story in Time: “First before the court came the lawyer for. . . a vice president of Westinghouse, to plead for mercy. His client, said thelawyer, was a vestryman of St. John’s Episcopal Church in Sharon, Pa. and abenefactor of charities for crippled children.” Another defendant’s lawyerpleaded that his client was “the director of a boy’s club in Schenectady, N.Y.and the chairman of a campaign to build a new Jesuit seminary in Lenox, Mass.”It was not these men’s achievements or their productive ability or theirexecutive talent or their intelligence or their rights that their lawyers foundit necessary to cite—but their altruistic “service” to the “welfare of theneedy.” The needy had a right to welfare—but those who produced and provided ithad not. The welfare and the rights of the producers were not regarded as worthyof consideration or recognition. This is the most damning indictment of thepresent state of our culture.The final touch on that whole gruesome farce was Judge Ganey’s statement. Hesaid: “What is really at stake here is the survival of the kind of economy underwhich America has grown to greatness, the free-enterprise system.” He said it,while delivering the most staggering blow that the free-enterprise system hadever sustained, while sentencing to jail seven of its best representatives andthus declaring that the very class of men who brought America to greatness—thebusinessmen—are now to be treated, by their nature and profession, as criminals.In the person of these seven men, it is the free-enterprise system that he wassentencing.These seven men were martyrs. They were treated as sacrificial animals—they werehuman sacrifices, as truly and more cruelly than the human sacrifices offered byprehistorical savages in the jungle.If you care about justice to minority groups, remember that businessmen are asmall minority—a very small minority, compared to the total of all theuncivilized hordes on earth. Remember how much you owe to this minority—and whatdisgraceful persecution it is enduring. Remember also that the smallest minorityon earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights cannot claim to bedefenders of minorities.What should we do about it? We should demand a re-examination and revision ofthe entire issue of antitrust. We should challenge its philosophical, political,economic, and moral base. We should have a Civil Liberties Union—forbusinessmen. The repeal of the antitrust laws should be our ultimate goal; itwill require a long intellectual and political struggle; but, in the meantimeand as a first step, we should demand that the jail-penalty provisions of theselaws be abolished. It is bad enough if men have to suffer financial penalties,such as fines, under laws which everyone concedes to be non-objective,contradictory, and undefinable, since no two jurists can agree on their meaningand application; it is obscene to impose prison sentences under laws of socontroversial a nature. We should put an end to the outrage of sending men tojail for breaking unintelligible laws which they cannot avoid breaking.Businessmen are the one group that distinguishes capitalism and the American wayof life from the totalitarian statism that is swallowing the rest of the world.All the other social groups—workers, farmers, professional men, scientists,soldiers—exist under dictatorships, even though they exist in chains, in terror,in misery, and in progressive self-destruction. But there is no such group asbusinessmen under a dictatorship. Their place is taken by armed thugs: bybureaucrats and commissars. Businessmen are the symbol of a free society—thesymbol of America. If and when they perish, civilization will perish. But if youwish to fight for freedom, you must begin by fighting for its unrewarded,unrecognized, unacknowledged, yet best representatives—the American businessmen."},{"pageContent":"4. ANTITRUSTby Alan Greenspan The world of antitrust is reminiscent of Alice’s Wonder-land: everythingseemingly is, yet apparently isn’t, simultaneously. It is a world in whichcompetition is lauded as the basic axiom and guiding principle, yet “too much”competition is condemned as “cutthroat.” It is a world in which actions designedto limit competition are branded as criminal when taken by businessmen, yetpraised as “enlightened” when initiated by the government. It is a world inwhich the law is so vague that businessmen have no way of knowing whetherspecific actions will be declared illegal until they hear the judge’sverdict—after the fact.In view of the confusion, contradictions, and legalistic hairsplitting whichcharacterize the realm of antitrust, I submit that the entire antitrust systemmust be opened for review. It is necessary to ascertain and to estimate: (a) thehistorical roots of the antitrust laws, and (b) the economic theories upon whichthese laws were based.Americans have always feared the concentration of arbitrary power in the handsof politicians. Prior to the Civil War, few attributed such power tobusinessmen. It was recognized that government officials had the legal power tocompel obedience by the use of physical force—and that businessmen had no suchpower. A businessman needed customers. He had to appeal to their self-interest.Based on a paper given at the Antitrust Seminar of the National Association ofBusiness Economists, Cleveland, September 25, 1961. Published by NathanielBranden Institute, New York, 1962.This appraisal of the issue changed rapidly in the immediate aftermath of theCivil War, particularly with the coming of the railroad age. Outwardly, therailroads did not have the backing of legal force. But to the farmers of theWest, the railroads seemed to hold the arbitrary power previously ascribedsolely to the government. The railroads appeared unhampered by the laws ofcompetition. They seemed able to charge rates calculated to keep the farmers inseed grain—no higher, no lower. The farmers’ protest took the form of theNational Grange movement, the organization responsible for the passage of theInterstate Commerce Act of 1887.The industrial giants, such as Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Trust, which wererising during this period, were also alleged to be immune from competition, fromthe law of supply and demand. The public reaction against the trusts culminatedin the Sherman Act of 1890.It was claimed then—as it is still claimed today—that business, if left free,would necessarily develop into an institution vested with arbitrary power. Isthis assertion valid? Did the post-Civil War period give birth to a new form ofarbitrary power? Or did the government remain the source of such power, withbusiness merely providing a new avenue through which it could be exercised? Thisis the crucial historical question.The railroads developed in the East, prior to the Civil War, in stiffcompetition with one another as well as with the older forms oftransportation—barges, riverboats, and wagons. By the 1860’s there arose apolitical clamor demanding that the railroads move west and tie California tothe nation: national prestige was held to be at stake. But the traffic volumeoutside of the populous East was insufficient to draw commercial transportationwestward. The potential profit did not warrant the heavy cost of investment intransportation facilities. In the name of “public policy” it was, therefore,decided to subsidize the railroads in their move to the West.Between 1863 and 1867, close to one hundred million acres of public lands weregranted to the railroads. Since these grants were made to individual roads, nocompeting railroads could vie for traffic in the same area in the West.Meanwhile, the alternative forms of competition (wagons, riverboats, etc.) couldnot afford to challenge the railroads in the West. Thus, with the aid of thefederal government, a segment of the railroad industry was able to “break free”from the competitive bounds which had prevailed in the East.As might be expected, the subsidies attracted the kind of promoters who alwaysexist on the fringe of the business community and who are constantly seeking an“easy deal.” Many of the new western railroads were shabbily built: they werenot constructed to carry traffic, but to acquire land grants.The western railroads were true monopolies in the textbook sense of the word.They could, and did, behave with an aura of arbitrary power. But that power wasnot derived from a free market. It stemmed from governmental subsidies andgovernmental restrictions.23 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-23]When, ultimately, western traffic increased to levels which could support otherprofit-making transportation carriers, the railroads’ monopolistic power wassoon undercut. In spite of their initial privileges, they were unable towithstand the pressure of free competition.In the meantime, however, an ominous turning point had taken place in oureconomic history: the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887.That Act was not necessitated by the “evils” of the free market. Like subsequentlegislation controlling business, the Act was an attempt to remedy the economicdistortions which prior government interventions had created, but which wereblamed on the free market. The Interstate Commerce Act, in turn, produced newdistortions in the structure and finances of the railroads. Today, it isproposed that these distortions be corrected by means of further subsidies. Therailroads are on the verge of final collapse, yet no one challenges the originalmisdiagnosis to discover—and correct—the actual cause of their illness.To interpret the railroad history of the nineteenth century as “proof” of thefailure of a free market is a disastrous error. The same error—which persists tothis day—was the nineteenth century’s fear of the “trusts.”The most formidable of the “trusts” was Standard Oil. Nevertheless, at the timeof the passage of the Sherman Act, a pre-automotive period, the entire petroleumindustry amounted to less than one percent of the Gross National Product and wasbarely one-third as large as the shoe industry. It was not the absolute size ofthe trusts, but their dominance within their own industries that gave rise toapprehension. What the observers failed to grasp, however, was the fact that thecontrol by Standard Oil, at the turn of the century, of more than eighty percentof refining capacity made economic sense and accelerated the growth of theAmerican economy.Such control yielded obvious gains in efficiency, through the integration ofdivergent refining, marketing, and pipeline operations; it also made the raisingof capital easier and cheaper. Trusts came into existence because they were themost efficient units in those industries which, being relatively new, were toosmall to support more than one large company.Historically, the general development of industry has taken the followingcourse: an industry begins with a few small firms; in time, many of them merge;this increases efficiency and augments profits. As the market expands, new firmsenter the field, thus cutting down the share of the market held by the dominantfirm. This has been the pattern in steel, oil, aluminum, containers, andnumerous other major industries.The observable tendency of an industry’s dominant companies eventually to losepart of their share of the market is not caused by antitrust legislation, but bythe fact that it is difficult to prevent new firms from entering the field whenthe demand for a certain product increases. Texaco and Gulf, for example, wouldhave grown into large firms even if the original Standard Oil Trust had not beendissolved. Similarly, the United States Steel Corporation’s dominance of thesteel industry half a century ago would have been eroded with or without theSherman Act.It takes extraordinary skill to hold more than fifty percent of a largeindustry’s market in a free economy. It requires unusual productive ability,unfailing business judgment, unrelenting effort at the continuous improvement ofone’s product and technique. The rare company which is able to retain its shareof the market year after year and decade after decade does so by means ofproductive efficiency—and deserves praise, not condemnation.The Sherman Act may be understandable when viewed as a projection of thenineteenth century’s fear and economic ignorance. But it is utter nonsense inthe context of today’s economic knowledge. The seventy additional years ofobserving industrial development should have taught us something.If the attempts to justify our antitrust statutes on historical grounds areerroneous and rest on a misinterpretation of history, the attempts to justifythem on theoretical grounds come from a still more fundamental misconception.In the early days of the United States, Americans enjoyed a large measure ofeconomic freedom. Each individual was free to produce what he chose, and sell towhomever he chose, at a price mutually agreed upon. If two competitors concludedthat it was to their mutual self-interest to set joint price policies, they werefree to do so. If a customer requested a rebate in exchange for his business, afirm (usually a railroad) could comply or deny as it saw fit. According toclassical economics, which had a profound influence on the nineteenth century,competition would keep the economy in balance.But while many theories of the classical economists—such as their description ofthe working of a free economy—were valid, their concept of competition wasambiguous and led to confusion in the minds of their followers. It wasunderstood to mean that competition consists merely of producing and selling themaximum possible, like a robot, passively accepting the market price as a law ofnature, never making any attempt to influence the conditions of the market.The businessmen of the latter half of the nineteenth century, however,aggressively attempted to affect the conditions of their markets by advertising,varying production rates, and bargaining on price with suppliers and customers.Many observers assumed that these activities were incompatible with theclassical theory. They concluded that competition was no longer workingeffectively. In the sense in which they understood competition, it had neverworked or existed, except possibly in some isolated agricultural markets. But ina meaningful sense of the word, competition did, and does, exist—in thenineteenth century as well as today.“Competition” is an active, not a passive, noun. It applies to the entire sphereof economic activity, not merely to production, but also to trade; it impliesthe necessity of taking action to affect the conditions of the market in one’sown favor.The error of the nineteenth-century observers was that they restricted a wideabstraction—competition—to a narrow set of particulars, to the “passive”competition projected by their own interpretation of classical economics. As aresult, they concluded that the alleged “failure” of this fictitious “passivecompetition” negated the entire theoretical structure of classical economics,including the demonstration of the fact that laissez-faire is the most efficientand productive of all possible economic systems. They concluded that a freemarket, by its nature, leads to its own destruction—and they came to thegrotesque contradiction of attempting to preserve the freedom of the market bygovernment controls, i.e., to preserve the benefits of laissez-faire byabrogating it.The crucial question which they failed to ask is whether “active” competitiondoes inevitably lead to the establishment of coercive monopolies, as theysupposed—or whether a laissez-faire economy of “active” competition has abuilt-in regulator that protects and preserves it. That is the question which wemust now examine.A “coercive monopoly” is a business concern that can set its prices andproduction policies independent of the market, with immunity from competition,from the law of supply and demand. An economy dominated by such monopolies wouldbe rigid and stagnant.The necessary precondition of a coercive monopoly is closed entry—the barring ofall competing producers from a given field. This can be accomplished only by anact of government intervention, in the form of special regulations, subsidies,or franchises. Without government assistance, it is impossible for a would-bemonopolist to set and maintain his prices and production policies independent ofthe rest of the economy. For if he attempted to set his prices and production ata level that would yield profits to new entrants significantly above thoseavailable in other fields, competitors would be sure to invade his industry.The ultimate regulator of competition in a free economy is the capital market.So long as capital is free to flow, it will tend to seek those areas which offerthe maximum rate of return.The potential investor of capital does not merely consider the actual rate ofreturn earned by companies within a specific industry. His decision concerningwhere to invest depends on what he himself could earn in that particular line.The existing profit rates within an industry are calculated in terms of existingcosts. He has to consider the fact that a new entrant might not be able toachieve at once as low a cost structure as that of experienced producers.Therefore, the existence of a free capital market does not guarantee that amonopolist who enjoys high profits will necessarily and immediately find himselfconfronted by competition. What it does guarantee is that a monopolist whosehigh profits are caused by high prices, rather than low costs, will soon meetcompetition originated by the capital market.The capital market acts as a regulator of prices, not necessarily of profits. Itleaves an individual producer free to earn as much as he can by lowering hiscosts and by increasing his efficiency relative to others. Thus, it constitutesthe mechanism that generates greater incentives to increased productivity andleads, as a consequence, to a rising standard of living.The history of the Aluminum Company of America prior to World War II illustratesthe process. Envisaging its self-interest and long-term profitability in termsof a growing market, ALCOA kept the price of primary aluminum at a levelcompatible with the maximum expansion of its market. At such a price level,however, profits were forthcoming only by means of tremendous efforts to step upefficiency and productivity.ALCOA was a monopoly—the only producer of primary aluminum—but it was not acoercive monopoly, i.e., it could not set its price and production policiesindependent of the competitive world. In fact, only because the company stressedcost-cutting and efficiency, rather than raising prices, was it able to maintainits position as sole producer of primary aluminum for so long. Had ALCOAattempted to increase its profits by raising prices, it soon would have founditself competing with new entrants in the primary aluminum business.In analyzing the competitive processes of a laissez-faire economy, one mustrecognize that capital outlays (investments in new plant and equipment either byexisting producers or new entrants) are not determined solely by currentprofits. An investment is made or not made depending upon the estimateddiscounted present worth of expected future profits. Consequently, the issue ofwhether or not a new competitor will enter a hitherto monopolistic industry isdetermined by his expected future returns.The present worth of the discounted expected future profits of a given industryis represented by the market price of the common stock of the companies in thatindustry.24 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-24] If the price of aparticular company’s stock (or an average for a particular industry) rises, themove implies a higher present worth for expected future earnings.Statistical evidence demonstrates the correlation between stock prices andcapital outlays, not only for industry as a whole, but also within majorindustry groups.25 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-25] Moreover, thetime between the fluctuations of stock prices and the corresponding fluctuationsof capital expenditures is rather short, a fact which implies that the processof relating new capital investments to profit expectations is relatively fast.If such a correlation works as well as it does, considering today’s governmentalimpediments to the free movement of capital, one must conclude that in acompletely free market the process would be much more efficient.The churning of a nation’s capital, in a fully free economy, would becontinuously pushing capital into profitable areas—and this would effectivelycontrol the competitive price and production policies of business firms, makinga coercive monopoly impossible to maintain. It is only in a so-called mixedeconomy that a coercive monopoly can flourish, protected from the discipline ofthe capital markets by franchises, subsidies, and special privileges fromgovernmental regulators.To sum up: the entire structure of antitrust statutes in this country is ajumble of economic irrationality and ignorance. It is the product: (a) of agross misinterpretation of history, and (b) of rather naive, and certainlyunrealistic, economic theories.As a last resort, some people argue that at least the antitrust laws haven’tdone any harm. They assert that even though the competitive process itselfinhibits coercive monopolies, there is no harm in making doubly sure bydeclaring certain economic actions to be illegal.But the very existence of those undefinable statutes and contradictory case lawinhibits businessmen from undertaking what would otherwise be sound productiveventures. No one will ever know what new products, processes, machines, andcost-saving mergers failed to come into existence, killed by the Sherman Actbefore they were born. No one can ever compute the price that all of us havepaid for that Act which, by inducing less effective use of capital, has kept ourstandard of living lower than would otherwise have been possible.No speculation, however, is required to assess the injustice and the damage tothe careers, reputations, and lives of business executives jailed under theantitrust laws.Those who allege that the purpose of the antitrust laws is to protectcompetition, enterprise, and efficiency need to be reminded of the followingquotation from Judge Learned Hand’s indictment of ALCOA’s so-called monopolisticpractices.It was not inevitable that it should always anticipate increases in the demandfor ingot and be prepared to supply them. Nothing compelled it to keep doublingand redoubling its capacity before others entered the field. It insists that itnever excluded competitors; but we can think of no more effective exclusion thanprogressively to embrace each new opportunity as it opened, and to face everynewcomer with new capacity already geared into a great organization, having theadvantage of experience, trade connections and the elite of personnel.ALCOA is being condemned for being too successful, too efficient, and too good acompetitor. Whatever damage the antitrust laws may have done to our economy,whatever distortions of the structure of the nation’s capital they may havecreated, these are less disastrous than the fact that the effective purpose, thehidden intent, and the actual practice of the antitrust laws in the UnitedStates have led to the condemnation of the productive and efficient members ofour society because they are productive and efficient."},{"pageContent":"5. COMMON FALLACIES ABOUT CAPITALISMby Nathaniel BrandenMONOPOLIESIN A SOCIETY OF LAISSEZ-FAIRE CAPITALISM, WHAT WOULD PREVENT THE FORMATION OFPOWERFUL MONOPOLIES ABLE TO GAIN CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE ECONOMY? One of the worst fallacies in the field of economics—propagated by Karl Marx andaccepted by almost everyone today, including many businessmen—is the notion thatthe development of monopolies is an inescapable and intrinsic result of theoperation of a free, unregulated economy. In fact, the exact opposite is true.It is a free market that makes monopolies impossible.It is imperative that one be clear and specific in one’s definition of“monopoly.” When people speak, in an economic or political context, of thedangers and evils of monopoly, what they mean is a coercive monopoly—i.e.,exclusive control of a given field of production which is closed to and exemptfrom competition, so that those controlling the field are able to set arbitraryproduction policies and charge arbitrary prices, independent of the market,immune from the law of supply and demand. Such a monopoly, it is important tonote, entails more than the absence of competition; it entails the impossibilityof competition. That is a coercive monopoly’s characteristic attribute, which isessential to any condemnation of such a monopoly.These articles appeared originally in the “Intellectual Ammunition Department”of The Objectivist Newsletter. They are brief answers to the economic questionsmost frequently asked by readers—questions that reflect the most widely spreadmisconceptions about capitalism.In the entire history of capitalism, no one has been able to establish acoercive monopoly by means of competition on a free market. There is only oneway to forbid entry into a given field of production: by law. Every coercivemonopoly that exists or has ever existed—in the United States, in Europe, oranywhere else in the world—was created and made possible only by an act ofgovernment: by special franchises, licenses, subsidies, by legislative actionswhich granted special privileges (not obtainable on a free market) to a man or agroup of men, and forbade all others to enter that particular field.A coercive monopoly is not the result of laissez-faire; it can result only fromthe abrogation of laissez-faire and from the introduction of the oppositeprinciple—the principle of statism.In this country, a utility company is a coercive monopoly: the government grantsit a franchise for an exclusive territory, and no one else is allowed to engagein that service in that territory; a would-be competitor, attempting to sellelectric power, would be stopped by law. A telephone company is a coercivemonopoly. As recently as World War II, the government ordered the two thenexisting telegraph companies, Western Union and Postal Telegraph, to merge intoone monopoly.In the comparatively free days of American capitalism, in thelate-nineteenth-early-twentieth century, there were many attempts to “corner themarket” on various commodities (such as cotton and wheat, to mention two famousexamples)—then close the field to competition and gather huge profits by sellingat exorbitant prices. All such attempts failed. The men who tried it werecompelled to give up—or go bankrupt. They were defeated, not by legislativeaction, but by the action of the free market.The question is often asked: What if a large, rich company kept buying out itssmaller competitors or kept forcing them out of business by means ofundercutting prices and selling at a loss—would it not be able to gain controlof a given field and then start charging high prices and be free to stagnatewith no fear of competition? The answer is: No, it could not be done. If acompany assumed heavy losses in order to drive out competitors, then began tocharge high prices to regain what it had lost, this would serve as an incentivefor new competitors to enter the field and take advantage of the highprofitability, without any losses to recoup. The new competitors would forceprices down to the market level. The large company would have to abandon itsattempt to establish monopoly prices—or go bankrupt, fighting off thecompetitors that its own policies would attract.It is a matter of historical fact that no “price war” has ever succeeded inestablishing a monopoly or in maintaining prices above the market level, outsidethe law of supply and demand. (“Price wars” have, however, acted as spurs to theeconomic efficiency of competing companies—and have thereby resulted in enormousbenefits to the public, in terms of better products at lower prices.)In considering this issue, people frequently ignore the crucial role of thecapital market in a free economy. As Alan Greenspan observes in his article“Antitrust”26 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-26]: If entry into a givenfield of production is not impeded by government regulations, franchises, orsubsidies, “the ultimate regulator of competition in a free economy is thecapital market. So long as capital is free to flow, it will tend to seek thoseareas which offer the maximum rate of return.” Investors are constantly seekingthe most profitable uses of their capital. If, therefore, some field ofproduction is seen to be highly profitable (particularly when the profitabilityis due to high prices rather than to low costs), businessmen and investorsnecessarily will be attracted to that field; and, as the supply of the productin question is increased relative to the demand for it, prices fall accordingly.“The capital market,” writes Mr. Greenspan, “acts as a regulator of prices, notnecessarily of profits. It leaves an individual producer free to earn as much ashe can by lowering his costs and by increasing his efficiency relative toothers. Thus it constitutes the mechanism that generates greater incentives toincreased productivity and leads, as a consequence, to a rising standard ofliving.”The free market does not permit inefficiency or stagnation—with economicimpunity—in any field of production. Consider, for instance, a well-knownincident in the history of the American automobile industry. There was a periodwhen Henry Ford’s Model-T held an enormous part of the automobile market. Butwhen Ford’s company attempted to stagnate and to resist stylistic changes—“Youcan have any color of the Model-T you want, so long as it’s black”—GeneralMotors, with its more attractively styled Chevrolet, cut into a major segment ofFord’s market. And the Ford Company was compelled to change its policies inorder to compete. One will find examples of this principle in the history ofvirtually every industry.Now if one considers the only kind of monopoly that can exist under capitalism,a non-coercive monopoly, one will see that its prices and production policiesare not independent of the wider market in which it operates, but are fullybound by the law of supply and demand; that there is no particular reason for orvalue in retaining the designation of “monopoly” when one uses it in anon-coercive sense; and that there are no rational grounds on which to condemnsuch “monopolies.”For instance, if a small town has only one drugstore, which is barely able tosurvive, the owner might be described as enjoying a “monopoly”—except that noone would think of using the term in this context. There is no economic need ormarket for a second drugstore, there is not enough trade to support it. But ifthat town grew, its one drugstore would have no way, no power, to prevent otherdrugstores from being opened.It is often thought that the field of mining is particularly vulnerable to theestablishment of monopolies, since the materials extracted from the earth existin limited quantity and since, it is believed, some firm might gain control ofall the sources of some raw material. But observe that International Nickel ofCanada produces more than two-thirds of the world’s nickel—yet it does notcharge monopoly prices. It prices its product as though it had a great manycompetitors—and the truth is that it does have a great many competitors. Nickel(in the form of alloy and stainless steels) is competing with aluminum and avariety of other materials. The seldom recognized principle involved in suchcases is that no single product, commodity, or material is or can beindispensable to an economy regardless of price. A commodity can be onlyrelatively preferable to other commodities. For example, when the price ofbituminous coal rose (which was due to John L. Lewis’ forcing an economicallyunjustified wage raise), this was instrumental in bringing about a large-scaleconversion to the use of oil and gas in many industries. The free market is itsown protector.Now if a company were able to gain and hold a non-coercive monopoly, if it wereable to win all the customers in a given field, not by specialgovernment-granted privileges, but by sheer productive efficiency—by its abilityto keep its costs low and/or to offer a better product than any competitorcould—there would be no grounds on which to condemn such a monopoly. On thecontrary, the company that achieved it would deserve the highest praise andesteem.No one can morally claim the right to compete in a given field if he cannotmatch the productive efficiency of those with whom he hopes to compete. There isno reason why people should buy inferior products at higher prices in order tomaintain less efficient companies in business. Under capitalism, any man orcompany that can surpass competitors is free to do so. It is in this manner thatthe free market rewards ability and works for the benefit of everyone—exceptthose who seek the undeserved. A bromide commonly cited in this connection by capitalism’s opponents is thestory of the old corner grocer who is driven out of business by the big chainstore. What is the clear implication of their protest? It is that the people wholive in the neighborhood of the old grocer have to continue buying from him,even though a chain store could give them better service at lower prices andthereby let them save money. Thus both the owners of the chain store and thepeople in the neighborhood are to be penalized—in order to protect thestagnation of the old grocer. By what right? If that grocer is unable to competewith the chain store, then, properly, he has no choice but to move elsewhere orgo into another line of business or seek employment from the chain store.Capitalism, by its nature, entails a constant process of motion, of growth, ofprogress; no one has a vested right to a position if others can do better thanhe can. When people denounce the free market as “cruel,” the fact they are decrying isthat the market is ruled by a single moral principle: justice. And that is theroot of their hatred for capitalism.There is only one kind of monopoly that men may rightfully condemn—the only kindfor which the designation of “monopoly” is economically significant: a coercivemonopoly. (Observe that in the non-coercive meaning of the term, every man maybe described as a “monopolist”—since he is the exclusive owner of his effort andproduct. But this is not regarded as evil—except by socialists.)In the issue of monopolies, as in so many other issues, capitalism is commonlyblamed for the evils perpetrated by its destroyers: it is not free trade on afree market that creates coercive monopolies, but government legislation,government action, government controls. If men are concerned about the evils ofmonopolies, let them identify the actual villain in the picture and the actualcause of the evils: government intervention into the economy. Let them recognizethat there is only one way to destroy monopolies: by the separation of State andEconomics—that is, by instituting the principle that the government may notabridge the freedom of production and trade. (JUNE 1962.)DEPRESSIONSARE PERIODIC DEPRESSIONS INEVITABLE IN A SYSTEM OF LAISSEZ-FAIRE CAPITALISM? It is characteristic of the enemies of capitalism that they denounce it forevils which are, in fact, the result not of capitalism but of statism: evilswhich result from and are made possible only by government intervention in theeconomy.I have discussed a flagrant example of this policy: the charge that capitalismleads to the establishment of coercive monopolies. The most notorious instanceof this policy is the claim that capitalism, by its nature, inevitably leads toperiodic depressions.Statists repeatedly assert that depressions (the phenomenon of the so-calledbusiness cycle, of “boom and bust”) are inherent in laissez-faire, and that thegreat crash of 1929 was the final proof of the failure of an unregulated,free-market economy. What is the truth of the matter?A depression is a large-scale decline in production and trade; it ischaracterized by a sharp drop in productive output, in investment, inemployment, and in the value of capital assets (plants, machinery, etc.). Normalbusiness fluctuations, or a temporary decline in the rate of industrialexpansion, do not constitute a depression. A depression is a nation-widecontraction of business activity—and a general decline in the value of capitalassets—of major proportions.There is nothing in the nature of a free-market economy to cause such an event.The popular explanations of depression as caused by “over-production,”“underconsumption,” monopolies, labor-saving devices, maldistribution, excessiveaccumulations of wealth, etc., have been exploded as fallacies many times.27[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-27]Readjustments of economic activity, shifts of capital and labor from oneindustry to another, due to changing conditions, occur constantly undercapitalism. This is entailed in the process of motion, growth, and progress thatcharacterizes capitalism. But there always exists the possibility of profitableendeavor in one field or another, there is always the need and demand for goods,and all that can change is the kind of goods it becomes most profitable toproduce.In any one industry, it is possible for supply to exceed demand, in the contextof all the other existing demands. In such a case, there is a drop in prices, inprofitableness, in investment, and in employment in that particular industry;capital and labor tend to flow elsewhere, seeking more rewarding uses. Such anindustry undergoes a period of stagnation, as a result of unjustified, that is,uneconomic, unprofitable, unproductive investment.In a free economy that functions on a gold standard, such unproductiveinvestment is severely limited; unjustified speculation does not rise,unchecked, until it engulfs an entire nation. In a free economy, the supply ofmoney and credit needed to finance business ventures is determined by objectiveeconomic factors. It is the banking system that acts as the guardian of economicstability. The principles governing money supply operate to forbid large-scaleunjustified investment.Most businesses finance their undertakings, at least in part, by means of bankloans. Banks function as an investment clearing house, investing the savings oftheir customers in those enterprises which promise to be most successful. Banksdo not have unlimited funds to loan; they are limited in the credit they canextend by the amount of their gold reserves. In order to remain successful, tomake profits and thus attract the savings of investors, banks must make theirloans judiciously: they must seek out those ventures which they judge to be mostsound and potentially profitable.If, in a period of increasing speculation, banks are confronted with aninordinate number of requests for loans, then, in response to the shrinkingavailability of money, they (a) raise their interest rates, and (b) scrutinizemore severely the ventures for which loans are requested, setting more exactingstandards of what constitutes a justifiable investment. As a consequence, fundsare more difficult to obtain, and there is a temporary curtailment andcontraction of business investment. Businessmen are often unable to borrow thefunds they desire and have to reduce plans for expansion. The purchase of commonstocks, which reflects the investors’ estimates of the future earnings ofcompanies, is similarly curtailed; overvalued stocks fall in price. Businessesengaged in uneconomic ventures, now unable to obtain additional credit, areobliged to close their doors; a further waste of productive factors is stoppedand economic errors are liquidated.At worst, the economy may experience a mild recession, i.e., a slight generaldecline in investment and production. In an unregulated economy, readjustmentsoccur quite swiftly, and then production and investment begin to rise again. Thetemporary recession is not harmful but beneficial; it represents an economicsystem in the process of correcting its errors, of curtailing disease andreturning to health. The impact of such a recession may be significantly felt in a few industries,but it does not wreck an entire economy. A nation-wide depression, such asoccurred in the United States in the thirties, would not have been possible in afully free society. It was made possible only by government intervention in theeconomy—more specifically, by government manipulation of the money supply. The government’s policy consisted, in essence, of anesthetizing the regulators,inherent in a free banking system, that prevent runaway speculation andconsequent economic collapse.All government intervention in the economy is based on the belief that economiclaws need not operate, that principles of cause and effect can be suspended,that everything in existence is “flexible” and “malleable,” except abureaucrat’s whim, which is omnipotent; reality, logic, and economics must notbe allowed to get in the way. This was the implicit premise that led to the establishment, in 1913, of theFederal Reserve System—an institution with control (through complex and oftenindirect means) over the individual banks throughout the country. The FederalReserve undertook to free individual banks from the “limitations” imposed onthem by the amount of their own individual reserves, to free them from the lawsof the market—and to arrogate to government officials the right to decide howmuch credit they wished to make available at what times. A “cheap money” policy was the guiding idea and goal of these officials. Bankswere no longer to be limited in making loans by the amount of their goldreserves. Interest rates were no longer to rise in response to increasingspeculation and increasing demands for funds. Credit was to remain readilyavailable—until and unless the Federal Reserve decided otherwise.28[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-28]The government argued that by taking control of money and credit out of thehands of private bankers, and by contracting or expanding credit at will, guidedby considerations other than those influencing the “selfish” bankers, itcould—in conjunction with other interventionist policies—so control investmentas to guarantee a state of virtually constant prosperity. Many bureaucratsbelieved that the government could keep the economy in a state of unending boom.To borrow an invaluable metaphor from Alan Greenspan: if, under laissez-faire,the banking system and the principles controlling the availability of funds actas a fuse that prevents a blowout in the economy—then the government, throughthe Federal Reserve System, put a penny in the fuse-box. The result was theexplosion known as the Crash of 1929.Throughout most of the 1920’s, the government compelled banks to keep interestrates artificially and uneconomically low. As a consequence, money was pouredinto every sort of speculative venture. By 1928, the warning signals of dangerwere clearly apparent: unjustified investment was rampant and stocks wereincreasingly overvalued. The government chose to ignore these danger signals.A free banking system would have been compelled, by economic necessity, to putthe brakes on this process of runaway speculation. Credit and investment, insuch a case, would be drastically curtailed; the banks which made unprofitableinvestments, the enterprises which proved unproductive, and those who dealt withthem, would suffer—but that would be all; the country as a whole would not bedragged down. However, the “anarchy” of a free banking system had beenabandoned—in favor of “enlightened” government planning.The boom and the wild speculation—which had preceded every major depression—wereallowed to rise unchecked, involving, in a widening network of malinvestmentsand miscalculations, the entire economic structure of the nation. People wereinvesting in virtually everything and making fortunes overnight—on paper.Profits were calculated on hysterically exaggerated appraisals of the futureearnings of companies. Credit was extended with promiscuous abandon, on thepremise that somehow the goods would be there to back it up. It was like thepolicy of a man who passes out rubber checks, counting on the hope that he willsomehow find a way to obtain the necessary money and to deposit it in the bankbefore anyone presents his checks for collection.But A is A—and reality is not infinitely elastic. In 1929, the country’seconomic and financial structure had become impossibly precarious. By the timethe government finally and frantically raised the interest rates, it was toolate. It is doubtful whether anyone can state with certainty what events firstset off the panic—and it does not matter: the crash had become inevitable; anynumber of events could have pulled the trigger. But when the news of the firstbank and commercial failures began to spread, uncertainty swept across thecountry in widening waves of terror. People began to sell their stocks, hopingto get out of the market with their gains, or to obtain the money they suddenlyneeded to pay bank loans that were being called in—and other people, seeingthis, apprehensively began to sell their stocks— and, virtually overnight, anavalanche hurled the stock market downward, prices collapsed, securities becameworthless, loans were called in, many of which could not be paid, the value ofcapital assets plummeted sickeningly, fortunes were wiped out, and, by 1932,business activity had come almost to a halt. The law of causality had avengeditself.Such, in essence, was the nature and cause of the 1929 depression.It provides one of the most eloquent illustrations of the disastrousconsequences of a “planned” economy. In a free economy, when an individualbusinessman makes an error of economic judgment, he (and perhaps those whoimmediately deal with him) suffers the consequences; in a controlled economy,when a central planner makes an error of economic judgment, the whole countrysuffers the consequences.But it was not the Federal Reserve, it was not government intervention that tookthe blame for the 1929 depression—it was capitalism. Freedom—cried statists ofevery breed and sect—had had its chance and had failed. The voices of the fewthinkers who pointed to the real cause of the evil were drowned out in thedenunciations of businessmen, of the profit motive, of capitalism.Had men chosen to understand the cause of the crash, the country would have beenspared much of the agony that followed. The depression was prolonged fortragically unnecessary years by the same evil that had caused it: governmentcontrols and regulations.Contrary to popular misconception, controls and regulations began long beforethe New Deal; in the 1920’s, the mixed economy was already an established factof American life. But the trend toward statism began to move faster under theHoover Administration—and, with the advent of Roosevelt’s New Deal, itaccelerated at an unprecedented rate. The economic adjustments needed to bringthe depression to an end were prevented from taking place—by the imposition ofstrangling controls, increased taxes, and labor legislation. This last had theeffect of forcing wage rates to unjustifiably high levels, thus raising thebusinessman’s costs at precisely the time when costs needed to be lowered, ifinvestment and production were to revive.The National Industrial Recovery Act, the Wagner Act, and the abandonment of thegold standard (with the government’s subsequent plunge into inflation and anorgy of deficit spending) were only three of the many disastrous measuresenacted by the New Deal for the avowed purpose of pulling the country out of thedepression; all had the opposite effect.As Alan Greenspan points out in “Stock Prices and Capital Evaluation,”29[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-29] the obstacle to business recoverydid not consist exclusively of the specific New Deal legislation passed; moreharmful still was the general atmosphere of uncertainty engendered by theAdministration. Men had no way to know what law or regulation would descend ontheir heads at any moment; they had no way to know what sudden shifts ofdirection government policy might take; they had no way to plan long-range.To act and produce, businessmen require knowledge, the possibility of rationalcalculation, not “faith” and “hope”—above all, not “faith” and “hope” concerningthe unpredictable twistings within a bureaucrat’s head.Such advances as business was able to achieve under the New Deal collapsed in1937—as a result of an intensification of uncertainty regarding what thegovernment might choose to do next. Unemployment rose to more than ten millionand business activity fell almost to the low point of 1932, the worst year ofthe depression.It is part of the official New Deal mythology that Roosevelt “got us out of thedepression.” How was the problem of the depression finally “solved”? By thefavorite expedient of all statists in times of emergency: a war.The depression precipitated by the stock market crash of 1929 was not the firstin American history—though it was incomparably more severe than any that hadpreceded it. If one studies the earlier depressions, the same basic cause andcommon denominator will be found: in one form or another, by one means oranother, government manipulation of the money supply. It is typical of themanner in which interventionism grows that the Federal Reserve System wasinstituted as a proposed antidote against those earlier depressions—which werethemselves products of monetary manipulation by the government.The financial mechanism of an economy is the sensitive center, the living heart,of business activity. In no other area can government intervention produce quitesuch disastrous consequences. For a general discussion of the business cycle andits relation to government manipulation of the money supply, see Ludwig vonMises, Human Action.30 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-30]One of the most striking facts of history is men’s failure to learn from it. Forfurther details, see the policies of the present Administration. (AUGUST 1962.)THE ROLE OF LABOR UNIONSDO LABOR UNIONS RAISE THE GENERAL STANDARD OF LIVING? One of the most widespread delusions of our age is the belief that the Americanworker owes his high standard of living to unions and to “humanitarian” laborlegislation. This belief is contradicted by the most fundamental facts andprinciples of economics—facts and principles which are systematically evaded bylabor leaders, legislators, and intellectuals of the statist persuasion.A country’s standard of living, including the wages of its workers, depends onthe productivity of labor; high productivity depends on machines, inventions,and capital investment; which depend on the creative ingenuity of individualmen; which requires, for its exercise, a politico-economic system that protectsthe individual’s rights and freedom.The productive value of physical labor as such is low. If the worker of todayproduces more than the worker of fifty years ago, it is not because the formerexerts more physical effort; quite the contrary: the physical effort required ofhim is far less. The productive value of his effort has been multiplied manytimes by the tools and machines with which he works; they are crucial indetermining the economic worth of his services. To illustrate this principle:consider what would be a man’s economic reward, on a desert island, for pushinghis finger the distance of half an inch; then consider the wages paid, forpushing a button, to an elevator operator in New York City. It is not musclesthat make the difference.As Ludwig von Mises observes:American wages are higher than wages in other countries because the capitalinvested per head of the worker is greater and the plants are thereby in theposition to use the most efficient tools and machines. What is called theAmerican way of life is the result of the fact that the United States has putfewer obstacles in the way of saving and capital accumulation than othernations. The economic backwardness of such countries as India consists preciselyin the fact that their policies hinder both the accumulation of capital and theinvestment of foreign capital. As the capital required is lacking, the Indianenterprises are prevented from employing sufficient quantities of modernequipment, are therefore producing much less per man hour and can only afford topay wage rates which, compared with American wage rates, appear as shockinglylow.31 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-31]In a free-market economy, employers must bid competitively for the services ofworkers, just as they must bid competitively for all the other factors ofproduction. If an employer attempts to pay wages which are lower than hisworkers can obtain elsewhere, he will lose his workers and thus will becompelled to change his policy or go out of business. If, other things beingequal, an employer pays wages which are above the market level, his higher costswill put him at a competitive disadvantage in the sale of his products, andagain he will be compelled to change his policy or go out of business. Employersdo not lower wages because they are cruel, nor raise wages because they arekind. Wages are not determined by the employer’s whim. Wages are the prices paidfor human labor and, like all other prices in a free economy, are determined bythe law of supply and demand.Since the start of the Industrial Revolution and capitalism, wage rates haverisen steadily—as an inevitable economic consequence of rising capitalaccumulation, technological progress, and industrial expansion. As capitalismcreated countless new markets, so it created an ever-widening market for labor:it multiplied the number and kinds of jobs available, increased the demand andcompetition for the worker’s services, and thus drove wage rates upward.It was the economic self-interest of employers that led them to raise wages andshorten working hours—not the pressure of labor unions. The eight-hour day wasestablished in most American industries long before unions acquired anysignificant size or economic power. At a time when his competitors were payingtheir workers between two and three dollars a day, Henry Ford offered fivedollars a day, thereby attracting the most efficient labor force in the country,and thus raising his own production and profits. In the 1920’s, when the labormovement in France and Germany was far more dominant than in the United States,the standard of living of the American worker was greatly superior. It was theconsequence of economic freedom.Needless to say, men have a right to organize into unions, provided they do sovoluntarily, that is, provided no one is forced to join. Unions can have valueas fraternal organizations, or as a means of keeping members informed of currentmarket conditions, or as a means of bargaining more effectively withemployers—particularly in small, isolated communities. It may happen that anindividual employer is paying wages that, in the overall market context, are toolow; in such a case, a strike, or the threat of a strike, can compel him tochange his policy, since he will discover that he cannot obtain an adequatelabor force at the wages he offers. However, the belief that unions can cause ageneral rise in the standard of living is a myth.Today, the labor market is no longer free. Unions enjoy a unique,near-monopolistic power over many aspects of the economy. This has been achievedthrough legislation which has forced men to join unions, whether they wished toor not, and forced employers to deal with these unions, whether they wished toor not. As a consequence, wage rates in many industries are no longer determinedby a free market; unions have been able to force wages substantially above theirnormal market level. These are the “social gains” for which unions are usuallygiven credit. In fact, however, the result of their policy has been (a) acurtailment of production, (b) widespread unemployment, and (c) the penalizingof workers in other industries, as well as the rest of the population.a. With the rise of wage rates to inordinately high levels, production costs aresuch that cutbacks in production are often necessary, new undertakings becometoo expensive, and growth is hindered. At the increased costs, marginalproducers—those who have been barely able to compete in the market—findthemselves unable to remain in business. The overall result: goods and servicesthat would have been produced are not brought into existence.b. As a result of the high wage rates, employers can afford to hire fewerworkers; as a result of curtailed production, employers need fewer workers.Thus, one group of workers obtains unjustifiably high wages at the expense ofother workers who are unable to find jobs at all. This—in conjunction withminimum wage laws—is the cause of widespread unemployment. Unemployment is theinevitable result of forcing wage rates above their free-market level. In a freeeconomy, in which neither employers nor workers are subject to coercion, wagerates always tend toward the level at which all those who seek employment willbe able to obtain it. In a frozen, controlled economy, this process is blocked.As a result of allegedly “pro-labor” legislation and of the monopolistic powerthat labor unions enjoy, unemployed workers are not free to compete in the labormarket by offering their services for less than the prevailing wage rates;employers are not free to hire them. In the case of strikes, if unemployedworkers attempted to obtain the jobs vacated by union strikers, by offering towork for a lower wage, they often would be subjected to threats and physicalviolence at the hands of union members. These facts are as notorious as they areevaded in most current discussions of the unemployment problem—particularly bygovernment officials.c. When market conditions are such that producers whose labor costs have risencannot raise the prices of the goods they sell, a curtailment of productionresults, as indicated above; and the general population accordingly suffers aloss of potential goods and services. (The notion that producers can “absorb”such wage increases, by “taking them out of profits,” without a detriment tofuture production, is worse than economically naive; it is profits that makefuture production possible; the amount of profits that go, not into investment,but into the producer’s personal consumption, is negligible in the overalleconomic context.) To the extent that market conditions do allow, producerswhose labor costs have risen are obliged to raise the prices of their goods.Then, workers in other industries find that their living costs have gone up,that they must now pay higher prices for the goods they purchase. Then, they inturn demand a raise in their industries, which leads to new price rises, whichleads to new wage increases, etc. (Union leaders typically express indignationwhenever prices are raised; the only prices they consider it moral to raise arethe prices paid for labor, i.e., wages.) Non-unionized workers, and the rest ofthe population generally, face this same steady rise in their living costs; theyare made to subsidize the unjustifiably high wages of union workers—and are theunacknowledged victims of the unions’ “social gains.” And one observes thespectacle of bricklayers receiving two or even three times the salary of officeworkers and professors.It cannot be sufficiently emphasized that it is not unionism as such butgovernment controls and regulations which make this state of affairs possible.In a free, unregulated economy, in a market from which coercion is barred, noeconomic group can acquire the power so to victimize the rest of the population.The solution does not lie in new legislation directed against unions, but in therepeal of the legislation that made the present evil possible.The inability of unions to achieve real, widespread raises in wage rates—toraise the standard of living generally—is in part obscured by the phenomenon ofinflation. As a consequence of the government’s policy of deficit spending andcredit expansion, the purchasing power of the monetary unit, the dollar, hasdiminished drastically across the years. Nominal wage rates have increasedconsiderably more than real wage rates, that is, wages measured in terms ofactual purchasing power.What has further served to obscure this issue is the fact that real wage rateshave risen considerably since the start of the century. In spite of destructiveand increasing governmental restraints on the freedom of production and trade,major advances in science, technology, and capital accumulation have been madeand have raised the general standard of living. It should be added that theseadvances are less than would have occurred in a fully free economy and, ascontrols continue to tighten, such advances become slower and rarer.It is relevant to consider against what obstacles businessmen have had to fightand to go on producing—when one hears labor leaders proclaiming, in indignanttones, the workers’ right to a “larger share” of the “national product.” Toparaphrase John Galt: A larger share—provided by whom? Blank out.Economic progress, like every other form of progress, has only one ultimatesource: man’s mind—and can exist only to the extent that man is free totranslate his thought into action.Let anyone who believes that a high standard of living is the achievement oflabor unions and government controls ask himself the following question: If onehad a “time machine” and transported the united labor chieftains of America,plus three million government bureaucrats, back to the tenth century—would theybe able to provide the medieval serf with electric light, refrigerators,automobiles, and television sets? When one grasps that they would not, oneshould identify who and what made these things possible.32[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-32] Postscript: After completing the above, I noticed an article in The New YorkTimes of September 8 that is too apropos to let pass without acknowledgment. Thearticle, entitled “10 U.A.W. Leaders Find Unions Are Losing Members’ Loyalty,”by Damon Stetson, reports that executives of the United Automobile Workers metto discuss the problem of workers’ increasing lack of loyalty to unionleadership and union solidarity. One U.A.W. official is quoted as declaring:“How can we get greater loyalty from the individual to the union? All the thingswe fought for, the corporation is now giving the workers. What we have to findare other things the workers want which the employer is not willing to give him,and we have to develop our program around these things as reasons for belongingto the union.”Is any comment necessary? (NOVEMBER 1963.)PUBLIC EDUCATIONSHOULD EDUCATION BE COMPULSORY AND TAX-SUPPORTED, AS IT IS TODAY? The answer to this question becomes evident if one makes the question moreconcrete and specific, as follows: Should the government be permitted to removechildren forcibly from their homes, with or without the parents’ consent, andsubject the children to educational training and procedures of which the parentsmay or may not approve? Should citizens have their wealth expropriated tosupport an educational system which they may or may not sanction, and to pay forthe education of children who are not their own? To anyone who understands andis consistently committed to the principle of individual rights, the answer isclearly: No.There are no moral grounds whatever for the claim that education is theprerogative of the State—or for the claim that it is proper to expropriate thewealth of some men for the unearned benefit of others.The doctrine that education should be controlled by the State is consistent withthe Nazi or communist theory of government. It is not consistent with theAmerican theory of government.The totalitarian implications of State education (preposterously described as“free education”) have in part been obscured by the fact that in America, unlikeNazi Germany or Soviet Russia, private schools are legally tolerated. Suchschools, however, exist not by right but only by permission.Further, the facts remain that: (a) most parents are effectively compelled tosend their children to State schools, since they are taxed to support theseschools and cannot afford to pay the additional fees required to send theirchildren to private schools; (b) the standards of education, controlling allschools, are prescribed by the State; (c) the growing trend in Americaneducation is for the government to exert wider and wider control over everyaspect of education.As an example of this last: when many parents, who objected to the pictographicmethod of teaching school-children to read, undertook to teach their children athome by the phonetic method—a proposal was made legally to forbid parents to doso. What is the implication of this, if not that the child’s mind belongs to theState?When the State assumes financial control of education, it is logicallyappropriate that the State should progressively assume control of the content ofeducation—since the State has the responsibility of judging whether or not itsfunds are being used “satisfactorily.” But when a government enters the sphereof ideas, when it presumes to prescribe in issues concerning intellectualcontent, that is the death of a free society.To quote Isabel Paterson in The God of the Machine:Educational texts are necessarily selective, in subject matter, language, andpoint of view. Where teaching is conducted by private schools, there will be aconsiderable variation in different schools; the parents must judge what theywant their children taught, by the curriculum offered. Then each must strive forobjective truth. . . . Nowhere will there be any inducement to teach the“supremacy of the state” as a compulsory philosophy. But every politicallycontrolled educational system will inculcate the doctrine of state supremacysooner or later, whether as the divine right of kings, or the “will of thepeople” in “democracy.” Once that doctrine has been accepted, it becomes analmost superhuman task to break the stranglehold of the political power over thelife of the citizen. It has had his body, property, and mind in its clutchesfrom infancy.33 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-33]The disgracefully low level of education in America today is the predictableresult of a State-controlled school system. Schooling, to a marked extent, hasbecome a status symbol and a ritual. More and more people are enteringcollege—and fewer and fewer people are emerging properly educated. Oureducational system is like a vast bureaucracy, a vast civil service, in whichthe trend is toward a policy of considering everything about a teacher’squalifications (such as the number of his publications) except his teachingability; and of considering everything about a student’s qualifications (such ashis “social adaptability”) except his intellectual competence.The solution is to bring the field of education into the marketplace.There is an urgent economic need for education. When educational institutionshave to compete with one another in the quality of the training they offer—whenthey have to compete for the value that will be attached to the diplomas theyissue—educational standards will necessarily rise. When they have to compete forthe services of the best teachers, the teachers who will attract the greatestnumber of students, then the caliber of teaching—and of teachers’ salaries—willnecessarily rise. (Today, the most talented teachers often abandon theirprofession and enter private industry, where they know their efforts will bebetter rewarded.) When the economic principles that have resulted in thesuperlative efficiency of American industry are permitted to operate in thefield of education, the result will be a revolution, in the direction ofunprecedented educational development and growth.Education should be liberated from the control or intervention of government,and turned over to profit-making private enterprise, not because education isunimportant, but because education is so crucially important.What must be challenged is the prevalent belief that education is some sort of“natural right”—in effect, a free gift of nature. There are no such free gifts.But it is in the interests of statism to foster this delusion—in order to throwa smokescreen over the issue of whose freedom must be sacrificed to pay for such“free gifts.”As a result of the fact that education has been tax-supported for such a longtime, most people find it difficult to project an alternative. Yet there isnothing unique about education that distinguishes it from the many other humanneeds which are filled by private enterprise. If, for many years, the governmenthad undertaken to provide all the citizens with shoes (on the grounds that shoesare an urgent necessity), and if someone were subsequently to propose that thisfield should be turned over to private enterprise, he would doubtless be toldindignantly: “What! Do you want everyone except the rich to walk aroundbarefoot?”But the shoe industry is doing its job with immeasurably greater competence thanpublic education is doing its job.To quote Isabel Paterson once more:The most vindictive resentment may be expected from the pedagogic profession forany suggestion that they should be dislodged from their dictatorial position; itwill be expressed mainly in epithets, such as “reactionary,” at the mildest.Nevertheless, the question to put to any teacher moved to such indignation is:Do you think nobody would willingly entrust his children to you and pay you forteaching them? Why do you have to extort your fees and collect your pupils bycompulsion? 34 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-34] (JUNE 1963.)INHERITED WEALTHDOES INHERITED WEALTH GIVE SOME INDIVIDUALS AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE IN A COMPETITIVEECONOMY? In considering the issue of inherited wealth, one must begin by recognizing thatthe crucial right involved is not that of the heir but of the original producerof the wealth. The right of property is the right of use and disposal; just asthe man who produces wealth has the right to use it and dispose of it in hislifetime, so he has the right to choose who shall be its recipient after hisdeath. No one else is entitled to make that choice. It is irrelevant, therefore,in this context, to consider the worthiness or unworthiness of any particularheir; his is not the basic right at stake; when people denounce inheritedwealth, it is the right of the producer that they, in fact, are attacking.It has been argued that, since the heir did not work to produce the wealth, hehas no inherent right to it; that is true: the heir’s is a derived right; theonly primary right is the producer’s. But if the future heir has no moral claimto the wealth, except by the producer’s choice, neither has anyoneelse—certainly not the government or “the public.”In a free economy, inherited wealth is not an impediment or a threat to thosewho do not possess it. Wealth, it is necessary to remember, is not a static,limited quantity that can only be divided or looted; wealth is produced; itspotential quantity is virtually unlimited.If an heir is worthy of his money, i.e., if he uses it productively, he bringsmore wealth into existence, he raises the general standard of living—and, tothat extent, he makes the road to the top easier for any talented newcomer. Thegreater the amount of wealth, of industrial development, in existence, thehigher the economic rewards (in wages and profits) and the wider the market forability—for new ideas, products and services.The less the wealth in existence, the longer and harder the struggle foreveryone. In the beginning years of an industrial economy, wages are low; thereis little market yet for unusual ability. But with every succeeding generation,as capital accumulation increases, the economic demand for men of ability rises.The existing industrial establishments desperately need such men; they have nochoice but to bid ever higher wages for such men’s services—and thus to traintheir own future competitors—so that the time required for a talented newcomerto accumulate his own fortune and establish his own business grows continuallyshorter.If the heir is not worthy of his money, the only person threatened by it ishimself. A free, competitive economy is a constant process of improvement,innovation, progress; it does not tolerate stagnation. If an heir who lacksability acquires a fortune and a great industrial establishment from hissuccessful father, he will not be able to maintain it for long; he will not beequal to the competition. In a free economy, where bureaucrats and legislatorswould not have the power to sell or grant economic favors, all of the heir’smoney would not be able to buy him protection for his incompetence; he wouldhave to be good at his work or lose his customers to companies run by men ofsuperior ability. There is nothing as vulnerable as a large, mismanaged companythat competes with small, efficient ones.The personal luxuries or drunken parties that the incompetent heir may enjoy onhis father’s money are of no economic significance. In business, he would not beable to stand in the way of talented competitors or serve as an impediment tomen of ability. He would find no automatic security anywhere.At the turn of the century, there was a popular phrase that is very eloquentwith regard to the foregoing: “From shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in threegenerations.” If a self-made man rose by ability and left his business tounworthy heirs, his grandson went back to the shirtsleeves of obscureemployment. (He did not end up with the governorship of a state.)It is a mixed economy—such as the semi-socialist or semi-fascist variety we havetoday—that protects the non-productive rich by freezing a society on a givenlevel of development, by freezing people into classes and castes and making itincreasingly more difficult for men to rise or fall or move from one caste toanother; so that whoever inherited a fortune before the freeze can keep it withlittle fear of competition, like an heir in a feudal society.It is significant how many heirs of great industrial fortunes, the second- andthird-generation millionaires, are welfare statists, clamoring for more and morecontrols. The target and victims of these controls are the men of ability who,in a free economy, would displace these heirs; the men with whom the heirs wouldbe unable to compete.As Ludwig von Mises writes in Human Action:Today taxes often absorb the greater part of the newcomer’s “excessive” profits.He cannot accumulate capital; he cannot expand his own business; he will neverbecome big business and a match for the vested interests. The old firms do notneed to fear his competition; they are sheltered by the tax collector. They maywith impunity indulge in routine. . . . It is true, the income tax preventsthem, too, from accumulating new capital. But what is more important for them isthat it prevents the dangerous newcomer from accumulating any capital. They arevirtually privileged by the tax system. In this sense progressive taxationchecks economic progress and makes for rigidity. . . .The interventionists complain that big business is getting rigid andbureaucratic and that it is no longer possible for competent newcomers tochallenge the vested interests of the old rich families. However, as far astheir complaints are justified, they complain about things which are merely theresult of their own policies.35 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-35](JUNE 1963.)CAPITALISM’S PRACTICALITYIS THERE ANY VALIDITY TO THE CLAIM THAT LAISSEZ-FAIRE CAPITALISM BECOMES LESSPRACTICABLE AS SOCIETY BECOMES MORE COMPLEX? This claim is the sort of collectivist bromide that “liberals” repeatritualistically, without any attempt to prove or substantiate it. To examine itis to perceive its absurdity.The same condition of freedom that is necessary in order to attain a high levelof industrial development—a high level of “complexity”—is necessary in order tokeep it. To say that a society has become more complex merely means that moremen live in the same geographical area and deal with one another, that theyengage in a greater volume of trading, and in a greater number and diversity ofproductive activities. There is nothing in these facts which conceivably couldjustify the abandonment of economic freedom in favor of government “planning.”On the contrary: the more “complex” an economy, the greater the number ofchoices and decisions that have to be made—and, therefore, the more blatantlyimpracticable it becomes for this process to be taken over by a centralgovernment authority. If there are degrees of irrationality, it would be moreplausible to imagine that a primitive, pre-industrial economy could be managed,non-disastrously, by the state; but the notion of running a scientific, highlyindustrialized society with slave labor is barbaric in the ignorance it reveals.Observe that the same type of persons who espouse this doctrine also declarethat the under-developed nations of the world are not suited for economicfreedom, that their primitive level of development makes socialism imperative.Thus, they simultaneously argue that a country should not be permitted freedombecause it is too undeveloped economically—and that a country should not bepermitted freedom because it is too highly developed economically.Both positions are crude rationalizations on the part of statist mentalities whohave never grasped what makes industrial civilization possible. (NOVEMBER 1963.)"},{"pageContent":"6. GOLD AND ECONOMIC FREEDOMby Alan Greenspan An almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is one issue whichunites statists of all persuasions. They seem to sense—perhap more clearly andsubtly than many consistent defenders of laissez-faire—that gold and economicfreedom are inseparable, that the gold standard is an instrument oflaissez-faire and that each implies and requires the other.In order to understand the source of their antagonism, it is necessary first tounderstand the specific role of gold in a free society.Money is the common denominator of all economic transactions. It is thatcommodity which serves as a medium of exchange, is universally acceptable to allparticipants in an exchange economy as payment for their goods or services, andcan, therefore, be used as a standard of market value and as a store of value,i.e., as a means of saving.The existence of such a commodity is a precondition of a division of laboreconomy. If men did not have some commodity of objective value which wasgenerally acceptable as money, they would have to resort to primitive barter orbe forced to live on self-sufficient farms and forgo the inestimable advantagesof specialization. If men had no means to store value, i.e., to save, neitherlong-range planning nor exchange would be possible.The Objectivist, July 1966.What medium of exchange will be acceptable to all participants in an economy isnot determined arbitrarily. First, the medium of exchange should be durable. Ina primitive society of meager wealth, wheat might be sufficiently durable toserve as a medium, since all exchanges would occur only during and immediatelyafter the harvest, leaving no value-surplus to store. But where store-of-valueconsiderations are important, as they are in richer, more civilized societies,the medium of exchange must be a durable commodity, usually a metal. A metal isgenerally chosen because it is homogeneous and divisible: every unit is the sameas every other and it can be blended or formed in any quantity. Precious jewels,for example, are neither homogeneous nor divisible.More important, the commodity chosen as a medium must be a luxury. Human desiresfor luxuries are unlimited and, therefore, luxury goods are always in demand andwill always be acceptable. Wheat is a luxury in underfed civilizations, but notin a prosperous society. Cigarettes ordinarily would not serve as money, butthey did in post-World War II Europe where they were considered a luxury. Theterm “luxury good” implies scarcity and high unit value. Having a high unitvalue, such a good is easily portable; for instance, an ounce of gold is worth ahalf-ton of pig iron.In the early stages of a developing money economy, several media of exchangemight be used, since a wide variety of commodities would fulfill the foregoingconditions. However, one of the commodities will gradually displace all others,by being more widely acceptable. Preferences on what to hold as a store of valuewill shift to the most widely acceptable commodity, which, in turn, will make itstill more acceptable. The shift is progressive until that commodity becomes thesole medium of exchange. The use of a single medium is highly advantageous forthe same reasons that a money economy is superior to a barter economy: it makesexchanges possible on an incalculably wider scale.Whether the single medium is gold, silver, seashells, cattle, or tobacco isoptional, depending on the context and development of a given economy. In fact,all have been employed, at various times, as media of exchange. Even in thepresent century, two major commodities, gold and silver, have been used asinternational media of exchange, with gold becoming the predominant one. Gold,having both artistic and functional uses and being relatively scarce, has alwaysbeen considered a luxury good. It is durable, portable, homogeneous, divisible,and, therefore, has significant advantages over all other media of exchange.Since the beginning of World War I, it has been virtually the sole internationalstandard of exchange.If all goods and services were to be paid for in gold, large payments would bedifficult to execute, and this would tend to limit the extent of a society’sdivision of labor and specialization. Thus a logical extension of the creationof a medium of exchange is the development of a banking system and creditinstruments (bank notes and deposits) which act as a substitute for, but areconvertible into, gold.A free banking system based on gold is able to extend credit and thus to createbank notes (currency) and deposits, according to the production requirements ofthe economy. Individual owners of gold are induced, by payments of interest, todeposit their gold in a bank (against which they can draw checks). But since itis rarely the case that all depositors want to withdraw all their gold at thesame time, the banker need keep only a fraction of his total deposits in gold asreserves. This enables the banker to loan out more than the amount of his golddeposits (which means that he holds claims to gold rather than gold as securityfor his deposits). But the amount of loans which he can afford to make is notarbitrary: he has to gauge it in relation to his reserves and to the status ofhis investments.When banks loan money to finance productive and profitable endeavors, the loansare paid off rapidly and bank credit continues to be generally available. Butwhen the business ventures financed by bank credit are less profitable and slowto pay off, bankers soon find that their loans outstanding are excessiverelative to their gold reserves, and they begin to curtail new lending, usuallyby charging higher interest rates. This tends to restrict the financing of newventures and requires the existing borrowers to improve their profitabilitybefore they can obtain credit for further expansion. Thus, under the goldstandard, a free banking system stands as the protector of an economy’sstability and balanced growth.When gold is accepted as the medium of exchange by most or all nations, anunhampered free international gold standard serves to foster a world-widedivision of labor and the broadest international trade. Even though the units ofexchange (the dollar, the pound, the franc, etc.) differ from country tocountry, when all are defined in terms of gold the economies of the differentcountries act as one—so long as there are no restraints on trade or on themovement of capital. Credit, interest rates, and prices tend to follow similarpatterns in all countries. For example, if banks in one country extend credittoo liberally, interest rates in that country will tend to fall, inducingdepositors to shift their gold to higher-interest paying banks in othercountries. This will immediately cause a shortage of bank reserves in the “easymoney” country, inducing tighter credit standards and a return to competitivelyhigher interest rates again.A fully free banking system and fully consistent gold standard have not as yetbeen achieved. But prior to World War I, the banking system in the United States(and in most of the world) was based on gold, and even though governmentsintervened occasionally, banking was more free than controlled. Periodically, asa result of overly rapid credit expansion, banks became loaned up to the limitof their gold reserves, interest rates rose sharply, new credit was cut off, andthe economy went into a sharp, but short-lived recession. (Compared with thedepressions of 1920 and 1932, the pre-World War I business declines were mildindeed.) It was limited gold reserves that stopped the unbalanced expansions ofbusiness activity, before they could develop into the post- World War I type ofdisaster. The readjustment periods were short and the economies quicklyre-established a sound basis to resume expansion.But the process of cure was misdiagnosed as the disease: if shortage of bankreserves was causing a business decline—argued economic interventionists—why notfind a way of supplying increased reserves to the banks so they never need beshort! If banks can continue to loan money indefinitely—it was claimed—thereneed never be any slumps in business. And so the Federal Reserve System wasorganized in 1913. It consisted of twelve regional Federal Reserve banksnominally owned by private bankers, but in fact government sponsored,controlled, and supported. Credit extended by these banks is in practice (thoughnot legally) backed by the taxing power of the federal government. Technically,we remained on the gold standard; individuals were still free to own gold, andgold continued to be used as bank reserves. But now, in addition to gold, creditextended by the Federal Reserve banks (“paper” reserves) could serve as legaltender to pay depositors.When business in the United States underwent a mild contraction in 1927, theFederal Reserve created more paper reserves in the hope of forestalling anypossible bank reserve shortage. More disastrous, however, was the FederalReserve’s attempt to assist Great Britain who had been losing gold to us becausethe Bank of England refused to allow interest rates to rise when market forcesdictated (it was politically unpalatable). The reasoning of the authoritiesinvolved was as follows: if the Federal Reserve pumped excessive paper reservesinto American banks, interest rates in the United States would fall to a levelcomparable with those in Great Britain; this would act to stop Britain’s goldloss and avoid the political embarrassment of having to raise interest rates.The “Fed” succeeded: it stopped the gold loss, but it nearly destroyed theeconomies of the world, in the process. The excess credit which the Fed pumpedinto the economy spilled over into the stock market—triggering a fantasticspeculative boom. Belatedly, Federal Reserve officials attempted to sop up theexcess reserves and finally succeeded in braking the boom. But it was too late:by 1929 the speculative imbalances had become so overwhelming that the attemptprecipitated a sharp retrenching and a consequent demoralizing of businessconfidence. As a result, the American economy collapsed. Great Britain faredeven worse, and rather than absorb the full consequences of her previous folly,she abandoned the gold standard completely in 1931, tearing asunder whatremained of the fabric of confidence and inducing a world-wide series of bankfailures. The world economies plunged into the Great Depression of the 1930’s.With a logic reminiscent of a generation earlier, statists argued that the goldstandard was largely to blame for the credit debacle which led to the GreatDepression. If the gold standard had not existed, they argued, Britain’sabandonment of gold payments in 1931 would not have caused the failure of banksall over the world. (The irony was that since 1913, we had been, not on a goldstandard, but on what may be termed “a mixed gold standard”; yet it is gold thattook the blame.)But the opposition to the gold standard in any form—from a growing number ofwelfare-state advocates—was prompted by a much subtler insight: the realizationthat the gold standard is incompatible with chronic deficit spending (thehallmark of the welfare state). Stripped of its academic jargon, the welfarestate is nothing more than a mechanism by which governments confiscate thewealth of the productive members of a society to support a wide variety ofwelfare schemes. A substantial part of the confiscation is effected by taxation.But the welfare statists were quick to recognize that if they wished to retainpolitical power, the amount of taxation had to be limited and they had to resortto programs of massive deficit spending, i.e., they had to borrow money, byissuing government bonds, to finance welfare expenditures on a large scale.Under a gold standard, the amount of credit that an economy can support isdetermined by the economy’s tangible assets, since every credit instrument isultimately a claim on some tangible asset. But government bonds are not backedby tangible wealth, only by the government’s promise to pay out of future taxrevenues, and cannot easily be absorbed by the financial markets. A large volumeof new government bonds can be sold to the public only at progressively higherinterest rates. Thus, government deficit spending under a gold standard isseverely limited.The abandonment of the gold standard made it possible for the welfare statiststo use the banking system as a means to an unlimited expansion of credit. Theyhave created paper reserves in the form of government bonds which—through acomplex series of steps—the banks accept in place of tangible assets and treatas if they were an actual deposit, i.e., as the equivalent of what was formerlya deposit of gold. The holder of a government bond or of a bank deposit createdby paper reserves believes that he has a valid claim on a real asset. But thefact is that there are now more claims outstanding than real assets.The law of supply and demand is not to be conned. As the supply of money (ofclaims) increases relative to the supply of tangible assets in the economy,prices must eventually rise. Thus the earnings saved by the productive membersof the society lose value in terms of goods. When the economy’s books arefinally balanced, one finds that this loss in value represents the goodspurchased by the government for welfare or other purposes with the moneyproceeds of the government bonds financed by bank credit expansion.In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings fromconfiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value. If there were,the government would have to make its holding illegal, as was done in the caseof gold. If everyone decided, for example, to convert all his bank deposits tosilver or copper or any other good, and thereafter declined to accept checks aspayment for goods, bank deposits would lose their purchasing power andgovernment-created bank credit would be worthless as a claim on goods. Thefinancial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for theowners of wealth to protect themselves.This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists’ tirades against gold. Deficitspending is simply a scheme for the “hidden” confiscation of wealth. Gold standsin the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of propertyrights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists’antagonism toward the gold standard."},{"pageContent":"7. NOTES ON THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN FREE ENTERPRISEby Ayn Rand If a detailed, factual study were made of all those instances in the history ofAmerican industry which have been used by the statists as an indictment of freeenterprise and as an argument in favor of a government-controlled economy, itwould be found that the actions blamed on businessmen were caused, necessitated,and made possible only by government intervention in business. The evils,popularly ascribed to big industrialists, were not the result of an unregulatedindustry, but of government power over industry. The villain in the picture wasnot the businessman, but the legislator, not free enterprise, but governmentcontrols.Businessmen were the victims, yet the victims have taken the blame (and arestill taking it), while the guilty parties have used their own guilt as anargument for the extension of their power, for wider and wider opportunities tocommit the same crime on a greater and greater scale. Public opinion has been somisinformed about the true facts that we have now reached the stage where, as acure for the country’s problems, people are asking for more and more of thepoison which made them sick in the first place.Published by Nathaniel Branden Institute, New York, 1959.As illustration, I will list below some examples which I have found in thecourse of my research into the history of just one industry—the Americanrailroads.One of the statists’ arguments in favor of government controls is the notionthat American railroads were built mainly through the financial help of thegovernment and would have been impossible without it. Actually, government helpto the railroads amounted to ten percent of the cost of all the railroads in thecountry—and the consequences of this help have been disastrous to the railroads.I quote from The Story of American Railroads by Stewart H. Holbrook:In a little more than two decades, three transcontinental railroads were builtwith government help. All three wound up in bankruptcy courts. And thus, whenJames Jerome Hill said he was going to build a line from the Great Lakes toPuget Sound, without government cash or land grant, even his close friendsthought him mad. But his Great Northern arrived at Puget Sound without a pennyof federal help, nor did it fail. It was an achievement to shame the much-toutedconstruction of the Erie Canal.36 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-36]The degree of government help received by any one railroad stood in directproportion to that railroad’s troubles and failures. The railroads with theworst histories of scandal, double-dealing, and bankruptcy were the ones thathad received the greatest amount of help from the government. The railroads thatdid best and never went through bankruptcy were the ones that had neitherreceived nor asked for government help. There may be exceptions to this rule,but in all my reading on railroads I have not found one yet.It is generally believed that in the period when railroads first began to bebuilt in this country, there was a great deal of useless “over-building,” agreat many lines which were started and abandoned after being proved worthlessand ruining those involved. The statists often use this period as an example of“the unplanned chaos” of free enterprise. The truth is that most (and perhapsall) of the useless railroads were built, not by men who intended to build arailroad for profit, but by speculators with political pull, who started theseventures for the sole purpose of obtaining money from the government.There were many forms of government help for these projects, such as federalland grants, subsidies, state bonds, municipal bonds, etc. A great manyspeculators started railroad projects as a quick means to get some governmentcash, with no concern for the future or the commercial possibilities of theirrailroads. They went through the motions of laying so many miles of shoddy rail,anywhere at all, without inquiring whether the locations they selected had anyneed for a railroad or any economic future. Some of those men collected the cashand vanished, never starting any railroad at all. This is the source of thepopular impression that the origin of American railroads was a period of wild,unscrupulous speculation. But the railroads of this period which were plannedand built by businessmen for a proper, private, commercial purpose were the onesthat survived, prospered, and proved unusual foresight in the choice of theirlocations.Among our major railroads, the most scandalous histories were those of the UnionPacific and the Central Pacific (now called Southern Pacific). These were thetwo lines built with a federal government subsidy. The Union Pacific collapsedinto bankruptcy soon after its construction, with what was, perhaps, the mostdisgraceful scandal in the history of any railroad; the scandal involvedofficial corruption. The road did not become properly organized and manageduntil it was taken over by a private capitalist, Edward H. Harriman.The Central Pacific—which was built by the “Big Four” of California, on federalsubsidies—was the railroad which was guilty of all the evils popularly heldagainst railroads. For almost thirty years, the Central Pacific controlledCalifornia, held a monopoly, and permitted no competitor to enter the state. Itcharged disastrous rates, changed them every year, and took virtually the entireprofit of the California farmers or shippers, who had no other railroad to turnto. What made this possible? It was done through the power of the Californialegislature. The Big Four controlled the legislature and held the state closedto competitors by legal restrictions—such as, for instance, a legislative actwhich gave the Big Four exclusive control of the entire coastline of Californiaand forbade any other railroad to enter any port. During these thirty years,many attempts were made by private interests to build competing railroads inCalifornia and break the monopoly of the Central Pacific. These attempts weredefeated—not by methods of free trade and free competition, but by legislativeaction.This thirty-year monopoly of the Big Four and the practices in which theyengaged are always cited as an example of the evils of big business and freeenterprise. Yet the Big Four were not free enterprisers; they were notbusinessmen who had achieved power by means of unregulated trade. They weretypical representatives of what is now called a mixed economy. They achievedpower by legislative intervention in business; none of their abuses would havebeen possible in a free, unregulated economy.The same Central Pacific is notorious for a land deal which led to thedispossession of farmers and to bloody riots in the late 1870’s. This is theincident which served as the basis for the anti-business novel, The Octopus, byFrank Norris, the incident which caused great public indignation and led tohatred of all railroads and of all big business. But this deal involved landgiven to the Big Four by the government—and the subsequent injustice was madepossible only by legislative and judicial assistance. Yet it was not governmentintervention in business that took the blame, it was business.37[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-37]At the other side of the scale, the railroad that had the cleanest history, wasmost efficiently built in the most difficult circumstances, and was responsible,single-handed, for the development of the entire American Northwest, was theGreat Northern, built by J. J. Hill without any federal help whatever. Yet Hillwas persecuted by the government all his life—under the Sherman Act, for being amonopolist (!).The worst injustice has been done by popular misconception to CommodoreVanderbilt of the New York Central. He is always referred to as “an old pirate,”“a monster of Wall Street,” etc., and always denounced for the allegedruthlessness of his Wall Street activities. But here is the actual story. WhenVanderbilt began to organize several small, obscure railroads into what was tobecome the New York Central system, he had to obtain a franchise from the CityCouncil to permit his railroad, the New York and Harlem, to enter New York City.The Council was known to be corrupt, and if one wanted a franchise, one had topay for it, which Vanderbilt did. (Should he be blamed for this, or does theblame rest on the fact that the government held an arbitrary, unanswerable powerin the matter and Vanderbilt had no choice?) The stock of his company went up,once it was known that his railroad had permission to enter the city. A littlewhile later, the Council suddenly revoked the franchise—and the Vanderbilt stockbegan to fall. The aldermen (who had taken Vanderbilt’s money), together with aclique of speculators, were selling the Vanderbilt stock short. Vanderbiltfought them and saved his railroad. His ruthlessness consisted of buying hisstock as fast as it was being dumped on the market, and thus preventing itsprice from crashing down to the level that the short-sellers needed. He riskedeverything he owned in this battle, but he won. The clique and the aldermen wentbroke.And, as if this were not enough, the same trick was repeated again a littlelater, this time involving the New York State Legislature. Vanderbilt needed anact of the legislature to permit him to consolidate the two railroads which heowned. Again, he had to pay the legislators for a promise to pass the necessarybill. The stock of his company went up, the legislators started selling it shortand denied Vanderbilt the promised legislation. He had to go through the sameWall Street battle again, he took on a frightening responsibility, he riskedeverything he owned plus millions borrowed from friends, but he won and ruinedthe Albany statesmen. “We busted the whole legislature,” he said, “and some ofthe honorable members had to go home without paying their board bills.”Nothing is said or known nowadays about the details of this story, and it isviciously ironic that Vanderbilt is now used as one of the examples of the evilsof free enterprise by those who advocate government controls. The Albanystatesmen are forgotten and Vanderbilt is made to be a villain. If you now askpeople just what was evil about Vanderbilt, they will answer: “Why, he didsomething cruel in Wall Street and ruined a lot of people.”38[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-38]The best illustration of the general confusion on the subject of business andgovernment can be found in Holbrook’s The Story of American Railroads. On page231, Mr. Holbrook writes:Almost from the first, too, the railroads had to undergo the harassments ofpoliticians and their catch-poles, or to pay blackmail in one way or another.The method was almost sure-fire; the politico, usually a member of a statelegislature, thought up some law or regulation that would be costly or awkwardto the railroads in his state. He then put this into the form of a bill, talkedloudly about it, about how it must pass if the sovereign people were to beprotected against the monster railroad, and then waited for some hireling of therailroad to dissuade him by a method as old as man. There is record of as manyas thirty-five bills that would harass railroads being introduced at one sittingof one legislature.And the same Mr. Holbrook in the same book just four pages later (pages 235-236)writes:In short, by 1870, to pick an arbitrary date, railroads had become, as only toomany orators of the day pointed out, a law unto themselves. They had boughtUnited States senators and congressmen, just as they bought rails andlocomotives—with cash. They owned whole legislatures, and often the statecourts. . . . To call the roads of 1870 corrupt is none too strong a term.The connection between these two statements and the conclusion to be drawn fromthem has, apparently, never occurred to Mr. Holbrook. It is the railroads thathe blames and calls “corrupt.” Yet what could the railroads do, except try to“own whole legislatures,” if these legislatures held the power of life or deathover them? What could the railroads do, except resort to bribery, if they wishedto exist at all? Who was to blame and who was “corrupt”—the businessmen who hadto pay “protection money” for the right to remain in business—or the politicianswho held the power to sell that right?Still another popular accusation against big business is the idea that selfish,private interests restrain and delay progress, when they are threatened with anew invention that might destroy their market. No private interest could or everhas done this, except with government help. The early history of the railroadsis a good illustration. The railroads were violently opposed by the owners ofcanals and steamship companies, who were doing most of the transportation at thetime. A great number of laws, regulations, and restrictions were passed byvarious legislatures, at the instigation of the canal interests, in an attemptto hamper and stop the development of the railroads. This was done in the nameof the “public welfare” (!). When the first railroad bridge was built across theMississippi, the river steamship interests brought suit against its builder, andthe court ordered the bridge destroyed as a “material obstruction and anuisance.” The Supreme Court reversed the ruling, by a narrow margin, andallowed the bridge to stand.39 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-39] Askyourself what the fate of the entire industrial development of the United Stateswould have been, if that narrow margin had been different—and what is the fateof all economic progress when it is left, not to objective demonstration, but tothe arbitrary decision of a few men armed with political power.It is important to note that the railroad owners did not start in business bycorrupting the government. They had to turn to the practice of bribinglegislators only in self-protection. The first and best builders of railroadswere free enterprisers who took great risks on their own, with private capitaland no government help. It was only when they demonstrated to the country thatthe new industry held a promise of tremendous wealth that the speculators andthe legislators rushed into the game to milk the new giant for all it was worth.It was only when the legislatures began the blackmail of threatening to passdisastrous and impossible regulations that the railroad owners had to turn tobribery.It is significant that the best of the railroad builders, those who started outwith private funds, did not bribe legislatures to throttle competitors nor toobtain any kind of special legal advantage or privilege. They made theirfortunes by their own personal ability—and if they resorted to bribery at all,like Commodore Vanderbilt, it was only to buy the removal of some artificialrestriction, such as a permission to consolidate. They did not pay to getsomething from the legislature, but only to get the legislature out of theirway. But the builders who started out with government help, such as the Big Fourof the Central Pacific, were the ones who used the government for specialadvantages and owed their fortunes to legislation more than to personal ability.This is the inevitable result of any kind or degree of mixed economy. It is onlywith the help of government regulations that a man of lesser ability can destroyhis better competitors—and he is the only type of man who runs to government foreconomic help.It is not a matter of accidental personalities, of “dishonest businessmen” or“dishonest legislators.” The dishonesty is inherent in and created by thesystem. So long as a government holds the power of economic control, it willnecessarily create a special “elite,” an “aristocracy of pull,” it will attractthe corrupt type of politician into the legislature, it will work to theadvantage of the dishonest businessman, and will penalize and, eventually,destroy the honest and the able.The examples quoted are only a few of the more obvious ones; there is a greatnumber of others, all demonstrating the same point. These were taken from thehistory of a single industry. One can well imagine what one would discover ifone went through the history of other American industries in similar detail.It is time to clarify in the public mind the pernicious confusion which wascreated by Marxism and which most people have unthinkingly accepted: the notionthat economic controls are the proper function of government, that government isa tool of economic class interests, and that the issue is only which particularclass or pressure group shall be served by the government. Most people believethat free enterprise is a controlled economy allegedly serving the interests ofthe industrialists—as opposed to the welfare state, which is a controlledeconomy allegedly serving the interests of the workers. The idea or possibilityof an uncontrolled economy has been entirely forgotten and is now beingdeliberately ignored. Most people would see no difference between businessmensuch as J. J. Hill of the Great Northern and businessmen such as the Big Four ofthe Central Pacific. Most people would simply dismiss the difference by sayingthat businessmen are crooks who will always corrupt the government and that thesolution is to let the government be corrupted by labor unions.The issue is not between pro-business controls and pro-labor controls, butbetween controls and freedom. It is not the Big Four against the welfare state,but the Big Four and the welfare state on one side—against J. J. Hill and everyhonest worker on the other. Government control of the economy, no matter inwhose behalf, has been the source of all the evils in our industrial history—andthe solution is laissez-faire capitalism, i.e., the abolition of any and allforms of government intervention in production and trade, the separation ofState and Economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separationof Church and State."},{"pageContent":"8. THE EFFECTS OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION ON WOMEN AND CHILDRENby Robert HessenCHILD LABOR AND THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION The least understood and most widely misrepresented aspect of the history ofcapitalism is child labor.One cannot evaluate the phenomenon of child labor in England during theIndustrial Revolution of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century,unless one realizes that the introduction of the factory system offered alivelihood, a means of survival, to tens of thousands of children who would nothave lived to be youths in the pre-capitalistic eras.The factory system led to a rise in the general standard of living, to rapidlyfalling urban death rates and decreasing infant mortality—and produced anunprecedented population explosion.In 1750, England’s population was six million; it was nine million in 1800 andtwelve million in 1820, a rate of increase without precedent in any era. The agedistribution of the population shifted enormously; the proportion of childrenand youths increased sharply. “The proportion of those born in London dyingbefore five years of age” fell from 74.5 percent in 1730-49 to 31.8 percent in1810-29.40 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-40] Children who hithertowould have died in infancy now had a chance for survival.The Objectivist Newsletter, April and November 1962.Both the rising population and the rising life expectancy give the lie to theclaims of socialist and fascist critics of capitalism that the conditions of thelaboring classes were progressively deteriorating during the IndustrialRevolution.One is both morally unjust and ignorant of history if one blames capitalism forthe condition of children during the Industrial Revolution, since, in fact,capitalism brought an enormous improvement over their condition in the precedingage. The source of that injustice was ill-informed, emotional novelists andpoets, like Dickens and Mrs. Browning; fanciful medievalists, like Southey;political tract writers posturing as economic historians, like Engels and Marx.All of them painted a vague, rosy picture of a lost “golden age” of the workingclasses, which, allegedly, was destroyed by the Industrial Revolution.Historians have not supported their assertions. Investigation and common sensehave deglamorized the pre-factory system of domestic industry. In that system,the worker made a costly initial investment, or paid heavy rentals, for a loomor frame, and bore most of the speculative risks involved. His diet was drab andmeager, and even subsistence often depended on whether work could be found forhis wife and children. There was nothing romantic or enviable about a familyliving and working together in a badly lighted, improperly ventilated, andpoorly constructed cottage.How did children thrive before the Industrial Revolution? In 1697, John Lockewrote a report for the Board of Trade on the problem of poverty and poor-relief.Locke estimated that a laboring man and his wife in good health could support nomore than two children, and he recommended that all children over three years ofage should be taught to earn their living at working schools for spinning andknitting, where they would be given food. “What they can have at home, fromtheir parents,” wrote Locke, “is seldom more than bread and water, and that veryscantily too.”Professor Ludwig von Mises reminds us:The factory owners did not have the power to compel anybody to take a factoryjob. They could only hire people who were ready to work for the wages offered tothem. Low as these wage rates were, they were nonetheless much more than thesepaupers could earn in any other field open to them. It is a distortion of factsto say that the factories carried off the housewives from the nurseries and thekitchen and the children from their play. These women had nothing to cook withand to feed their children. These children were destitute and starving. Theironly refuge was the factory. It saved them, in the strict sense of the term,from death by starvation.41 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-41]Factory children went to work at the insistence of their parents. The children’shours of labor were very long, but the work was often quite easy—usually justattending a spinning or weaving machine and retying threads when they broke. Itwas not on behalf of such children that the agitation for factory legislationbegan. The first child labor law in England (1788) regulated the hours andconditions of labor of the miserable children who worked as chimney sweeps—adirty, dangerous job which long antedated the Industrial Revolution, and whichwas not connected with factories. The first Act which applied to factorychildren was passed to protect those who had been sent into virtual slavery bythe parish authorities, a government body: they were deserted or orphaned pauperchildren who were legally under the custody of the poor-law officials in theparish, and who were bound by these officials into long terms of unpaidapprenticeship in return for a bare subsistence.Conditions of employment and sanitation are acknowledged to have been best inthe larger and newer factories. As successive Factory Acts, between 1819 and1846, placed greater and greater restrictions on the employment of children andadolescents, the owners of the larger factories, which were more easily andfrequently subject to visitation and scrutiny by the factory inspectors,increasingly chose to dismiss children from employment rather than be subjectedto elaborate, arbitrary, and ever-changing regulations on how they might run afactory which employed children. The result of legislative intervention was thatthese dismissed children, who needed to work in order to survive, were forced toseek jobs in smaller, older, and more out-of-the-way factories, where theconditions of employment, sanitation, and safety were markedly inferior. Thosewho could not find new jobs were reduced to the status of their counterparts ahundred years before, that is, to irregular agricultural labor, or worse—in thewords of Professor von Mises—to “infest the country as vagabonds, beggars,tramps, robbers and prostitutes.”Child labor was not ended by legislative fiat; child labor ended when it becameeconomically unnecessary for children to earn wages in order to survive—when theincome of their parents became sufficient to support them. The emancipators andbenefactors of those children were not legislators or factory inspectors, butmanufacturers and financiers. Their efforts and investments in machinery led toa rise in real wages, to a growing abundance of goods at lower prices, and to anincomparable improvement in the general standard of living.The proper answer to the critics of the Industrial Revolution is given byProfessor T. S. Ashton:There are today on the plains of India and China men and women, plague-riddenand hungry, living lives little better, to outward appearance, than those of thecattle that toil with them by day and share their places of sleep by night. SuchAsiatic standards, and such un-mechanized horrors, are the lot of those whoincrease their numbers without passing through an industrial revolution.42[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-42]Let me add that the Industrial Revolution and its consequent prosperity were theachievement of capitalism and cannot be achieved under any otherpolitico-economic system. As proof, I offer you the spectacle of Soviet Russiawhich combines industrialization—and famine.WOMEN AND THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONTo condemn capitalism one must first misrepresent its history. The notion thatindustrial capitalism led to nothing but misery and degradation for women is anarticle of faith among critics of capitalism. It is as prevalent as the viewthat children were victimized and exploited by the Industrial Revolution—and itis as false.Let us examine the source of this view. To appreciate the benefits thatcapitalism brought to women, one must compare their status under capitalism withtheir condition in the preceding centuries. But the nineteenth-century criticsof capitalism did not do this; instead, they distorted and falsified history,glamorizing the past and disparaging everything modern by contrast.For instance, Richard Oastler, one of the most fanatical nineteenth-centuryenemies of capitalism, claimed that everyone was better off spiritually andmaterially in the Middle Ages than in the early nineteenth century. Describingmedieval England, Oastler rhapsodized about the lost golden age: “Oh, what abeautiful ship was England once! She was well built, well manned, wellprovisioned, well rigged! All were then merry, cheerful and happy on board.”This was said of centuries in which “the bulk of the population were peasants ina servile condition, bound by status, not free to change their mode of life orto move from their birthplace”43[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-43]—when people had only the promise ofhappiness in the life beyond the grave to succor them against decimatingplagues, recurring famines and at best half-filled stomachs—when people lived inhomes so infested with dirt and vermin that one historian’s verdict about thesecottages is: “From a health point of view the only thing to be said in theirfavor was that they burnt down very easily!”44[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-44]Oastler represented the viewpoint of the medievalists. The socialists, whoagreed with them, were equally inaccurate historians.For example, describing the conditions of the masses in the pre-industrialseventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, Friedrich Engels alleged: “Theworkers vegetated throughout a passably comfortable existence, leading arighteous and peaceful life in all piety and probity; and their materialposition was far better off than their successors.”This was written of an age characterized by staggeringly high mortality rates,especially among children—crowded towns and villages untouched bysanitation—notoriously high gin consumption. The working-class diet consistedmainly of oatmeal, milk, cheese, and beer; while bread, potatoes, coffee, tea,sugar, and meat were still expensive luxuries. Bathing was infrequent andlaundering a rarity because soap was so costly, and clothing—which had to last adecade or generation—would not last if washed too often.The most rapid change wrought by the Industrial Revolution was the shifting oftextile production out of the home and into the factory. Under the previoussystem, called “domestic industry,” the spinning and weaving was done in theworker’s own home with the aid of his wife and children. When technologicaladvances caused the shifting of textile production into factories, this led,said one critic of capitalism, “to the breakup of the home as a social unit.”45[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-45]Mrs. Neff writes approvingly that “under the system of domestic industry theparents and the children had worked together, the father the autocratic head,pocketing the family earnings and directing their expenditure.” Her tone turnsto condemnation when she recounts: “But under the factory system the members ofthe family all had their own earnings, they worked in separate departments ofthe mill, coming home only for food and sleep. The home was little but ashelter.”The factories were held responsible, by such critics, for every social problemof that age, including promiscuity, infidelity, and prostitution. Implicit inthe condemnation of women working in the factories was the notion that a woman’splace is in the home and that her only proper role is to keep house for herhusband and to rear his children. The factories were blamed simultaneously forremoving girls from the watchful restraints of their parents and for encouragingearly marriages; and later, for fostering maternal negligence and incompetenthousekeeping, as well as for encouraging lack of female subordination and thedesire for luxuries.It is a damning indictment of the pre-factory system to consider what kind of“luxuries” the Industrial Revolution brought within reach of the working-classbudget. Women sought such luxuries as shoes instead of clogs, hats instead ofshawls, “delicacies” (like coffee, tea, and sugar) instead of “plain food.”Critics denounced the increasing habit of wearing ready-made clothes, and theyviewed the replacement of wools and linens by inexpensive cottons as a sign ofgrowing poverty. Women were condemned for not making by hand that which theycould buy more cheaply, thanks to the revolution in textile production. Dressesno longer had to last a decade—women no longer had to wear coarse petticoatsuntil they disintegrated from dirt and age; cheap cotton dresses andundergarments were a revolution in personal hygiene.The two most prevalent nineteenth-century explanations of why women worked inthe factories were: (a) that their “husbands preferred to remain home idle,supported by their wives,” and (b) that the factory system “displaced adult menand imposed on women ‘the duty and burden of supporting their husbands andfamilies.’ ” These charges are examined in Wives and Mothers in VictorianIndustry, a definitive study by Dr. Margaret Hewitt of the University of Exeter.Her conclusion is: “Neither of these assumptions proves to have any statisticalfoundation whatsoever.”46 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-46]In fact, women worked in the factories for far more conventional reasons. Dr.Hewitt enumerates them: many women worked because “their husbands’ wages wereinsufficient to keep the home going”; others were widowed or deserted; otherswere barren, or had grown-up children; some had husbands who were unemployed, oremployed in seasonal jobs; and a few chose to work in order to earn money forextra comforts in the home, although their husbands’ wages were sufficient tocover necessities.47 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-47]What the factory system offered these women was—not misery and degradation—but ameans of survival, of economic independence, of rising above the barestsubsistence. Harsh as nineteenth-century factory conditions were, compared totwentieth-century conditions, women increasingly preferred work in the factoriesto any other alternatives open to them, such as domestic service, orback-breaking work in agricultural gangs, or working as haulers and pullers inthe mines; moreover, if a woman could support herself, she was not driven intoearly marriage.Even Professor Trevelyan, who persistently disparaged the factories and extolled“the good old days,” admitted:. . . the women who went to work in the factories though they lost some of thebest things in life [Trevelyan does not explain what he means], gainedindependence. . . . The money they earned was their own. The factory handacquired an economic position personal to herself, which in the course of timeother women came to envy.And Trevelyan concluded: “The working class home often became more comfortable,quiet and sanitary by ceasing to be a miniature factory.” 48[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-48]Critics of the factory system still try to argue that the domestic spinners orweavers could have a creator’s pride in their work, which they lost by becomingmere cogs in a huge industrial complex. Dr. Dorothy George easily demolishesthis thesis: “It seems unlikely that the average weaver, toiling hour after hourthrowing the shuttle backwards and forwards on work which was monotonous andexhausting, had the reactions which would satisfy a modern enthusiast forpeasant arts.”49 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-49]Finally, it was charged that factory work made women too concerned with materialcomforts at the expense of spiritual considerations.The misery in which women lived before capitalism, might have made them cherishthe New Testament injunction: “Love not the world, nor the things that are inthe world.” But the productive splendor of capitalism vanquished that view.Today, the foremost champions of that viewpoint are Professor Galbraith and theausterity-preachers behind the Iron Curtain."},{"pageContent":"9. THE ASSAULT ON INTEGRITYby Alan Greenspan Protection of the consumer against “dishonest and unscrupulous businesspractices” has become a cardinal ingredient of welfare statism. Left to theirown devices, it is alleged, businessmen would attempt to sell unsafe food anddrugs, fraudulent securities, and shoddy buildings. Thus, it is argued, the PureFood and Drug Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and thenumerous building regulatory agencies are indispensable if the consumer is to beprotected from the “greed” of the businessman.But it is precisely the “greed” of the businessman or, more appropriately, hisprofit-seeking, which is the unexcelled protector of the consumer.What collectivists refuse to recognize is that it is in the self-interest ofevery businessman to have a reputation for honest dealings and a qualityproduct. Since the market value of a going business is measured by itsmoney-making potential, reputation or “good will” is as much an asset as itsphysical plant and equipment. For many a drug company, the value of itsreputation, as reflected in the salability of its brand name, is often its majorasset. The loss of reputation through the sale of a shoddy or dangerous productwould sharply reduce the market value of the drug company, though its physicalresources would remain intact. The market value of a brokerage firm is even moreclosely tied to its good-will assets. Securities worth hundreds of millions ofdollars are traded every day over the telephone. The slightest doubt as to thetrustworthiness of a broker’s word or commitment would put him out of businessovernight.The Objectivist Newsletter, August 1963.Reputation, in an unregulated economy, is thus a major competitive tool.Builders who have acquired a reputation for top quality construction take themarket away from their less scrupulous or less conscientious competitors. Themost reputable securities dealers get the bulk of the commission business. Drugmanufacturers and food processors vie with one another to make their brand namessynonymous with fine quality.Physicians have to be just as scrupulous in judging the quality of the drugsthey prescribe. They, too, are in business and compete for trustworthiness. Eventhe corner grocer is involved: he cannot afford to sell unhealthy foods if hewants to make money. In fact, in one way or another, every producer anddistributor of goods or services is caught up in the competition for reputation.It requires years of consistently excellent performance to acquire a reputationand to establish it as a financial asset. Thereafter, a still greater effort isrequired to maintain it: a company cannot afford to risk its years of investmentby letting down its standards of quality for one moment or one inferior product;nor would it be tempted by any potential “quick killing.” Newcomers entering thefield cannot compete immediately with the established, reputable companies, andhave to spend years working on a more modest scale in order to earn an equalreputation. Thus the incentive to scrupulous performance operates on all levelsof a given field of production. It is a built-in safeguard of a free enterprisesystem and the only real protection of consumers against business dishonesty.Government regulation is not an alternative means of protecting the consumer. Itdoes not build quality into goods, or accuracy into information. Its sole“contribution” is to substitute force and fear for incentive as the “protector”of the consumer. The euphemisms of government press releases to the contrarynotwithstanding, the basis of regulation is armed force. At the bottom of theendless pile of paper work which characterizes all regulation lies a gun. Whatare the results?To paraphrase Gresham’s Law: bad “protection” drives out good. The attempt toprotect the consumer by force undercuts the protection he gets from incentive.First, it undercuts the value of reputation by placing the reputable company onthe same basis as the unknown, the newcomer, or the fly-by-nighter. It declares,in effect, that all are equally suspect and that years of evidence to thecontrary do not free a man from that suspicion. Second, it grants an automatic(though, in fact, unachievable) guarantee of safety to the products of anycompany that complies with its arbitrarily set minimum standards. The value of areputation rested on the fact that it was necessary for the consumers toexercise judgment in the choice of the goods and services they purchased. Thegovernment’s “guarantee” undermines this necessity; it declares to theconsumers, in effect, that no choice or judgment is required—and that acompany’s record, its years of achievement, is irrelevant.The minimum standards, which are the basis of regulation, gradually tend tobecome the maximums as well. If the building codes set minimum standards ofconstruction, a builder does not get very much competitive advantage byexceeding those standards and, accordingly, he tends to meet only the minimums.If minimum specifications are set for vitamins, there is little profit inproducing something of above-average quality. Gradually, even the attempt tomaintain minimum standards becomes impossible, since the draining of incentivesto improve quality ultimately undermines even the minimums.The guiding purpose of the government regulator is to prevent rather than tocreate something. He gets no credit if a new miraculous drug is discovered bydrug company scientists; he does if he bans thalidomide. Such emphasis on thenegative sets the framework under which even the most conscientious regulatorsmust operate. The result is a growing body of restrictive legislation on drugexperimentation, testing, and distribution. As in all research, it is impossibleto add restrictions to the development of new drugs without simultaneouslycutting off the secondary rewards of such research—the improvement of existingdrugs. Quality improvement and innovation are inseparable.Building codes are supposed to protect the public. But by being forced to adhereto standards of construction long after they have been surpassed by newtechnological discoveries, builders divert their efforts to maintaining the oldrather than adopting new and safer techniques of construction.Regulation—which is based on force and fear—undermines the moral base ofbusiness dealings. It becomes cheaper to bribe a building inspector than to meethis standards of construction. A fly-by-night securities operator can quicklymeet all the S.E.C. requirements, gain the inference of respectability, andproceed to fleece the public. In an unregulated economy, the operator would havehad to spend a number of years in reputable dealings before he could earn aposition of trust sufficient to induce a number of investors to place funds withhim.Protection of the consumer by regulation is thus illusory. Rather than isolatingthe consumer from the dishonest businessman, it is gradually destroying the onlyreliable protection the consumer has: competition for reputation.While the consumer is thus endangered, the major victim of “protective”regulation is the producer: the businessman. Regulation which acts to destroythe competition of businessmen for reputation undermines the market value of thegood will which businessmen have built up over the years. It is an act ofexpropriation of wealth created by integrity. Since the value of a business—itswealth—rests on its ability to make money, the acts of a government seizing acompany’s plant or devaluing its reputation are in the same category: both areacts of expropriation.Moreover, “protective” legislation falls in the category of preventive law.Businessmen are being subjected to governmental coercion prior to the commissionof any crime. In a free economy, the government may step in only when a fraudhas been perpetrated, or a demonstrable damage has been done to a consumer; insuch cases the only protection required is that of criminal law.Government regulations do not eliminate potentially dishonest individuals, butmerely make their activities harder to detect or easier to hush up. Furthermore,the possibility of individual dishonesty applies to government employees fullyas much as to any other group of men. There is nothing to guarantee the superiorjudgment, knowledge, and integrity of an inspector or a bureaucrat—and thedeadly consequences of entrusting him with arbitrary power are obvious.The hallmark of collectivists is their deep-rooted distrust of freedom and ofthe free-market processes; but it is their advocacy of so-called “consumerprotection” that exposes the nature of their basic premises with particularclarity. By preferring force and fear to incentive and reward as a means ofhuman motivation, they confess their view of man as a mindless brute functioningon the range of the moment, whose actual self-interest lies in “flying-by-night”and making “quick kills.” They confess their ignorance of the role ofintelligence in the production process, of the wide intellectual context andlong-range vision required to maintain a modern industry. They confess theirinability to grasp the crucial importance of the moral values which are themotive power of capitalism. Capitalism is based on self-interest andself-esteem; it holds integrity and trustworthiness as cardinal virtues andmakes them pay off in the marketplace, thus demanding that men survive by meansof virtues, not of vices. It is this superlatively moral system that the welfarestatists propose to improve upon by means of preventive law, snoopingbureaucrats, and the chronic goad of fear."},{"pageContent":"10. THE PROPERTY STATUS OF AIRWAVESby Ayn Rand Any material element or resource which, in order to become of use or value tomen, requires the application of human knowledge and effort should be privateproperty—by the right of those who apply the knowledge and effort.This is particularly true of broadcasting frequencies or waves, because they areproduced by human action and do not exist without it. What exists in nature isonly the potential and the space through which those waves must travel.Just as two trains cannot travel on the same section of track at the same time,so two broadcasts cannot use the same frequency at the same time in the samearea without “jamming” each other. There is no difference in principle betweenthe ownership of land and the ownership of airways. The only issue is the taskof defining the application of property rights to this particular sphere. It ison this task that the American government has failed dismally, with incalculablydisastrous consequences.The Objectivist Newsletter, April 1964.There is no essential difference between a broadcast and a concert: the formermerely transmits sounds over a longer distance and requires more complextechnical equipment. No one would venture to claim that a pianist may own hisfingers and his piano, but the space inside the concert hall—through which thesound waves he produces travel—is “public property” and, therefore, he has noright to give a concert without a license from the government. Yet this is theabsurdity foisted on our broadcasting industry.The chief argument in support of the notion that broadcasting frequencies shouldbe “public property” has been stated succinctly by Justice Frankfurter: “[Radio]facilities are limited; they are not available to all who may wish to use them;the radio spectrum simply is not large enough to accommodate everybody. There isa fixed natural limitation upon the number of stations that can operate withoutinterfering with one another.”The fallacy of this argument is obvious. The number of broadcasting frequenciesis limited; so is the number of concert halls; so is the amount of oil or wheator diamonds; so is the acreage of land on the surface of the globe. There is nomaterial element or value that exists in unlimited quantity. And if a “wish” touse a certain “facility” is the criterion of the right to use it, then theuniverse is simply not large enough to accommodate all those who harbor wishesfor the unearned.It is the proper task of the government to protect individual rights and, aspart of it, to formulate the laws by which these rights are to be implementedand adjudicated. It is the government’s responsibility to define the applicationof individual rights to a given sphere of activity—to define (i.e., toidentify), not to create, invent, donate, or expropriate. The question ofdefining the application of property rights has arisen frequently, in the wakeof major scientific discoveries or inventions, such as the question of oilrights, vertical space rights, etc. In most cases, the American government wasguided by the proper principle: it sought to protect all the individual rightsinvolved, not to abrogate them.A notable example of the proper method of establishing private ownership fromscratch, in a previously ownerless area, is the Homestead Act of 1862, by whichthe government opened the western frontier for settlement and turned “publicland” over to private owners. The government offered a 160-acre farm to anyadult citizen who would settle on it and cultivate it for five years, afterwhich it would become his property. Although that land was originally regarded,in law, as “public property,” the method of its allocation, in fact, followedthe proper principle (in fact, but not in explicit ideological intention). Thecitizens did not have to pay the government as if it were an owner; ownershipbegan with them, and they earned it by the method which is the source and rootof the concept of “property”: by working on unused material resources, byturning a wilderness into a civilized settlement. Thus, the government, in thiscase, was acting not as the owner but as the custodian of ownerless resourceswho defines objectively impartial rules by which potential owners may acquirethem.This should have been the principle and pattern of the allocation ofbroadcasting frequencies.As soon as it became apparent that radio broadcasting had opened a new realm ofmaterial resources which, in the absence of legal definitions, would become awilderness of clashing individual claims, the government should have promulgatedthe equivalent of a Homestead Act of the airways—an act defining privateproperty rights in the new realm, establishing the rule that the user of a radiofrequency would own it after he had operated a station for a certain number ofyears, and allocating all frequencies by the rule of priority, i.e., “firstcome, first served.”Bear in mind that the development of commercial radio took many years ofstruggle and experimentation, and that the goldrush of the “wishers” did notstart until the pioneers—who had taken the risks of venturing into theunknown—had built it into a bright promise of great commercial value. By whatright, code, or standard was anyone entitled to that value except the men whohad created it?If the government had adhered to the principle of private property rights, andthe pioneers’ ownership had been legally established, then a latecomer whowished to acquire a radio station would have had to buy it from one of theoriginal owners (as is the case with every other type of property). The factthat the number of available frequencies was limited would have served, not toentrench the original owners, but to threaten their hold, if they did not makethe best economic use of their property (which is what free competition does toevery other type of property). With a limited supply and a growing demand,competition would have driven the market value of a radio (and later, TV)station so high that only the most competent men could have afforded to buy itor to keep it; a man, unable to make a profit could not have long afforded towaste so valuable a property. Who, on a free market, determines the economicsuccess or failure of an enterprise? The public (the public as a sum ofindividual producers, viewers, and listeners, each making his own decisions—notas a single, helpless, disembodied collective with a few bureaucrats posturingas the spokesmen of its will on earth).Contrary to the “argument from scarcity,” if you want to make a “limited”resource available to the whole people, make it private property and throw it ona free, open market.The “argument from scarcity,” incidentally, is outdated, even in its literalmeaning: with the discovery of ultra-high frequencies, there are morebroadcasting channels available today than prospective applicants willing topioneer in their development. As usual, the “wishers” seek, not to create, butto take over the rewards and advantages created by others.The history of the collectivization of radio and television demonstrates, incondensed form, in a kind of microcosm, the process and the causes ofcapitalism’s destruction. It is an eloquent illustration of the fact thatcapitalism is perishing by the philosophical default of its alleged defenders.Collectivists frequently cite the early years of radio as an example of thefailure of free enterprise. In those years, when broadcasters had no propertyrights in radio, no legal protection or recourse, the airways were a chaotic noman’s land where anyone could use any frequency he pleased and jam anyone else.Some professional broadcasters tried to divide their frequencies by privateagreements, which they could not enforce on others; nor could they fight theinterference of stray, maliciously mischievous amateurs. This state of affairswas used, then and now, to urge and justify government control of radio.This is an instance of capitalism taking the blame for the evils of its enemies.The chaos of the airways was an example, not of free enterprise, but of anarchy.It was caused, not by private property rights, but by their absence. Itdemonstrated why capitalism is incompatible with anarchism, why men do need agovernment and what is a government’s proper function. What was needed waslegality, not controls.What was imposed was worse than controls: outright nationalization. By agradual, uncontested process—by ideological default—it was taken for grantedthat the airways belong to “the people” and are “public property.”If you want to know the intellectual state of the time, I will ask you to guessthe political ideology of the author of the following quotation:Radio communication is not to be considered as merely a business carried on forprivate gain, for private advertisement, or for entertainment of the curious. Itis a public concern impressed with the public trust and to be consideredprimarily from the standpoint of public interest in the same extent and upon thebasis of the same general principles as our other public utilities.No, this was not said by a business-hating collectivist eager to establish thesupremacy of the “public interest” over “private gain”; it was not said by asocialist planner nor by a communist conspirator; it was said by Herbert Hoover,then Secretary of Commerce, in 1924.It was Hoover who fought for government control of radio and, as Secretary ofCommerce, made repeated attempts to extend government power beyond the limitsset by the legislation of the time, attempts to attach detailed conditions toradio licenses, which he had no legal authority to do and which were repeatedlynegated by the courts. It was Hoover’s influence that was largely responsiblefor that tombstone of the radio (and the then unborn television) industry knownas the Act of 1927, which established the Federal Radio Commission with all ofits autocratic, discretionary, undefined, and undefinable powers. (That Act—withminor revisions and amendments, including the Act of 1934 that changed theFederal Radio Commission into the Federal Communications Commission—is still, inall essential respects, the basic legal document ruling the broadcastingindustry today.)“What we are doing,” said F.C.C. Chairman Newton N. Minow in 1962, “did notbegin with the New Frontier.” He was right.The Act of 1927 did not confine the government to the role of a trafficpoliceman of the air who protects the rights of broadcasters from technicalinterference (which is all that was needed and all that a government shouldproperly do). It established service to the “public interest, convenience, ornecessity” as the criterion by which the Federal Radio Commission was to judgeapplicants for broadcasting licenses and accept or reject them. Since there isno such thing as the “public interest” (other than the sum of the individualinterests of individual citizens), since that collectivist catch-phrase hasnever been and can never be defined, it amounted to a blank check ontotalitarian power over the broadcasting industry, granted to whateverbureaucrats happened to be appointed to the Commission.“The public interest”—that intellectual knife of collectivism’s sacrificialguillotine, which the operators of broadcasting stations have to test by placingtheir heads on the block every three years—was not raised over their heads bycapitalism’s enemies, but by their own leaders.It was the so-called “conservatives”—including some of the pioneers, some of thebroadcasting industry’s executives who, today, are complaining andprotesting—who ran to the government for regulations and controls, who cheeredthe notion of “public property” and service to the “public interest,” and thusplanted the seeds of which Mr. Minow and Mr. Henry are merely the logical,consistent flowers. The broadcasting industry was enslaved with the sanction ofthe victims—but they were not fully innocent victims.Many businessmen, of the mixed-economy persuasion, resent the actual nature ofcapitalism; they believe that it is safer to hold a position, not by right, butby favor; they dread the competition of a free market and they feel that abureaucrat’s friendship is much easier to win. Pull, not merit, is their form of“social security.” They believe that they will always succeed at courting,pressuring, or bribing a bureaucrat, who is “a good fellow” they can “get alongwith” and who will protect them from that merciless stranger: the ablercompetitor.Consider the special privileges to be found in the status of a certified servantof the “public interest” and a licensed user of “public property.” Not only doesit place a man outside the reach of economic competition, but it also spares himthe responsibility and the costs entailed in private property. It grants himgratuitously the use of a broadcasting frequency for which he would have had topay an enormous price on a free market and would not have been able to keep forlong, if he sent forth through the air the kind of unconscionable trash he issending forth today.Such are the vested interests made possible by the doctrine of the “publicinterest”—and such are the beneficiaries of any form, version, or degree of thedoctrine of “public property.”Now observe the practical demonstration of the fact that without propertyrights, no other rights are possible. If censorship and the suppression of freespeech ever get established in this country, they will have originated in radioand television.The Act of 1927 granted to a government Commission total power over theprofessional fate of broadcasters, with the “public interest” as the criterionof judgment—and, simultaneously, forbade the Commission to censor radioprograms. From the start, and progressively louder through the years, manyvoices have been pointing out that this is a contradiction impossible topractice. If a commissioner has to judge which applicant for a broadcastinglicense will best serve the “public interest,” how can he judge it withoutjudging the content, nature, and value of the programs the applicants haveoffered or will offer?If capitalism had had any proper intellectual defenders, it is they who shouldhave been loudest in opposing a contradiction of that kind. But such was not thecase: it was the statists who seized upon it, not in defense of free speech, butin support of the Commission’s “right” to censor programs. And, so long as thecriterion of the “public interest” stood unchallenged, logic was on the side ofthe statists.The result was what it had to be (illustrating once more the power of basicprinciples): by gradual, unobtrusive, progressively accelerating steps, theCommission enlarged its control over the content of radio and televisionprograms—leading to the open threats and ultimatums of Mr. Minow, who merelymade explicit what had been known implicitly for many years. No, the Commissiondid not censor specific programs: it merely took cognizance of program contentat license-renewal time. What was established was worse than open censorship(which could be knocked out in a court of law): it was the unprovable,intangible, insidious censorship-by-displeasure —the usual, and only, result ofany nonobjective legislation.50 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-50]All media of communication influence one another. It is impossible to computethe extent to which the gray, docile, fear-ridden, appeasement-minded mediocrityof so powerful a medium as television has contributed to the demoralization ofour culture.Nor can the freedom of one medium of communication be destroyed withoutaffecting all the others. When censorship of radio and television becomes fullyaccepted, as a fait accompli, it will not be long before all the othermedia—books, magazines, newspapers, lectures—follow suit, unobtrusively,unofficially, and by the same method: overtly, in the name of the “publicinterest”; covertly, for fear of government reprisals. (This process is takingplace already.)So much for the relationship of “human” rights to property rights.Since “public property” is a collectivist fiction, since the public as a wholecan neither use nor dispose of its “property,” that “property” will always betaken over by some political “elite,” by a small clique which will then rule thepublic—a public of literal, dispossessed proletarians.If you want to gauge a collectivist theory’s distance from reality, askyourself: by what inconceivable standard can it be claimed that the broadcastingairways are the property of some illiterate sharecropper who will never be ableto grasp the concept of electronics, or of some hillbilly whose engineeringcapacity is not quite sufficient to cope with a corn-liquor still—and thatbroadcasting, the product of an incalculable amount of scientific genius, is tobe ruled by the will of such owners?Remember that this literally is the alleged principle at the base of the entirelegal structure of our broadcasting industry.There is only one solution to this problem, and it has to start at the base;nothing less will do. The airways should be turned over to private ownership.The only way to do it now is to sell radio and television frequencies to thehighest bidders (by an objectively defined, open, impartial process)—and thusput an end to the gruesome fiction of “public property.”Such a reform cannot be accomplished overnight; it will take a long struggle;but that is the ultimate goal which the advocates of capitalism should bear inmind. That is the only way to correct the disastrous, atavistic error made bycapitalism’s alleged defenders.I say “atavistic,” because it took many centuries before primitive, nomadictribes of savages reached the concept of private property—specifically, landproperty, which marked the beginning of civilization. It is a tragic irony thatin the presence of a new realm opened by a gigantic achievement of science, ourpolitical and intellectual leaders reverted to the mentality of primitive nomadsand, unable to conceive of property rights, declared the new realm to be atribal hunting ground.The breach between man’s scientific achievements and his ideological developmentis growing wider every day. It is time to realize that men cannot keep this upmuch longer if they continue to retrogress to ideological savagery with everystep of scientific progress."},{"pageContent":"11. PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTSby Ayn Rand Patents and copyrights are the legal implementation of the base of all propertyrights: a man’s right to the product of his mind.Every type of productive work involves a combination of mental and physicaleffort: of thought and of physical action to translate that thought into amaterial form. The proportion of these two elements varies in different types ofwork. At the lowest end of the scale, the mental effort required to performunskilled manual labor is minimal. At the other end, what the patent andcopyright laws acknowledge is the paramount role of mental effort in theproduction of material values; these laws protect the mind’s contribution in itspurest form: the origination of an idea. The subject of patents and copyrightsis intellectual property.An idea as such cannot be protected until it has been given a material form. Aninvention has to be embodied in a physical model before it can be patented; astory has to be written or printed. But what the patent or copyright protects isnot the physical object as such, but the idea which it embodies. By forbiddingan unauthorized reproduction of the object, the law declares, in effect, thatthe physical labor of copying is not the source of the object’s value, that thatvalue is created by the originator of the idea and may not be used without hisconsent; thus the law establishes the property right of a mind to that which ithas brought into existence.The Objectivist Newsletter, May 1964.It is important to note, in this connection, that a discovery cannot bepatented, only an invention. A scientific or philosophical discovery, whichidentifies a law of nature, a principle or a fact of reality not previouslyknown, cannot be the exclusive property of the discoverer because: (a) he didnot create it, and (b) if he cares to make his discovery public, claiming it tobe true, he cannot demand that men continue to pursue or practice falsehoodsexcept by his permission. He can copyright the book in which he presents hisdiscovery and he can demand that his authorship of the discovery beacknowledged, that no other man appropriate or plagiarize the credit for it—buthe cannot copyright theoretical knowledge. Patents and copyrights pertain onlyto the practical application of knowledge, to the creation of a specific objectwhich did not exist in nature—an object which, in the case of patents, may neverhave existed without its particular originator; and in the case of copyrights,would never have existed.The government does not “grant” a patent or copyright, in the sense of a gift,privilege, or favor; the government merely secures it—i.e., the governmentcertifies the origination of an idea and protects its owner’s exclusive right ofuse and disposal. A man is not forced to apply for a patent or copyright; he maygive his idea away, if he so chooses; but if he wishes to exercise his propertyright, the government will protect it, as it protects all other rights. A patentor copyright represents the formal equivalent of registering a property deed ortitle. The patent or copyright notice on a physical object represents a publicstatement of the conditions on which the inventor or author is willing to sellhis product: for the purchaser’s use, but not for commercial reproduction.The right to intellectual property cannot be exercised in perpetuity.Intellectual property represents a claim, not on material objects, but on theidea they embody, which means: not merely on existing wealth, but on wealth yetto be produced—a claim to payment for the inventor’s or author’s work. No debtcan be extended into infinity.Material property represents a static amount of wealth already produced. It canbe left to heirs, but it cannot remain in their effortless possession inperpetuity: the heirs can consume it or must earn its continued possession bytheir own productive work. The greater the value of the property, the greaterthe effort demanded of the heir. In a free, competitive society, no one couldlong retain the ownership of a factory or of a tract of land without exercisinga commensurate effort.But intellectual property cannot be consumed. If it were held in perpetuity, itwould lead to the opposite of the very principle on which it is based: it wouldlead, not to the earned reward of achievement, but to the unearned support ofparasitism. It would become a cumulative lien on the production of unborngenerations, which would ultimately paralyze them. Consider what would happenif, in producing an automobile, we had to pay royalties to the descendants ofall the inventors involved, starting with the inventor of the wheel and on up.Apart from the impossibility of keeping such records, consider the accidentalstatus of such descendants and the unreality of their unearned claims.The inheritance of material property represents a dynamic claim on a staticamount of wealth; the inheritance of intellectual property represents a staticclaim on a dynamic process of production.Intellectual achievement, in fact, cannot be transferred, just as intelligence,ability, or any other personal virtue cannot be transferred. All that can betransferred is the material results of an achievement, in the form of actuallyproduced wealth. By the very nature of the right on which intellectual propertyis based—a man’s right to the product of his mind—that right ends with him. Hecannot dispose of that which he cannot know or judge: the yet-unproduced,indirect, potential results of his achievement four generations—or fourcenturies—later.It is in this issue that our somewhat collectivistic terminology might bemisleading: on the expiration of a patent or copyright, the intellectualproperty involved does not become “public property” (though it is labeled as “inthe public domain”); it ceases to exist qua property. And if the invention orthe book continues to be manufactured, the benefit of that former property doesnot go to the “public,” it goes to the only rightful heirs: to the producers, tothose who exercise the effort of embodying that idea in new material forms andthus keeping it alive.Since intellectual property rights cannot be exercised in perpetuity, thequestion of their time limit is an enormously complex issue. If they wererestricted to the originator’s life-span, it would destroy their value by makinglong-term contractual agreements impossible: if an inventor died a month afterhis invention were placed on the market, it could ruin the manufacturer who mayhave invested a fortune in its production. Under such conditions, investorswould be unable to take a long-range risk; the more revolutionary or importantan invention, the less would be its chance of finding financial backers.Therefore, the law has to define a period of time which would protect the rightsand interests of all those involved.In the case of copyrights, the most rational solution is Great Britain’sCopyright Act of 1911, which established the copyright of books, paintings,movies, etc., for the lifetime of the author and fifty years thereafter.In the case of patents, the issue is much more complex. A patented inventionoften tends to hamper or restrict further research and development in a givenarea of science. Many patents cover overlapping areas. The difficulty lies indefining the inventor’s specific rights without including more than he canproperly claim, in the form of indirect consequences or yet-undiscoveredimplications. A lifetime patent could become an unjustifiable barrier to thedevelopment of knowledge beyond the inventor’s potential power or actualachievement. The legal problem is to set a time limit which would secure for theinventor the fullest possible benefit of his invention without infringing theright of others to pursue independent research. As in many other legal issues,that time limit has to be determined by the principle of defining and protectingall the individual rights involved.As an objection to the patent laws, some people cite the fact that two inventorsmay work independently for years on the same invention, but one will beat theother to the patent office by an hour or a day and will acquire an exclusivemonopoly, while the loser’s work will then be totally wasted. This type ofobjection is based on the error of equating the potential with the actual. Thefact that a man might have been first does not alter the fact that he wasn’t.Since the issue is one of commercial rights, the loser in a case of that kindhas to accept the fact that in seeking to trade with others he must face thepossibility of a competitor winning the race, which is true of all types ofcompetition.Today, patents are the special target of the collectivists’ attacks—directly andindirectly, through such issues as the proposed abolition of trademarks, brandnames, etc. While the so-called “conservatives” look at those attacksindifferently or, at times, approvingly, the collectivists seem to realize thatpatents are the heart and core of property rights, and that once they aredestroyed, the destruction of all other rights will follow automatically, as abrief postscript.The present state of our patent system is a nightmare. The inventors’ rights arebeing infringed, eroded, chipped, gnawed, and violated in so many ways, undercover of so many non-objective statutes, that industrialists are beginning torely on secrecy to protect valuable inventions which they are afraid to patent.(Consider the treatment accorded to patents under the antitrust laws, as justone example out of many.)Those who observe the spectacle of the progressive collapse of patents—thespectacle of mediocrity scrambling to cash-in on the achievements of genius—andwho understand its implications, will understand why in the closing paragraphsof Chapter VII, Part II, of Atlas Shrugged, one of the guiltiest men is thepassenger who said: “Why should Rearden be the only one permitted to manufactureRearden Metal?”"},{"pageContent":"12. THEORY AND PRACTICEby Ayn RandTHE MAN-HATERSFew errors are as naive and suicidal as the attempts of the “conservatives” tojustify capitalism on altruist-collectivist grounds.Many people believe that altruism means kindness, benevolence, or respect forthe rights of others. But it means the exact opposite: it teachesself-sacrifice, as well as the sacrifice of others, to any unspecified “publicneed”; it regards man as a sacrificial animal.Believing that collectivists are motivated by an authentic concern for thewelfare of mankind, capitalism’s alleged defenders assure its enemies thatcapitalism is the practical road to the socialists’ goal, the best means to thesame end, the best “servant” of public needs.Then they wonder why they fail—and why the bloody muck of socialization keepsoozing forward over the face of the globe.They fail, because no one’s welfare can be achieved by anyone’s sacrifice—andbecause man’s welfare is not the socialists’ goal. It is not for its allegedflaws that the altruist-collectivists hate capitalism, but for its virtues.If you doubt it, consider a few examples.These two articles appeared originally in Ayn Rand’s column in the Los AngelesTimes, 1962.Many collectivist historians criticize the Constitution of the United States onthe ground that its authors were rich landowners who, allegedly, were motivated,not by any political ideals, but only by their own “selfish” economic interests.This, of course, is not true. But it is true that capitalism does not requirethe sacrifice of anyone’s interests. And what is significant here is the natureof the morality behind the collectivists’ argument.Prior to the American Revolution, through centuries of feudalism and monarchy,the interests of the rich lay in the expropriation, enslavement, and misery ofthe rest of the people. A society, therefore, where the interests of the richrequire general freedom, unrestricted productiveness, and the protection ofindividual rights, should have been hailed as an ideal system by anyone whosegoal is man’s well-being.But that is not the collectivists’ goal.A similar criticism is voiced by collectivist ideologists about the AmericanCivil War. The North, they claim disparagingly, was motivated, not byself-sacrificial concern for the plight of the slaves, but by the “selfish”economic interests of capitalism—which requires a free labor market.This last clause is true. Capitalism cannot work with slave labor. It was theagrarian, feudal South that maintained slavery. It was the industrial,capitalistic North that wiped it out—as capitalism wiped out slavery and serfdomin the whole civilized world of the nineteenth century.What greater virtue can one ascribe to a social system than the fact that itleaves no possibility for any man to serve his own interests by enslaving othermen? What nobler system could be desired by anyone whose goal is man’swell-being?But that is not the collectivists’ goal.Capitalism has created the highest standard of living ever known on earth. Theevidence is incontrovertible. The contrast between West and East Berlin is thelatest demonstration, like a laboratory experiment for all to see. Yet those whoare loudest in proclaiming their desire to eliminate poverty are loudest indenouncing capitalism. Man’s well-being is not their goal.The “under-developed” nations are an alleged problem to the world. Most of themare destitute. Some, like Brazil, loot (or nationalize) the property of foreigninvestors; others, like the Congo, slaughter foreigners, including women andchildren; after which, all of them scream for foreign help, for technicians andmoney. It is only the indecency of altruistic doctrines that permits them tohope to get away with it.If those nations were taught to establish capitalism, with full protection ofproperty rights, their problems would vanish. Men who could afford it wouldinvest private capital in the development of natural resources, expecting toearn profits. They would bring the technicians, the funds, the civilizinginfluence, and the employment which those nations need. Everyone would profit,at no one’s expense or sacrifice.But this would be “selfish” and, therefore, evil—according to the altruists’code. Instead, they prefer to seize men’s earnings—through taxation—and pourthem down any foreign drain, and watch our own economic growth slow down year byyear.Next time you refuse yourself some necessity you can’t afford or some smallluxury which would have made the difference between pleasure and drudgery—askyourself what part of your money has gone to pay for a crumbling road inCambodia or for the support of those “selfless” little altruists of the PeaceCorps, who play the role of big shots in the jungle, at taxpayers’ expense.If you wish to stop it, you must begin by realizing that altruism is not adoctrine of love, but of hatred for man.Collectivism does not preach sacrifice as a temporary means to some desirableend. Sacrifice is its end—sacrifice as a way of life. It is man’s independence,success, prosperity, and happiness that collectivists wish to destroy.Observe the snarling, hysterical hatred with which they greet any suggestionthat sacrifice is not necessary, that a non-sacrificial society is possible tomen, that it is the only society able to achieve man’s well-being.If capitalism had never existed, any honest humanitarian should have beenstruggling to invent it. But when you see men struggling to evade its existence,to misrepresent its nature, and to destroy its last remnants—you may be surethat whatever their motives, love for man is not one of them.BLIND CHAOSThere is an important political lesson to be learned from the current events inAlgeria.President Kennedy has been waging an ideological war against ideology. He hasbeen stating repeatedly that political philosophy is useless and that“sophistication” consists of acting on the expediency of the moment.On July 31, he declared to a group of Brazilian students that there are no rulesor principles governing “the means of providing progress” and that any politicalsystem is as good as any other, including socialism, as long as it represents “afree choice” of the people.On August 31, just one month later, history—like a well-constructed play—gavehim an eloquent answer. The people of Algiers marched through the streets of thecity, in desperate protest against the new threat of civil war, shouting: “Wewant peace! We want a government!”How are they to go about getting it?Through the years of civil war, they had been united, not by any politicalphilosophy, but only by a racial issue. They were fighting, not for any program,but only against French rule. When they won their independence, they fellapart—into rival tribes and armed “willayas” fighting one another.The New York Times (September 2, 1962) described it as “a bitter scramble forpower among the men who were expected to lead the country.” But to leadit—where? In the absence of political principles, the issue of government is anissue of seizing power and ruling by brute force.The people of Algeria and their various tribal chieftains, who represent themajority that fought the war against France, are being taken over by awell-organized minority that did not appear on the scene until after thevictory. That minority is led by Ben Bella and was armed by Soviet Russia.A majority without an ideology is a helpless mob, to be taken over by anyone.Now consider the meaning of Mr. Kennedy’s advice to the Brazilians and to theworld. It was not the political philosophy of the United States that he wasenunciating, but the principle of unlimited majority rule—the doctrine that themajority may choose anything it wishes, that anything done by the majority isright and practical, because its will is omnipotent.This means that the majority may vote away the rights of a minority—and disposeof an individual’s life, liberty, and property, until such time, if ever, as heis able to gather his own majority gang. This, somehow, will guarantee politicalfreedom.But wishing won’t make it so—neither for an individual nor for a nation.Political freedom requires much more than the people’s wish. It requires anenormously complex knowledge of political theory and of how to implement it inpractice.It took centuries of intellectual, philosophical development to achievepolitical freedom. It was a long struggle, stretching from Aristotle to JohnLocke to the Founding Fathers. The system they established was not based onunlimited majority rule, but on its opposite: on individual rights, which werenot to be alienated by majority vote or minority plotting. The individual wasnot left at the mercy of his neighbors or his leaders: the Constitutional systemof checks and balances was scientifically devised to protect him from both.This was the great American achievement—and if concern for the actual welfare ofother nations were our present leaders’ motive, this is what we should have beenteaching the world.Instead, we are deluding the ignorant and the semi-savage by telling them thatno political knowledge is necessary—that our system is only a matter ofsubjective preference—that any prehistorical form of tribal tyranny, gang rule,and slaughter will do just as well, with our sanction and support.It is thus that we encourage the spectacle of Algerian workers marching throughthe streets and shouting the demand: “Work, not blood!”—without knowing whatgreat knowledge and virtue are required to achieve it.In the same way, in 1917, the Russian peasants were demanding: “Land andFreedom!” But Lenin and Stalin is what they got.In 1933, the Germans were demanding: “Room to live!” But what they got wasHitler.In 1793, the French were shouting: “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!” What theygot was Napoleon.In 1776, the Americans were proclaiming “The Rights of Man”—and, led bypolitical philosophers, they achieved it.No revolution, no matter how justified, and no movement, no matter how popular,has ever succeeded without a political philosophy to guide it, to set itsdirection and goal.The United States—history’s magnificent example of a country created bypolitical theorists—has abandoned its own philosophy and is falling apart. As anation, we are splintering into warring tribes which—only by the fading momentumof a civilized tradition—are called “economic pressure groups,” at present. Asopposition to our growing statism, we have nothing but the futile “willayas” ofthe so-called “conservatives,” who are fighting, not for any politicalprinciples, but only against the “liberals.”Embittered by Algeria’s collapse into chaos, one of her leaders remarked: “Weused to laugh at the Congolese; now it goes for us.”And it goes for us, as well."},{"pageContent":"13. LET US ALONE!by Ayn Rand Since “economic growth” is today’s great problem, and our present Administrationis promising to “stimulate” it—to achieve general prosperity by ever widergovernment controls, while spending an unproduced wealth—I wonder how manypeople know the origin of the term laissez-faire?France, in the seventeenth century, was an absolute monarchy. Her system hasbeen described as “absolutism limited by chaos.” The king held total power overeveryone’s life, work, and property—and only the corruption of governmentofficials gave people an unofficial margin of freedom.Louis XIV was an archetypical despot: a pretentious mediocrity with grandioseambitions. His reign is regarded as one of the brilliant periods of Frenchhistory: he provided the country with a “national goal,” in the form of long andsuccessful wars; he established France as the leading power and the culturalcenter of Europe. But “national goals” cost money. The fiscal policies of hisgovernment led to a chronic state of crisis, solved by the immemorial expedientof draining the country through ever-increasing taxation.Based on a column in the Los Angeles Times, August 1962.Colbert, chief adviser of Louis XIV, was one of the early modern statists. Hebelieved that government regulations can create national prosperity and thathigher tax revenues can be obtained only from the country’s “economic growth”;so he devoted himself to seeking “a general increase in wealth by theencouragement of industry.” The encouragement consisted of imposing countlessgovernment controls and minute regulations that choked business activity; theresult was dismal failure.Colbert was not an enemy of business; no more than is our presentAdministration. Colbert was eager to help fatten the sacrificial victims—and onone historic occasion, he asked a group of manufacturers what he could do forindustry. A manufacturer named Legendre answered: “Laissez-nous faire!” (“Let usalone!”)Apparently, the French businessmen of the seventeenth century had more couragethan their American counterparts of the twentieth, and a better understanding ofeconomics. They knew that government “help” to business is just as disastrous asgovernment persecution, and that the only way a government can be of service tonational prosperity is by keeping its hands off.To say that that which was true in the seventeenth century cannot possibly betrue today, because we travel in jet planes while they traveled in horsecarts—is like saying that we do not need food, as men did in the past, becausewe are wearing trenchcoats and slacks, instead of powdered wigs and hoop skirts.It is that sort of concrete-bound superficiality—or inability to graspprinciples, to distinguish the essential from the non-essential—that blindspeople to the fact that the economic crisis of our day is the oldest and stalestone in history.Consider the essentials. If government controls could achieve nothing butparalysis, starvation, and collapse in a pre-industrial age, what happens whenone imposes controls on a highly industrialized economy? Which is easier forbureaucrats to regulate: the operation of hand looms and hand forges—or theoperation of steel mills, aircraft plants, and electronics concerns? Who is morelikely to work under coercion: a horde of brutalized men doing unskilled manuallabor—or the incalculable number of individual men of creative genius requiredto build and to maintain an industrial civilization? And if government controlsfail even with the first, what depth of evasion permits modern statists to hopethat they can succeed with the second?The statists’ epistemological method consists of endless debates about single,concrete, out-of-context, range-of-the-moment issues, never allowing them to beintegrated into a sum, never referring to basic principles or ultimateconsequences—and thus inducing a state of intellectual disintegration in theirfollowers. The purpose of that verbal fog is to conceal the evasion of twofundamentals: (a) that production and prosperity are the product of men’sintelligence, and (b) that government power is the power of coercion by physicalforce.Once these two facts are acknowledged, the conclusion to be drawn is inevitable:that intelligence does not work under coercion, that man’s mind will notfunction at the point of a gun.This is the essential issue to consider; all other considerations are trivialdetails by comparison.The details of a country’s economy are as varied as the many cultures andsocieties that have existed. But all of mankind’s history is the practicaldemonstration of the same basic principle, no matter what the variants of form:the degree of human prosperity, achievement, and progress is a direct functionand corollary of the degree of political freedom. As witness: ancient Greece,the Renaissance, the nineteenth century.In our own age, the difference between West Germany and East Germany is soeloquent a demonstration of the efficacy of a (comparatively) free economyversus a controlled economy that no further discussion is necessary. And notheorist can deserve serious consideration if he evades the existence of thatcontrast, leaving its implications unanswered, its causes unidentified, and itslesson unlearned.Now consider the fate of England, “the peaceful experiment in socialism,” theexample of a country that committed suicide by vote: there was no violence, nobloodshed, no terror, merely the throttling process of “democratically” imposedgovernment controls—but observe the present cries about England’s “brain drain,”about the fact that the best and ablest men, particularly the scientists andengineers, are deserting England and running to whatever small remnant offreedom they can find anywhere in today’s world.Remember that the Berlin wall was erected to stop a similar “brain drain” fromEast Germany; remember that after forty-five years of a totally controlledeconomy, Soviet Russia, who possesses some of the best agricultural land in theworld, is unable to feed her population and has to import wheat fromsemi-capitalist America; read East Minus West = Zero by Werner Keller, 51[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-51] for a graphic (and unrefuted)picture of the Soviet economy’s impotence—and then, judge the issue of freedomversus controls.Regardless of the purpose for which one intends to use it, wealth must first beproduced. As far as economics is concerned, there is no difference between themotives of Colbert and of President Johnson. Both wanted to achieve nationalprosperity. Whether the wealth extorted by taxation is drained for the unearnedbenefit of Louis XIV or for the unearned benefit of the “underprivileged” makesno difference to the economic productivity of a nation. Whether one is chainedfor a “noble” purpose or an ignoble one, for the benefit of the poor or therich, for the sake of somebody’s “need” or somebody’s “greed”—when one ischained, one cannot produce.There is no difference in the ultimate fate of all chained economies, regardlessof any alleged justifications for the chains.Consider some of these justifications:The creation of “consumer demand”? It would be interesting to compute how manyhousewives with relief checks would equal the “consumer demands” provided byMadame de Maintenon and her numerous colleagues.A “fair” distribution of wealth? The privileged favorites of Louis XIV did notenjoy so unfair an advantage over other people as do our “aristocrats of pull,”the actual and potential variants of Billie Sol Estes or Bobby Baker.The requirements of the “national interest”? If there is such a thing as a“national interest,” achieved by sacrificing the rights and the interests ofindividuals, then Louis XIV acquitted himself superlatively. The greater part ofhis extravagance was not “selfish”: he did build France up into a majorinternational power—and wrecked her economy. (Which means: he achieved“prestige” among other totalitarian rulers—at the price of the welfare, thefuture, and the lives of his own subjects.)The furtherance of our “cultural” or “spiritual” progress? It is doubtful that agovernment-subsidized theater project will ever produce an array of geniuscomparable to that supported by the court of Louis XIV in his role of “patron ofthe arts” (Corneille, Racine, Molière, etc.). But no one will ever compute thestill-born genius of those who perish under systems of that kind, unwilling tolearn the art of bootlicking required by any political patron of the arts. (ReadCyrano de Bergerac.)The fact is that motives do not alter facts. The paramount requirement of anation’s productivity and prosperity is freedom; men cannot—and, morally, willnot—produce under compulsion and controls.There is nothing new or mysterious about today’s economic problems. LikeColbert, President Johnson is appealing to various economic groups, seekingadvice on what he can do for them. And if he does not wish to go down in historywith a record similar to Colbert’s, he would do well to heed the voice of amodern Legendre, if such exists, who could give him the same immortal advice ina single word: “De-control!”"},{"pageContent":"Current State"},{"pageContent":"14. THE ANATOMY OF COMPROMISEby Ayn Rand A major symptom of a man’s—or a culture’s—intellectual and moral disintegrationis the shrinking of vision and goals to the concrete-bound range of theimmediate moment. This means: the progressive disappearance of abstractions froma man’s mental processes or from a society’s concerns. The manifestation of adisintegrating consciousness is the inability to think and act in terms ofprinciples.A principle is “a fundamental, primary, or general truth, on which other truthsdepend.” Thus a principle is an abstraction which subsumes a great number ofconcretes. It is only by means of principles that one can set one’s long-rangegoals and evaluate the concrete alternatives of any given moment. It is onlyprinciples that enable a man to plan his future and to achieve it.The Objectivist Newsletter, January 1964.The present state of our culture may be gauged by the extent to which principleshave vanished from public discussion, reducing our cultural atmosphere to thesor-did, petty senselessness of a bickering family that haggles over trivialconcretes, while betraying all its major values, selling out its future for somespurious advantage of the moment.To make it more grotesque, that haggling is accompanied by an aura of hystericalself-righteousness, in the form of belligerent assertions that one mustcompromise with anybody on anything (except on the tenet that one mustcompromise) and by panicky appeals to “practicality.”But there is nothing as impractical as a so-called “practical” man. His view ofpracticality can best be illustrated as follows: if you want to drive from NewYork to Los Angeles, it is “impractical” and “idealistic” to consult a map andto select the best way to get there; you will get there much faster if you juststart out driving at random, turning (or cutting) any corner, taking any road inany direction, following nothing but the mood and the weather of the moment.The fact is, of course, that by this method you will never get there at all. Butwhile most people do recognize this fact in regard to the course of a journey,they are not so perceptive in regard to the course of their life and of theircountry.There is only one science that could produce blindness on so large a scale, thescience whose job it was to provide men with sight: philosophy. Since modernphilosophy, in essence, is a concerted attack against the conceptual level ofman’s consciousness—a sustained attempt to invalidate reason, abstractions,generalizations, and any integration of knowledge—men have been emerging fromuniversities, for many decades past, with the helplessness of epistemologicalsavages, with no inkling of the nature, function, or practical application ofprinciples. These men have been groping blindly for some direction through thebewildering mass of (to them) incomprehensible concretes in the daily life of acomplex industrial civilization—groping, struggling, failing, giving up, andperishing, unable to know in what manner they had acted as their own destroyers.It is, therefore, important—for those who do not care to continue that suicidalprocess—to consider a few rules about the working of principles in practice andabout the relationship of principles to goals.The three rules listed below are by no means exhaustive; they are merely thefirst leads to the understanding of a vast subject.1. In any conflict between two men (or two groups) who hold the same basicprinciples, it is the more consistent one who wins.2. In any collaboration between two men (or two groups) who hold different basicprinciples, it is the more evil or irrational one who wins.3. When opposite basic principles are clearly and openly defined, it works tothe advantage of the rational side; when they are not clearly defined, but arehidden or evaded, it works to the advantage of the irrational side.1. When two men (or groups) hold the same basic principles, yet oppose eachother on a given issue, it means that at least one of them is inconsistent.Since basic principles determine the ultimate goal of any long-range process ofaction, the person who holds a clearer, more consistent view of the end to beachieved will be more consistently right in his choice of means; and thecontradictions of his opponent will work to his advantage, psychologically andexistentially.Psychologically, the inconsistent person will endorse and propagate the sameideas as his adversary, but in a weaker, diluted form—and thus will sanction,assist, and hasten his adversary’s victory, creating in the minds of theirdisputed following the impression of his adversary’s greater honesty andcourage, while discrediting himself by an aura of evasion and cowardice.Existentially, every step or measure taken to achieve their common goal willnecessitate further and more crucial steps or measures in the same direction(unless the goal is rejected and the basic principles reversed)—thusstrengthening the leadership of the consistent person and reducing theinconsistent one to impotence.The conflict will follow that course regardless of whether the basic principlesshared by the two adversaries are right or wrong, true or false, rational orirrational.For instance, consider the conflict between the Republicans and the Democrats(and, within each party, the same conflict between the “conservatives” and the“liberals”). Since both parties hold altruism as their basic moral principle,both advocate a welfare state or mixed economy as their ultimate goal. Everygovernment control imposed on the economy (regardless in whose favor)necessitates the imposition of further controls, to alleviate—momentarily—thedisasters caused by the first control. Since the Democrats are more consistentlycommitted to the growth of government power, the Republicans are reduced tohelpless “me-too’ing,” to inept plagiarism of any program initiated by theDemocrats, and to the disgraceful confession implied in their claim that theyseek to achieve “the same ends” as the Democrats, but by different means.It is precisely those ends (altruism-collectivism-statism) that ought to berejected. But if neither party chooses to do it, the logic of the events createdby their common basic principles will keep dragging them both further andfurther to the left. If and when the “conservatives” are kicked out of the gamealtogether, the same conflict will continue between the “liberals” and theavowed socialists; when the socialists win, the conflict will continue betweenthe socialists and the communists; when the communists win, the ultimate goal ofaltruism will be achieved: universal immolation.There is no way to stop or change that process except at the root: by a changeof basic principles.The evidence of that process is mounting in every country on earth. And,observing it, the unthinking begin to whisper about some mysterious occult powercalled a “historical necessity” which, in some unspecified way, by someunknowable means, has preordained mankind to collapse into the abyss ofcommunism. But there are no fatalistic “historical necessities”: the“mysterious” power moving the events of the world is the awesome power of men’sprinciples—which is mysterious only to the “practical” modern savages who weretaught to discard it as “impotent.”But—it might be argued—since the advocates of a mixed economy are alsoadvocating freedom, at least in part, why does the irrational part of theirmixture have to win? This leads us to the fact that—2. In any collaboration between two men (or groups) who hold different basicprinciples, it is the more evil or irrational one who wins.The rational (principle, premise, idea, policy, or action) is that which isconsonant with the facts of reality; the irrational is that which contradictsthe facts and attempts to get away with it. A collaboration is a jointundertaking, a common course of action. The rational (the good) has nothing togain from the irrational (the evil), except a share of its failures and crimes;the irrational has everything to gain from the rational: a share of itsachievements and values. An industrialist does not need the help of a burglar inorder to succeed; a burglar needs the industrialist’s achievement in order toexist at all. What collaboration is possible between them and to what end?If an individual holds mixed premises, his vices undercut, hamper, defeat, andultimately destroy his virtues. What is the moral status of an honest man whosteals once in a while? In the same way, if a group of men pursues mixed goals,its bad principles drive out the good. What is the political status of a freecountry whose government violates the citizens’ rights once in a while?Consider the case of a business partnership: if one partner is honest and theother is a swindler, the latter contributes nothing to the success of thebusiness; but the reputation of the former disarms the victims and provides theswindler with a wide-scale opportunity which he could not have obtained on hisown.Now consider the collaboration of the semi-free countries with the communistdictatorships, in the United Nations. To identify that institution is to damnit, so that any criticism is superfluous. It is an institution allegedlydedicated to peace, freedom, and human rights, which includes Soviet Russia—themost brutal aggressor, the bloodiest dictatorship, the largest-scalemass-murderer and mass-enslaver in all history—among its charter members.Nothing can be added to that fact and nothing can mitigate it. It is sogrotesquely evil an affront to reason, morality, and civilization that nofurther discussion is necessary, except for a glance at the consequences.Psychologically, the U.N. has contributed a great deal to the gray swamp ofdemoralization—of cynicism, bitterness, hopelessness, fear and namelessguilt—which is swallowing the Western world. But the communist world has gaineda moral sanction, a stamp of civilized respectability from the Western world—ithas gained the West’s assistance in deceiving its victims—it has gained thestatus and prestige of an equal partner, thus establishing the notion that thedifference between human rights and mass slaughter is merely a difference ofpolitical opinion.The declared goal of the communist countries is the conquest of the world. Whatthey stand to gain from a collaboration with the (relatively) free countries isthe latter’s material, financial, scientific, and intellectual resources; thefree countries have nothing to gain from the communist countries. Therefore, theonly form of common policy or compromise possible between two such parties isthe policy of property owners who make piecemeal concessions to an armed thug inexchange for his promise not to rob them.The U.N. has delivered a larger part of the globe’s surface and population intothe power of Soviet Russia than Russia could ever hope to conquer by armedforce. The treatment accorded to Katanga versus the treatment accorded toHungary is a sufficient example of U.N. policies. An institution allegedlyformed for the purpose of using the united might of the world to stop anaggressor has become the means of using the united might of the world to forcethe surrender of one helpless country after another into the aggressor’s power.Who, but a concrete-bound epistemological savage, could have expected any otherresults from such an “experiment in collaboration”? What would you expect from acrime-fighting committee whose board of directors included the leading gangstersof the community?Only a total evasion of basic principles could make this possible. And thisillustrates the reason why—3. When opposite basic principles are clearly and openly defined, it works tothe advantage of the rational side; when they are not clearly defined, but arehidden or evaded, it works to the advantage of the irrational side.In order to win, the rational side of any controversy requires that its goals beunderstood; it has nothing to hide, since reality is its ally. The irrationalside has to deceive, to confuse, to evade, to hide its goals. Fog, murk, andblindness are not the tools of reason; they are the only tools of irrationality.No thought, knowledge, or consistency is required in order to destroy;unremitting thought, enormous knowledge, and a ruthless consistency are requiredin order to achieve or create. Every error, evasion, or contradiction helps thegoal of destruction; only reason and logic can advance the goal of construction.The negative requires an absence (ignorance, impotence, irrationality); thepositive requires a presence, an existent (knowledge, efficacy, thought).The spread of evil is the symptom of a vacuum. Whenever evil wins, it is only bydefault: by the moral failure of those who evade the fact that there can be nocompromise on basic principles.“In any compromise between food and poison, it is only death that can win. Inany compromise between good and evil, it is only evil that can profit.” (AtlasShrugged)"},{"pageContent":"15. IS ATLAS SHRUGGING?by Ayn Rand As the title of this discussion indicates, its theme is: the relationship of theevents presented in my novel Atlas Shrugged to the actual events of today’sworld.Or, to put the question in a form which has often been addressed to me: “IsAtlas Shrugged a prophetic novel—or a historical one?”The second part of the question seems to answer the first: if some peoplebelieve that Atlas Shrugged is a historical novel, this means that it was asuccessful prophecy.The truth of the matter can best be expressed as follows: although the politicalaspects of Atlas Shrugged are not its central theme nor its main purpose, myattitude toward these aspects—during the years of writing the novel—wascontained in a brief rule I had set for myself: “The purpose of this book is toprevent itself from becoming prophetic.”The book was published in 1957. Since then, I have received many letters andheard many comments which amounted, in essence, to the following: “When I firstread Atlas Shrugged, I thought that you were exaggerating, but then I realizedsuddenly—while reading the newspapers—that the things going on in the worldtoday are exactly like the things in your book.”Lecture given at The Ford Hall Forum, Boston, on April 19, 1964. Published inThe Objectivist Newsletter, August 1964.And so they are. Only more so.The present state of the world, the political events, proposals, and ideas oftoday are so grotesquely irrational that neither I nor any other novelist couldever put them into fiction: no one would believe them. A novelist could not getaway with it; only a politician might imagine that he can.The political aspects of Atlas Shrugged are not its theme, but one of theconsequences of its theme. The theme is: the role of the mind in man’s existenceand, as a corollary, the presentation of a new code of ethics—the morality ofrational self-interest.The story of Atlas Shrugged shows what happens to the world when the men of themind—the originators and innovators in every line of rational endeavor—go onstrike and vanish, in protest against an altruist-collectivist society.There are two key passages in Atlas Shrugged that give a brief summary of itsmeaning. The first is a statement of John Galt:There is only one kind of men who have never been on strike in human history.Every other kind and class have stopped, when they so wished, and have presenteddemands to the world, claiming to be indispensable—except the men who havecarried the world on their shoulders, have kept it alive, have endured tortureas sole payment, but have never walked out on the human race. Well, their turnhas come. Let the world discover who they are, what they do and what happenswhen they refuse to function. This is the strike of the men of the mind, MissTaggart. This is the mind on strike.The second passage—which explains the title of the novel—is:“Mr. Rearden,” said Francisco, his voice solemnly calm, “if you saw Atlas, thegiant who holds the world on his shoulders, if you saw that he stood, bloodrunning down his chest, his knees buckling, his arms trembling but still tryingto hold the world aloft with the last of his strength, and the greater hiseffort the heavier the world bore down upon his shoulders—what would you tellhim to do?”“I . . . don’t know. What . . . could he do? What would you tell him?”“To shrug.”The story of Atlas Shrugged presents the conflict of two fundamentalantagonists, two opposite schools of philosophy, or two opposite attitudestoward life. As a brief means of identification, I shall call them the“reasonindividualism-capitalism axis” versus the “mysticismaltruism-collectivismaxis.” The story demonstrates that the basic conflict of our age is not merelypolitical or economic, but moral and philosophical—that the dominant philosophyof our age is a virulent revolt against reason—that the so-called redistributionof wealth is only a superficial manifestation of themysticism-altruism-collectivism axis—that the real nature and deepest, ultimatemeaning of that axis is anti-man, anti-mind, anti-life.Do you think that I was exaggerating?During—and after—the writing of Atlas Shrugged, I kept a file which, formally,should be called a “Research or Documentation File.” For myself, I called it“The Horror File.” Let me give you a few samples from it.Here is an example of modern ideology—from an Alumni-Faculty Seminar, entitled“The Distrust of Reason,” at Wesleyan University, in June 1959.Perhaps in the future reason will cease to be important. Perhaps for guidance intime of trouble, people will turn not to human thought, but to the humancapacity for suffering. Not the universities with their thinkers, but the placesand people in distress, the inmates of asylums and concentration camps, thehelpless decision-makers in bureaucracy and the helpless soldiers infoxholes—these will be the ones to lighten man’s way, to refashion his knowledgeof disaster into something creative. We may be entering a new age. Our heroesmay not be intellectual giants like Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein, but victimslike Anne Frank, who will show us a greater miracle than thought. They willteach us how to endure—how to create good in the midst of evil and how tonurture love in the presence of death. Should this happen, however, theuniversity will still have its place. Even the intellectual man can be anexample of creative suffering.Do you think that this is a rare exception, a weird extreme? On January 4, 1963,Time published the following news story:“Ultimate performance in society”—not just brains and grades—should be theadmissions criterion of top colleges, says Headmaster Leslie R. Severinghaus ofthe Haverford School near Philadelphia. In the Journal of the Association ofCollege Admissions Counselors, he warns against the “highly intelligent,aggressive, personally ambitious, and socially indifferent and unconcernedegotist.” Because these self-centered bright students have “little to offer,either now or later,” colleges should be ready to welcome other good qualities.“Who says that brains and motivated performance represent the dimensions ofexcellence? Is not social concern a facet of excellence? Is it not exciting tofind a candidate who believes that ‘no man liveth unto himself?’ What aboutleadership? Integrity? The ability to communicate both ideas and friendship? Maywe discount spiritual eagerness? And why should we pass over cooperation withothers in good causes, even at some sacrifice of one’s own scholasticachievement? What about graciousness and decency?” None of this shows up oncollege board scores, chides Severinghaus. “Colleges must themselves believe inthe potential of young people of this sort.”Consider the meaning of this. If your husband, wife, or child were stricken witha deadly disease, of what use would the doctor’s “social concern” or“graciousness” be to you, if that doctor had sacrificed his “own scholasticachievement”? If our country is threatened with nuclear destruction, will ourlives depend on the intelligence and ambition of our scientists, or on their“spiritual eagerness” and “capacity to communicate friendship”?I would not put a passage of that kind into the mouth of a character in the mostexaggerated farce-satire—I would consider it too absurdly grotesque—and yet,this is said, heard, and discussed seriously in an allegedly civilized society.Are you inclined to believe that theories of this kind will have no results inpractice? I quote from the Rochester Times Union, of February 18, 1960, from anarticle entitled “Is Our Talent Running Out?”Is this mighty nation running short of talent?At this point in history, with Russia and the United States “in deadlycompetition,” could this nation fall behind because of a lack of brainpower?Dr. Harry Lionel Shapiro, chairman of the department of anthropology at theAmerican Museum of Natural History in New York City, says, “There is a growinguneasiness, not yet fully expressed . . . that the supply of competence isrunning short.”The medical profession, he says, is “profoundly worried” about the matter.Studies have shown that today’s medical students, on the basis of grades, areinferior to those of a decade ago.Some spokesmen for the profession have been inclined to blame this on thedramatic and financial appeal of other professions in this space age—engineeringand other technological fields.But, Dr. Shapiro says, “This seems to be a universal complaint.”The anthropologist spoke before a group of science writers at Ardsley-on-Hudson.This same group listened to some 25 scientists over a 2-week period—and heardthe same lament from engineers, physicists, a meteorologist and many others.These scientists, outstanding spokesmen for their fields, found this subject offar greater importance than the need for more money.Dr. William O. Baker, vice president in charge of research at Bell TelephoneLaboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., one of the top scientists in the country,said more research is needed—but that it will come not as a result of moremoney.“It all depends on ideas,” he said, “not very many, but they have to be newideas.”Dr. Baker argued that the National Institute of Health has continually increasedits grants but the results of the work have remained on a level, “if they arenot on the downgrade.”Eugene Kone, public relations director of the American Physical Society, saidthat in physics, “We are not getting anywhere near enough first-class people.”Dr. Sidney Ingram, vice president of the Engineering Manpower Commission, saidthe situation “is absolutely unique in the history of Western Civilization.”This news story was not given any prominence in our press. It reflects the firstsymptoms of anxiety over a situation which may still be hidden from the generalpublic. But the same situation in Great Britain has become so obvious that itcannot be hidden any longer, and it is being discussed in terms of headlines.The British have coined a name for it: they call it “the brain drain.”Let me remind you, parenthetically, that in Atlas Shrugged, John Galt states,referring to the strike: “I have done by plan and intention what had been donethroughout history by silent default.” And he lists the various ways in whichexceptional men had perished, in which intelligence had gone on strike againsttyranny psychologically, deserting any mystic-altruist-collectivist society. Youmay also remember Dagny’s description of Galt before she meets him, which helater repeats to her: “The man who’s draining the brains of the world.”No, I do not mean to imply that the British have plagiarized my words. What ismuch more significant is that they haven’t; most of them, undoubtedly, havenever read Atlas Shrugged. What is significant is that they are facing—andgroping to identify—the same phenomenon.I quote from a news story in The New York Times of February 11, 1964:The Labor party is calling for a Government study of the emigration of Britishscientists to the United States, a problem known here as the “brain drain.”Labor’s action . . . followed the disclosure that Prof. Ian Bush and hisresearch team are leaving Birmingham University for the Worcester Foundation forExperimental Biology in Shrewsbury, Mass.Professor Bush, who is 35 years old, heads the department of physiology atBirmingham. His team of nine scientists has been investigating the treatment ofmental diseases with drugs.Tonight it was learned that a leading physicist, Prof. Maurice Pryce, and a topcancer research pathologist, Dr. Leonard Weiss, would take posts in the UnitedStates. . . .Tom Dalyell, a Labor spokesman on science, will ask if the Prime Minister, SirAlec Douglas-Home, will appoint a royal commission “to consider the wholeproblem of the training, recruitment, and retention of scientific manpower forservice in Britain”. . . .Professor Bush’s decision was termed “tragic” by Sir George Pickering, presidentof the British Medical Association. He described the professor as the “mostbrilliant pupil I ever had and one of the most brilliant people I have evermet.” From The New York Times of February 12: The furor over Britain’s loss of scientific talent was intensified today when aforemost theoretical physicist said he was leaving for the United States.Dr. John Anthony Pople, superintendent of the Basic Physics Division at theNational Physical Laboratory, said he was going to the Carnegie Institute ofTechnology in Pittsburgh in about a month.Afternoon newspapers used large headlines to report the move, the 13th since theweekend. One paper’s front-page headline read: “Another One Down the BrainDrain.”From The New York Times of February 13: With the announcement today of the impending departure of at least five morescientists from Britain, the nation began searching with new anxiety for rootcauses of the exodus.The story names two of the departing scientists: Dr. Ray Guillery, 34-year-oldassociate professor of anatomy at University College, London, and also fromUniversity College, Dr. Eric Shooter, 39, an assistant professor ofbiochemistry.From The New York Times of February 16:With Britain in a furor over the steady departure of her scientists, the nationis again searching for the causes of the exodus and demanding remedies. . . .The “brain drain,” as the departure of scientists is called here, is not new toBritain. For decades, foreign universities and other institutions of learningand research, especially in the United States, have been drawing scientifictalent from Britain.In the last academic year Britain lost 160 senior university teachers, about 60of them to the United States, according to a survey published by the Associationof University Teachers. . . .British scientists with newly acquired Ph.D.’s have been leaving the countrypermanently at a rate of at least 140 a year, according to a report last year bythe Royal Society. This would be about 12 per cent of the nation’s output. . . .Most commonly, the scientists who depart permanently explain that fundsavailable for research equipment and staff in the United States cannot bematched at home.Some say frankly that they are attracted by salaries two or three times higherthan they get in Britain and also by what they consider a greater general regardin the United States for scientific effort and achievement.Others complain about the shortage of senior posts in universities, about theadministrative jungle through which research grants must pass in Britain andabout what they term the mean, controlling hand of the Treasury in alluniversity grants.What intellectual arguments are being offered to the scientists as an inducementto prevent them from leaving, and what practical remedies are being proposed?Quintin Hogg, Secretary of State for Education and Science, “appealed to thepatriotism of scientists to stay at home. ‘It is better to be British thananything else,’ he said.” An earlier story (The New York Times, October 31,1963) stated that a “report, submitted by a committee headed by Sir Burke Trend,Secretary of the Cabinet, calls for reshaping Britain’s civil science set-up andfor giving increased powers to the Minister of Science.” [Italics mine.]There is, of course, a great deal of implicit and explicit indignation againstAmerican wealth and big business, which the British seem to regard as chiefly toblame for the flight of their scientific talent.Now I want to call your attention to two significant facts: the age and theprofessions of the scientists who were mentioned by name in these stories. Mostof them are in their thirties; most of them are connected with theoreticalmedicine.Socialized medicine is an established institution of Britain’s political system.What future would brilliant young men be able to achieve under socializedmedicine? Draw your own conclusions about the causes of the “brain drain”—aboutthe future welfare of those left behind in the welfare state—and about the roleof the mind in man’s existence.The next time you hear or read reports about the success of socialized medicinein Great Britain and in the other welfare states of Europe—the reports broughtby the superficial, concrete-bound mentalities who cannot see beyond the rangeof the moment and who declare that they observe no change in the conscientiousefficiency of the family doctors—remember that the source of the family doctors’efficiency, knowledge, and power lies in the laboratories of theoreticalmedicine, and that that source is drying up. This is the real price which acountry pays for socialized medicine—a price which does not appear on the costsheets of the state planners, but which will not take long to appear in reality.At present, we lag behind Great Britain on the road to the collectivistabyss—but not very far behind. In recent years, our newspapers have beenmentioning alarming reports on the state of the enrollment in our medicalschools. There was a time when these schools had a much greater number ofapplicants than could be accepted—and only the ablest students, those with thehighest academic grades and records, had a chance to be admitted. Today, thenumber of applicants is falling—and, according to some reports, will soon beless than the number of openings available in our medical schools.Consider the growth of socialized medicine throughout the world—consider theMedicare plan in this country—consider the strike of the Canadian doctors inSaskatchewan, and the recent strike of the doctors in Belgium. Consider the factthat in every instance the overwhelming majority of the doctors fought againstsocialization and that the moral cannibalism of the welfare-statists did nothesitate to force them into slavery at the point of a gun. The picture wasparticularly eloquent in Belgium, with thousands of doctors fleeing blindly,escaping from the country—with the allegedly “humanitarian” government resortingto the crude, Nazi-like, militaristic measure of drafting the doctors into thearmy in order to force them back into practice.Consider it—and then read the statement of Dr. Hendricks in Atlas Shrugged, thesurgeon who went on strike in protest against socialized medicine: “I have oftenwondered at the smugness with which people assert their right to enslave me, tocontrol my work, to force my will, to violate my conscience, to stifle mymind—yet what is it that they expect to depend on, when they lie on an operatingtable under my hands?”That is the question that should be asked of the altruistic slave-drivers ofBelgium.The next time you hear a discussion of Medicare, give some thought to thefuture—particularly to the future of your children, who will live at a time whenthe best brains available will no longer choose to go into medicine.Ragnar Danneskjöld, the pirate in Atlas Shrugged, said that he was fightingagainst “the idea that need is a sacred idol requiring human sacrifices—that theneed of some men is the knife of a guillotine hanging over others and that theextent of our ability is the extent of our danger, so that success will bringour heads down on the block, while failure will give us the right to pull thecord.” This is the essence of the morality of altruism: the greater a man’sachievement and the greater society’s need of him—the more vicious the treatmenthe receives and the closer he comes to the status of a sacrificial animal.Businessmen—who provide us with the means of livelihood, with jobs, withlabor-saving devices, with modern comforts, with an ever-rising standard ofliving—are the men most immediately and urgently needed by society. They havebeen the first victims, the hated, smeared, denounced, exploited scapegoats ofthe mystic-altruist-collectivist axis. Doctors come next; it is preciselybecause their services are so crucially important and so desperately needed thatthe doctors are now the targets of the altruists’ attack, on a world-wide scale.As to the present condition of businessmen, let me mention the following. Aftercompleting Atlas Shrugged, I submitted it, in galley-proofs, to a railroadexpert, for a technical check-up. The first question he asked me, after he hadread it, was: “Do you realize that all the laws and directives you invented areon our statute books already?” “Yes,” I answered, “I realize it.”And that is what I want my readers to realize.In my novel, I presented these issues in terms of abstractions which expressedthe essence of government controls and of statist legislation at any time and inany country. But the principles of every edict and every directive presented inAtlas Shrugged—such as “The Equalization of Opportunity Bill” or “Directive 10-289”—can be found, and in cruder forms, in our antitrust laws.In that accumulation of non-objective, undefinable, unjudicable statutes, youwill find every variant of penalizing ability for being ability, of penalizingsuccess for being success, of sacrificing productive genius to the demands ofenvious mediocrity. You will find such rulings as: the forced break-up of largecompanies or the “divorcement” of companies from their subsidiaries (which is my“Equalization of Opportunity Bill”)—the forcing of established concerns to sharewith any newcomer the facilities it had taken them years to create—thecompulsory licensing or the outright confiscation of patents—and, on top of thislast, the order that the victims teach their own competitors how to use thesepatents.The only thing that stands between us and the level of social disintegrationpresented in Atlas Shrugged is the fact that the statists do not dare as yet toenforce the antitrust laws to the full extent of their power. But the power isthere—and you can observe the accelerating process of its widening applicationyear by year.Now you might think, however, that the “Railroad Unification Plan” and the“Steel Unification Plan,” which I introduced toward the end of Atlas Shrugged,have no counterpart in real life. I thought so, too. I invented them—as adevelopment dictated by the logic of events—to illustrate the last stages of asociety’s collapse. These two plans were typical collectivist devices forhelping the weakest members of an industry at the expense of the strongest, bymeans of forcing them to “pool” their resources. I thought these plans were abit ahead of our time.I was wrong.I quote from a news story of March 17, 1964:The three television networks have been asked by the Federal Government toconsider a tentative plan under which each would turn over a share of itsprograms to existing or new TV stations that might operate from a competitivedisadvantage. . . .A companion suggestion, also put forth for discussion by the [FederalCommunications] Commission, would compel some stations now affiliated with onenetwork to accept affiliation with an alternative chain.The proposals, which in effect call upon the “haves” of the television industryto help the “have nots,” drew strenuous objections over the weekend from theColumbia Broadcasting System. . . .The thinking behind the F.C.C. proposals is to help sustain existing ultra-highfrequency stations and encourage the start of additional such outlets byguaranteeing them program resources that would win audiences. Most advertisersnormally prefer the more powerful very-high frequency stations. . . .Under the controversial proposals, the total pool of network programming wouldbe carved up among two V.H.F. stations and one U.H.F. station.The alleged justification for these proposals is the desire to correct“competitive imbalance.”Now observe today’s situation in the sphere of labor.In Atlas Shrugged, I showed that at a time of desperate shortages oftransportation, due to shortages of motive power, track, and fuel, the railroadsof the country were ordered to run shorter trains at lower speeds. Today, at atime when the railroads are perishing, with most of them on the brink ofbankruptcy, the railroad unions are demanding the preservation of“featherbedding” practices (that is, of useless, unneeded jobs) and ofantiquated work and payment rules.The press comments on this issue were mixed. But one editorial deserves amoment’s special attention: it is from the Star Herald of Camden, New Jersey, ofAugust 16, 1963, and it was sent to me by a fan.The money-makers, the powerful business leaders of America, have failed torealize that prosperity can be inhuman. They have failed to understand thatpeople take precedence over profits. . . .Ambition and the drive for profit is a good thing. It spurs man to higherachievements. But it must be tempered by concern for society and its members. Itmust be slowed down in the light of human needs. . . .These are the thoughts that trouble us when we ponder the railroad stalemate.Crying “featherbed!” like a war whoop, the managers of the railroads haveinsisted on eliminating tens of thousands of jobs . . . jobs that are themainstays of homes . . . jobs that mean the difference between a man’s feelingdignified or futile. . . . Before you vote yes for such painful progress,imagine your husband or brother or father as one of those destined to besacrificed on the altar of progress. Far better, in our view, to have thegovernment nationalize the railroads and prevent another human disaster on theirone-way track of making profit at human expense.This editorial had no byline, but my anonymous admirer had written on it inpenciled block letters: “By Eugene Lawson???”That kind of “humanitarian” attitude is not directed against profits, butagainst achievement; it is not directed against the rich, but against thecompetent. Do you think that the only victims of themystic-altruist-collectivist axis are a few exceptional men on the top of thesocial pyramid, a few men of financial and intellectual genius?Here is an old clipping from my “Horror File,” a news story dating years back:Britain is currently stirred by the story of a young coal miner who has quit hisjob to prevent 2,000 miners from striking at Doncaster.Alan Bulmer, 31, got in trouble with his fellow workers when he finished aweek’s assignment three hours ahead of time. Instead of sitting down for threehours, he started on a new stint of work.More than 2,000 miners held a meeting last Sunday to object to his working toohard. They demanded that he be demoted for three months and his pay cut from $36a week to $25.Bulmer quit his job to end the crisis, with the statement that it always hasbeen his belief that “a man should do a full day’s work for a full day’s pay.”Officials of the government-operated mines say the affair is up to the unions.Ask yourself, what will become of that young man in the future? How long will hepreserve his integrity and his ambition if he knows that they will bring himpunishments, not rewards? Will he continue to exercise his ability if he is tobe demoted for it? This is how a nation loses the best of its men.Do you remember the scene in Atlas Shrugged when Hank Rearden finally decided togo on strike? The last straw, which made the situation clear to him, was JamesTaggart’s statement that he, Rearden, would always find a way to “dosomething”—even in the face of the most irrational and impossible demands.Compare that with the following quotation in a news story of December 28,1959—which is a statement by Michael J. Quill, head of the Transport Workers’Union, commenting on a threatened city transit strike: “A lot of people arethinking we are taking this to the brink. But it so happens that every time wewent to the well before, there was something there.”In the closing chapters of Atlas Shrugged, I described the labor situation ofthe country as follows:“Give us men!” The plea began to hammer progressively louder upon the desk ofthe Unification Board, from all parts of a country ravaged by unemployment, andneither the pleaders nor the Board dared to add the dangerous words which thecry was implying: “Give us men of ability!” There were waiting lines years’ longfor the jobs of janitors, greasers, porters, and bus boys; there was no one toapply for the jobs of executives, managers, superintendents, engineers.An editorial in the July 29, 1963, issue of Barron’s mentions:the mounting scarcity of skilled labor including, as Dr. Arthur F. Burns notedin a recent critique of official unemployment statistics, “extensive shortagesof scientists, teachers, engineers, doctors, nurses, typists, stenographers,automobile and TV mechanics, tailors and domestic servants.”Do you remember the story of the Minnesota harvest disaster in Atlas Shrugged? Abumper crop of wheat perished along the roadsides—around the overfilled silosand grain elevators—for lack of railroad freight cars which, by governmentorder, had been sent to carry a harvest of soybeans.The following news story is from the Chicago Sun Times of November 2, 1962:Illinois farm officials and grain dealers met Thursday in an effort to relievean acute freight car shortage which is threatening the Midwest’s bumper grainharvest. . . .Farmers and grain dealers agreed that the shortage of railroad boxcars hasbecome “critical,” and saw little hope of relief for at least two weeks.Some grain elevator operators showed the group photographs of corn piled on theground near elevators plugged up with corn which can’t be shipped. . . .The boxcar shortage was blamed on the harvesting of three major crops—corn,soybeans and milo—at the same time this year. In addition, there have been heavymovements of government-owned grain.In Atlas Shrugged, Ragnar Danneskjöld denounced Robin Hood as the particularimage of evil that he wanted to destroy in men’s minds. “He is the man whobecame the symbol of the idea that need, not achievement, is the source ofrights, that we don’t have to produce, only to want, that the earned does notbelong to us, but the unearned does.”I shall never know whether Ragnar was or was not the inspiration of an articledenouncing Robin Hood, which appeared last year in a British journal calledJustice of the Peace and Local Government Review, a magazine of law and policeaffairs. The occasion for the article was the revival of the Robin Hoodfestival.Having regard to the fact [said the article] that the exploits of this legendaryhero were chiefly concerned with robbing the rich under the specious motive ofgiving to the poor, a function which, in modern times, has been taken over bythe welfare state, it is a question of some doubt whether a Robin Hood festivalis not contrary to public policy.But now we come to a composition that beats anything presented in AtlasShrugged. I concede that I would have been unable to invent it and that nomatter how low my estimate of the altruist-collectivist mentalities—and it isvery low—I would not have believed this possible. It is not fiction. It is anews story, which appeared, on March 23, 1964, on the front page of The New YorkTimes.Every American should be guaranteed an adequate income as a matter of rightwhether he works or not, a 32-member group calling itself the Ad Hoc Committeeon the Triple Revolution urged today. . . .The three revolutions listed in their statement, which they sent to PresidentJohnson, were “the cybernation revolution,” “the weaponry revolution” and “thehuman rights revolution.”“The fundamental problem posed by the cybernation revolution in the UnitedStates is that it invalidates the general mechanism so far employed to undergirdpeople’s rights as consumers,” the committee said.“Up to this time,” it continued, “economic resources have been distributed onthe basis of contributions to production, with machines and men competing foremployment on somewhat equal terms. In the developing cybernated system,potentially unlimited output can be achieved by systems of machines which willrequire little cooperation from human beings.“The continuance of the income-through-jobs link as the only major mechanism fordistributing effective demand—for granting the right to consume—now acts as themain brake on the almost unlimited capacity of a cybernated productive system.”The Committee urged that the link be broken by “an unqualified commitment” bysociety to provide, through its appropriate legal and governmental institutions,“every individual and every family with an adequate income as a matter ofright.” [All italics mine.]To be provided—by whom? Blank out.One would expect a proclamation of this kind to be issued by a group ofsmall-town crackpots dissociated from reality and from any knowledge ofeconomics. Or one would expect it to be issued by a group of rabblerousers, forthe purpose of inciting the lowest elements of the population to violenceagainst any business office that owns an electronic computer and thus deprivesthem of their “right to consume.”But such was not the case.This proclamation was issued by a group of professors, economists, educators,writers, and other “intellectuals.” What is frightening—as a symptom of thepresent state of our culture—is that it received front-page attention, and thatapparently-civilized people are willing to regard it as within the bounds ofcivilized discussion.What is the cultural atmosphere of our day? See whether the followingdescription fits it. I quote from Atlas Shrugged—from a passage referring to aseries of accelerating disasters and catastrophes:The newspapers did not mention it. The editorials went on speaking ofself-denial as the road to future progress, of self-sacrifice as the moralimperative, of greed as the enemy, of love as the solution—their threadbarephrases as sickeningly sweet as the odor of ether in a hospital.Rumors went spreading through the country in whispers of cynical terror—yetpeople read the newspapers and acted as if they believed what they read, eachcompeting with the others on who would keep most blindly silent, each pretendingthat he did not know what he knew, each striving to believe that the unnamed wasthe unreal. It was as if a volcano were cracking open, yet the people at thefoot of the mountain ignored the sudden fissures, the black fumes, the boilingtrickles, and went on believing that their only danger was to acknowledge thereality of these signs.The purpose of my discussing this today was, not to boast nor to leave you withthe impression that I possess some mystical gift of prophecy, but to demonstratethe exact opposite: that that gift is not mystical. Contrary to the prevalentviews of today’s alleged scholars, history is not an unintelligible chaos ruledby chance and whim—historical trends can be predicted, and changed—men are nothelpless, blind, doomed creatures carried to destruction by incomprehensibleforces beyond their control.There is only one power that determines the course of history, just as itdetermines the course of every individual life: the power of man’s rationalfaculty—the power of ideas. If you know a man’s convictions, you can predict hisactions. If you understand the dominant philosophy of a society, you can predictits course. But convictions and philosophy are matters open to man’s choice.There is no fatalistic, predetermined historical necessity. Atlas Shrugged isnot a prophecy of our unavoidable destruction, but a manifesto of our power toavoid it, if we choose to change our course.It is the philosophy of the mysticism-altruism-collectivism axis that hasbrought us to our present state and is carrying us toward a finale such as thatof the society presented in Atlas Shrugged. It is only the philosophy of thereason-individualism-capitalism axis that can save us and carry us, instead,toward the Atlantis projected in the last two pages of my novel.Since men have free will, no one can predict with certainty the outcome of anideological conflict nor how long such a conflict will last. It is too early totell which choice this country will make. I can say only that if part of thepurpose of Atlas Shrugged was to prevent itself from becoming prophetic, thereare many, many signs to indicate that it is succeeding in that purpose. (Postscript. Over a year after this article was written, there occurred an eventworth noting here.In the last chapter of Atlas Shrugged, which describes the collapse of thecollectivists’ rule, there is the following paragraph:The plane was above the peaks of the skyscrapers when suddenly, with theabruptness of a shudder, as if the ground had parted to engulf it, the citydisappeared from the face of the earth. It took them a moment to realize thatthe panic had reached the power stations—and that the lights of New York hadgone out.On November 9, 1965, the lights of New York and of the entire Eastern seaboardwent out. The situation was not exactly parallel to that in my story, but agreat many readers recognized the symbolic meaning of the event. I quote some ofthe letters and wires I received in the next few days:A wire from Austin, Texas, signed by a number of names: “We thought you said thenovel was not prophetic.”A wire from Marion, Wisconsin: “There is a John Galt.”From a letter from Indianapolis: “But it didn’t even take a panic, did it, MissRand? Just that same old irresponsibility and incompetence. The train wrecks[etc.] have made us chuckle, but this fulfilled prophecy also brings a shudder.”A note from Dundee, Scotland: “I could not help but think of your book AtlasShrugged when we saw on television New York without its lights—there on thescreen the black canyons of the buildings and the low lights of the cars tryingto find a way out.”From Memphis, Tennessee (a postcard sent by his mother to a reader who sent itto me): “I just had to pass this on: Last night in the blackout in the Northeast[a friend] called and asked if you were there. I said no, and she said ‘Well,I’m sorry, I wanted to ask him if Atlas had shrugged!’ ”A note from Chicago: “We waited expectantly for the one rational explanation forthe ‘blackout’ of 11/9/65. ‘This is John Galt Speaking.’ ”)"},{"pageContent":"16. THE PULL PEDDLERSby Ayn Rand America’s foreign policy is so grotesquely irrational that most people believethere must be some sensible purpose behind it. The extent of the irrationalityacts as its own protection: like the technique of the “Big Lie,” it makes peopleassume that so blatant an evil could not possibly be as evil as it appears tothem and, therefore, that somebody must understand its meaning, even though theythemselves do not.The sickening generalities and contradictions cited in justification of theforeign aid program fall roughly into two categories which are offered to ussimultaneously: the “idealistic” and the “practical,” or mush and fear.The “idealistic” arguments consist of appeals to altruism and swim out of focusin a fog of floating abstractions about our duty to support the“under-developed” nations of the entire globe, who are starving and will perishwithout our selfless help.The “practical” arguments consist of appeals to fear and emit a different sortof fog, to the effect that our own selfish interest requires that we go bankruptbuying the favor of the “under-developed” nations, who, otherwise, will become adangerous threat to us.The Objectivist Newsletter, September 1962.It is useless to point out to the advocates of our foreign policy that it’seither-or: either the “under-developed” nations are so weak that they are doomedwithout our help, in which case they cannot become a threat to us—or they are sostrong that with some other assistance they can develop to the point ofendangering us, in which case we should not drain our economic power to help thegrowth of potential enemies who are that powerful.It is useless to discuss the contradiction between these two assertions, becauseneither of them is true. Their proponents are impervious to facts, to logic, andto the mounting evidence that after two decades of global altruism, our foreignpolicy is achieving the exact opposite of its alleged goals; it is wrecking oureconomy—it is reducing us internationally to the position of an impotent failurewho has nothing but a series of compromises, retreats, defeats, and betrayals onhis record—and, instead of bringing progress to the world, it is bringing thebloody chaos of tribal warfare and delivering one helpless nation after anotherinto the power of communism.When a society insists on pursuing a suicidal course, one may be sure that thealleged reasons and proclaimed slogans are mere rationalizations. The questionis only: what is it that these rationalizations are hiding?Observe that there is no consistent pattern in the erratic chaos of our foreignaid. And although in the long run it leads to the benefit of Soviet Russia,Russia is not its direct, immediate beneficiary. There is no consistent winner,only a consistent loser: the United States.In the face of such a spectacle, some people give up the attempt to understand;others imagine that some omnipotent conspiracy is destroying America, that therationalizations are hiding some malevolent, fantastically powerful giant.The truth is worse than that: the truth is that the rationalizations are hidingnothing—that there is nothing at the bottom of the fog but a nest of scurryingcockroaches.I submit in evidence excerpts from an article in the editorial section of TheNew York Times, of July 15, 1962, entitled: “Role of Foreign Lobbies.”A “non-diplomatic corps” of foreign agents [states the article] has bloomed inrecent years [in Washington] . . .Lobbying in Congress to obtain—or prevent—the passage of legislation of interestto their foreign clients, seeking to pressure the Administration into adoptingcertain political or economic policies, or attempting to mold public opinionthrough a myriad of methods and techniques, this legion of special agents hasbecome an elusive shadow for operating in Washington and the width and thelength of the land.“Lobbying” is the activity of attempting to influence legislation by privatelyinfluencing the legislators. It is the result and creation of a mixed economy—ofgovernment by pressure groups. Its methods range from mere social courtesies andcocktail-party or luncheon “friendships” to favors, threats, bribes, blackmail.All lobbyists, whether serving foreign or domestic interests, are required—bylaws passed in the last three decades—to register with the government. Theregistrations have been growing at such a rate—with the foreign lobbyistsoutnumbering the domestic ones—that legislators are beginning to be alarmed. TheSenate Foreign Relations Committee has announced that it is preparing aninvestigation of these foreign agents’ activities.The New York Times article describes foreign lobbying as follows:The theory behind this whole enterprise is that for a fee or a retainer andoften for hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising, publicity and expensemoney, a foreign government or a foreign economic or political interest canpurchase a favorable legislation in the United States Congress, a friendlypolicy of the Administration or a positive image in the eyes of the Americanpublic opinion, leading in turn to profitable political or economic advantage.[Italics mine.]Who are these lobbyists? Men with political pull—with “access” to influentialWashington figures—American men hired by foreign interests. The article mentionsthat most of these men are “Washington lawyers” or “New York public relationsfirms.”Russia is one of these foreign interests and is served by registered lobbyistsin Washington; but she is merely cashing-in on the situation, like the others.The success of her conspiracy in this country is the result, not the cause, ofour self-destruction; she is winning by default. The cause is much deeper thanthat.The issue of lobbies has attracted attention recently through the struggle offoreign lobbyists to obtain sugar quotas from the American government.Their efforts [states the article] were centered on Representative Harold D.Cooley, Democrat of North Carolina, chairman of the House Committee onAgriculture, who at least until this year held almost the complete power in thedistribution of quotas. It has never been too clear what criteria Mr. Cooleyused in allocating these quotas, and, by the same token, it is impossible todetermine what was the actual effect of the lobbyists’ entreaties on him.But in offering their services to foreign governments or sugar growers’associations, these representatives were, in effect, offering for sale theirreal or alleged friendship with Mr. Cooley.This is the core and essence of the issue of lobbying—and of our foreign aid—andof a mixed economy.The trouble is not that “it has never been too clear what criteria Mr. Cooleyused in allocating these quotas”—but that it has never been and never can be tooclear what criteria he was expected to use by the legislation that granted himthese powers. No criteria can ever be defined in this context; such is thenature of non-objective law and of all economic legislation.So long as a concept such as “the public interest” (or the “social” or“national” or “international” interest) is regarded as a valid principle toguide legislation—lobbies and pressure groups will necessarily continue toexist. Since there is no such entity as “the public,” since the public is merelya number of individuals, the idea that “the public interest” supersedes privateinterests and rights can have but one meaning: that the interests and rights ofsome individuals take precedence over the interests and rights of others.If so, then all men and all private groups have to fight to the death for theprivilege of being regarded as “the public.” The government’s policy has toswing like an erratic pendulum from group to group, hitting some and favoringothers, at the whim of any given moment—and so grotesque a profession aslobbying (selling “influence”) becomes a full-time job. If parasitism,favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixedeconomy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men toothers, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guidedin practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of moneytaken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes downultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrarypower to some government officials.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, butthat it cannot be used honestly. The wisest man in the world, with the purestintegrity, cannot find a criterion for the just, equitable, rational applicationof an unjust, inequitable, irrational principle. The best that an honestofficial can do is to accept no material bribe for his arbitrary decision; butthis does not make his decision and its consequences more just or lesscalamitous.A man of clear-cut convictions is impervious to anyone’s influence. But whenclear-cut convictions are impossible, personal influences take over. When aman’s mind is trapped in the foggy labyrinth of the non-objective, that has noexits and no solutions, he will welcome any quasi-persuasive, semi-plausibleargument. Lacking certainty, he will follow anyone’s facsimile thereof. He isthe natural prey of social “manipulators,” of propaganda salesmen, of lobbyists.When any argument is as inconclusive as any other, the subjective, emotional, or“human” element becomes decisive. A harried legislator may conclude, consciouslyor subconsciously, that the friendly man who smiled at him at the cocktail partylast week was a good person who would not deceive him and whose opinion can betrusted safely. It is by considerations such as these that officials may disposeof your money, your effort, and your future.Although cases of actual corruption do undoubtedly exist among legislators andgovernment officials, they are not a major motivating factor in today’ssituation. It is significant that in such cases as have been publicly exposed,the bribes were almost pathetically small. Men who held the power to dispose ofmillions of dollars, sold their favors for a thousand-dollar rug or a fur coator a refrigerator.The truth, most likely, is that they did not regard it as bribery or as abetrayal of their public trust; they did not think that their particulardecision could matter one way or another, in the kind of causeless choices theyhad to make, in the absence of any criteria, in the midst of the general orgy oftossing away an apparently ownerless wealth. Men who would not sell out theircountry for a million dollars are selling it out for somebody’s smile and avacation trip to Florida. Paraphrasing John Galt: “It is of such pennies andsmiles that the destruction of your country is made.”The general public is helplessly bewildered. The “intellectuals” do not care tolook at our foreign policy too closely. They feel guilt; they sense that theirown worn-out ideologies, which they dare not challenge, are the cause of theconsequences which they dare not face. The more they evade, the greater theireagerness to grasp at any fashionable straw or rationalization and to uphold itwith glassy-eyed aggressiveness. The threadbare cloak of altruism serves tocover it up and to sanction the evasions by a fading aura of moralrighteousness. The exhausted cynicism of a bankrupt culture, of a societywithout values, principles, convictions, or intellectual standards, does therest: it leaves a vacuum, for anyone to fill.The motive power behind the suicidal bleeding of the greatest country in theworld is not an altruistic fervor or a collectivist crusade any longer, but themanipulations of little lawyers and public relations men pulling the mentalstrings of lifeless automatons.These—the lobbyists in the pay of foreign interests, the men who could not hopeto get, in any other circumstances, the money they are getting now—are the realand only profiteers on the global sacrifice, as their ilk has always been at theclose of every altruistic movement in history. It is not the “under-developed”nations nor the “underprivileged” masses nor the starving children of junglevillages who benefit from America’s self-immolation—it is only the men who aretoo small to start such movements and small enough to cash in at the end.It is not any “lofty ideal” that the altruism-collectivism doctrine accomplishesor can ever accomplish. Its end-of-trail is as follows:A local railroad had gone bankrupt in North Dakota, abandoning the region to thefate of a blighted area, the local banker had committed suicide, first killinghis wife and children—a freight train had been taken off the schedule inTennessee, leaving a local factory without transportation at a day’s notice, thefactory owner’s son had quit college and was now in jail, awaiting execution fora murder committed with a gang of raiders—a way station had been closed inKansas, and the station agent, who had wanted to be a scientist, had given uphis studies and become a dishwasher—that he, James Taggart, might sit in aprivate barroom and pay for the alcohol pouring down Orren Boyle’s throat, forthe waiter who sponged Boyle’s garments when he spilled his drink over hischest, for the carpet burned by the cigarettes of an ex-pimp from Chile who didnot want to take the trouble of reaching for an ashtray across a distance ofthree feet. (Atlas Shrugged)"},{"pageContent":"17. “EXTREMISM,” OR THE ART OF SMEARINGby Ayn Rand Among the many symptoms of today’s moral bankruptcy, the performance of theso-called “moderates” at the Republican National Convention was the climax, atleast to date. It was an attempt to institutionalize smears as an instrument ofnational policy—to raise those smears from the private gutters of yellowjournalism to the public summit of a proposed inclusion in a political partyplatform. The “moderates” were demanding a repudiation of “extremism” withoutany definition of that term.Ignoring repeated challenges to define what they meant by “extremism,”substituting vituperation for identification, they kept the debate on the levelof concretes and would not name the wider abstractions or principles involved.They poured abuse on a few specific groups and would not disclose the criteriaby which these groups had been chosen. The only thing clearly perceivable to thepublic was a succession of snarling faces and hysterical voices screaming withviolent hatred—while denouncing “purveyors of hate” and demanding “tolerance.”The Objectivist Newsletter, September 1964.When men feel that strongly about an issue, yet refuse to name it, when theyfight savagely for some seemingly incoherent, unintelligible goal—one may besure that their actual goal would not stand public identification. Let us,therefore, proceed to identify it.First, observe the peculiar incongruity of the concretes chosen as the objectsof the “moderates’ ” hatred: “the Communist Party, the Ku Klux Klan, and theJohn Birch Society.” If one attempts to abstract the common attribute, theprinciple, by which these three groups could be linked together, one findsnone—or none more specific than “political group.” Obviously, this is not whatthe “moderates” had in mind.The common attribute—the “moderates” would snarl at this point—is “evil.” Okay,what evil? The Communist Party is guilty of the wholesale slaughter of countlessmillions spread through every continent of the globe. The Ku Klux Klan is guiltyof murdering innocent victims by the mob violence of lynchings. What is the JohnBirch Society guilty of? The only answer elicited from the “moderates” was:“They accused General Eisenhower of being a communist.”The worst category of crime in which this accusation could be placed is libel.Let us leave aside the fact that libel is what every anti-welfare-statist ischronically subjected to in public discussions. Let us agree that libel is aserious offense and ask only one question: does libel belong to the samecategory of evil as the actions of the Communist Party and the Ku Klux Klan?Are we to regard wholesale slaughter, lynch-murders, and libel as equal evils?If one heard a man declaring: “I am equally opposed to bubonic plague, tothrowing acid in people’s faces, and to my mother-in-law’s nagging”—one wouldconclude that the mother-in-law was the only object of his hatred and that herelimination was his only goal. The same principle applies to both examples ofthe same technique.No one truly opposed to the Communist Party and the Ku Klux Klan would taketheir evil so lightly as to equate it with the activities of a futile, befuddledorganization whose alleged sin, at worst, might be irresponsible recklessness inmaking unproved or libelous assertions.And more: the Communist Party as such is not a campaign issue, neither for theRepublicans nor the Democrats nor the electorate at large; virtually everybodyis denouncing the Communist Party these days and nobody needs the reassurance ofa formal repudiation. The Ku Klux Klan is not a Republican issue or problem; itsmembers, traditionally, are Democrats; for the Republicans to repudiate theirvote would be like repudiating the vote of Tammany Hall, which is not theirs torepudiate.This leaves only the John Birch Society as a real issue for a Republicanconvention. And it was the real issue—but in a deeper and more devious sensethan might appear on the surface.The real issue was not the John Birch Society as such: that Society was merelyan artificial and somewhat unworthy straw man, picked by the “moderates” as afocal point for the intended destruction of much greater and much more importantvictims.Observe that everyone at the Republican Convention seemed to understand theimplicit purpose behind the issue of “extremism,” but nobody would name itexplicitly. The debate was conducted in terms of enormous, undefined“package-deals,” as if words were merely approximations intended to connote anissue no one dared to denote. The result gave the impression of a life-and-deathstruggle conducted out of focus.The same atmosphere dominates the public controversy now raging over this issue.People are arguing about “extremism” as if they knew what that word meant, yetno two statements use it in the same sense and no two speakers seem to betalking about the same subject. If there ever was a tower-of-Babel situation,this is surely it. Please note that that is an important part of the issue.In fact, most people do not know the meaning of the word “extremism”; theymerely sense it. They sense that something is being put over on them by somemeans which they cannot grasp.In order to understand what is done and how it is being done, let us observesome earlier instances of the same technique.A large-scale instance, in the 1930’s, was the introduction of the world“isolationism” into our political vocabulary. It was a derogatory term,suggesting something evil, and it had no clear, explicit definition. It was usedto convey two meanings: one alleged, the other real—and to damn both.The alleged meaning was defined approximately like this: “Isolationism is theattitude of a person who is interested only in his own country and is notconcerned with the rest of the world.” The real meaning was: “Patriotism andnational self-interest.”What, exactly, is “concern with the rest of the world”? Since nobody did orcould maintain the position that the state of the world is of no concern to thiscountry, the term “isolationism” was a straw man used to misrepresent theposition of those who were concerned with this country’s interests. The conceptof patriotism was replaced by the term “isolationism” and vanished from publicdiscussion.The number of distinguished patriotic leaders smeared, silenced, and eliminatedby that tag would be hard to compute. Then, by a gradual, imperceptible process,the real purpose of the tag took over: the concept of “concern” was switchedinto “selfless concern.” The ultimate result was a view of foreign policy whichis wrecking the United States to this day: the suicidal view that our foreignpolicy must be guided, not by considerations of national self-interest, but byconcern for the interests and welfare of the world, that is, of all countriesexcept our own.In the late 1940’s, another newly coined term was shot into our culturalarteries: “McCarthyism.” Again, it was a derogatory term, suggesting someinsidious evil, and without any clear definition. Its alleged meaning was:“Unjust accusations, persecutions, and character assassinations of innocentvictims.” Its real meaning was: “Anti-communism.”Senator McCarthy was never proved guilty of those allegations, but the effect ofthat term was to intimidate and silence public discussions. Any uncompromisingdenunciation of communism or communists was—and still is—smeared as“McCarthyism.” As a consequence, opposition to and exposes of communistpenetration have all but vanished from our intellectual scene. (I must mentionthat I am not an admirer of Senator McCarthy, but not for the reasons implied inthat smear.)Now consider the term “extremism.” Its alleged meaning is: “Intolerance, hatred,racism, bigotry, crackpot theories, incitement to violence.” Its real meaningis: “The advocacy of capitalism.”Observe the technique involved in these three examples. It consists of creatingan artificial, unnecessary, and (rationally) unusable term, designed to replaceand obliterate some legitimate concepts—a term which sounds like a concept, butstands for a “package-deal” of disparate, incongruous, contradictory elementstaken out of any logical conceptual order or context, a “packagedeal” whose(approximately) defining characteristic is always a non-essential. This last isthe essence of the trick.Let me remind you that the purpose of a definition is to distinguish the thingssubsumed under a single concept from all other things in existence; and,therefore, their defining characteristic must always be that essentialcharacteristic which distinguishes them from everything else.So long as men use language, that is the way they will use it. There is no otherway to communicate. And if a man accepts a term with a definition bynon-essentials, his mind will substitute for it the essential characteristic ofthe objects he is trying to designate.For instance, “concern (or non-concern) with the rest of the world” is not anessential characteristic of any theory of foreign relations. If a man hears theterm “isolationists” applied to a number of individuals, he will observe thatthe essential characteristic distinguishing them from other individuals ispatriotism—and he will conclude that “isolationism” means “patriotism” and thatpatriotism is evil. Thus the real meaning of the term will automatically replacethe alleged meaning.If a man hears the term “McCarthyism,” he will observe that the best-knowncharacteristic distinguishing Senator McCarthy from other public figures is ananti-communist stand, and he will conclude that anti-communism is evil.If a man hears the term “extremism” and is offered the innocuous figure of theJohn Birch Society as an example, he will observe that its best-knowncharacteristic is “conservatism,” and he will conclude that “conservatism” isevil—as evil as the Communist Party and the Ku Klux Klan. (“Conservatism” isitself a loose, undefined, badly misleading term—but in today’s popular usage itis taken to mean “pro-capitalism.”)Such is the function of modern smear-tags, and such is the process by which theydestroy our public communications, making rational discussion of politicalissues impossible.The same mentalities that create an “anti-hero” in order to destroy heroes, andan “anti-novel” in order to destroy novels, are creating “anti-concepts” inorder to destroy concepts.The purpose of “anti-concepts” is to obliterate certain concepts without publicdiscussion; and, as a means to that end, to make public discussionunintelligible, and to induce the same disintegration in the mind of any man whoaccepts them, rendering him incapable of clear thinking or rational judgment. Nomind is better than the precision of its concepts.(I call this to the special attention of two particular classes of men who aidand abet the dissemination of “anti-concepts”: the academic ivory-towerphilosophers who claim that definitions are a matter of arbitrary social whim orconvention, and that there can be no such thing as right or wrongdefinitions—and the “practical” men who believe that so abstract a science asepistemology can have no effect on the political events of the world.)Of all the “anti-concepts” polluting our cultural atmosphere, “extremism” is themost ambitious in scale and implications; it goes much beyond politics. Let usnow examine it in detail.To begin with, “extremism” is a term which, standing by itself, has no meaning.The concept of “extreme” denotes a relation, a measurement, a degree. Thedictionary gives the following definitions: “Extreme, adj.—1. of a character orkind farthest removed from the ordinary or average. 2. utmost or exceedinglygreat in degree.”It is obvious that the first question one has to ask, before using that term,is: a degree—of what?To answer: “Of anything!” and to proclaim that any extreme is evil because it isan extreme—to hold the degree of a characteristic, regardless of its nature, asevil—is an absurdity (any garbled Aristotelianism to the contrarynotwithstanding). Measurements, as such, have no value-significance—and acquireit only from the nature of that which is being measured.Are an extreme of health and an extreme of disease equally undesirable? Areextreme intelligence and extreme stupidity—both equally far removed “from theordinary or average”—equally unworthy? Are extreme honesty and extremedishonesty equally immoral? Are a man of extreme virtue and a man of extremedepravity equally evil?The examples of such absurdities can be multiplied indefinitely—particularly inthe field of morality where only an extreme (i.e., unbreached, uncompromised)degree of virtue can be properly called a virtue. (What is the moral status of aman of “moderate” integrity?)But “don’t bother to examine a folly—ask yourself only what it accomplishes.”What is the “anti-concept” of “extremism” intended to accomplish in politics?The basic and crucial political issue of our age is: capitalism versussocialism, or freedom versus statism. For decades, this issue has been silenced,suppressed, evaded, and hidden under the foggy, undefined rubber-terms of“conservatism” and “liberalism” which had lost their original meaning and couldbe stretched to mean all things to all men.The goal of the “liberals”—as it emerges from the record of the past decades—wasto smuggle this country into welfare statism by means of single, concrete,specific measures, enlarging the power of the government a step at a time, neverpermitting these steps to be summed up into principles, never permitting theirdirection to be identified or the basic issue to be named. Thus statism was tocome, not by vote or by violence, but by slow rot—by a long process of evasionand epistemological corruption, leading to a fait accompli. (The goal of the“conservatives” was only to retard that process.)The “liberals’ ” program required that the concept of capitalism beobliterated—not merely as if it could not exist any longer, but as if it hadnever existed. The actual nature, principles, and history of capitalism had tobe smeared, distorted, misrepresented and thus kept out of publicdiscussion—because socialism has not won and cannot win in open debate, in anuncorrupted marketplace of ideas, neither on the ground of logic nor economicsnor morality nor historical performance. Socialism can win only by default—bythe moral default of its alleged opponents.That blackout seemed to work for a while. But “you can’t fool all of the peopleall of the time.” Today, the frayed, worn tags of “conservatism” and“liberalism” are cracking up—and what is showing underneath is: capitalismversus socialism.The welfare-statists need a new cover. What we are witnessing now is adesperate, last-ditch attempt to put over two “anti-concepts”: the “extremists”and the “moderates.”To put over an “anti-concept,” one needs a straw man (or scarecrow or scapegoat)to serve as an example of its alleged meaning. That is the role for which the“liberals” have chosen the John Birch Society.That Society was thrust into public prominence by the “liberal” press, a fewyears ago, and overpublicized out of all proportion to its actual importance. Ithas no clear, specific political philosophy (it is not for capitalism, butmerely against communism), no real political program, no intellectual influence;it represents a confused, non-intellectual, “cracker-barrel” type of protest; itis certainly not the spokesman nor the rallying point of pro-capitalism or evenof “conservatism.” These precisely are the reasons why it was chosen by the“liberals.”The intended technique was: first, to ignore the existence of any serious,reputable, intellectual advocacy of capitalism and the growing body ofliterature on that subject, past and present—by literally pretending that it didnot and does not exist; then, to publicize the John Birch Society as the onlyrepresentative of the “right”; then to smear all “rightists” by equating themwith the John Birch Society.An explicit proof of this intention was given in a TV interview last year(September 15, 1963) by Governor Rockefeller, who later led the attack on“extremism” at the Republican Convention. Asked to define what he meant by “theradical right,” he said:The best illustration was what happened at the Young Republican Convention inSan Francisco a number of months ago, where a man was elected, a YoungRepublican was elected on a platform to abolish the income tax, to withdraw fromthe United Nations, I don’t know whether he included impeachment of Earl Warren,but that is part of this whole concept, and the idea that General Eisenhower wasa crypto-communist. [Italics mine.]Part of what concept?The first two tenets listed are legitimate “rightist” positions, backed by manyvalid reasons; the third is a sample of purely Birchite foolishness; the fourthis a sample of the irresponsibility of just one Birchite. The total is a sampleof the art of smearing.Now consider the meaning ascribed to the term “rightist” within the“package-deal” of “extremism.” In general usage, the terms “rightists” and“leftists” designate advocates of capitalism and socialism. But observe theabnormal, artificial stress of the attempt to associate racism and violence with“the extreme right”—two evils of which even the straw man, the Birch Society, isnot guilty, and which can be much more plausibly associated with the DemocraticParty (via the Ku Klux Klan). The purpose is to revive that old saw of pre-WorldWar II vintage, the notion that the two political opposites confronting us, thetwo “extremes,” are: fascism versus communism.The political origin of that notion is more shameful than the “moderates” wouldcare publicly to admit. Mussolini came to power by claiming that that was theonly choice confronting Italy. Hitler came to power by claiming that that wasthe only choice confronting Germany. It is a matter of record that in the Germanelection of 1933, the Communist Party was ordered by its leaders to vote for theNazis—with the explanation that they could later fight the Nazis for power, butfirst they had to help destroy their common enemy: capitalism and itsparliamentary form of government.It is obvious what the fraudulent issue of fascism versus communismaccomplishes: it sets up, as opposites, two variants of the same politicalsystem; it eliminates the possibility of considering capitalism; it switches thechoice of “Freedom or dictatorship?” into “Which kind of dictatorship?”—thusestablishing dictatorship as an inevitable fact and offering only a choice ofrulers. The choice—according to the proponents of that fraud—is: a dictatorshipof the rich (fascism) or a dictatorship of the poor (communism).That fraud collapsed in the 1940’s, in the aftermath of World War II. It is tooobvious, too easily demonstrable that fascism and communism are not twoopposites, but two rival gangs fighting over the same territory—that both arevariants of statism, based on the collectivist principle that man is therightless slave of the state—that both are socialistic, in theory, in practice,and in the explicit statements of their leaders—that under both systems, thepoor are enslaved and the rich are expropriated in favor of a ruling clique—thatfascism is not the product of the political “right,” but of the “left”—that thebasic issue is not “rich versus poor,” but man versus the state, or: individualrights versus totalitarian government—which means: capitalism versussocialism.52 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-52]The smear of capitalism’s advocates as “fascists” has failed in this countryand, for over a decade, has been moldering in dark corners, seldom venturing tobe heard openly, in public—coming only as an occasional miasma from under theground, from the sewers of actual left-ism. And this is the kind of notion thatthe “liberals” are unfastidious enough to attempt to revive. But it is obviouswhat vested interest that notion can serve.If it were true that dictatorship is inevitable and that fascism and communismare the two “extremes” at the opposite ends of our course, then what is thesafest place to choose? Why, the middle of the road. The safely undefined,indeterminate, mixed-economy, “moderate” middle—with a “moderate” amount ofgovernment favors and special privileges to the rich and a “moderate” amount ofgovernment handouts to the poor—with a “moderate” respect for rights and a“moderate” degree of brute force—with a “moderate” amount of freedom and a“moderate” amount of slavery—with a “moderate” degree of justice and a“moderate” degree of injustice—with a “moderate” amount of security and a“moderate” amount of terror—and with a moderate degree of tolerance for all,except those “extremists” who uphold principles, consistency, objectivity,morality and who refuse to compromise.The notion of compromise as the supreme virtue superseding all else is the moralimperative, the moral precondition of a mixed economy.53[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-53] A mixed economy is an explosive,untenable mixture of two opposite elements, which cannot remain stable, but mustultimately go one way or the other; it is a mixture of freedom and controls,which means: not of fascism and communism, but of capitalism and statism(including all its variants). Those who wish to support the un-supportable,disintegrating status quo, are screaming in panic that it can be prolonged byeliminating the two “extremes” of its basic components; but the two extremesare: capitalism or total dictatorship.Dictatorship feeds on the ideological chaos of bewildered, demoralized,cynically flexible, unresisting men. But capitalism requires an uncompromisingstand. (Destruction can be done blindly, at random; but construction requiresstrict adherence to specific principles.) The welfare-statists hope to eliminatecapitalism by smear and silence—and to “avoid” dictatorship by “voluntary”compliance, by a policy of bargaining and compromise with the government’sgrowing power.This brings us to the deeper implications of the term “extremism.” It is obviousthat an uncompromising stand (on anything) is the actual characteristic whichthat “anti-concept” is designed to damn. It is also obvious that compromise isincompatible with morality. In the field of morality, compromise is surrender toevil.There can be no compromise on basic principles. There can be no compromise onmoral issues. There can be no compromise on matters of knowledge, of truth, ofrational conviction.If an uncompromising stand is to be smeared as “extremism,” then that smear isdirected at any devotion to values, any loyalty to principles, any profoundconviction, any consistency, any steadfastness, any passion, any dedication toan unbreached, inviolate truth—any man of integrity.And it is against all these that that “anti-concept” has been and is being used.Here we can see the deeper roots, the source that has made the spread of“anti-concepts” possible. The mentally paralyzed, anxiety-ridden neuroticsproduced by the disintegration of modern philosophy—with its cult ofuncertainty, its epistemological irrationalism and ethical subjectivism—come outof our colleges, broken by chronic dread, seeking escape from the absolutism ofreality with which they feel themselves impotent to deal. Fear drives them tounite with slick political manipulators and pragmatist ward-heelers to make theworld safe for mediocrity by raising to the status of a moral ideal thatarchetypical citizen of a mixed economy: the docile, pliable, moderateMilquetoast who never gets excited, never makes trouble, never cares too much,adjusts to anything and upholds nothing.The best proof of an intellectual movement’s collapse is the day when it hasnothing to offer as an ultimate ideal but a plea for “moderation.” Such is thefinal proof of collectivism’s bankruptcy. The vision, the courage, thededication, the moral fire are now on the barely awakening side of the crusadersfor capitalism.It will take more than an “anti-concept” to stop them."},{"pageContent":"18. THE OBLITERATION OF CAPITALISMby Ayn Rand In my article “ ‘Extremism,’ or The Art of Smearing,” I discussed the subject of“anti-concepts”—i.e., artificial, unnecessary, undefined and (rationally)unusable terms intended to replace and obliterate certain legitimate concepts inpeople’s minds.I said that the “liberals” are coining and spreading “anti-concepts” in order tosmuggle this country into statism by an imperceptible process—and that theprimary target marked for obliteration is the concept of “capitalism,” which, iflost, would carry away with it the knowledge that a free society can and didexist.But there is something much less attractive (and, politically, much moredisastrous) than capitalism’s enemies: its alleged defenders—some of whom aremuscling in on the game of manufacturing “anti-concepts” of their own.Have you ever felt a peculiar kind of embarrassment when witnessing a grosslyinappropriate human performance, such as the antics of an unfunny comedian? Itis a depersonalized, almost metaphysical embarrassment at having to witness soundignified a behavior on the part of a member of the human species.The Objectivist Newsletter, October 1965.That is what I feel at having to hear the following statement of GovernorRomney, which was his alleged answer to the communists’ boast that they wouldbury capitalism:“But what they do not understand—and what we have failed to tell the world—isthat Americans buried capitalism long ago, and moved on to consumerism.”The implications of such a statement are too sickeningly obvious. The bestcomment on it came from The Richardson Digest (Richardson, Texas, April 28,1965), from the column “Lively Comments” by Earl Lively, who wrote: “Afraid tostand alone, even on his knees, Romney then tells the rest of us that we do notknow the definition of capitalism, we do not understand our economic principles,and we’d be better off if we quit going around defending such an unpopularconcept as capitalism.”Mr. Lively is admirably precise in his description of the posture involved. ButMr. Romney is not alone in it. A number of intellectually more reputable men(including some distinguished free-enterprise economists) have adopted the samestance and the same line for the same psychological reasons.There are the economists who proclaim that the essence (and the moraljustification) of capitalism is “service to others—to the consumers,” that theconsumers’ wishes are the absolute edicts ruling the free market, etc. (This isan example of what a definition by non-essentials accomplishes, and of why ahalf-truth is worse than a lie: what all such theorists fail to mention is thefact that capitalism grants economic recognition to only one kind of consumer:the producer—that only traders, i.e., producers who have something to offer, arerecognized on a free market, not “consumers” as such—that, in a capitalisteconomy, as in reason, in justice, and in reality, production is thepre-condition of consumption.)There are the businessmen who spend fortunes on ideological ads, allegedly indefense of capitalism, which assure the public that all but a tiny fraction ofan industry’s income goes to labor (wages), to government (taxes), etc., withthese shares represented as big chunks in full-color process, and, lost amongthem, an apologetic little sliver is marked “2½ percent” and labeled “profits.”There is the display of charts and models, in a hallway of the New York StockExchange, presenting the achievements of free enterprise and captioned: “ThePeople’s Capitalism.”Since none of these attempts can succeed in disguising the nature of capitalismnor in degrading it to the level of an altruistic stockyard, their sole resultis to convince the public that capitalism hides some evil secret which imbuesits alleged defenders with such an aura of abject guilt and hypocrisy. But, infact, the secret they are struggling to hide is capitalism’s essence andgreatest virtue: that it is a system based on the recognition of individualrights—on man’s right to exist (and to work) for his own sake—not on thealtruistic view of man as a sacrificial animal. Thus it is capitalism’s virtuethat the public is urged—by such defenders—to regard as evil, and it is altruismthat all their efforts help to reinforce and reaffirm as the standard of thegood.What they dare not allow into their minds is the fact that capitalism andaltruism are incompatible; so they wonder why the more they propagandize, themore unpopular capitalism becomes. They blame it on people’s stupidity (becausepeople refuse to believe that a successful industrialist is an exponent ofaltruistic self-sacrifice)—and on people’s greed for the unearned (because,after being battered with assurances that the industrialist’s wealth is“morally” theirs, people do come to believe it).No “anti-concept” launched by the “liberals” goes so far so crudely as the tag“consumerism.” It implies loudly and clearly that the status of “consumer” isseparate from and superior to the status of “producer”; it suggests a socialsystem dedicated to the service of a new aristocracy which is distinguished bythe ability to “consume” and vested with a special claim on the caste of serfsmarked by the ability to produce. If taken seriously, such a tag would lead tothe ultimate absurdity of the communists proclaiming: “Who does not toil, shallnot eat”—and the alleged representatives of capitalism replying: “Oh yes, heshall!” And if the Ad Hoc Committee on the Triple Revolution propounds such amoral obscenity as “the right to consume”—who inspired it, Karl Marx or GovernorRomney?It is true that we are not a capitalist system any longer: we are a mixedeconomy, i.e., a mixture of capitalism and statism, of freedom and controls. Amixed economy is a country in the process of disintegration, a civil war ofpressure-groups looting and devouring one another. In this sense, “consumerism”might be the appropriate name for it.Now to whom is it that the friends, the semi-friends, and even the acquaintancesof capitalism are so anxiously apologizing?As the clearest illustration of the psychological motives, the moral meaning andthe intellectual technique involved in the manufacture of “anti-concepts,” Ioffer you a column by C. L. Sulzberger, entitled “Should the Old Labels BeChanged,” in the July 1964 issue of The New York Times.A research report of the United States Information Agency [writes Mr.Sulzberger] has ruefully discovered that the more our propaganda advertises thevirtues of “capitalism” and attacks “Socialism,” the less the world likes us. .. . Confused semantics make bad public relations. . . . Having analyzedconclusions of its poll-takers in both hemispheres, the U.S.I.A. study observes:“Capitalism is evil. The United States is the leading capitalist country.Therefore, the United States is evil.” It would be difficult to exaggerate theharm that this line of thinking has done. In the Soviet Union and CommunistChina it sustains attitudes and actions that greatly increase the danger ofthermonuclear war.What is meant here by such a foggy expression as “sustains attitudes andactions”? The smear of capitalism as evil was originated and is constantlyreiterated by the communists. Does the above mean that their own smear sustainstheir attitudes? And does it mean that the way to avoid thermonuclear war is forus to agree that the smear is true? The report does not say. It merely goes on:“In the non-Communist world it tends to poison the atmosphere in which we aretrying to carry on our aid programs and other international cooperation.”This means that the harm, to us, lies in the danger that the recipients of ourcharity might refuse to take our money—and that in order to gain their“cooperation,” we must spit in our own face and join in smearing the systemwhich produced the wealth which is saving their lives.“Capitalism” is a dirty word to millions of non-Marxists who see “Socialism” asvaguely benevolent. When the U.S.I.A. sampled foreign opinion it found that tothe majority “Socialism” did not mean government ownership and was notnecessarily related to communism. Rather it seemed to imply a system favoringwelfare of common people.If you have doubted that the philosophy of Pragmatism actually teaches thattruth is to be established by public polls—here is a sample of it, in pure andnaked form. Volumes of theory, a century of history, and the bloody practice offive continents to the contrary notwithstanding, “socialism” does not meangovernment ownership and is not related to communism—because a sampling ofmajority opinion said so. And what is meant by “a system favoring welfare ofcommon people”? How does one “favor” the “common people”? At the expense of theuncommon? A “favor” means the unearned—since the earned is a right, not a favor.Whose rights and earnings are to be abrogated and expropriated—for whosebenefit? The only variant of socialism that can distribute “favors” withoutgovernment ownership is fascism. Draw your own conclusions about the politicalinclinations of the moral cannibals involved in that poll.Most foreigners apparently don’t regard “capitalism” as descriptive of anefficient economy or a safeguard of individual rights. To them it means littleconcern for the poor, unfair distribution of wealth, and undue influence of therich.How does one combine the safeguard of individual rights with agovernment-enforced “concern for the poor” and a government-distributed wealthand “influence”? No answer.U.S.I.A. found an impressive percentage of British, West Germans, Italians,Japanese, Mexicans and Brazilians have a favorable opinion of “Socialism” and astrongly unfavorable opinion of “capitalism.”Consider the philosophical trends, the intellectual commitments, the moralrecords of these countries—and their political results. Germany, Italy, andJapan were fascist dictatorships; their claims to political wisdom consist ofgiving the world a demonstration of horror equaled only by their ideologicalbrothers in Soviet Russia and Red China. Britain, Mexico, and Brazil are mixedeconomies which have long since gone over the borderline state of mixture intothe category—and the economic bankruptcy—of socialistic countries. And these arethe nations whose opinions we are asked to value, whose favor we are asked tocourt—these are the moral authorities to whom we must apologize for the noblestpolitical system in history: ours—these are the judges whom we must placate bydenying our system, dishonoring its record, and obliterating its name.Is there any conceivable motive that could prompt a nation to so base abetrayal? Conceivable—no, if one refers to the realm of rational concepts. But—“Capitalism” abroad is frequently a pejorative word. Efforts to purge it ofnegative connotations by phrases like “people’s capitalism” have failed. . . .But “Socialism” is chic. [Yes, chic.] Even in Britain and West Germany, whereprivate ownership is the mode, the majority expressed itself sympathetic to“Socialism,” while abhorring Communism.If the term “social metaphysics” occurs to you at this point, you would beright—except that even that term seems too clean, almost too innocent, toexplain the following:Leaders of underdeveloped nations, spurning “capitalism,” boast of specialbrands of “Socialism.” Leopold Senghor of Senegal says “Socialism is a sense ofcommunity which is a return to Africanism.” Julius Nyerere of Tanganyika insists“no underdeveloped country can afford to be anything but ‘Socialist.’ ”Tunisia’s Habib Bourguiba claims Mohammed’s companions “were Socialists beforethe invention of the word.” And Cambodia’s Prince Norodom Sihanouk contends “ourSocialism is first and foremost an application of Buddhism.”The above is true, totally true, true all the way down to the deepestphilosophical, psychological, political, and moral fundamentals. And this is themost damning indictment of socialism that a rational person could need to see.Socialism is a regression to primitive barbarism. But that is not the appraisalor the conclusion of the U.S.I.A. report. It is to the Mohammedans, theBuddhists, and the cannibals (the literal cannibals, this time)—to theunder-developed, the undeveloped, and the not-to-be-developed cultures—that theCapitalist United States of America is asked to apologize for her skyscrapers,her automobiles, her plumbing, and her smiling, confident, untortured,un-skinned-alive, un-eaten young men!The column ends as follows:The study concludes that foreigners attribute to the U.S.A. “a high degree ofcapitalist exploitation and of capitalist power over the society as a whole, aswell as a great absence of those social welfare measures which, to them, are thedecisive criterion of Socialism.” [U.S.I.A.’s own italics.]There is surely no sense in proclaiming our philosophy in terms that areunsalable and peculiarly vulnerable to our opponents’ attacks. . . .Our system of capitalism has evolved immensely from the outmoded economicdoctrine to which the label was originally applied by Marx and other 19thcenturythinkers. Might not the U.S.I.A. attempt another survey seeking ways ofannouncing our social and political system in a manner more acceptable to thoseabroad whose opinions we would influence?Influence—how? In what direction? To what purpose? If, for the sake ofappeasement, we renounce our philosophy and adopt theirs, if we discard the lastremnants of capitalism and proclaim ourselves to be a “National SocialistWelfare State,” who would have “influenced”—and buried—whom?A great many things may be observed about this unusually revealing column. It istrue, of course, that if American propagandists are defending capitalism abroadas they do at home, the results would be precisely as described in that U.S.I.A.study, or worse. At home, it is the “conservatives” who are appeasing the“liberals” and losing the battle, because they dare not uphold the true natureof capitalism. Abroad, it is the “liberals” who are appeasing the communists andlosing the battle, for the same reason: there is no way to defend capitalismwithout upholding man’s right to exist, which means, without rejecting altruism.Observe the appalling indifference to the issue of truth or falsehood on thepart of capitalism’s alleged defenders. They attach no significance to suchcontradictions as sympathizing with socialism while abhorring communism—or tothe fact that capitalism is the only opposite of and the only defense againstcommunism. They attach no significance to the ignorance, the dishonesty, theinjustice, the irrationality of capitalism’s critics. In the face of amoral-philosophical issue, their response is an immediate, uncritical acceptanceof the critics’ terms, a surrender to ignorance, dishonesty, injustice,irrationality. In the face of the knowledge that capitalism is being smeared bythe communists, by the very enemy they intend to fight, their policy is not toblast the smear, not to enlighten the world, not to defend the victim, not tospeak out for justice—but to sanction the smear, to hide the truth, to sacrificethe victim, to join the lynching. What they feel is: Of what account is truth inthe face of such a consideration as “people don’t like us”? What they cry is:“But this is the way we’ll make people like the victim!”—after we’ve helped themgrind her to bits in the mud. Then they wonder why contempt is all they earn,from betrayed allies and sworn enemies alike. Moral cowardice is not anattractive nor an inspiring nor a very practical trait.Observe the obscenity of those Europeans who—in this day and age, in the risingtide of global bloodshed, in the face of the unspeakable atrocities of the“newly emerging” nations—dare prattle about “little concern for the poor” andcriticize the United States for that. Whatever their motives, concern for humansuffering is not one of them.We may observe all that, but it seems almost irrelevant beside the one central,overwhelming fact: the intellectual leaders of today’s world are willing tocondone and accept anything, they are willing to recognize the right of Buddhismand Africanism to their boastfully asserted traditions (remember the nature andrecord of those traditions)—but they make one exception. There is onecountry—the United States of America—who is not acceptable to them, who mustrenounce her tradition and, in atonement, must crawl on her knees, begging thesavages of five continents to choose a new name for her system, which wouldobliterate the guilt of her past. What is her guilt? That for one brief momentin human history, she offered the world the vision of unsacrificed man in anon-sacrificial way of life.When one grasps this, one knows that it is no use arguing over political trivia,or wondering about the nature of altruism and why the reign of the altruists isleading the world to an ever widening spread of horror. This is the nature ofaltruism, this—not any sort of benevolence, good will, or concern for humanmisfortune. Hatred of man, not the desire to help him—hatred of life, not thedesire to further it—hatred of the successful state of life—and that ultimate,apocalyptic evil: hatred of the good for being the good.What every successful man (successful at any human value, spiritual or material)has encountered, has sensed, has been bewildered by, but has seldom identified,can now be seen in the open, with nations, instead of individual men,re-enacting the same unspeakable evil on a world scale where it cannot be hiddenany longer. It is not for her flaws that the United States of America is hated,but for her virtues—not for her weaknesses, but for her achievements—not for herfailures, but for her success—her magnificent, shining, life-giving success.It is not your wealth that they’re after. Theirs is a conspiracy against themind, which means: against life and man. It is a conspiracy without leader ordirection, and the random little thugs of the moment who cash in on the agony ofone land or another are chance scum riding the torrent from the broken dam ofthe sewer of centuries, from the reservoir of hatred for reason, for logic, forability, for achievement, for joy, stored by every whining anti-human who everpreached the superiority of the “heart” over the mind. (Atlas Shrugged)With most of the world in ruins, with the voice of philosophy silent and thelast remnants of civilization vanishing undefended, in an unholy alliance ofsavagery and decadence, bloody thugs are fighting over the spoils, while thecynical pragmatists left in charge and way out of their depth are trying todrown their panic at Europe’s cocktail parties, where emasculated men andhysterical, white-lipped women determine the fate of the world by declaring thatsocialism is chic.This is the face of our age. To attempt to fight it by means of compromise,conciliation, equivocation, and circumlocution is worse than grotesque. This isnot a battle to be fought by joining the enemy in any manner—nor by borrowingany of his slogans or his bloody ideological equipment—nor by deluding the worldabout the nature of the battle—nor by pretending that one is “in” with that sortof crowd.It is a battle only for those who know why it is necessary to be “out”—as farout of that stream as words will carry—why, when moral issues are at stake, onemust begin by blasting the enemy’s base and cutting off any link to it, anybridge, any toehold—and if one is to be misunderstood, let it be on the side ofintransigence, not on the side of any resemblance to any part of so monstrous anevil.It is a battle only for those who—paraphrasing a character in Atlas Shrugged—areprepared to say:“Capitalism was the only system in history where wealth was not acquired bylooting, but by production, not by force, but by trade, the only system thatstood for man’s right to his own mind, to his work, to his life, to hishappiness, to himself. If this is evil, by the present standards of the world,if this is the reason for damning us, then we—we, the champions of man—accept itand choose to be damned by that world. We choose to wear the name ‘Capitalism’printed on our foreheads, proudly, as our badge of nobility.”This is what the battle demands. Nothing less will do."},{"pageContent":"19. CONSERVATISM: AN OBITUARYby Ayn Rand Both the “conservatives” and the “liberals” stress a fact with which everybodyseems to agree: that the world is facing a deadly conflict and that we mustfight to save civilization.But what is the nature of that conflict? Both groups answer: it is a conflictbetween communism and . . . and what?—blank out. It is a conflict between twoways of life, they answer, the communist way and . . . what?—blank out. It is aconflict between two ideologies, they answer. What is our ideology? Blank out.The truth which both groups refuse to face and to admit is that, politically,the world conflict of today is the last stage of the struggle between capitalismand statism.We stand for freedom, say both groups—and proceed to declare what kind ofcontrols, regulations, coercions, taxes, and “sacrifices” they would impose,what arbitrary powers they would demand, what “social gains” they would hand outto various groups, without specifying from what other groups these “gains” wouldbe expropriated. Neither of them cares to admit that government control of acountry’s economy—any kind or degree of such control, by any group, for anypurpose whatsoever—rests on the basic principle of statism, the principle thatman’s life belongs to the state. A mixed economy is merely a semi-socializedeconomy—which means: a semi-enslaved society—which means: a country torn byirreconcilable contradictions, in the process of gradual disintegration.Based on a lecture given at Princeton University on December 7, 1960. Publishedby Nathaniel Branden Institute, New York, 1962.Freedom, in a political context, means freedom from government coercion. It doesnot mean freedom from the landlord, or freedom from the employer, or freedomfrom the laws of nature which do not provide men with automatic prosperity. Itmeans freedom from the coercive power of the state—and nothing else.The world conflict of today is the conflict of the individual against the state,the same conflict that has been fought throughout mankind’s history. The nameschange, but the essence—and the results—remain the same, whether it is theindividual against feudalism, or against absolute monarchy, or against communismor fascism or Nazism or socialism or the welfare state.If one upholds freedom, one must uphold man’s individual rights; if one upholdsman’s individual rights, one must uphold his right to his own life, to his ownliberty, to the pursuit of his own happiness—which means: one must uphold apolitical system that guarantees and protects these rights—which means: thepolitico-economic system of capitalism.Individual rights, freedom, justice, progress were the philosophical values, thetheoretical goals, and the practical results of capitalism. No other system cancreate them or maintain them; no other system ever has or will. For proof,consider the nature and function of basic principles; for evidence, consulthistory—and the present state of the different countries of Europe.The issue is not slavery for a “good” cause versus slavery for a “bad” cause;the issue is not dictatorship by a “good” gang versus dictatorship by a “bad”gang. The issue is freedom versus dictatorship. It is only after men have chosenslavery and dictatorship that they can begin the usual gang warfare ofsocialized countries—today, it is called pressure-group warfare—over whose gangwill rule, who will enslave whom, whose property will be plundered for whosebenefit, who will be sacrificed to whose “noble” purpose. All such argumentscome later and are, in fact, of no consequence: the results will always be thesame. The first choice—and the only one that matters—is: freedom ordictatorship, capitalism or statism.That is the choice which today’s political leaders are determined to evade. The“liberals” are trying to put statism over by stealth—statism of asemi-socialist, semi-fascist kind—without letting the country realize what roadthey are taking to what ultimate goal. And while such a policy is reprehensible,there is something more reprehensible still: the policy of the “conservatives,”who are trying to defend freedom by stealth.If the “liberals” are afraid to identify their program by its proper name, ifthey advocate every specific step, measure, policy, and principle of statism,but squirm and twist themselves into semantic pretzels with such euphemisms asthe “Welfare State,” the “New Deal,” the “New Frontier,” they still preserve asemblance of logic, if not of morality: it is the logic of a con man who cannotafford to let his victims discover his purpose. Besides, the majority of thosewho are loosely identified by the term “liberals” are afraid to let themselvesdiscover that what they advocate is statism. They do not want to accept the fullmeaning of their goal; they want to keep all the advantages and effects ofcapitalism, while destroying the cause, and they want to establish statismwithout its necessary effects. They do not want to know or to admit that theyare the champions of dictatorship and slavery. So they evade the issue, for fearof discovering that their goal is evil.Immoral as this might be, what is one to think of men who evade the issue forfear of discovering that their goal is good? What is the moral stature of thosewho are afraid to proclaim that they are the champions of freedom? What is theintegrity of those who outdo their enemies in smearing, misrepresenting,spitting at, and apologizing for their own ideal? What is the rationality ofthose who expect to trick people into freedom, cheat them into justice, foolthem into progress, con them into preserving their rights, and, whileindoctrinating them with statism, put one over on them and let them wake up in aperfect capitalist society some morning?These are the “conservatives”—or most of their intellectual spokesmen.One need not wonder why they are losing elections or why this country isstumbling anxiously, reluctantly toward statism. One need not wonder why anycause represented or upheld in such a manner is doomed. One need not wonder whyany group with such a policy does, in fact, declare its own bankruptcy,forfeiting any claim to moral, intellectual, or political leadership.The meaning of the “liberals’ ” program is pretty clear by now. But what are the“conservatives”? What is it that they are seeking to “conserve”?It is generally understood that those who support the “conservatives” expectthem to uphold the system which has been camouflaged by the loose term of “theAmerican way of life.” The moral treason of the “conservative” leaders lies inthe fact that they are hiding behind that camouflage: they do not have thecourage to admit that the American way of life was capitalism, that that was thepolitico-economic system born and established in the United States, the systemwhich, in one brief century, achieved a level of freedom, of progress, ofprosperity, of human happiness, unmatched in all the other systems and centuriescombined—and that that is the system which they are now allowing to perish bysilent default.If the “conservatives” do not stand for capitalism, they stand for and arenothing; they have no goal, no direction, no political principles, no socialideals, no intellectual values, no leadership to offer anyone.Yet capitalism is what the “conservatives” dare not advocate or defend. They areparalyzed by the profound conflict between capitalism and the moral code whichdominates our culture: the morality of altruism. Altruism holds that man has noright to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the onlyjustification of his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moralduty, virtue, and value. Capitalism and altruism are incompatible; they arephilosophical opposites; they cannot co-exist in the same man or in the samesociety. The conflict between capitalism and altruism has been undercuttingAmerica from her start and, today, has reached its climax.The American political system was based on a different moral principle: on theprinciple of man’s inalienable right to his own life—which means: on theprinciple that man has the right to exist for his own sake, neither sacrificinghimself to others nor sacrificing others to himself, and that men must deal withone another as traders, by voluntary choice to mutual benefit.But this moral principle was merely implied in the American political system: itwas not stated explicitly, it was not identified, it was not formulated into afull, philosophical code of ethics. This was the unfulfilled task which remainedas a deadly flaw in our culture and which is destroying America today.Capitalism is perishing for lack of a moral base and of a full philosophicaldefense.The social system based on and consonant with the altruist morality—with thecode of self-sacrifice—is socialism, in all or any of its variants: fascism,Nazism, communism. All of them treat man as a sacrificial animal to be immolatedfor the benefit of the group, the tribe, the society, the state. Soviet Russiais the ultimate result, the final product, the full, consistent embodiment ofthe altruist morality in practice; it represents the only way that that moralitycan ever be practiced.Not daring to challenge the morality of altruism, the “conservatives” have beenstruggling to evade the issue of morality or to bypass it. This has cost themtheir confidence, their courage, and their cause. Observe the guiltyevasiveness, the apologetic timidity, the peculiarly non-intellectual,non-philosophical attitude projected by most “conservatives” in their speechesand in their writings. No man, and no movement, can succeed without moralcertainty—without a full, rational conviction of the moral rightness of one’scause.Just as the “conservatives” feel guilty, uncertain, morally disarmed in fightingthe “liberals,” so the “liberals” feel guilty, uncertain, morally disarmed infighting the communists. When men share the same basic premise, it is the mostconsistent ones who win. So long as men accept the altruist morality, they willnot be able to stop the advance of communism. The altruist morality is SovietRussia’s best and only weapon.The hypocrisy of America’s position in international affairs, the evasiveness,the self-effacing timidity, the apologies for her wealth, her power, hersuccess, for all the greatest virtues of her system, the avoidance of anymention of “capitalism,” as if it were the skeleton in her closet—have done morefor the prestige of Soviet Russia and for the growing spread of communismthrough the world than the Russians’ own cheap, bombastic propaganda could everaccomplish. An attitude of moral guilt is not becoming to the leader of a worldcrusade and will not rouse men to follow us.And what do we ask men to fight for? They would join a crusade for freedomversus slavery, which means: for capitalism versus communism. But who will careto fight in a crusade for socialism versus communism? Who will want to fight anddie to defend a system under which he will have to do voluntarily—or rather, bypublic vote—what a dictator would accomplish faster and much more thoroughly:the sacrifice of everyone to everyone? Who will want to crusade againstmurder—for the privilege of committing suicide?In recent years, the “conservatives” have gradually come to a dim realization ofthe weakness in their position, of the philosophical flaw that had to becorrected. But the means by which they are attempting to correct it are worsethan the original weakness; the means are discrediting and destroying the lastremnants of their claim to intellectual leadership.There are three interrelated arguments used by today’s “conservatives” tojustify capitalism, which can best be designated as: the argument from faith—theargument from tradition—the argument from depravity.Sensing their need of a moral base, many “conservatives” decided to choosereligion as their moral justification; they claim that America and capitalismare based on faith in God. Politically, such a claim contradicts the fundamentalprinciples of the United States: in America, religion is a private matter whichcannot and must not be brought into political issues.Intellectually, to rest one’s case on faith means to concede that reason is onthe side of one’s enemies—that one has no rational arguments to offer. The“conservatives’ ” claim that their case rests on faith, means that there are norational arguments to support the American system, no rational justification forfreedom, justice, property, individual rights, that these rest on a mysticrevelation and can be accepted only on faith—that in reason and logic the enemyis right, but men must hold faith as superior to reason.Consider the implications of that theory. While the communists claim that theyare the representatives of reason and science, the “conservatives” concede itand retreat into the realm of mysticism, of faith, of the supernatural, intoanother world, surrendering this world to communism. It is the kind of victorythat the communists’ irrational ideology could never have won on its own merits.Observe the results. On the occasion of Khrushchev’s first visit to America, hedeclared, at a televised luncheon, that he had threatened to bury us because ithas been “scientifically” proved that communism is the system of the future,destined to rule the world. What did our spokesman answer? Mr. Henry Cabot Lodgeanswered that our system is based on faith in God. Prior to Khrushchev’sarrival, the “conservative” leaders—including senators and House members—wereissuing indignant protests against his visit, but the only action they suggestedto the American people, the only “practical” form of protest, was: prayer andthe holding of religious services for Khrushchev’s victims. To hear prayeroffered as their only weapon by the representatives of the most powerful countryon earth—a country allegedly dedicated to the fight for freedom—was enough todiscredit America and capitalism in anyone’s eyes, at home and abroad.Now consider the second argument: the attempt to justify capitalism on theground of tradition. Certain groups are trying to switch the word “conservative”into the exact opposite of its modern American usage, to switch it back to itsnineteenth-century meaning, and to put this over on the public. These groupsdeclare that to be a “conservative” means to uphold the status quo, the given,the established, regardless of what it might be, regardless of whether it isgood or bad, right or wrong, defensible or indefensible. They declare that wemust defend the American political system not because it is right, but becauseour ancestors chose it, not because it is good, but because it is old.America was created by men who broke with all political traditions and whooriginated a system unprecedented in history, relying on nothing but the“unaided” power of their own intellect. But the “neo-conservatives” are nowtrying to tell us that America was the product of “faith in revealed truths” andof uncritical respect for the traditions of the past (!).It is certainly irrational to use the “new” as a standard of value, to believethat an idea or a policy is good merely because it is new. But it is much morepreposterously irrational to use the “old” as a standard of value, to claim thatan idea or a policy is good merely because it is ancient. The “liberals” areconstantly asserting that they represent the future, that they are “new,”“progressive,” “forward-looking,” etc.—and they denounce the “conservatives” asold-fashioned representatives of a dead past. The “conservatives” concede it,and thus help the “liberals” to propagate one of today’s most grotesqueinversions: collectivism, the ancient, frozen, status society, is offered to usin the name of progress—while capitalism, the only free, dynamic, creativesociety ever devised, is defended in the name of stagnation.The plea to preserve “tradition” as such, can appeal only to those who havegiven up or to those who never intended to achieve anything in life. It is aplea that appeals to the worst elements in men and rejects the best: it appealsto fear, sloth, cowardice, conformity, self-doubt—and rejects creativeness,originality, courage, independence, self-reliance. It is an outrageous plea toaddress to human beings anywhere, but particularly outrageous here, in America,the country based on the principle that man must stand on his own feet, live byhis own judgment, and move constantly forward as a productive, creativeinnovator.The argument that we must respect “tradition” as such, respect it merely becauseit is a “tradition,” means that we must accept the values other men have chosen,merely because other men have chosen them—with the necessary implication of: whoare we to change them? The affront to a man’s self-esteem, in such an argument,and the profound contempt for man’s nature are obvious.This leads us to the third—and the worst—argument, used by some “conservatives”:the attempt to defend capitalism on the ground of man’s depravity.This argument runs as follows: since men are weak, fallible, non-omniscient andinnately depraved, no man may be entrusted with the responsibility of being adictator and of ruling everybody else; therefore, a free society is the properway of life for imperfect creatures. Please grasp fully the implications of thisargument: since men are depraved, they are not good enough for a dictatorship;freedom is all that they deserve; if they were perfect, they would be worthy ofa totalitarian state.Dictatorship—this theory asserts—believe it or not, is the result of faith inman and in man’s goodness; if people believed that man is depraved by nature,they would not entrust a dictator with power. This means that a belief in humandepravity protects human freedom—that it is wrong to enslave the depraved, butwould be right to enslave the virtuous. And more: dictatorships—this theorydeclares—and all the other disasters of the modern world are man’s punishmentfor the sin of relying on his intellect and of attempting to improve his life onearth by seeking to devise a perfect political system and to establish arational society. This means that humility, passivity, lethargic resignation anda belief in Original Sin are the bulwarks of capitalism. One could not gofarther than this in historical, political, and psychological ignorance orsubversion. This is truly the voice of the Dark Ages rising again—in the midstof our industrial civilization.The cynical, man-hating advocates of this theory sneer at all ideals, scoff atall human aspirations and deride all attempts to improve men’s existence. “Youcan’t change human nature,” is their stock answer to the socialists. Thus theyconcede that socialism is the ideal, but human nature is unworthy of it; afterwhich, they invite men to crusade for capitalism—a crusade one would have tostart by spitting in one’s own face. Who will fight and die to defend his statusas a miserable sinner? If, as a result of such theories, people becomecontemptuous of “conservatism,” do not wonder and do not ascribe it to thecleverness of the socialists.Such are capitalism’s alleged defenders—and such are the arguments by which theypropose to save it.It is obvious that with this sort of theoretical equipment and with an unbrokenrecord of defeats, concessions, compromises, and betrayals in practice, today’s“conservatives” are futile, impotent and, culturally, dead. They have nothing tooffer and can achieve nothing. They can only help to destroy intellectualstandards, to disintegrate thought, to discredit capitalism, and to acceleratethis country’s uncontested collapse into despair and dictatorship.But to those of you who do wish to contest it—particularly those of you who areyoung and are not ready to surrender—I want to give a warning: nothing is asdead as the stillborn. Nothing is as futile as a movement without goals, or acrusade without ideals, or a battle without ammunition. A bad argument is worsethan ineffectual: it lends credence to the arguments of your opponents. Ahalf-battle is worse than none: it does not end in mere defeat—it helps andhastens the victory of your enemies.At a time when the world is torn by a profound ideological conflict, do not jointhose who have no ideology—no ideas, no philosophy—to offer you. Do not go intobattle armed with nothing but stale slogans, pious platitudes, and meaninglessgeneralities. Do not join any so-called “conservative” group, organization, orperson that advocates any variant of the arguments from “faith,” from“tradition,” or from “depravity.” Any home-grown sophist in any village debatecan refute those arguments and can drive you into evasions in about fiveminutes. What would happen to you, with such ammunition, on the philosophicalbattlefield of the world? But you would never reach that battlefield: you wouldnot be heard on it, since you would have nothing to say.It is not by means of evasions that one saves civilization. It is not by meansof empty slogans that one saves a world perishing for lack of intellectualleadership. It is not by means of ignoring its causes that one cures a deadlydisease.So long as the “conservatives” ignore the issue of what destroyed capitalism,and merely plead with men to “go back,” they cannot escape the question of: backto what? And none of their evasions can camouflage the fact that the implicitanswer is: back to an earlier stage of the cancer which is devouring us todayand which has almost reached its terminal stage. That cancer is the morality ofaltruism.So long as the “conservatives” evade the issue of altruism, all of their pleasand arguments amount, in essence, to this: Why can’t we just go back to thenineteenth century when capitalism and altruism seemed somehow to co-exist? Whydo we have to go to extremes and think of surgery, when the early stages of thecancer were painless?The answer is that the facts of reality—which includes history andphilosophy—are not to be evaded. Capitalism was destroyed by the morality ofaltruism. Capitalism is based on individual rights—not on the sacrifice of theindividual to the “public good” of the collective. Capitalism and altruism areincompatible. It’s one or the other. It’s too late for compromises, forplatitudes, and for aspirin tablets. There is no way to save capitalism—orfreedom, or civilization, or America—except by intellectual surgery, that is: bydestroying the source of the destruction, by rejecting the morality of altruism.If you want to fight for capitalism, there is only one type of argument that youshould adopt, the only one that can ever win in a moral issue: the argument fromself-esteem. This means: the argument from man’s right to exist—from man’sinalienable individual right to his own life.I quote from my book For the New Intellectual:The world crisis of today is a moral crisis—and nothing less than a moralrevolution can resolve it: a moral revolution to sanction and complete thepolitical achievement of the American Revolution. . . . The New Intellectualmust fight for capitalism, not as a “practical” issue, not as an economic issue,but, with the most righteous pride, as a moral issue. That is what capitalismdeserves, and nothing less will save it.Capitalism is not the system of the past; it is the system of the future—ifmankind is to have a future. Those who wish to fight for it must discard thetitle of “conservatives.” “Conservatism” has always been a misleading name,inappropriate to America. Today, there is nothing left to “conserve”: theestablished political philosophy, the intellectual orthodoxy, and the status quoare collectivism. Those who reject all the basic premises of collectivism areradicals in the proper sense of the word: “radical” means “fundamental.” Today,the fighters for capitalism have to be, not bankrupt “conservatives,” but newradicals, new intellectuals and, above all, new, dedicated moralists."},{"pageContent":"20. THE NEW FASCISM: RULE BY CONSENSUSby Ayn Rand I shall begin by doing a very unpopular thing that does not fit today’sintellectual fashions and is, therefore, “anti-consensus”: I shall begin bydefining my terms, so that you will know what I am talking about.Let me give you the dictionary definitions of three political terms: socialism,fascism, and statism:Socialism—a theory or system of social organization which advocates the vestingof the ownership and control of the means of production, capital, land, etc. inthe community as a whole.Fascism—a governmental system with strong centralized power, permitting noopposition or criticism, controlling all affairs of the nation (industrial,commercial, etc.)Statism—the principle or policy of concentrating extensive economic, political,and related controls in the state at the cost of individual liberty.54[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-54]Based on a lecture given at The Ford Hall Forum, Boston, on April 18, 1965.Published in The Objectivist Newsletter, May and June 1965.It is obvious that “statism” is the wider, generic term, of which the other twoare specific variants. It is also obvious that statism is the dominant politicaltrend of our day. But which of those two variants represents the specificdirection of that trend?Observe that both “socialism” and “fascism” involve the issue of propertyrights. The right to property is the right of use and disposal. Observe thedifference in those two theories: socialism negates private property rightsaltogether, and advocates “the vesting of ownership and control ” in thecommunity as a whole, i.e., in the state; fascism leaves ownership in the handsof private individuals, but transfers control of the property to the government.Ownership without control is a contradiction in terms: it means “property,”without the right to use it or to dispose of it. It means that the citizensretain the responsibility of holding property, without any of its advantages,while the government acquires all the advantages without any of theresponsibility.In this respect, socialism is the more honest of the two theories. I say “morehonest,” not “better”—because, in practice, there is no difference between them:both come from the same collectivist-statist principle, both negate individualrights and subordinate the individual to the collective, both deliver thelivelihood and the lives of the citizens into the power of an omnipotentgovernment—and the differences between them are only a matter of time, degree,and superficial detail, such as the choice of slogans by which the rulers deludetheir enslaved subjects.Which of these two variants of statism are we moving toward: socialism orfascism?To answer this question, one must first ask: Which is the dominant ideologicaltrend of today’s culture?The disgraceful and terrifying answer is: there is no ideological trend today.There is no ideology. There are no political principles, theories, ideals, orphilosophy. There is no direction, no goal, no compass, no vision of the future,no intellectual element of leadership. Are there any emotional elementsdominating today’s culture? Yes. One. Fear.A country without a political philosophy is like a ship drifting at random inmid-ocean, at the mercy of any chance wind, wave, or current, a ship whosepassengers huddle in their cabins and cry: “Don’t rock the boat!”—for fear ofdiscovering that the captain’s bridge is empty.It is obvious that a boat which cannot stand rocking is doomed already and thatit had better be rocked hard, if it is to regain its course—but this realizationpresupposes a grasp of facts, of reality, of principles and a long-range view,all of which are precisely the things that the “non-rockers” are franticallystruggling to evade.Just as a neurotic believes that the facts of reality will vanish if he refusesto recognize them—so, today, the neurosis of an entire culture leads men tobelieve that their desperate need of political principles and concepts willvanish if they succeed in obliterating all principles and concepts. But since,in fact, neither an individual nor a nation can exist without some form ofideology, this sort of anti-ideology is now the formal, explicit, dominantideology of our bankrupt culture.This anti-ideology has a new and very ugly name: it is called “Government byConsensus.”If some demagogue were to offer us, as a guiding creed, the following tenets:that statistics should be substituted for truth, vote-counting for principles,numbers for rights, and public polls for morality—that pragmatic,range-of-the-moment expediency should be the criterion of a country’s interests,and that the number of its adherents should be the criterion of an idea’s truthor falsehood—that any desire of any nature whatsoever should be accepted as avalid claim, provided it is held by a sufficient number of people—that amajority may do anything it pleases to a minority—in short, gang rule and mobrule—if a demagogue were to offer it, he would not get very far. Yet all of itis contained in—and camouflaged by—the notion of “Government by Consensus.”This notion is now being plugged, not as an ideology, but as an anti-ideology;not as a principle, but as a means of obliterating principles; not as reason,but as rationalization, as a verbal ritual or a magic formula to assuage thenational anxiety neurosis—a kind of pep pill or goof-ball for the“non-boat-rockers,” and a chance to play it deuces wild, for the others.It is only today’s lethargic contempt for the pronouncements of our politicaland intellectual leaders that blinds people to the meaning, implications, andconsequences of the notion of “Government by Consensus.” You have all heard itand, I suspect, dismissed it as politicians’ oratory, giving no thought to itsactual meaning. But that is what I urge you to consider.A significant clue to that meaning was given in an article by Tom Wicker in TheNew York Times (October 11, 1964). Referring to “what Nelson Rockefeller used tocall ‘the mainstream of American thought,’ ” Mr. Wicker writes:That mainstream is what political theorists have been projecting for years as“the national consensus”—what Walter Lippmann has aptly called “the vitalcenter.” . . . Political moderation, almost by definition, is at the heart ofthe consensus. That is, the consensus generally sprawls over all acceptablepolitical views—all ideas that are not totally repugnant to and do not directlythreaten some major segment of the population. Therefore, acceptable ideas musttake the views of others into account and that is what is meant by moderation.Now let us identify what this means. “The consensus generally sprawls over allacceptable political views . . .” Acceptable—to whom? To the consensus. Andsince the government is to be ruled by the consensus, this means that politicalviews are to be divided into those which are “acceptable” and those which are“unacceptable” to the government. What would be the criterion of“acceptability”? Mr. Wicker supplies it. Observe that the criterion is notintellectual, not a question of whether certain views are true or false; thecriterion is not moral, not a question of whether the views are right or wrong;the criterion is emotional: whether the views are or are not “repugnant.” Towhom? “To some major segment of the population.” There is also the additionalproviso that those views must not “directly threaten” that major segment.What about the minor segments of the population? Are the views that threatenthem “acceptable”? What about the smallest segment: the individual? Obviously,the individual and the minority groups are not to be considered; no matter howrepugnant an idea may be to a man and no matter how gravely it may threaten hislife, his work, his future, he is to be ignored or sacrificed by the omnipotentconsensus and its government—unless he has a gang, a sizable gang, to supporthim.What exactly is a “direct threat” to any part of the population? In a mixedeconomy, every government action is a direct threat to some men and an indirectthreat to all. Every government interference in the economy consists of givingan unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. Bywhat criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size ofthe victim’s gang.Now note Mr. Wicker’s last sentence: “Therefore, acceptable ideas must take theviews of others into account and that is what is meant by moderation.” And justwhat is meant here by “the views of others”? Of which others? Since it is notthe views of individuals nor of minorities, the only discernible meaning is thatevery “major segment” must take into account the views of all the other “majorsegments.” But suppose that a group of socialists wants to nationalize allfactories, and a group of industrialists wants to keep its properties? Whatwould it mean, for either group, to “take into account” the views of the other?And what would “moderation” consist of, in such a case? What would constitute“moderation” in a conflict between a group of men who want to be supported atpublic expense—and a group of taxpayers who have other uses for their money?What would constitute “moderation” in a conflict between the member of a smallergroup, such as a Negro in the South, who believes that he has an inalienableright to a fair trial—and the larger group of Southern racists who believe thatthe “public good” of their community permits them to lynch him? What wouldconstitute “moderation” in a conflict between me and a communist (or between ourrespective followers), when my views are that I have an inalienable right to mylife, liberty, and happiness—and his views are that the “public good” of thestate permits him to rob, enslave, or murder me?There can be no meeting ground, no middle, no compromise between oppositeprinciples. There can be no such thing as “moderation” in the realm of reasonand of morality. But reason and morality are precisely the two conceptsabrogated by the notion of “Government by Consensus.”The advocates of that notion would declare at this point that any idea whichpermits no compromise constitutes “extremism”—that any form of “extremism,” anyuncompromising stand, is evil—that the consensus “sprawls” only over those ideaswhich are amenable to “moderation”—and that “moderation” is the supreme virtue,superseding reason and morality.This is the clue to the core, essence, motive, and real meaning of the doctrineof “Government by Consensus”: the cult of compromise. Compromise is thepre-condition, the necessity, the imperative of a mixed economy. The “consensus”doctrine is an attempt to translate the brute facts of a mixed economy into anideological—or anti-ideological—-system and to provide them with a semblance ofjustification.A mixed economy is a mixture of freedom and controls—with no principles, rules,or theories to define either. Since the introduction of controls necessitatesand leads to further controls, it is an unstable, explosive mixture which,ultimately, has to repeal the controls or collapse into dictatorship. A mixedeconomy has no principles to define its policies, its goals, its laws—noprinciples to limit the power of its government. The only principle of a mixedeconomy—which, necessarily, has to remain unnamed and unacknowledged—is that noone’s interests are safe, everyone’s interests are on a public auction block,and anything goes for anyone who can get away with it. Such a system—or, moreprecisely, anti-system—breaks up a country into an ever-growing number of enemycamps, into economic groups fighting one another for self-preservation in anindeterminate mixture of defense and offense, as the nature of such a jungledemands. While, politically, a mixed economy preserves the semblance of anorganized society with a semblance of law and order, economically it is theequivalent of the chaos that had ruled China for centuries: a chaos of robbergangs looting—and draining—the productive elements of the country.A mixed economy is rule by pressure groups. It is an amoral, institutionalizedcivil war of special interests and lobbies, all fighting to seize a momentarycontrol of the legislative machinery, to extort some special privilege at oneanother’s expense by an act of government—i.e., by force. In the absence ofindividual rights, in the absence of any moral or legal principles, a mixedeconomy’s only hope to preserve its precarious semblance of order, to restrainthe savage, desperately rapacious groups it itself has created, and to preventthe legalized plunder from running over into plain, unlegalized looting of allby all—is compromise; compromise on everything and in every realm—material,spiritual, intellectual—so that no group would step over the line by demandingtoo much and topple the whole rotted structure. If the game is to continue,nothing can be permitted to remain firm, solid, absolute, untouchable;everything (and everyone) has to be fluid, flexible, indeterminate, approximate.By what standard are anyone’s actions to be guided? By the expediency of anyimmediate moment.The only danger, to a mixed economy, is any not-to-be-compromised value, virtue,or idea. The only threat is any uncompromising person, group, or movement. Theonly enemy is integrity.It is unnecessary to point out who will be the steady winners and who theconstant losers in a game of that kind.It is also clear what sort of unity (of consensus) that game requires: the unityof a tacit agreement that anything goes, anything is for sale (or for“negotiation”), and the rest is up to the free-for-all of pressuring, lobbying,manipulating, favor-swapping, public-relation’ing, give-and-taking,double-crossing, begging, bribing, betraying—and chance, the blind chance of awar in which the prize is the privilege of using legal armed force againstlegally disarmed victims.Observe that this type of prize establishes one basic interest held in common byall the players: the desire to have a strong government—a government ofunlimited power, strong enough to let the winners and would-be winners get awaywith whatever they’re seeking; a government uncommitted to any policy,unrestrained by any ideology, a government that hoards an ever-growing power,power for power’s sake—which means: for the sake and use of any “major” gang whomight seize it momentarily to ram their particular piece of legislation down thecountry’s throat. Observe, therefore, that the doctrine of “compromise” and“moderation” applies to everything except one issue: any suggestion to limit thepower of the government.Observe the torrents of vilification, abuse, and hysterical hatred unleashed bythe “moderates” against any advocate of freedom, i.e., of capitalism. Observethat such designations as “extreme middle” or “militant middle” are being usedby people seriously and self-righteously. Observe the inordinately viciousintensity of the smear-campaign against Senator Goldwater, which had theovertones of panic: the panic of the “moderates,” the “vital-centrists,” the“middle-of-the-roaders” in the face of the possibility that a real,pro-capitalism movement might put an end to their game. A movement,incidentally, which does not exist, as yet, since Senator Goldwater was not anadvocate of capitalism—and since his meaningless, unphilosophical,unintellectual campaign has contributed to the entrenchment of theconsensus-advocates. But what is significant here is the nature of their panic:it gave us a glimpse of their vaunted “moderation,” their “democratic” respectfor the people’s choices and their tolerance of disagreements or opposition.In a letter to The New York Times (June 23, 1964), an assistant professor ofpolitical science, fearing Goldwater’s nomination, wrote as follows:The real danger lies in the divisive campaign which his nomination wouldprovoke. . . . The result of a Goldwater candidacy would be a divided andembittered electorate. . . . To be effective, American government requires ahigh degree of consensus and bipartisanship on basic issues. . . .When and by whom has statism been accepted as the basic principle of America—andas a principle which should now be placed beyond debate or dissension, so thatno basic issues are to be raised any longer? Isn’t that the formula of aone-party government? The professor did not specify.Another letter-writer in The New York Times (June 24, 1964), identified in printas a “Liberal Democrat,” went a little farther.Let the American people choose in November. If they choose overwhelmingly forLyndon Johnson and the Democrats, then once and for all the Federal Governmentcan get on, with no excuses, with the job millions of Negroes, unemployed, aged,sick and otherwise handicapped persons expect it to do—to say nothing of ouroverseas commitments.If the people choose Goldwater, then it would seem the nation was hardly worthsaving after all.Woodrow Wilson once said that there is such a thing as being too proud to fight;then he had to go to war. Once and for all let us have it out, while the battleyet can be fought with ballots instead of bullets.Does this gentleman mean that if we don’t vote his way, he will resort tobullets? Your guess is as good as mine.The New York Times, which had been a conspicuous advocate of “Government byConsensus,” said some curious things in its comment on President Johnson’svictory. Its editorial of November 8, 1964, stated:No matter how massive the electoral victory—and it was massive—theAdministration cannot merely ride the crest of the popular wave rolling along ona sea of platitudinous generalizations and euphoric promises . . . now that ithas a broad popular mandate, it has the moral as well as the politicalobligation not to try to be all things to all men but to settle down to a hard,concrete, purposeful course of action.What kind of purposeful action? If the voters were offered nothing but“platitudinous generalizations and euphoric promises,” how can their vote betaken as a “broad popular mandate”? A mandate for an unnamed purpose? Apolitical blank check? And if Mr. Johnson did win a massive victory by trying“to be all things to all men,” then which things is he now expected to be, whichvoters is he to disappoint or betray—and what becomes of the broad popularconsensus?Morally and philosophically, that editorial is highly dubious and contradictory.But it becomes clear and consistent in the context of a mixed economy’santi-ideology. The president of a mixed economy is not expected to have aspecific program or policy. A blank check on power is all that he asks thevoters to give him. Thereafter, it’s up to the pressure-group game, whicheverybody is supposed to understand and endorse, but never mention. Which thingshe will be to which men depends on the chances of the game—and on the “majorsegments of the population.” His job is only to hold the power—and to dispensethe favors.In the 1930’s, the “liberals” had a program of broad social reforms and acrusading spirit, they advocated a planned society, they talked in terms ofabstract principles, they propounded theories of a predominantly socialisticnature—and most of them were touchy about the accusation that they wereenlarging the government’s power; most of them were assuring their opponentsthat government power was only a temporary means to an end—a “noble end,” theliberation of the individual from his bondage to material needs.Today, nobody talks of a planned society in the “liberal” camp; long-rangeprograms, theories, principles, abstractions, and “noble ends” are notfashionable any longer. Modern “liberals” deride any political concern with suchlarge-scale matters as an entire society or an economy as a whole; they concernthemselves with single, concrete-bound, range-of-the-moment projects anddemands, without regard to cost, context, or consequences. “Pragmatic”—not“idealistic”—is their favorite adjective when they are called upon to justifytheir “stance,” as they call it, not “stand.” They are militantly opposed topolitical philosophy; they denounce political concepts as “tags,” “labels,”“myths,” “illusions”—and resist any attempt to “label”—i.e., to identify—theirown views. They are belligerently anti-theoretical and—with a faded mantle ofintellectuality still clinging to their shoulders—they are anti-intellectual.The only remnant of their former “idealism” is a tired, cynical, ritualisticquoting of shopworn “humanitarian” slogans, when the occasion demands it.Cynicism, uncertainty, and fear are the insignia of the culture which they arestill dominating by default. And the only thing that has not rusted in theirideological equipment, but has grown savagely brighter and clearer through theyears, is their lust for power—for an autocratic, statist, totalitariangovernment power. It is not a crusading brightness, it is not the lust of afanatic with a mission—it is more like the glassy-eyed brightness of asomnambulist whose stuporous despair has long since swallowed the memory of hispurpose, but who still clings to his mystic weapon in the stubborn belief that“there ought to be a law,” that everything will be all right if only somebodywill pass a law, that every problem can be solved by the magic power of bruteforce. . . .Such is the present intellectual state and ideological trend of our culture.Now I shall ask you to consider the question I raised at the beginning of thisdiscussion: Which of these two variants of statism are we moving toward:socialism or fascism?Let me submit in evidence, as part of the answer, a quotation from an editorialthat appeared in the Washington Star (October 1964). It is an eloquent mixtureof truth and misinformation, and a typical example of the state of today’spolitical knowledge:Socialism is quite simply the state ownership of the means of production. Thishas never been proposed by a major party candidate for the Presidency and is notnow proposed by Lyndon Johnson. [True.]There is, however, a whole series of American legislative acts that increaseeither government regulation of private business or government responsibilityfor individual welfare. [True.] It is to such legislation that warning cries of“socialism!” refer.Besides the Constitutional provision for Federal regulation of interstatecommerce, such “intrusion” of government into the market-place begins with theantitrust laws. [Very true.] To them we owe the continued existence ofcompetitive capitalism and the non-arrival of cartel capitalism. [Untrue.]Inasmuch as socialism is the product, one way or another, of cartel capitalism[untrue], it may reasonably be said that such government interference withbusiness has in fact prevented socialism. [Worse than untrue.]As to welfare legislation, it is still light years away from the “cradle tograve” security sponsored by contemporary socialism. [Not quite true.] It seemsmuch more like ordinary human concern for human distress than like anideological program of any kind. [The last part of this sentence is true: it isnot an ideological program. As to the first part, ordinary human concern forhuman distress does not manifest itself ordinarily in the form of a gun aimed atthe wallets and earnings of one’s neighbors.]This editorial did not mention, of course, that a system in which the governmentdoes not nationalize the means of production, but assumes total control over theeconomy is fascism.It is true that the welfare-statists are not socialists, that they neveradvocated or intended the socialization of private property, that they want to“preserve” private property—with government control of its use and disposal. Butthat is the fundamental characteristic of fascism.Here is another piece of evidence. This one is less crudely naive than the firstand much more insidiously wrong. This is from a letter to The New York Times(November 1, 1964), written by an assistant professor of economics:Viewed by almost every yardstick, the United States today is more committed toprivate enterprise than probably any other industrial country and is not evenremotely approaching a socialist system. As the term is understood by studentsof comparative economic systems and others who do not use it loosely, socialismis identified with extensive nationalization, a dominant public sector, a strongcooperative movement, egalitarian income distribution, a total welfare state andcentral planning.In the United States not only has there been no nationalization, but Governmentconcerns have been turned over to private enterprise. . . .Income distribution in this country is one of the most unequal among thedeveloped nations, and tax cuts and tax loopholes have blunted the moderateprogressivity of our tax structure. Thirty years after the New Deal, the UnitedStates has a very limited welfare state, compared with the comprehensive socialsecurity and public housing schemes in many European countries.By no stretch of the imagination is the real issue in this campaign a choicebetween capitalism and socialism or between a free and a planned economy. Theissue is about two differing concepts of the role of government within theframework of an essentially private enterprise system.The role of government in a private enterprise system is that of a policeman whoprotects man’s individual rights (including property rights) by protecting menfrom physical force; in a free economy, the government does not control,regulate, coerce, or interfere with men’s economic activities.I do not know the political views of the writer of that letter; he may be a“liberal” or he may be an alleged defender of capitalism. But if he is thislast, then I must point out that such views as his—which are shared by many“conservatives”—are more damaging and derogatory to capitalism than the ideas ofits avowed enemies.Such “conservatives” regard capitalism as a system compatible with governmentcontrols, and thus help to spread the most dangerous misconceptions. While full,laissez-faire capitalism has not yet existed anywhere, while some (unnecessary)government controls were allowed to dilute and undercut the original Americansystem (more through error than through theoretical intention)—such controlswere minor impediments, the mixed economies of the nineteenth century werepredominantly free, and it is this unprecedented freedom that brought aboutmankind’s unprecedented progress. The principles, the theory, and the actualpractice of capitalism rest on a free, unregulated market, as the history of thelast two centuries has amply demonstrated. No defender of capitalism can permithimself to ignore the exact meaning of the term “laissez-faire”—and of the term“mixed economy,” which clearly indicates the two opposite elements involved inthe mixture: the element of economic freedom, which is capitalism, and theelement of government controls, which is statism.An insistent campaign has been going on for years to make us accept the Marxistview that all governments are tools of economic class interests and thatcapitalism is not a free economy, but a system of government controls servingsome privileged class. The purpose of that campaign is to distort economics,rewrite history, and obliterate the existence and the possibility of a freecountry and an uncontrolled economy. Since a system of nominal private propertyruled by government controls is not capitalism, but fascism, the only choicethis obliteration would leave us is the choice between fascism and socialism (orcommunism)—which all the statists in the world, of all varieties, degrees, anddenominations, are struggling frantically to make us believe. (The destructionof freedom is their common goal, after which they hope to fight one another forpower.)It is thus that the views of that professor and of many “conservatives” lendcredence and support to the vicious leftist propaganda which equates capitalismwith fascism.But there is a bitter kind of justice in the logic of events. That propaganda ishaving an effect which may be advantageous to the communists, but which is theopposite of the effect intended by the “liberals,” the welfare-statists, thesocialists, who share the guilt of spreading it: instead of smearing capitalism,that propaganda has succeeded in whitewashing and disguising fascism.In this country, few people care to advocate, to defend, or even to understandcapitalism; yet fewer still wish to give up its advantages. So if they are toldthat capitalism is compatible with controls, with the particular controls whichfurther their particular interests—be it government handouts, or minimum wages,or price-supports, or subsidies, or antitrust laws, or censorship of dirtymovies—they will go along with such programs, in the comforting belief that theresults will be nothing worse than a “modified” capitalism. And thus a countrywhich does abhor fascism is moving by imperceptible degrees—through ignorance,confusion, evasion, moral cowardice, and intellectual default—not towardsocialism or any mawkish altruistic ideal, but toward a plain, brutal,predatory, power-grubbing, de facto fascism.No, we have not reached that stage. But we are certainly not “an essentiallyprivate enterprise system” any longer. At present, we are a disintegrating,unsound, precariously unstable mixed economy—a random, mongrel mixture ofsocialistic schemes, communistic influences, fascist controls, and shrinkingremnants of capitalism still paying the costs of it all—the total of it rollingin the direction of a fascist state.Consider our present Administration. I don’t think I’ll be accused of unfairnessif I say that President Johnson is not a philosophical thinker. No, he is not afascist, he is not a socialist, he is not a pro-capitalist. Ideologically, he isnot anything in particular. Judging by his past record and by the consensus ofhis own supporters, the concept of an ideology is not applicable in his case. Heis a politician—a very dangerous, yet very appropriate phenomenon in our presentstate. He is an almost fiction-like, archetypical embodiment of the perfectleader of a mixed economy: a man who enjoys power for power’s sake, who isexpert at the game of manipulating pressure groups, of playing them all againstone another, who loves the process of dispensing smiles, frowns, and favors,particularly sudden favors, and whose vision does not extend beyond the range ofthe next election.Neither President Johnson nor any of today’s prominent groups would advocate thesocialization of industry. Like his modern predecessors in office, Mr. Johnsonknows that businessmen are the milch-cows of a mixed economy, and he does notwant to destroy them, he wants them to prosper and to feed his welfare projects(which the next election requires), while they, the businessmen, are eating outof his hand, as they seem to be anxiously eager to do. The business lobby iscertain to get its fair share of influence and of recognition—just like thelabor lobby or the farm lobby or the lobby of any “major segment”—on his ownterms. He will be particularly adept at the task of creating and encouraging thetype of businessmen whom I call “the aristocracy of pull.” This is not asocialistic pattern; it is the typical pattern of fascism.The political, intellectual, and moral meaning of Mr. Johnson’s policy towardbusinessmen was summed up eloquently in an article in The New York Times ofJanuary 4, 1965:Mr. Johnson is an out-and-out Keynesian in his assiduous wooing of the businesscommunity. Unlike President Roosevelt, who delighted in attacking businessmenuntil World War II forced him into a reluctant truce, and President Kennedy, whoalso incurred business hostility, President Johnson has worked long and hard toget businessmen to join ranks in a national consensus for his programs.This campaign may perturb many Keynesians, but it is pure Keynes. Indeed, LordKeynes, who once was regarded as a dangerous and Machiavellian figure byAmerican businessmen, made specific suggestions for improving relations betweenthe President and the business community.He set down his views in 1938 in a letter to President Roosevelt, who wasrunning into renewed criticism from businessmen following the recession thattook place the previous year. Lord Keynes, who always sought to transformcapitalism in order to save it, recognized the importance of business confidenceand tried to convince Mr. Roosevelt to repair the damage that had been done.He advised the President that businessmen were not politicians and did notrespond to the same treatment. They are, he wrote “much milder than politicians,at the same time allured and terrified by the glare of publicity, easilypersuaded to be ‘patriots,’ perplexed, bemused, indeed terrified, yet only tooanxious to take a cheerful view, vain perhaps but very unsure of themselves,pathetically responsive to a kind word. . . .”He was confident that Mr. Roosevelt could tame them and make them do hisbidding, provided he followed some simple Keynesian rules.“You could do anything you liked with them,” the letter continued, “if you wouldtreat them (even the big ones), not as wolves and tigers, but as domesticanimals by nature, even though they have been badly brought up and not trainedas you would wish.”President Roosevelt ignored his advice. So, apparently, did President Kennedy.But President Johnson seems to have got the message. . . . By kind words andfrequent pats on the head, he had had the business community eating out of hishand.Mr. Johnson appears to agree with Lord Keynes’s view that there is little to begained by carrying on a feud with businessmen. As he put it, “If you work theminto the surly, obstinate, terrified mood of which domestic animals, wronglyhandled, are capable, the nation’s burden will not get carried to market; and inthe end, public opinion will veer their way.”The view of businessmen as “domestic animals” who carry “the nation’s burden”and who must be “trained” by the President “to do his bidding” is certainly nota view compatible with capitalism. It is not a view applicable to socialism,since there are no businessmen in a socialist state. It is a view that expressesthe economic essence of fascism, of the relationship between business andgovernment in a fascist state.No matter what the verbal camouflage, such is the actual meaning of any variantof “transformed” (or “modified” or “modernized” or “humanized”) capitalism. Inall such doctrines, the “humanization” consists of turning some members ofsociety (the most productive ones) into beasts of burden.The formula by which the sacrificial animals are to be fooled and tamed is beingrepeated today with growing insistence and frequency: businessmen, it is said,must regard the government, not as an enemy, but as a “partner.” The notion of a“partnership” between a private group and public officials, between business andgovernment, between production and force, is a linguistic corruption (an“anti-concept”) typical of a fascist ideology—an ideology that regards force asthe basic element and ultimate arbiter in all human relationships.“Partnership” is an indecent euphemism for “government control.” There can be nopartnership between armed bureaucrats and defenseless private citizens who haveno choice but to obey. What chance would you have against a “partner” whosearbitrary word is law, who may give you a hearing (if your pressure group is bigenough), but who will play favorites and bargain your interests away, who willalways have the last word and the legal “right” to enforce it on you at thepoint of a gun, holding your property, your work, your future, your life in hispower? Is that the meaning of “partnership”?55[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-55]But there are men who may find such a prospect attractive; they exist amongbusinessmen as among every other group or profession: the men who dread thecompetition of a free market and would welcome an armed “partner” to extortspecial advantages over their abler competitors; men who seek to rise, not bymerit but by pull, men who are willing and eager to live not by right, but byfavor. Among businessmen, this type of mentality was responsible for the passageof the antitrust laws and is still supporting them today.A substantial number of Republican businessmen switched to the side of Mr.Johnson in the last election. Here are some interesting observations on thissubject, from a survey by The New York Times (September 16, 1964):Interviews in five cities in the industrial Northeast and Midwest disclosestriking differences in political outlook between officials of largecorporations and men who operate smaller businesses. . . . The businessexecutives who expect to cast the first Democratic Presidential vote of theirlives are nearly all affiliated with large companies. . . . There is moresupport for President Johnson among business executives who are in their 40’sand 50’s than there is among either older or younger businessmen. . . . Manybusinessmen in their 40’s and 50’s say they find relatively little shiftingtoward support of Mr. Johnson on the part of younger business executives.Interviews with those in their 30’s confirm this. . . . The younger executivesthemselves speak with pride of their generation as the one that interrupted andreversed the trend toward more liberalism in younger persons. . . . It is on theissue of Government deficits that the division of opinion between small andlarge businessmen emerges most dramatically. Officials of giant corporationshave a far greater tendency to accept the idea that budget deficits aresometimes necessary and even desirable. The typical small businessman, however,reserves a very special scorn for deficit spending. . . .This gives us an indication of who are the vested interests in a mixedeconomy—and what such an economy does to the beginners or the young.An essential aspect of the socialistically inclined mentality is the desire toobliterate the difference between the earned and the unearned, and, therefore,to permit no differentiation between such businessmen as Hank Rearden and OrrenBoyle. To a concrete-bound, range-of-the-moment, primitive socialist mentality—amentality that clamors for a “redistribution of wealth” without any concern forthe origin of wealth—the enemy is all those who are rich, regardless of thesource of their riches. Such mentalities, those aging, graying “liberals,” whohad been the “idealists” of the 30’s, are clinging desperately to the illusionthat we are moving toward some sort of socialist state inimical to the rich andbeneficial to the poor—while frantically evading the spectacle of what kind ofrich are being destroyed and what kind are flourishing under the system they,the “liberals,” have established. The grim joke is on them: their alleged“ideals” have paved the way, not toward socialism, but toward fascism. Thecollector of their efforts is not the helplessly, brainlessly virtuous “littleman” of their flat-footed imagination and shopworn fiction, but the worst typeof predatory rich, the rich-by-force, the rich-by-political-privilege, the typewho has no chance under capitalism, but who is always there to cash in on everycollectivist “noble experiment.”It is the creators of wealth, the Hank Reardens, who are destroyed under anyform of statism—socialist, communist, or fascist; it is the parasites, the OrrenBoyles, who are the privileged “elite” and the profiteers of statism,particularly of fascism. (The special profiteers of socialism are the JamesTaggarts; of communism—the Floyd Ferrises.) The same is true of theirpsychological counterparts among the poor and among the men of all the economiclevels in-between.The particular form of economic organization, which is becoming more and moreapparent in this country, as an outgrowth of the power of pressure groups, isone of the worst variants of statism: guild socialism. Guild socialism robs thetalented young of their future—by freezing men into professional castes underrigid rules. It represents an open embodiment of the basic motive of moststatists, though they usually prefer not to confess it: the entrenchment andprotection of mediocrity from abler competitors, the shackling of the men ofsuperior ability down to the mean average of their professions. That theory isnot too popular among socialists (though it has its advocates)—but the mostfamous instance of its large-scale practice was Fascist Italy. In the 1930’s, a few perceptive men said that Roosevelt’s New Deal was a form ofguild socialism and that it was closer to Mussolini’s system than to any other.They were ignored. Today, the evidence is unmistakable.It was also said that if fascism ever came to the United States, it would comedisguised as socialism. In this connection, I recommend that you read or re-readSinclair Lewis’ It Can’t Happen Here—with special reference to the character,style, and ideology of Berzelius Windrip, the fascist leader.Now let me mention, and answer, some of the standard objections by which today’s“liberals” attempt to camouflage (to differentiate from fascism) the nature ofthe system they are supporting.“Fascism requires one-party rule.” What will the notion of “Government byConsensus” amount to in practice?“Fascism’s goal is the conquest of the world.” What is the goal of thoseglobal-minded, bipartisan champions of the United Nations? And, if they reachit, what positions do they expect to acquire in the power-structure of “OneWorld”?“Fascism preaches racism.” Not necessarily. Hitler’s Germany did; Mussolini’sItaly did not.“Fascism is opposed to the welfare state.” Check your premises and your historybooks. The father and originator of the welfare state, the man who put intopractice the notion of buying the loyalty of some groups with money extortedfrom others, was Bismarck—the political ancestor of Hitler. Let me remind youthat the full title of the Nazi Party was: the National Socialist Workers Partyof Germany.Let me remind you also of some excerpts from the political program of thatparty, adopted in Munich, on February 24, 1920:We ask that the government undertake the obligation above all of providingcitizens with adequate opportunity for employment and earning a living.The activities of the individual must not be allowed to clash with the interestsof the community, but must take place within its confines and be for the good ofall. Therefore, we demand: . . . an end to the power of the financial interests.We demand profit sharing in big business.We demand a broad extension of care for the aged.We demand . . . the greatest possible consideration of small business in thepurchases of the national, state, and municipal governments.In order to make possible to every capable and industrious [citizen] theattainment of higher education and thus the achievement of a post of leadership,the government must provide an all-around enlargement of our entire system ofpublic education. . . . We demand the education at government expense of giftedchildren of poor parents. . . .The government must undertake the improvement of public health—by protectingmother and child, by prohibiting child labor . . . by the greatest possiblesupport for all clubs concerned with the physical education of youth.[We] combat the . . . materialistic spirit within and without us, and areconvinced that a permanent recovery of our people can only proceed from withinon the foundation of The Common Good Before the Individual Good.56[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-56]There is, however, one difference between the type of fascism toward which weare drifting, and the type that ravaged European countries: ours is not amilitant kind of fascism, not an organized movement of shrill demagogues, bloodythugs, hysterical third-rate intellectuals, and juvenile delinquents—ours is atired, worn, cynical fascism, fascism by default, not like a flaming disaster,but more like the quiet collapse of a lethargic body slowly eaten by internalcorruption.Did it have to happen? No. Can it still be averted? Yes.If you doubt the power of philosophy to set the course and shape the destiny ofhuman societies, observe that our mixed economy is the literal, faithfullycarried-out product of Pragmatism—and of the generation brought up under itsinfluence. Pragmatism is the philosophy which holds that there is no objectivereality or permanent truth, that there are no absolute principles, no validabstractions, no firm concepts, that anything may be tried by rule-of-thumb,that objectivity consists of collective subjectivism, that whatever people wishto be true, is true, whatever people wish to exist, does exist—provided aconsensus says so.If you want to avert the final disaster, it is this type of thinking—every oneof those propositions and all of them—that you must face, grasp, and reject.Then you will have grasped the connection of philosophy to politics and to thedaily events of your life. Then you will have learned that no society is betterthan its philosophical foundation. And then—to paraphrase John Galt—you will beready, not to return to capitalism, but to discover it."},{"pageContent":"21. THE WRECKAGE OF THE CONSENSUSby Ayn Rand Two years ago, on April 18, 1965, I spoke at this Forum on the subject of “TheNew Fascism: Rule by Consensus.” I said: “The clue to the core, essence, motive,and real meaning of the doctrine of ‘Government by Consensus’ [is] the cult ofcompromise. Compromise is the precondition, the necessity, the imperative of amixed economy. The ‘consensus’ doctrine is an attempt to translate the brutefacts of a mixed economy into an ideological—or anti-ideological—system and toprovide them with a semblance of justification.” The brute facts of a mixedeconomy are gang-rule, i.e., a scramble for power by various pressuregroups—without any moral or political principles, without any program,direction, purpose, or long-range goal—with the tacit belief in rule by force,as their only common denominator, and, unless the trend is changed, a fasciststate as the ultimate result.In September of 1965, writing in The Objectivist Newsletter, I said: “Contraryto the fanatical belief of its advocates, compromise does not satisfy, butdissatisfies everyone; it does not lead to general fulfillment, but to generalfrustration; those who try to be all things to all men end up by not beinganything to anyone.”Lecture given at The Ford Hall Forum, Boston, on April 16, 1967. Published inThe Objectivist, April and May, 1967.It is startling to observe how rapidly this principle took effect—in an age thattakes no cognizance of principles.Where is President Johnson’s consensus today? And where, politically, isPresident Johnson? To descend—in two years, in an era of seeming prosperity,without the push of any obvious national disaster—to descend from the height ofa popular landslide to the status of a liability to his own party in theelections of 1966, is a feat that should give pause to anyone concerned withmodern politics.If there were any way to make compromise work, President Johnson is the man whowould have done it. He was an expert at the game of manipulating pressuregroups—a game that consists of making promises and friends, and keeping thesecond, but not the first. His skill as a manipulator was the one characteristicthat his “public-image builders” were selling us at the height of hispopularity. If he could not make it, no amateur can.The practical efficacy of compromise is the first premise that Johnson’s historyshould prompt people to check. And, I believe, a great many people are checkingit. People, but not Republicans—or, at least, not all of them. Not those who arenow pushing an unformed, soft-shelled thing like Romney to succeed where a prohas failed.What are we left with, now that the consensus has collapsed? Nothing but theopen spectacle of a mixed economy’s intellectual and moral bankruptcy, therandom wreckage of its naked mechanism, with the screeching of its gears as theonly sound in our public silence—the sound of crude, range-of-the-moment demandsby pressure groups who have abandoned even the pretense at any political idealsor moral justification.The consensus-doctrine was a disguise, a shoddy, cheesecloth one, but still adisguise to give a semblance of theoretical status to the practice of plain gangwarfare. Today, even the cheesecloth is gone, leaving the anti-ideology tofunction in the open, more brazenly than ever.A political ideology is a set of principles aimed at establishing or maintaininga certain social system; it is a program of long-range action, with theprinciples serving to unify and integrate particular steps into a consistentcourse. It is only by means of principles that men can project the future andchoose their actions accordingly.Anti-ideology consists of the attempts to shrink men’s minds down to the rangeof the immediate moment, without regard to past or future, without context ormemory—above all, without memory, so that contradictions cannot be detected, anderrors or disasters can be blamed on the victims.In anti-ideological practice, principles are used implicitly and are relied uponto disarm the opposition, but are never acknowledged, and are switched at will,when it suits the purpose of the moment. Whose purpose? The gang’s. Thus men’smoral criterion becomes, not “my view of the good—or of the right—or of thetruth,” but “my gang, right or wrong.”This is what makes today’s public issues and discussions so sickeningly falseand futile. Most issues rest on so many wrong premises and carry so manycontradictions that instead of the question: “Who is right?” one is constantlyand tacitly confronted with the question: “Which gang do you want to support?”For example, consider the issue of the war in Vietnam.Everything is wrong about that hideous mess (but not for the reasons which areshouted most loudly), starting from its designation. A “cold war” is a brazencontradiction in terms. It is not very “cold” for the American soldiers killedon battlefields, nor for their families, nor for any of us.A “cold war” is a typically Hegelian term. It rests on the premise that A isnon-A, that things are not what they are, so long as we don’t name them; or,practically speaking, things are what our leaders tell us they are—and, unlessthey tell us, we have no way of knowing. This sort of epistemology is notworking too well even in regard to the ignorant hordes of Russian peasants. Thatthis should be attempted in regard to American citizens is, perhaps, the mostdisgraceful symptom of our cultural disintegration.When men are being killed by a foreign army in military action, it is a war, awhole war and nothing but a war—regardless of what temperature anyone chooses toascribe to it.But observe what advantages the Hegelian terminology offers to the leaders of amixed economy. When a country is at war, it has to use all of its power to fightand win as fast as possible. It cannot fight and non-fight at the same time. Itcannot send its soldiers to die as cannon fodder, forbidding them to win. When acountry is at war, its leaders cannot prattle about “cultural exchanges” andabout “building bridges” to the enemy, as our leaders are doing—trade bridges tobolster the enemy’s economy and enable it to produce the planes and guns whichare killing our own soldiers.A country at war often resorts to smearing its enemy by spreading atrocitystories—a practice which a free, civilized country need not and should notresort to. A civilized country, with a free press, can let the facts speak forthemselves. But what is the moral-intellectual state of a country that spreadssmears and atrocity stories about itself and ignores or suppresses the factsknown about the enemy’s atrocities? What is the moral-intellectual state of acountry that permits its citizens to stage parades carrying the enemy’s—theVietcong’s—flag? Or to collect funds for the enemy on university campuses? Whatmakes this possible? The claim that we are not, allegedly, at war—only at “coldwar.”A country’s morale is crucially important, in wartime. In World War II, theBritish Lord Haw-Haw was, properly, regarded as a traitor—for the crime oftrying to undercut the British soldiers’ morale by broadcasting scare storiesabout Nazi Germany’s invincible power. In a “cold war,” such as we have today,Lord Haw-Haw’s job is performed by our own public leaders. The sickening scarestories about “escalation,” about our fear of war with China, would be morallyshameful if indulged in by the leaders of Monaco or Luxemburg. When they comefrom the leaders of the most powerful country on earth, “shameful” is not anadequate word to describe their moral meaning.If a country knows that it cannot fight another country, it does not undertaketo fight. If a country is actually weak, it does not go into battle screaming:“Please don’t take me seriously—I won’t go very far!” It does not proclaim itsfear as proof of its desire for peace.There is only one sense in which that ghastly phenomenon has to be classified asa non-war: the United States has nothing to gain from it. Wars are the secondgreatest evil that human societies can perpetrate. (The first is dictatorship,the enslavement of their own citizens, which is the cause of wars.) When anation resorts to war, it has some purpose, rightly or wrongly, something tofight for—and the only justifiable purpose is self-defense. If you want to seethe ultimate, suicidal extreme of altruism, on an international scale, observethe war in Vietnam—a war in which American soldiers are dying for no purposewhatever.This is the ugliest evil of the Vietnam war, that it does not serve any nationalinterest of the United States—that it is a pure instance of blind, senseless,altruistic, self-sacrificial slaughter. This is the evil—not the revolting stuffthat the Vietniks are howling about.None of us knows why we are in that war, how we got in, or what will take usout. Whenever our public leaders attempt to explain it to us, they make themystery greater. They tell us simultaneously that we are fighting for theinterests of the United States—and that the United States has no “selfish”interests in that war. They tell us that communism is the enemy—and they attack,denounce, and smear any anti-communists in this country. They tell us that thespread of communism must be contained in Asia—but not in Africa. They tell usthat communist aggression must be resisted in Vietnam—but not in Europe. Theytell us that we must defend the freedom of South Vietnam—but not the freedom ofEast Germany, Poland, Hungary, Latvia, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Katanga, etc.They tell us that North Vietnam is a threat to our national security—but Cuba isnot. They tell us that we must defend South Vietnam’s right to hold a“democratic” election, and to vote itself into communism, if it wishes, providedit does so by vote—which means that we are not fighting for any political idealor any principle of justice, but only for unlimited majority rule, and that thegoal for which American soldiers are dying is to be determined by somebodyelse’s vote. They tell us also that we must force South Vietnam to acceptcommunists into a coalition government—a process by which we delivered China tothe communists, which fact we must not mention. They tell us that we must defendSouth Vietnam’s right to “national self-determination”—and that anyone upholdingthe national sovereignty of the United States is an isolationist, thatnationalism is evil, that the globe is our homeland and we must be prepared todie for any part of it, except the continent of North America.Is it any wonder that no one believes the pronouncements of our public leadersany longer, neither the American people nor foreign nations? Ouranti-ideologists are beginning to worry about this problem. But—in their typicalstyle—they do not say that somebody is lying, they say that there exists a“credibility gap.”>Observe the terms in which the war in Vietnam is discussed. There are no statedgoals, no intellectual issues. But there are, apparently, two opposing sideswhich are designated, not by any specific ideological concepts, but by images,which is appropriate to the primitive epistemology of savages: the “hawks” andthe “doves.” But the “hawks” are cooing apologetically, and the “doves” aresnarling their heads off.The same groups that coined the term “isolationist” in World War II—to designateanyone who held that the internal affairs of other countries are not theresponsibility of the United States—these same groups are screaming that theUnited States has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of Vietnam.Nobody has proposed a goal which, if achieved, would terminate that war—exceptPresident Johnson, who has offered a billion dollars as the price of peace; nota billion dollars paid to us, but a billion dollars paid by us for the economicdevelopment of Vietnam; which means that we are fighting for the privilege ofturning every American taxpayer into a serf laboring part of his time for thebenefit of his Vietnamese masters. But, demonstrating that irrationality is nota monopoly of the United States, North Vietnam has rejected that offer.No, there is no proper solution for the war in Vietnam: it is a war we shouldnever have entered. To continue it is senseless—to withdraw from it would be onemore act of appeasement on our long, shameful record. The ultimate result ofappeasement is a world war, as demonstrated by World War II; in today’s context,it may mean a nuclear world war.That we let ourselves be trapped into a situation of that kind is theconsequence of fifty years of a suicidal foreign policy. One cannot correct aconsequence without correcting its cause; if such disasters could be solved“pragmatically,” i.e., out of context, on the spur and range of the moment, anation would not need any foreign policy. And this is an example of why we doneed a policy based on long-range principles, i.e., an ideology. But a revisionof our foreign policy, from its basic premises on up, is what today’santi-ideologists dare not contemplate. The worse its results, the louder ourpublic leaders proclaim that our foreign policy is bipartisan.A proper solution would be to elect statesmen—if such appeared—with a radicallydifferent foreign policy, a policy explicitly and proudly dedicated to thedefense of America’s rights and national self-interests, repudiating foreign aidand all forms of international self-immolation. On such a policy, we couldwithdraw from Vietnam at once—and the withdrawal would not be misunderstood byanyone, and the world would have a chance to achieve peace. But such statesmendo not exist at present. In today’s conditions, the only alternative is to fightthat war and win it as fast as possible—and thus gain time to develop newstatesmen with a new foreign policy, before the old one pushes us into another“cold war,” just as the “cold war” in Korea pushed us into Vietnam.The institution that enables our leaders to indulge in such recklesslyirresponsible ventures is the military draft.The question of the draft is, perhaps, the most important single issue debatedtoday. But the terms in which it is being debated are a sorry manifestation ofour anti-ideological “mainstream.”Of all the statist violations of individual rights in a mixed economy, themilitary draft is the worst. It is an abrogation of rights. It negates man’sfundamental right—the right to life—and establishes the fundamental principle ofstatism: that a man’s life belongs to the state, and the state may claim it bycompelling him to sacrifice it in battle. Once that principle is accepted, therest is only a matter of time.If the state may force a man to risk death or hideous maiming and crippling, ina war declared at the state’s discretion, for a cause he may neither approve ofnor even understand, if his consent is not required to send him into unspeakablemartyrdom—then, in principle, all rights are negated in that state, and itsgovernment is not man’s protector any longer. What else is there left toprotect?The most immoral contradiction—in the chaos of today’s anti-ideologicalgroups—is that of the so-called “conservatives,” who posture as defenders ofindividual rights, particularly property rights, but uphold and advocate thedraft. By what infernal evasion can they hope to justify the proposition thatcreatures who have no right to life have the right to a bank account? A slightlyhigher—though not much higher—rung of hell should be reserved for those“liberals” who claim that man has the “right” to economic security, publichousing, medical care, education, recreation, but no right to life, or: that manhas the right to livelihood, but not to life.One of the notions used by all sides to justify the draft is that “rights imposeobligations.” Obligations, to whom?—and imposed, by whom? Ideologically, thatnotion is worse than the evil it attempts to justify: it implies that rights area gift from the state, and that a man has to buy them by offering something (hislife) in return. Logically, that notion is a contradiction: since the onlyproper function of a government is to protect man’s rights, it cannot claimtitle to his life in exchange for that protection.The only “obligation” involved in individual rights is an obligation imposed,not by the state, but by the nature of reality (i.e., by the law of identity):consistency, which, in this case, means the obligation to respect the rights ofothers, if one wishes one’s own rights to be recognized and protected.Politically, the draft is clearly unconstitutional. No amount ofrationalization, neither by the Supreme Court nor by private individuals, canalter the fact that it represents “involuntary servitude.”A volunteer army is the only proper, moral—and practical—way to defend a freecountry. Should a man volunteer to fight, if his country is attacked? Yes—if hevalues his own rights and freedom. A free (or even semi-free) country has neverlacked volunteers in the face of foreign aggression. Many military authoritieshave testified that a volunteer army—an army of men who know what they arefighting for and why—is the best, most effective army, and that a drafted one isthe least effective.It is often asked: “But what if a country cannot find a sufficient number ofvolunteers?’ Even so, this would not give the rest of the population a right tothe lives of the country’s young men. But, in fact, the lack of volunteersoccurs for one of two reason: (1) If a country is demoralized by a corrupt,authoritarian government, its citizens will not volunteer to defend it. Butneither will they fight for long, if drafted. For example, observe the literaldisintegration of the Czarist Russian army in World War I. (2) If a country’sgovernment undertakes to fight a war for some reason other than self-defense,for a purpose which the citizens neither share nor understand, it will not findmany volunteers. Thus a volunteer army is one of the best protectors of peace,not only against foreign aggression, but also against any warlike ideologies orprojects on the part of a country’s own government.Not many men would volunteer for such wars as Korea or Vietnam. Without thepower to draft, the makers of our foreign policy would not be able to embark onadventures of that kind. This is one of the best practical reasons for theabolition of the draft.Consider another practical reason. The age of large, mass armies is past. Amodern war is a war of technology; it requires a highly trained, scientificpersonnel, not hordes of passive, unthinking, bewildered men; it requiresbrains, not brawn—intelligence, not blind obedience. One can force men to die;one cannot force them to think. Observe that the more technological branches ofour armed services—such as the Navy and the Air Force—do not accept draftees andare made up of volunteers. The draft, therefore, applies only to the leastefficacious and—in today’s conditions—the least essential part of our armedforces: the infantry. If so, then is national defense the main consideration ofthose who advocate and uphold the draft?The practical question of the country’s military protection is not the issue atstake; it is not the chief concern of the draft’s supporters. Some of them maybe motivated by routine, traditional notions and fears; but, on a nationalscale, there is a deeper motive involved.When a vicious principle is accepted implicitly, it does not take long to becomeexplicit: pressure groups are quick to find practical advantages in its logicalimplications. For instance, in World War II, the military draft was used as ajustification for proposals to establish labor conscription—i.e., compulsorylabor service for the entire population, with the government empowered to assignanyone to any job of its choice. “If men can be drafted to die for theircountry,” it was argued, “why can’t they be drafted to work for their country?”Two bills embodying such proposals were introduced in Congress, but,fortunately, were defeated. The second of those bills had an interesting quirk:drafted labor, it proposed, would be paid a union scale of wages—in order not toundercut union scales—but, in “fairness” to the military draftees, the labordraftees would be given only the equivalent of army pay, and the rest of theirwages would go to the government (!).What political group, do you suppose, came up with a notion of this kind? Bothbills were introduced by Republicans—and were defeated by organized labor, whichwas the only large economic group standing between us and a totalitarian state.Now observe the terms in which the draft is being debated today. The main reasonadvanced for the continuation of the draft is not military, but financial (!).It is generally conceded that the draft is unnecessary, but, it is argued, avolunteer army would cost too much.As matters stand, the army is one of the lowest paid groups in the country; adrafted soldier’s pay, in cash or equivalent (i.e., including room and board),amounts to about one dollar an hour. To attract volunteers, it would benecessary to offer higher pay and better conditions, thus making an army careercomparable to the standards of the civilian labor market.No exact estimates of the cost of a volunteer army have been offered, but theapproximate estimates place it at about four billion dollars a year.Hold this figure in mind. Hold it while you read about our national budget inthe daily papers—and while you hold also, clearly and specifically, the image ofwhat this figure would buy.The years from about fifteen to twenty-five are the crucial formative years of aman’s life. This is the time when he confirms his impressions of the world, ofother men, of the society in which he is to live, when he acquires consciousconvictions, defines his moral values, chooses his goals, and plans his future,developing or renouncing ambition. These are the years that mark him for life.And it is these years that an allegedly humanitarian society forces him to spendin terror—the terror of knowing that he can plan nothing and count on nothing,that any road he takes can be blocked at any moment by an unpredictable power,that, barring his vision of the future, there stands the gray shape of thebarracks, and, perhaps, beyond it, death for some unknown reason in some alienjungle.A pressure of that kind is devastating to a young man’s psychology, if he graspsthe issue consciously—and still worse, if he doesn’t.The first thing he is likely to give up, in either case, is his intellect: anintellect does not function on the premise of its own impotence. If he acquiresthe conviction that existence is hopeless, that his life is in the hands of someenormous, incomprehensible evil, if he develops a helpless, searing contempt forthe hypocrisy of his elders, and a profound hatred for all mankind—if he seeksto escape from that inhuman psychological pressure by turning to the beatnikcult of the immediate moment, by screaming: “Now, now, now!” (he has nothingelse but that “now”), or by dulling his terror and killing the last of his mindwith LSD—don’t blame him. Brothers, you asked for it!This is what four billion dollars would buy—this is what it would spare him andevery other young man in the country and every person who loves them. Rememberdown what drains our money is being poured today: according to the Federalbudget for fiscal year 1968, we will spend 4.5 billion on foreign aid and alliedprojects, 5.3 billion on space programs, 11.3 billion on just one of the many,many departments dealing with public welfare—yet we claim that we cannot affordfour billion dollars to save our youth from the agony of a mangling, brutalizingpsychological torture.But, of course, the real motive behind that social crime is not financial; theissue of costs is merely a rationalization. The real motive may be detected inthe following statement made by Lieutenant General Lewis B. Hershey, Director ofthe Selective Service System, on June 24, 1966: “I am not concerned with theuncertainty involved in keeping our citizenry believing that they owe somethingto their country. There are too many, too many people that think individualismhas to be completely recognized, even if the group rights go to the devil.”The same motive was made fully clear in a proposal which was advanced bySecretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara and is now being plugged with growinginsistence by the press.On May 18, 1966, Mr. McNamara said the following: “As matters stand, our presentSelective system draws on only a minority of eligible young men. That is aninequity. It seems to me that we could move toward remedying that inequity byasking every young person in the United States to give two years of service tohis country—whether in one of the military services, in the Peace Corps or insome other volunteer developmental work at home or abroad.”“Developmental” work—devoted to whose development?Apparently, planting rice or digging ditches in Asia, Africa, and South Americaconstitutes service to the United States—but preparing oneself for a productivecareer does not. Teaching our own illiterates in hillbilly regions or city slumsconstitutes service to the United States—but going to college does not. Teachingretarded children to weave baskets constitutes service to the United States—butacquiring a Ph.D. does not.Isn’t the unnamed principle clear? Developing yourself into a productive,ambitious, independent person is not regarded as a value to the United States;turning yourself into an abject sacrificial animal is.This, I submit, is a moral obscenity.Whatever country such a principle could apply to, it is not the United States.It is not even Soviet Russia—where they do destroy the minds of their youth, butnot in so mawkishly, wantonly senseless a manner.That proposal represents the naked essence of altruism in its pure and fullyconsistent form. It does not seek to sacrifice men for the alleged benefit ofthe state—it seeks to sacrifice them for the sake of sacrifice. It seeks tobreak man’s spirit—to destroy his mind, his ambition, his self-esteem, hisself-confidence, his self, during the very years when he is in the process ofacquiring them.Mr. McNamara’s trial balloon did not go over too well, at first. There wereoutcries of protest and indignation, which compelled the government to issue ahasty disclaimer. “The Johnson Administration,” said The New York Times of May20, 1966, “quickly made it plain today that it had no plans to draft youngAmericans for civilian duty or to let such duty become an alternative tomilitary service.” The same news story said that “officials called upon tointerpret his [McNamara’s] words stressed that he had suggested ‘asking’ ratherthan ‘compelling’ young people to serve.” Well, I want to stress that if agovernment intends to “ask” rather than “compel,” it does not choose theSecretary of Defense to do the “asking,” and he does not “ask” it in the contextof a passage dealing with the military draft.The suggestion of “voluntary service” under a threat to one’s life isblackmail—blackmail directed at the entire American youth—blackmail demandingtheir surrender into explicit serfdom.After that initial suggestion—obviously, as an intermediary step, to “condition”the sacrificial animals—the statist-altruist gangs began to plug the notion of“voluntary” social service.On September 14, 1966, James Reston of The New York Times quoted PresidentJohnson as saying: “I hope to see a day when some form of voluntary service tothe community and the nation and the world is as common in America as going toschool; when no man has truly lived who only served himself.”The motivation of all this is obvious. The draft is not needed for militarypurposes, it is not needed for the protection of this country, but the statistsare struggling not to relinquish the power it gave them and the unnamedprinciple (and precedent) it established—above all, not to relinquish theprinciple: that man’s life belongs to the state.This is the real issue—and the only issue—and there is no way to fight it or toachieve the abolition of the draft except by upholding the principle of man’sright to his own life. There is no way to uphold that right without a full,consistent, moral-political ideology. But that is not the way the issue is nowdebated by the frantic anti-ideologists of all sides.It is the “conservatives,” the alleged defenders of freedom and capitalism, whoshould be opposing the draft. They are not; they are supporting it. Early in thepresidential election campaign of 1964, Barry Goldwater made a vague suggestionfavoring the abolition of the draft, which aroused the public’s hopefulattention; he promptly dropped it, and devoted his campaign to denouncing themorals of Bobby Baker. Who brought the issue of the draft into public focus anddebate, demanding its repeal? The extreme left—the Vietniks and Peaceniks.In line with the anti-ideological methods of all other groups, theVietniks—whose sympathies are on the side of Russia, China, and NorthVietnam—are screaming against the draft in the name of their “individualrights”—individual rights, believe it or not. They are proclaiming their rightto choose which war they’ll fight in—while sympathizing with countries where theindividual does not even have the right to choose and utter a thought of hisown. What is still worse is the fact that they are the only group that evenmentions individual rights (if newspaper reports are to be trusted).But of all this anti-ideological mess, I would pick one small incident as,morally, the worst. I quote from The New York Times of February 6, 1967:Leaders of 15 student organizations representing both political extremes as wellas the center called today for the abolition of the draft and the encouragementof voluntary service in humanitarian pursuits. In a resolution ending a two-dayconference on the draft and national service at the Shoreham Hotel [Washington,D.C.], the student leaders declared: “The present draft system with its inherentinjustices is incompatible with traditional American principles of individualfreedom within a democratic society, and for this reason the draft should beeliminated. An urgent need exists within our society for young people to becomeinvolved in the elimination of such social ills as ignorance, poverty, racialdiscrimination and war.” Among those who signed the resolution were leadingmembers of the left-wing Students for a Democratic Society, the right-wing YoungAmericans for Freedom, and the moderate Youth and College Division of theNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People. . . . Although nounanimity on concrete recommendations was arrived at, Mr. Chickering [thesponsor of the conference] said he believed that most of the student leadersfavored his proposal for the creation of a system of voluntary national service.Under this proposal . . . students at campuses throughout the country will beasked to fill out cards expressing their willingness to serve in humanitarianwork.(Observe the formulation “traditional American principles of individual freedomwithin a democratic society”—instead of “individual right to life.” What is“individual freedom within a democratic society”? What is a “democraticsociety”? “Individual freedom” is not a primary political principle and cannotbe defined, defended, or practiced without the primary principle of individualrights. And a “democratic society,” traditionally, means: unlimited majorityrule. This is an example of the method by which today’s anti-ideologists areobliterating the concept of rights. Observe also that the leaders of the“conservative” Young Americans for Freedom signed a document of that kind.)These are not men who are being whipped: these are men who take the lashobediently and whip themselves.Politically, that proposal is much worse than the draft. The draft, at least,offers the excuse that one is serving one’s own country in time of danger—andits political implications are diluted by a long historical tradition associatedwith patriotism. But if young men accept the belief that it is their duty tospend their irreplaceable formative years on growing rice and carryingbedpans—they’re done for psychologically, and so is this country.The same news story carried some shocking statistics on the attitude of collegestudents at large. It quoted a poll conducted by the National StudentsAssociation at twenty-three campuses throughout the country. If that poll is tobe trusted, “Approximately 75 per cent said they preferred the establishment ofsome means to allow work in the Peace Corps, the Teacher Corps or Volunteers inService to America as an alternative to military service. About 90 per cent,however, said they believed that the Government has a right to conscript itscitizens, and 68 per cent thought such conscription was necessary in periodsother than those of a declared national emergency.”This is an example, on a grand scale, of what I call “the sanction of thevictim.” It is also an example of the fact that men cannot be enslavedpolitically until they have been disarmed ideologically. When they are sodisarmed, it is the victims who take the lead in the process of their owndestruction.Such is the swamp of contradictions swallowing the two most immediatelyprominent issues of today—Vietnam and the draft. The same is true of all theother issues and pseudo-issues now clogging all the avenues of publiccommunication. And, adding insult to injury, the anti-ideologists,who areresponsible for it, are complaining about the public’s lethargy.Lethargy is only a precarious psychological cover for confusion, disgust, anddespair.The country at large is bitterly dissatisfied with the status quo, disillusionedwith the stale slogans of welfare statism, and desperately seeking analternative, i.e., an intelligible program and course. The intensity of thatneed may be gauged by the fact that a single good speech raised a man, who hadnever held public office, to the governorship of California. The statists ofboth parties, who are now busy smearing Governor Reagan, are anxious not to seeand not to let others discover the real lesson and meaning of his election: thatthe country is starved for a voice of consistency, clarity, and moralself-confidence—which were the outstanding qualities of his famous speech, andwhich cannot be achieved or projected by consensus-seeking anti-ideologists.As of this date, Governor Reagan seems to be a promising public figure—I do notknow him and cannot speak for the future. It is difficult to avoid a certaindegree of skepticism: we have been disappointed too often. But whether he livesup to the promise or not, the people’s need, quest for, and response toclear-cut ideas remain a fact—and will become a tragic fact if the intellectualleaders of this country continue to ignore it.Since the elections of 1966, some commentators have been talking about thecountry’s “swing to the right.” There was no swing to the right (except,perhaps, in California)—there was only a swing against the left (if by “right,”we mean capitalism—and by “left,” statism). Without a firm, consistentideological program and leadership, the people’s desperate protest will bedissipated in the blind alleys of the same statism that they are opposing. It isfutile to fight against, if one does not know what one is fighting for. A merelynegative trend or movement cannot win and, historically, has never won: it leadsnowhere.The consensus-doctrine has achieved the exact opposite of its alleged goal:instead of creating unity or agreement, it has disintegrated and atomized thecountry to such an extent that no communication, let alone agreement, ispossible. It is not unity, but intellectual coherence that a country needs. Thatcoherence can be achieved only by fundamental principles, not by compromisesamong groups of men—by the primacy of ideas, not of gangs.The task of defining ideas and goals is not the province of politicians and isnot accomplished at election time: elections are merely consequences. The taskbelongs to the intellectuals. The need is more urgent than ever. (Postscript. Once in a while, I receive letters from young men asking me forpersonal advice on problems connected with the draft. Morally, no one can giveadvice in any issue where choices and decisions are not voluntary: “Moralityends where a gun begins.” As to the practical alternatives available, the bestthing to do is to consult a good lawyer.There is, however, one moral aspect of the issue that needs clarification. Someyoung men seem to labor under the misapprehension that since the draft is aviolation of their rights, compliance with the draft law would constitute amoral sanction of that violation. This is a serious error. A forced complianceis not a sanction. All of us are forced to comply with many laws that violateour rights, but so long as we advocate the repeal of such laws, our compliancedoes not constitute a sanction. Unjust laws have to be fought ideologically;they cannot be fought or corrected by means of mere disobedience and futilemartyrdom. To quote from an editorial on this subject in the April 1967 issue ofPersuasion: “One does not stop the juggernaut by throwing oneself in front ofit. . . .”)"},{"pageContent":"22. THE CASHING-IN: THE STUDENT “REBELLION”by Ayn Rand The so-called student “rebellion,” which was started and keynoted at theUniversity of California at Berkeley, has profound significance, but not of thekind that most commentators have ascribed to it. And the nature of themisrepresentations is part of its significance.The events at Berkeley began, in the fall of 1964, ostensibly as a studentprotest against the University administration’s order forbidding politicalactivity—specifically, the recruiting, fund-raising, and organizing of studentsfor political action off-campus—on a certain strip of ground adjoining thecampus, which was owned by the University. Claiming that their rights had beenviolated, a small group of “rebels” rallied thousands of students of allpolitical views, including many “conservatives,” and assumed the title of the“Free Speech Movement.” The Movement staged “sit-in” protests in theadministration building, and committed other acts of physical force, such asassaults on the police and the seizure of a police car for use as a rostrum.The Objectivist Newsletter, July, August, and September 1965.The spirit, style, and tactics of the rebellion are best illustrated by oneparticular incident. The University administration called a mass meeting, whichwas attended by eighteen thousand students and faculty members, to hear anaddress on the situation by the University President, Clark Kerr; it had beenexpressly announced that no student speakers would be allowed to address themeeting. Kerr attempted to end the rebellion by capitulating: he promised togrant most of the rebels’ demands; it looked as if he had won the audience tohis side. Whereupon, Mario Savio, the rebel leader, seized the microphone, in anattempt to take over the meeting, ignoring the rules and the fact that themeeting had been adjourned. When he was—properly—dragged off the platform, theleaders of the F.S.M. admitted, openly and jubilantly, that they had almost losttheir battle, but had saved it by provoking the administration to an act of“violence” (thus admitting that the victory of their publicly proclaimed goalswas not the goal of their battle).What followed was nation-wide publicity, of a peculiar kind. It was a suddenand, seemingly, spontaneous out-pouring of articles, studies, surveys, revealinga strange unanimity of approach in several basic aspects: in ascribing to theF.S.M. the importance of a national movement, unwarranted by the facts—inblurring the facts by means of unintelligible generalities—in granting to therebels the status of spokesmen for American youth, acclaiming their “idealism”and “commitment” to political action, hailing them as a symptom of the“awakening” of college students from “political apathy.” If ever a “puff-job”was done by a major part of the press, this was it.In the meantime, what followed at Berkeley was a fierce, three-cornered struggleamong the University administration, its Board of Regents, and its faculty, astruggle so sketchily reported in the press that its exact nature remainsfogbound. One can gather only that the Regents were, apparently, demanding a“tough” policy toward the rebels, that the majority of the faculty were on therebels’ side and that the administration was caught in the “moderate” middle ofthe road.The struggle led to the permanent resignation of the University’s Chancellor (asthe rebels had demanded)—the temporary resignation, and later reinstatement, ofPresident Kerr—and, ultimately, an almost complete capitulation to the F.S.M.,with the administration granting most of the rebels’ demands. (These includedthe right to advocate illegal acts and the right to an unrestricted freedom ofspeech on campus.)To the astonishment of the naive, this did not end the rebellion: the moredemands were granted, the more were made. As the administration intensified itsefforts to appease the F.S.M., the F.S.M. intensified its provocations. Theunrestricted freedom of speech took the form of a “Filthy Language Movement,”which consisted of students carrying placards with four-letter words, andbroadcasting obscenities over the University loudspeakers (which Movement wasdismissed with mild reproof by most of the press, as a mere “adolescent prank”).This, apparently, was too much even for those who sympathized with therebellion. The F.S.M. began to lose its following—and was, eventually,dissolved. Mario Savio quit the University, declaring that he “could not keep upwith the undemocratic procedures that the administration is following” [italicsmine]—and departed, reportedly to organize a nation-wide revolutionary studentmovement.This is a bare summary of the events as they were reported by the press. Butsome revealing information was provided by volunteers, outside the regular newschannels, such as in the letters-to-the-editor columns.An eloquent account was given in a letter to The New York Times (March 31, 1965)by Alexander Grendon, a biophysicist in the Donner Laboratory, University ofCalifornia:The F.S.M. has always applied coercion to insure victory. One-party “democracy,”as in the Communist countries or the lily-white portions of the South, correctsopponents of the party line by punishment. The punishment of the recalcitrantuniversity administration (and more than 20,000 students who avoidedparticipation in the conflict) was to “bring the university to a grinding halt”by physical force.To capitulate to such corruption of democracy is to teach students that thesemethods are right. President Kerr capitulated repeatedly. . . .Kerr agreed the university would not control “advocacy of illegal acts,” anabstraction until illustrated by examples: In a university lecture hall, aself-proclaimed anarchist advises students how to cheat to escape militaryservice; a nationally known Communist uses the university facilities to condemnour Government in vicious terms for its action in Vietnam, while funds tosupport the Vietcong are illegally solicited; propaganda for the use ofmarijuana, with instructions where to buy it, is openly distributed on campus.Even the abstraction “obscenity” is better understood when one hears a speaker,using the university’s amplifying equipment, describe in vulgar words hisexperiences in group sexual intercourse and homosexuality and recommend thesepractices, while another suggests students should have the same sexual freedomon campus as dogs. . . .Clark Kerr’s “negotiation”—a euphemism for surrender—on each deliberate defianceof orderly university processes contributes not to a liberal university but to alawless one.David S. Landes, Professor of History, Harvard University, made an interestingobservation in a letter to The New York Times (December 29, 1964). Stating thatthe Berkeley revolt represents potentially one of the most serious assaults onacademic freedom in America, he wrote:In conclusion, I should like to point out the deleterious implications of thisdispute for the University of California. I know personally of five or sixfaculty members who are leaving, not because of lack of sympathy with “freespeech” or “political action,” but because, as one put it, who wants to teach atthe University of Saigon?The clearest account and most perceptive evaluation were offered in an articlein the Columbia University Forum (Spring 1965), entitled “What’s Left atBerkeley,” by William Petersen, Professor of Sociology at the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley. He writes:The first fact one must know about the Free Speech Movement is that it haslittle or nothing to do with free speech. . . . If not free speech, what then isthe issue? In fact, preposterous as this may seem, the real issue is the seizureof power. . . .That a tiny number, a few hundred out of a student body of more than 27,000, wasable to disrupt the campus is the consequence of more than vigor and skill inagitation. This minuscule group could not have succeeded in getting so manystudents into motion without three other, at times unwitting, sources ofsupport: off-campus assistance of various kinds, the University administration,and the faculty.Everyone who has seen the efficient, almost military organization of theagitators’ program has a reasonable basis for believing that skilled personneland money are being dispatched into the Berkeley battle. . . . Around theBerkeley community a dozen “ad hoc committees to support” this or that elementof the student revolt sprang up spontaneously, as though out of nowhere.The course followed by the University administration . . . could hardly havebetter fostered a rebellious student body if it had been devised to do so. Toestablish dubious regulations and when they are attacked to defend them byunreasonable argument is bad enough; worse still, the University did not imposeon the students any sanctions that did not finally evaporate. . . . Obedience tonorms is developed when it is suitably rewarded, and when noncompliance issuitably punished. That professional educators should need to be reminded ofthis axiom indicates how deep the roots of the Berkeley crisis lie.But the most important reason that the extremists won so many supporters amongthe students was the attitude of the faculty. Perhaps their most notoriouscapitulation to the F.S.M. was a resolution passed by the Academic Senate onDecember 8, by which the faculty notified the campus not only that theysupported all of the radicals’ demands but also that, in effect, they werewilling to fight for them against the Board of Regents, should that becomenecessary. When that resolution passed by an overwhelming majority—824 to 115votes—it effectively silenced the anti-F.S.M. student organizations. . . .The Free Speech Movement is reminiscent of the Communist fronts of the 1930’s,but there are several important differences. The key feature, that a radicalcore uses legitimate issues ambiguously in order to manipulate a large mass, isidentical. The core in this case, however, is not the disciplined Communistparty, but a heterogeneous group of radical sects.Professor Petersen lists the various socialist, Trotskyist, communist, and othergroups involved. His conclusion is:The radical leaders on the Berkeley campus, like those in Latin American orAsian universities, are not the less radical for being, in many cases, outsidethe discipline of a formal political party. They are defined not by whether theypay dues to a party, but by their actions, their vocabulary, their way ofthinking. The best term to describe them, in my opinion, is Castroite. [Thisterm, he explains, applies primarily to their choice of tactics, to the factthat] in critical respects all of them imitate the Castro movement. . . .At Berkeley, provocative tactics applied not against a dictatorship but againstthe liberal, divided, and vacillating University administration proved to beenormously effective. Each provocation and subsequent victory led to the next.Professor Petersen ends his article on a note of warning:By my diagnosis . . . not only has the patient [the University] not recoveredbut he is sicker than ever. The fever has gone down temporarily, but theinfection is spreading and becoming more virulent.Now let us consider the ideology of the rebels, from such indications as weregiven in the press reports. The general tone of the reports was best expressedby a headline in The New York Times (March 15, 1965): “The New Student Left:Movement Represents Serious Activists in Drive for Changes.”What kind of changes? No specific answer was given in the almost full-pagestory. Just “changes.”Some of these activists “who liken their movement to a ‘revolution,’ want to becalled radicals. Most of them, however, prefer to be called ‘organizers.’ ”Organizers—of what? Of “deprived people.” For what? No answer. Just“organizers.”Most express contempt for any specific labels, and they don’t mind being calledcynics. . . . The great majority of those questioned said they were as skepticalof Communism as they were of any other form of political control. . . . “Youmight say we’re a-Communist,” said one of them, “just as you might say we’reamoral and a-almost everything else.”There are exceptions, however. A girl from the University of California, one ofthe leaders of the Berkeley revolt, is quoted as saying: “At present thesocialist world, even with all its problems, is moving closer than any othercountries toward the sort of society I think should exist. In the Soviet Union,it has almost been achieved.”Another student, from the City College of New York, is quoted as concurring: “‘The Soviet Union and the whole Socialist bloc are on the right track,’ hesaid.”In view of the fact that most of the young activists were active in the civilrights movement, and that the Berkeley rebels had started by hiding behind theissue of civil rights (attempting, unsuccessfully, to smear all opposition as of“racist” origin), it is interesting to read that: “There is little talk amongthe activists about racial integration. Some of them consider the subject passé.They declare that integration will be almost as evil as segregation if itresults in a complacent, middle-class interracial society.”The central theme and basic ideology of all the activists is: anti-ideology.They are militantly opposed to all “labels,” definitions, and theories; theyproclaim the supremacy of the immediate moment and commitment to action—tosubjectively, emotionally motivated action. Their anti-intellectual attituderuns like a stressed leitmotif through all the press reports.An article in The New York Times Magazine (February 14, 1965) declares:The Berkeley mutineers did not seem political in the sense of those studentrebels in the Turbulent Thirties. They are too suspicious of all adultinstitutions to embrace wholeheartedly even those ideologies with a stake insmashing the system. An anarchist or I.W.W. strain seems as pronounced as anyMarxist doctrine. “Theirs is a sort of political existentialism,” says PaulJacobs, a research associate at the university’s Center for the Study of Law andSociety, who is one of the F.S.M.’s applauders. “All the old labels are out. . ..”The proudly immoderate zealots of the F.S.M. pursue an activist creed—that onlycommitment can strip life of its emptiness, its absence of meaning in a great“knowledge factory” like Berkeley.An article in The Saturday Evening Post (May 8, 1965), discussing the variousyouth groups on the left, quotes a leader of Students for a Democratic Society:“We began by rejecting the old sectarian left and its ancient quarrels, and witha contempt for American society, which we saw as depraved. We are interested indirect action and specific issues. We do not spend endless hours debating thenature of Soviet Russia or whether Yugoslavia is a degenerate workers’ state.”[And]: “With sit-ins we saw for the first time the chance for directparticipation in meaningful social revolution.”In their off-picket-line hours, [states the same article] the P.L. [ProgressiveLabor] youngsters hang out at the experimental theaters and coffee shops ofManhattan’s East Village. Their taste in reading runs more to Sartre than toMarx.With an interesting touch of unanimity, a survey in Newsweek (March 22, 1965)quotes a young man on the other side of the continent: “ ‘These students don’tread Marx,’ said one Berkeley Free Student Movement leader. ‘They read Camus.’ ”“If they are rebels,” the survey continues, “they are rebels without anideology, and without long-range revolutionary programs. They rally over issues,not philosophies, and seem unable to formulate or sustain a systematizedpolitical theory of society, either from the left or right.”“Today’s student seeks to find himself through what he does, not what hethinks,” the survey declares explicitly—and quotes some adult authorities insympathetic confirmation. “ ‘What you have now, as in the 30’s,’ says New YorkPost editor James A. Wechsler, ‘are groups of activists who really want tofunction in life.’ But not ideologically. ‘We used to sit around and debateMarxism, but students now are working for civil-rights and peace.’ ” RichardUnsworth, chaplain at Dartmouth, is quoted as saying: “In the world of today’scampus ‘the avenue now is doing and then reflecting on your doing, instead ofreflecting, then deciding, and then doing, the way it was a few years ago.’ ”Paul Goodman, described as writer, educator and “one of the students’ currentheroes,” is quoted as hailing the Berkeley movement because: “The leaders of theinsurrection, he says, ‘didn’t play it cool, they took risks, they were willingto be confused, they didn’t know whether it all would be a success or a failure.Now they don’t want to be cool any more, they want to take over.’ ” [Italicsmine. The same tribute could be paid to any drunken driver.]The theme of “taking over” is repeated again and again. The immediate target,apparently, is the take-over of the universities. The New York Times Magazinearticle quotes one of the F.S.M. leaders: “Our idea is that the university iscomposed of faculty, students, books, and ideas. In a literal sense, theadministration is merely there to make sure the sidewalks are kept clean. Itshould be the servant of the faculty and the students.”The climax of this particular line was a news story in The New York Times (March29, 1965) under the heading: “Collegians Adopt a ‘Bill of Rights.’ ”A group of Eastern college students declared here [in Philadelphia] this weekendthat college administrators should be no more than housekeepers in theeducational community.“The modern college or university,” they said, “should be run by the studentsand the professors; administrators would be maintenance, clerical and safetypersonnel whose purpose is to enforce the will of faculty and students.”A manifesto to this effect was adopted at a meeting held at the University ofPennsylvania and attended by two hundred youthsfrom 39 colleges in the Philadelphia and New York areas, Harvard, Yale, theUniversity of California at Berkeley, and from schools in the Midwest.A recurring theme in the meeting was that colleges and universities had becomeservants of the “financial, industrial, and military establishment,” and thatstudents and faculty were being “sold down the river” by administrators.Among the provisions of the manifesto were declarations of freedom to join,organize or hold meetings of any organization . . . abolition of tuition fees;control of law enforcement by the students and faculty; an end to the ReserveOfficer Training Corps; abolition of loyalty oaths; student-faculty control overcurriculum. . . .The method used to adopt that manifesto is illuminating: “About 200 studentsattended the meeting, 45 remaining until the end when the ‘Student Bill ofRights’ was adopted.” So much for “democratic procedures” and for the activists’right to the title of spokesmen for American youth.What significance is ascribed to the student rebellion by all these reports andby the authorities they choose to quote? Moral courage is not a characteristicof today’s culture, but in no other contemporary issue has moral cowardice beenrevealed to such a naked, ugly extent. Not only do most of the commentators lackan independent evaluation of the events, not only do they take their cue fromthe rebels, but of all the rebels’ complaints, it is the most superficial,irrelevant and, therefore, the safest, that they choose to support and to acceptas the cause of the rebellion: the complaint that the universities have grown“too big.”As if they had mushroomed overnight, the “bigness” of the universities issuddenly decried by the consensus as a national problem and blamed for the“unrest” of the students, whose motives are hailed as youthful “idealism.” Intoday’s culture, it has always been safe to attack “bigness.” And since themeaningless issue of mere size has long served as a means of evading realissues, on all sides of all political fences, a new catch-phrase has been addedto the list of “Big Business,” “Big Labor,” “Big Government,” etc.: “BigUniversity.”For a more sophisticated audience, the socialist magazine The New Leader(December 21, 1964) offers a Marxist-Freudian appraisal, ascribing the rebellionprimarily to “alienation” (quoting Savio: “Somehow people are being separatedoff from something”) and to “generational revolt” (“Spontaneously the naturalidiom of the student political protest was that of sexual protest against theforbidding university administrator who ruled in loco parentis”).But the prize for expressing the moral-intellectual essence of today’s cultureshould go to Governor Brown of California. Remember that the University ofCalifornia is a state institution, that its Regents are appointed by theGovernor and that he, therefore, was the ultimate target of the revolt,including all its manifestations, from physical violence to filthy language.Have we made our society safe for students with ideas? [said Governor Brown at acampus dinner.] We have not. Students have changed but the structure of theuniversity and its attitudes towards its students have not kept pace with thatchange.Therefore, some students felt they had the right to go outside the law to forcethe change. But in so doing, they displayed the height of idealistic hypocrisy.[Italics mine.] On the one hand, they held up the Federal Constitution,demanding their rights of political advocacy. But at the same time, they threwaway the principle of due process in favor of direct action.In doing so, they were as wrong as the university. This, then, is the greatchallenge that faces us, the challenge of change.57[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-57]Consider the fact that Governor Brown is generally regarded as a powerful chiefexecutive and, by California Republicans, as a formidable opponent. Consider thefact that “according to the California Public Opinion Poll, 74 percent of thepeople disapprove of the student protest movement in Berkeley.”58[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-58] Then observe that Governor Brown didnot dare denounce a movement led or manipulated by a group of forty-fivestudents—and that he felt obliged to qualify the term “hypocrisy” by theadjective “idealistic,” thus creating one of the weirdest combinations intoday’s vocabulary of evasion.Now observe that in all that mass of comments, appraisals, and interpretations(including the ponderous survey in Newsweek which offered statistics on everyimaginable aspect of college life), not one word was said about the content ofmodern education, about the nature of the ideas that are being inculcated bytoday’s universities. Every possible question was raised and considered, except:What are the students taught to think? This, apparently, was what no one dareddiscuss.This is what we shall now proceed to discuss.If a dramatist had the power to convert philosophical ideas into real,flesh-and-blood people, and attempted to create the walking embodiments ofmodern philosophy—the result would be the Berkeley rebels.These “activists” are so fully, literally, loyally, devastatingly the productsof modern philosophy that someone should cry to all the universityadministrations and faculties: “Brothers, you asked for it!”Mankind could not expect to remain unscathed after decades of exposure to theradiation of intellectual fission-debris, such as: “Reason is impotent to knowthings as they are—reality is unknowable—certainty is impossible—knowledge ismere probability—truth is that which works—mind is a superstition—logic is asocial convention—ethics is a matter of subjective commitment to an arbitrarypostulate.” And the consequent mutations are those contorted young creatures whoscream, in chronic terror, that they know nothing and want to rule everything.If that dramatist were writing a movie, he could justifiably entitle it “MarioSavio, Son of Immanuel Kant.”With rare and academically neglected exceptions, the philosophical “mainstream”that seeps into every classroom, subject, and brain in today’s universities, is:epistemological agnosticism, avowed irrationalism, ethical subjectivism. Our ageis witnessing the ultimate climax, the cashing-in on a long process ofdestruction, at the end of the road laid out by Kant.Ever since Kant divorced reason from reality, his intellectual descendants havebeen diligently widening the breach. In the name of reason, Pragmatismestablished a range-of-the-moment view as an enlightened perspective on life,context-dropping as a rule of epistemology, expediency as a principle ofmorality, and collective subjectivism as a substitute for metaphysics. LogicalPositivism carried it farther and, in the name of reason, elevated theimmemorial psycho-epistemology of shyster-lawyers to the status of a scientificepistemological system—by proclaiming that knowledge consists of linguisticmanipulations. Taking this seriously, Linguistic Analysis declared that the taskof philosophy is, not to identify universal principles, but to tell people whatthey mean when they speak, which they are otherwise unable to know (which last,by that time, was true—in philosophical circles). This was the final stroke ofphilosophy breaking its moorings and floating off, like a lighter-than-airballoon, losing any semblance of connection to reality, any relevance to theproblems of man’s existence.No matter how cautiously the proponents of such theories skirted any referenceto the relationship between theory and practice, no matter how coyly theystruggled to treat philosophy as a parlor or classroom game—the fact remainedthat young people went to college for the purpose of acquiring theoreticalknowledge to guide them in practical action. Philosophy teachers evadedquestions about the application of their ideas to reality, by such means asdeclaring that “reality is a meaningless term,” or by asserting that philosophyhas no purpose other than the amusement of manufacturing arbitrary “constructs,”or by urging students to temper every theory with “common sense”—the commonsense they had spent countless hours trying to invalidate.As a result, a student came out of a modern university with the followingsediment left in his brain by his four to eight years of study: existence is anuncharted, unknowable jungle, fear and uncertainty are man’s permanent state,skepticism is the mark of maturity, cynicism is the mark of realism, and, aboveall, the hallmark of an intellectual is the denial of the intellect.When and if academic commentators gave any thought to the practical results oftheir theories, they were predominantly united in claiming that uncertainty andskepticism are socially valuable traits which would lead to tolerance ofdifferences, flexibility, social “adjustment,” and willingness to compromise.Some went so far as to maintain explicitly that intellectual certainty is themark of a dictatorial mentality, and that chronic doubt—the absence of firmconvictions, the lack of absolutes—is the guarantee of a peaceful, “democratic”society.They miscalculated.It has been said that Kant’s dichotomy led to two lines of Kantian philosophers,both accepting his basic premises, but choosing opposite sides: those who chosereason, abandoning reality—and those who chose reality, abandoning reason. Thefirst delivered the world to the second.The collector of the Kantian rationalizers’ efforts—the receiver of the bankruptshambles of sophistry, casuistry, sterility, and abysmal triviality to whichthey had reduced philosophy—was Existentialism.Existentialism, in essence, consists of pointing to modern philosophy anddeclaring: “Since this is reason, to hell with it!”In spite of the fact that the pragmatists-positivists-analysts had obliteratedreason, the existentialists accepted them as reason’s advocates, held them up tothe world as examples of rationality and proceeded to reject reason altogether,proclaiming its impotence, rebelling against its “failure,” calling for a returnto reality, to the problems of human existence, to values, to action—tosubjective values and mindless action. In the name of reality, they proclaimedthe moral supremacy of “instincts,” urges, feelings—and the cognitive powers ofstomachs, muscles, kidneys, hearts, blood. It was a rebellion of headlessbodies.The battle is not over. The philosophy departments of today’s universities arethe battleground of a struggle which, in fact, is only a family quarrel betweenthe analysts and the existentialists. Their progeny are the activists of thestudent rebellion.If these activists choose the policy of “doing and then reflecting on yourdoing”—hasn’t Pragmatism taught them that truth is to be judged by consequences?If they “seem unable to formulate or sustain a systematized political theory ofsociety,” yet shriek with moral righteousness that they propose to achieve theirsocial goals by physical force—hasn’t Logical Positivism taught them thatethical propositions have no cognitive meaning and are merely a report on one’sfeelings or the equivalent of emotional ejaculations? If they are savagely blindto everything but the immediate moment—hasn’t Logical Positivism taught themthat nothing else can be claimed with certainty to exist? And while thelinguistic analysts are busy demonstrating that “The cat is on the mat” does notmean that “the mat” is an attribute of “the cat,” nor that “on-the-mat” is thegenus to which “the cat” belongs, nor yet that “the-cat” equals “on-the-mat”—isit any wonder that students storm the Berkeley campus with placards inscribed“Strike now, analyze later”? (This slogan is quoted by Professor Petersen in theColumbia University Forum.)On June 14, CBS televised a jumbled, incoherent, unintelligible—and for thesevery reasons, authentic and significant—documentary entitled The Berkeley Story.There is method in every kind of madness—and for those acquainted with modernphilosophy, that documentary was like a display of sideshow mirrors throwing offtwisted reflections and random echoes of the carnage perpetrated in the academictorture-chambers of the mind.“Our generation has no ideology,” declared the first boy interviewed, in thetone of defiance and hatred once reserved for saying: “Down with WallStreet!”—clearly projecting that the enemy now is not the so-called RobberBarons, but the mind. The older generation, he explained scornfully, had “a neatlittle pill” to solve everything, but the pill didn’t work and they merely “gottheir hearts busted.” “We don’t believe in pills,” he said.“We’ve learned that there are no absolute rules,” said a young girl, hastily anddefensively, as if uttering an axiom—and proceeded to explain inarticulately,with the help of gestures pointing inward, that “we make rules for ourselves”and that what is right for her may not be right for others.A girl described her classes as “words, words, words, paper, paper, paper”—andquietly, in a tone of authentic despair, said that she stopped at times towonder: “What am I doing here? I’m not learning anything.”An intense young girl who talked volubly, never quite finishing a sentence normaking a point, was denouncing society in general, trying to say that sincepeople are social products, society has done a bad job. In the middle of asentence, she stopped and threw in, as a casual aside: “Whatever way I turn out,I still am a product,” then went on. She said it with the simple earnestness ofa conscientious child acknowledging a self-evident fact of nature. It was not anact: the poor little creature meant it.The helpless bewilderment on the face of Harry Reasoner, the commentator, whenhe tried to sum up what he had presented, was an eloquent indication of why thepress is unable properly to handle the student rebellion. “Now—immediacy—anysituation must be solved now,” he said incredulously, describing the rebels’attitude, neither praising nor blaming, in the faintly astonished, faintlyhelpless tone of a man unable to believe that he is seeing savages running looseon the campus of one of America’s great universities.Such are the products of modern philosophy. They are the type of students whoare too intelligent not to see the logical consequences of the theories theyhave been taught—but not intelligent nor independent enough to see through thetheories and reject them.So they scream their defiance against “The System,” not realizing that they areits most consistently docile pupils, that theirs is a rebellion against thestatus quo by its archetypes, against the intellectual “Establishment” by itsrobots who have swallowed every shopworn premise of the “liberals” of the1930’s, including the catch-phrases of altruism, the dedication to “deprivedpeople,” to such a safely conventional cause as “the war on poverty.” Arebellion that brandishes banners inscribed with bromides is not a veryconvincing nor very inspiring sight.As in any movement, there is obviously a mixture of motives involved: there arethe little shysters of the intellect, who have found a gold mine in modernphilosophy, who delight in arguing for argument’s sake and stumping opponents bymeans of ready-to-wear paradoxes—there are the little role-players, who fancythemselves as heroes and enjoy defiance for the sake of defiance—there are thenihilists, who, moved by a profound hatred, seek nothing but destruction for thesake of destruction—there are the hopeless dependents, who seek to “belong” toany crowd that would have them—and there are the plain hooligans, who are alwaysthere, on the fringes of any mob action that smells of trouble. Whatever thecombination of motives, neurosis is stamped in capital letters across the wholemovement, since there is no such thing as rejecting reason through an innocenterror of knowledge. But whether the theories of modern philosophy serve merelyas a screen, a defense-mechanism, a rationalization of neurosis or are, in part,its cause—the fact remains that modern philosophy has destroyed the best inthese students and fostered the worst.Young people do seek a comprehensive view of life, i.e., a philosophy, they doseek meaning, purpose, ideals—and most of them take what they get. It is intheir teens and early twenties that most people seek philosophical answers andset their premises, for good or evil, for the rest of their lives. Some neverreach that stage; some never give up the quest; but the majority are open to thevoice of philosophy for a few brief years. These last are the permanent, if notinnocent, victims of modern philosophy.They are not independent thinkers nor intellectual originators; they are unableto answer or withstand the flood of modern sophistries. So some of them give up,after one or two unintelligible courses, convinced that thinking is a waste oftime—and turn into lethargic cynics or stultified Babbitts by the time theyreach twenty-five. Others accept what they hear; they accept it blindly andliterally; these are today’s activists. And no matter what tangle of motives nowmoves them, every teacher of modern philosophy should cringe in their presence,if he is still open to the realization that it is by means of the best withinthem, by means of their twisted, precarious groping for ideas, that he hasturned them into grotesque little monstrosities.Now what happens to the better minds in modern universities, to the students ofabove average intelligence who are actually eager to learn? What they find andhave to endure is a long, slow process of psycho-epistemological torture.Directly or indirectly, the influence of philosophy sets the epistemologicalstandards and methods of teaching for all departments, in the physical sciencesas well as in the humanities. The consequence, today, is a chaos of subjectivewhims setting the criteria of logic, of communication, demonstration, evidence,proof, which differ from class to class, from teacher to teacher. I am notspeaking of a difference in viewpoint or content, but of the absence of basicepistemological principles and the consequent difference in the method offunctioning required of a student’s mind. It is as if each course were given ina different language, each requiring that one think exclusively in thatlanguage, none providing a dictionary. The result—to the extent that one wouldattempt to comply—is intellectual disintegration.Add to this: the opposition to “system-building,” i.e., to the integration ofknowledge, with the result that the material taught in one class contradicts thematerial taught in the others, each subject hanging in a vacuum and to beaccepted out of context, while any questions on how to integrate it arerejected, discredited, and discouraged.Add to this: the arbitrary, senseless, haphazard conglomeration of mostcurricula, the absence of any hierarchical structure of knowledge, any order,continuity or rationale—the jumble of courses on out-of-context minutiae andout-of-focus surveys—the all-pervading unintelligibility—the arrogantlyself-confessed irrationality—and, consequently, the necessity to memorize,rather than learn, to recite, rather than understand, to hold in one’s mind acacophony of undefined jargon long enough to pass the next exam.Add to this: the professors who refuse to answer questions—the professors whoanswer by evasion and ridicule—the professors who turn their classes intobull-sessions on the premise that “we’re here to mull things over together”—theprofessors who do lecture, but, in the name of “anti-dogmatism,” take no stand,express no viewpoint and leave the students in a maze of contradictions with nolead to a solution—the professors who do take a stand and invite the students’comments, then penalize dissenters by mean of lower grades (particularly inpolitical courses).Add to this: the moral cowardice of most university administrations, the policyof permanent moral neutrality, of compromising on anything, of evading anyconflict at any price—and the students’ knowledge that the worst classroominjustice will remain uncorrected, that no appeal is practicable and no justiceis to be found anywhere.Yes, of course, there are exceptions—there are competent educators, brilliantminds, and rational men on the university staffs—but they are swallowed in therampaging “mainstream” of irrationality and, too often, defeated by the hopelesspessimism of bitter, long-repressed frustration.And further: most professors and administrators are much more competent andrational as individuals than they are in their collective performance. Most ofthem realize and, privately, complain about the evils of today’s educationalworld. But each of them feels individually impotent before the enormity of theproblem. So they blame it on some nameless, disembodied, almost mystical power,which they designate as “The System”—and too many of them take it to be apolitical system, specifically capitalism. They do not realize that there isonly one human discipline which enables men to deal with large-scale-problems,which has the power to integrate and unify human activities—and that thatdiscipline is philosophy, which they have set, instead, to the task ofdisintegrating and destroying their work.What does all this do to the best minds among the students? Most of them enduretheir college years with the teeth-clenched determination of serving out a jailsentence. The psychological scars they acquire in the process are incalculable.But they struggle as best they can to preserve their capacity to think, sensingdimly that the essence of the torture is an assault on their mind. And what theyfeel toward their schools ranges from mistrust to resentment to contempt tohatred—intertwined with a sense of exhaustion and excruciating boredom.To various extents and various degrees of conscious awareness, these feelingsare shared by the entire pyramid of the student body, from intellectual top tobottom. This is the reason why the handful of Berkeley rebels was able toattract thousands of students who did not realize, at first, the nature of whatthey were joining and who withdrew when it became apparent. Those students weremoved by a desperate, incoherent frustration, by a need to protest, not knowingfully against what, by a blind desire to strike out at the university somehow.I asked a small group of intelligent students at one of New York’s bestuniversities—who were ideologically opposed to the rebels—whether they wouldfight for the university administration, if the rebellion came to their campus.All of them shook their heads, with faint, wise, bitter smiles.The philosophical impotence of the older generation is the reason why the adultauthorities—from the Berkeley administration to the social commentators to thepress to Governor Brown—were unable to take a firm stand and had no rationalanswer to the Berkeley rebellion. Granting the premises of modern philosophy,logic was on the side of the rebels. To answer them would require a totalphilosophical re-evaluation, down to basic premises—which none of those adultswould dare attempt.Hence the incredible spectacle of brute force, hoodlum tactics, and militantlyexplicit irrationality being brought to a university campus—and being met by thevague, uncertain, apologetic concessions, the stale generalities, the evasiveplatitudes of the alleged defenders of academic law and order.In a civilized society, a student’s declaration that he rejects reason andproposes to act outside the bounds of rationality would be taken as sufficientgrounds for immediate expulsion—let alone if he proceeded to engage in mobaction and physical violence on a university campus. But modern universitieshave long since lost the moral right to oppose the first—and are, therefore,impotent against the second.The student rebellion is an eloquent demonstration of the fact that when menabandon reason, they open the door to physical force as the only alternative andthe inevitable consequence.The rebellion is also one of the clearest refutations of the argument of thoseintellectuals who claimed that skepticism and chronic doubt would lead to socialharmony.When men reduce their virtues to the approximate, then evil acquires the forceof an absolute, when loyalty to an unyielding purpose is dropped by thevirtuous, it’s picked up by scoundrels—and you get the indecent spectacle of acringing, bargaining, traitorous good and a self-righteously uncompromisingevil. (Atlas Shrugged)Who stands to profit by that rebellion? The answer lies in the nature and goalsof its leadership.If the rank-and-file of the college rebels are victims, at least in part, thiscannot be said of their leaders. Who are their leaders? Any and all of thestatist-collectivist groups that hover, like vultures, over the remnants ofcapitalism, hoping to pounce on the carcass—and to accelerate the end, wheneverpossible. Their minimal goal is just “to make trouble”—to undercut, to confuse,to demoralize, to destroy. Their ultimate goal is to take over.To such leadership, the college rebels are merely cannon-fodder, intended tostick their headless necks out, to fight on campuses, to go to jail, to losetheir careers and their future—and eventually, if the leadership succeeds, tofight in the streets and lose their “nonabsolute” lives, paving the way for theabsolute dictatorship of whoever is the bloodiest among the thugs scrambling forpower. Young fools who refuse to look beyond the immediate “now” have no way ofknowing whose long-range goals they are serving.The communists are involved, among others; but, like the others, they are merelythe manipulators, not the cause, of the student rebellion. This is an example ofthe fact that whenever they win, they win by default—like germs feeding on thesores of a disintegrating body. They did not create the conditions that aredestroying American universities—they did not create the hordes of embittered,aimless, neurotic teen-agers—but they do know how to attack through the soreswhich their opponents insist on evading. They are professional ideologists, andit is not difficult for them to move into an intellectual vacuum and to hang thecringing advocates of “antiideology” by their own contradictions.For its motley leftist leadership, the student rebellion is a trial balloon, akind of cultural temperature-taking. It is a test of how much they can get awaywith and what sort of opposition they will encounter.For the rest of us, it is a miniature preview—in the microcosm of the academicworld—of what is to happen to the country at large, if the present culturaltrend remains unchallenged.The country at large is a mirror of its universities. The practical result ofmodern philosophy is today’s mixed economy with its moral nihilism, itsrange-of-the-moment pragmatism, its anti-ideological ideology, and its trulyshameful recourse to the notion of “Government by Consensus.”Rule by pressure groups is merely the prelude, the social conditioning for mobrule. Once a country has accepted the obliteration of moral principles, ofindividual rights, of objectivity, of justice, of reason, and has submitted tothe rule of legalized brute force—the elimination of the concept “legalized”does not take long to follow. Who is to resist it—and in the name of what?When numbers are substituted for morality, and no individual can claim a right,but any gang can assert any desire whatever, when compromise is the only policyexpected of those in power, and the preservation of the moment’s “stability,” ofpeace at any price, is their only goal—the winner, necessarily, is whoeverpresents the most unjust and irrational demands; the system serves as an openinvitation to do so. If there were no communists or other thugs in the world,such a system would create them.The more an official is committed to the policy of compromise, the less able heis to resist anything: to give in is his “instinctive” response in anyemergency, his basic principle of conduct, which makes him an easy mark.In this connection, the extreme of naive superficiality was reached by thosecommentators who expressed astonishment that the student rebellion had chosenBerkeley as its first battleground and President Kerr as its first target inspite of his record as a “liberal” and as a renowned mediator and arbitrator.“Ironically, some of the least mature student spokesmen . . . tried to depictMr. Kerr as the illiberal administrator,” said an editorial in The New YorkTimes (March 11, 1965). “This was, of course, absurd in view of Mr. Kerr’s longand courageous battle to uphold academic freedom and students’ rights in theface of those right-wing pressures that abound in California.” Othercommentators pictured Mr. Kerr as an innocent victim caught between theconflicting pressures of the “conservatives” on the Board of Regents and the“liberals” on the faculty. But, in fact and in logic, the middle of the road canlead to no other final destination—and it is clear that the rebels chose ClarkKerr as their first target, not in spite of, but because of his record.Now project what would happen if the technique of the Berkeley rebellion wererepeated on a national scale. Contrary to the fanatical belief of its advocates,compromise does not satisfy, but dissatisfies everybody; it does not lead togeneral fulfillment, but to general frustration; those who try to be all thingsto all men end up by not being anything to anyone. And more: the partial victoryof an unjust claim encourages the claimant to try further; the partial defeat ofa just claim discourages and paralyzes the victim. If a determined, disciplinedgang of statists were to make an assault on the crumbling remnants of a mixedeconomy, boldly and explicitly proclaiming the collectivist tenets which thecountry had accepted by tacit default—what resistance would they encounter? Thedispirited, demoralized, embittered majority would remain lethargicallyindifferent to any public event. And many would support the gang, at first,moved by a desperate, incoherent frustration, by a need to protest, not knowingfully against what, by a blind desire to strike out somehow at the suffocatinghopelessness of the status quo.Who would feel morally inspired to fight for Johnson’s “consensus”? Who foughtfor the aimless platitudes of the Kerensky government in Russia—of the WeimarRepublic in Germany—of the Nationalist government in China?But no matter how badly demoralized and philosophically disarmed a country mightbe, it has to reach a certain psychological turning point before it can bepushed from a state of semi-freedom into surrender to full-fledged dictatorship.And this was the main ideological purpose of the student rebellion’s leaders,whoever they were: to condition the country to accept force as the means ofsettling political controversies.Observe the ideological precedents which the Berkeley rebels were striving toestablish: all of them involved the abrogation of rights and the advocacy offorce. These notions have been publicized, yet their meaning has been largelyignored and left unanswered.1. The main issue was the attempt to make the country accept mass civildisobedience as a proper and valid tool of political action. This attempt hasbeen made repeatedly in connection with the civil rights movement. But there theissue was confused by the fact that the Negroes were the victims of legalizedinjustice and, therefore, the matter of breaching legality did not becomeunequivocally clear. The country took it as a fight for justice, not as anassault on the law.Civil disobedience may be justifiable, in some cases, when and if an individualdisobeys a law in order to bring an issue to court, as a test case. Such anaction involves respect for legality and a protest directed only at a particularlaw which the individual seeks an opportunity to prove to be unjust. The same istrue of a group of individuals when and if the risks involved are their own.But there is no justification, in a civilized society, for the kind of masscivil disobedience that involves the violation of the rights ofothers—regardless of whether the demonstrators’ goal is good or evil. The enddoes not justify the means. No one’s rights can be secured by the violation ofthe rights of others. Mass disobedience is an assault on the concept of rights:it is a mob’s defiance of legality as such.The forcible occupation of another man’s property or the obstruction of a publicthoroughfare is so blatant a violation of rights that an attempt to justify itbecomes an abrogation of morality. An individual has no right to do a “sit-in”in the home or office of a person he disagrees with—and he does not acquire sucha right by joining a gang. Rights are not a matter of numbers—and there can beno such thing, in law or in morality, as actions forbidden to an individual, butpermitted to a mob.The only power of a mob, as against an individual, is greater muscularstrength—i.e., plain, brute physical force. The attempt to solve social problemsby means of physical force is what a civilized society is established toprevent. The advocates of mass civil disobedience admit that their purpose isintimidation. A society that tolerates intimidation as a means of settlingdisputes—the physical intimidation of some men or groups by others—loses itsmoral right to exist as a social system, and its collapse does not take long tofollow.Politically, mass civil disobedience is appropriate only as a prelude to civilwar—as the declaration of a total break with a country’s political institutions.And the degree of today’s intellectual chaos and context-dropping was bestillustrated by some “conservative” California official who rushed to declarethat he objects to the Berkeley rebellion, but respects civil disobedience as avalid American tradition. “Don’t forget the Boston Tea Party,” he said,forgetting it.If the meaning of civil disobedience is somewhat obscured in the civil rightsmovement—and, therefore, the attitude of the country is inconclusive—thatmeaning becomes blatantly obvious when a sit-in is staged on a universitycampus. If the universities—the supposed citadels of reason, knowledge,scholarship, civilization—can be made to surrender to the rule of brute force,the rest of the country is cooked.2. To facilitate the acceptance of force, the Berkeley rebels attempted toestablish a special distinction between force and violence: force, they claimedexplicitly, is a proper form of social action, but violence is not. Theirdefinition of the terms was as follows: coercion by means of a literal physicalcontact is “violence” and is reprehensible; any other way of violating rights ismerely “force” and is a legitimate, peaceful method of dealing with opponents.For instance, if the rebels occupy the administration building, that is “force”;if policemen drag them out, that is “violence.” If Savio seizes a microphone hehas no right to use, that is “force”; if a policeman drags him away from it,that is “violence.”Consider the implications of that distinction as a rule of social conduct: ifyou come home one evening, find a stranger occupying your house and throw himout bodily, he has merely committed a peaceful act of “force,” but you areguilty of “violence,” and you are to be punished.The theoretical purpose of that grotesque absurdity is to establish a moralinversion: to make the initiation of force moral, and resistance to forceimmoral—and thus to obliterate the right of self-defense. The immediatepractical purpose is to foster the activities of the lowest political breed: theprovocateurs, who commit acts of force and place the blame on their victims.3. To justify that fraudulent distinction, the Berkeley rebels attempted toobliterate a legitimate one: the distinction between ideas and actions. Theyclaimed that freedom of speech means freedom of action and that no clear line ofdemarcation can be drawn between them.For instance, if they have the right to advocate any political viewpoint—theyclaimed—they have the right to organize, on campus, any off-campus activities,even those forbidden by law. As Professor Petersen put it, they were claimingthe right “to use the University as a sanctuary from which to make illegal raidson the general community.”The difference between an exchange of ideas and an exchange of blows isself-evident. The line of demarcation between freedom of speech and freedom ofaction is established by the ban on the initiation of physical force. It is onlywhen that ban is abrogated that such a problem can arise—but when that ban isabrogated, no political freedom of any kind can remain in existence.At a superficial glance, the rebels’ “package-deal” may seem to imply a sort ofanarchistic extension of freedom; but, in fact and in logic, it implies theexact opposite—which is a grim joke on those unthinking youths who joined therebellion in the name of “free speech.” If the freedom to express ideas wereequated with the freedom to commit crimes, it would not take long to demonstratethat no organized society can exist on such terms and, therefore, that theexpression of ideas has to be curtailed and some ideas have to be forbidden,just as criminal acts are forbidden. Thus the gullible would be brought toconcede that the right of free speech is undefinable and “impracticable.”4. An indication of such a motive was given by the rebels’ demand forunrestricted freedom of speech on campus—with the consequent “Filthy LanguageMovement.”There can be no such thing as the right to an unrestricted freedom of speech (orof action) on someone else’s property. The fact that the University at Berkeleyis owned by the state merely complicates the issue, but does not alter it. Theowners of a state university are the voters and taxpayers of that state. TheUniversity administration, appointed (directly or indirectly) by an electedofficial, is, theoretically, the agent of the owners—and has to act as such, solong as state universities exist. (Whether they should exist is a differentquestion.)In any undertaking or establishment involving more than one man, it is the owneror owners who set the rules and terms of appropriate conduct; the rest of theparticipants are free to go elsewhere and seek different terms, if they do notagree. There can be no such thing as the right to act on whim, to be exercisedby some participants at the expense of others.Students who attend a university have the right to expect that they will not besubjected to hearing the kind of obscenities for which the owner of asemi-decent barroom would bounce hoodlums out on the street. The right todetermine what sort of language is permissible belongs to the administration ofa university—fully as much as to the owner of a barroom.The technique of the rebels, as of all statists, was to take advantage of theprinciples of a free society in order to undercut them by an allegeddemonstration of their “impracticability”—in this case, the “impracticability”of the right of free speech. But, in fact, what they have demonstrated is apoint farthest removed from their goals: that no rights of any kind can beexercised without property rights.It is only on the basis of property rights that the sphere and application ofindividual rights can be defined in any given social situation. Without propertyrights, there is no way to solve or to avoid a hopeless chaos of clashing views,interests, demands, desires, and whims.There was no way for the Berkeley administration to answer the rebels except byinvoking property rights. It is obvious why neither modern “liberals” nor“conservatives” would care to do so. It is not the contradictions of a freesociety that the rebels were exposing and cashing-in on, but the contradictionsof a mixed economy.As to the question of what ideological policy should properly be adopted by theadministration of a state university, it is a question that has no answer. Thereare no solutions for the many contradictions inherent in the concept of “publicproperty,” particularly when the property is directly concerned with thedissemination of ideas. This is one of the reasons why the rebels would choose astate university as their first battleground.A good case could be made for the claim that a state university has no right toforbid the teaching or advocacy of any political viewpoint whatever, as, forinstance, of communism, since some of the taxpaying owners may be communists. Anequally good case could be made for the claim that a state university has noright to permit the teaching and advocacy of any political viewpoint which (as,for instance, communism) is a direct threat to the property, freedom, and livesof the majority of the taxpaying owners. Majority rule is not applicable in therealm of ideas; an individual’s convictions are not subject to a majority vote;but neither an individual nor a minority nor a majority should be forced tosupport their own destroyers.On the one hand, a government institution has no right to forbid the expressionof any ideas. On the other hand, a government institution has no right toharbor, assist, and finance the country’s enemies (as, for instance, thecollectors of funds for the Vietcong).The source of these contradictions does not lie in the principle of individualrights, but in their violation by the collectivist institution of “publicproperty.”This issue, however, has to be fought in the field of constitutional law, not oncampus. As students, the rebels have no greater rights in a state universitythan in a private one. As taxpayers, they have no greater rights than themillions of other California taxpayers involved. If they object to the policiesof the Board of Regents, they have no recourse except at the polls at the nextelection—if they can persuade a sufficient number of voters. This is a prettyslim chance—and this is a good argument against any type of “public property.”But it is not an issue to be solved by physical force.What is significant here is the fact that the rebels—who, to put it mildly, arenot champions of private property—refused to abide by the kind of majority rulewhich is inherent in public ownership. That is what they were opposing when theycomplained that universities have become servants of the “financial, industrial,and military establishment.” It is the rights of these particular groups oftaxpayers (the right to a voice in the management of state universities) thatthey were seeking to abrogate.If anyone needs proof of the fact that the advocates of public ownership are notseeking “democratic” control of property by majority rule, but control bydictatorship—this is one eloquent piece of evidence.5. As part of the ideological conditioning for that ultimate goal, the rebelsattempted to introduce a new variant on an old theme that has been the object ofan intense drive by all statist-collectivists for many years past: theobliteration of the difference between private action and government action.This has always been attempted by means of a “package-deal” ascribing to privatecitizens the specific violations constitutionally forbidden to the government,and thus destroying individual rights while freeing the government from anyrestrictions. The most frequent example of this technique consists of accusingprivate citizens of practicing “censorship” (a concept applicable only to thegovernment) and thus negating their right to disagree.59[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-59]The new variant provided by the rebels was their protest against alleged “doublejeopardy.” It went as follows: if the students commit illegal acts, they will bepunished by the courts and must not, therefore, be penalized by the universityfor the same offense.“Double jeopardy” is a concept applicable only to the government, and only toone branch of the government, the judiciary, and only to a specific judiciaryaction: it means that a man must not be put on trial twice for the same offense.To equate private judgment and action (or, in this context, a governmentofficial’s judgment and action) with a court trial is worse than absurd. It isan outrageous attempt to obliterate the right to moral judgment and moralaction. It is a demand that a lawbreaker suffer no civil consequences of hiscrime.If such a notion were accepted, individuals would have no right to evaluate theconduct of others nor to act according to their evaluation. They would have towait until a court had decreed whether a given man was guilty or innocent—andeven after he was pronounced guilty, they would have no right to change theirbehavior toward him and would have to leave the task of penalizing himexclusively to the government.For instance, if a bank employee were found guilty of embezzlement and hadserved his sentence, the bank would have no right to refuse to give him back hisformer job—since a refusal would constitute “double jeopardy.”Or: a government official would have no right to watch the legality of theactions of his department’s employees, nor to lay down rules for their strictobservance of the law, but would have to wait until a court had found themguilty of law-breaking—and would have to reinstate them in their jobs, afterthey had served their sentences for influence-peddling or bribe-taking ortreason.The notion of morality as a monopoly of the government (and of a single branchor group within the government) is so blatantly a part of the ideology of adictatorship that the rebels’ attempt to get away with it is truly shocking.6. The rebels’ notion that universities should be run by students and facultieswas an open, explicit assault on the right attacked implicitly by all theirother notions: the right of private property. And of all the variousstatist-collectivist systems, the one they chose as their goal is,politico-economically, the least practical; intellectually, the leastdefensible; morally, the most shameful: guild socialism.Guild socialism is a system that abolishes the exercise of individual ability bychaining men into groups according to their line of work, and delivering thework into the group’s power, as its exclusive domain, with the group dictatingthe rules, standards, and practices of how the work is to be done and who shallor shall not do it.Guild socialism is the concrete-bound, routine-bound mentality of a savage,elevated into a social theory. Just as a tribe of savages seizes a piece ofjungle territory and claims it as a monopoly by reason of the fact of beingthere—so guild socialism grants a monopoly, not on a jungle forest orwater-hole, but on a factory or a university—not by reason of a man’s ability,achievement, or even “public service,” but by reason of the fact that he isthere.Just as savages have no concept of causes or consequences, of past or future,and no concept of efficacy beyond the muscular power of their tribe—so guildsocialists, finding themselves in the midst of an industrial civilization,regard its institutions as phenomena of nature and see no reason why the gangshould not seize them.If there is any one proof of a man’s incompetence, it is the stagnant mentalityof a worker (or of a professor) who, doing some small, routine job in a vastundertaking, does not care to look beyond the lever of a machine (or the lecternof a classroom), does not choose to know how the machine (or the classroom) gotthere or what makes his job possible, and proclaims that the management of theundertaking is parasitical and unnecessary. Managerial work—the organization andintegration of human effort into purposeful, large-scale, long-rangeactivities—is, in the realm of action, what man’s conceptual faculty is in therealm of cognition. It is beyond the grasp and, therefore, is the first targetof the self-arrested, sensory-perceptual mentality.If there is any one way to confess one’s own mediocrity, it is the willingnessto place one’s work in the absolute power of a group, particularly a group ofone’s professional colleagues. Of any forms of tyranny, this is the worst; it isdirected against a single human attribute: the mind—and against a single enemy:the innovator. The innovator, by definition, is the man who challenges theestablished practices of his profession. To grant a professional monopoly to anygroup is to sacrifice human ability and abolish progress; to advocate such amonopoly is to confess that one has nothing to sacrifice.Guild socialism is the rule of, by, and for mediocrity. Its cause is a society’sintellectual collapse; its consequence is a quagmire of stagnation; itshistorical example is the guild system of the Middle Ages (or, in modern times,the fascist system of Italy under Mussolini).The rebels’ notion that students (along with faculties) should run universitiesand determine their curricula is a crude absurdity. If an ignorant youth comesto an institution of learning in order to acquire knowledge of a certainscience, by what means is he to determine what is relevant and how he should betaught? (In the process of learning, he can judge only whether his teacher’spresentation is clear or unclear, logical or contradictory; he cannot determinethe proper course and method of teaching, ahead of any knowledge of thesubject.) It is obvious that a student who demands the right to run a university(or to decide who should run it) has no knowledge of the concept of knowledge,that his demand is self-contradictory and disqualifies him automatically. Thesame is true—with a much heavier burden of moral guilt—of the professor whotaught him to make such demands and who supports them.Would you care to be treated in a hospital where the methods of therapy weredetermined by a vote of doctors and patients?Yet the absurdity of these examples is merely more obvious—not more irrationalnor more vicious—than the standard collectivist claim that workers should takeover the factories created by men whose achievement they can neither grasp norequal. The basic epistemological-moral premise and pattern are the same: theobliteration of reason obliterates the concept of reality, which obliterates theconcept of achievement, which obliterates the concept of the distinction betweenthe earned and the unearned. Then the incompetent can seize factories, theignorant can seize universities, the brutes can seize scientific researchlaboratories—and nothing is left in a human society but the power of whim andfist.What makes guild socialism cruder than (but not different from) moststatist-collectivist theories is the fact that it represents the other, theusually unmentioned, side of altruism: it is the voice, not of the givers, butof the receivers. While most altruistic theorists proclaim “the common good” astheir justification, advocate self-sacrificial service to the “community,” andkeep silent about the exact nature or identity of the recipients ofsacrifices—guild socialists brazenly declare themselves to be the recipients andpresent their claims to the community, demanding its services. If they want amonopoly on a given profession, they claim, the rest of the community must giveup the right to practice it. If they want a university, they claim, thecommunity must provide it.And if “selfishness” is taken, by the altruists, to mean the sacrifice of othersto self, I challenge them to name an uglier example of it than the pronouncementof the little Berkeley collectivist who declared: “Our idea is that theuniversity is composed of faculty, students, books, and ideas. In a literalsense, the administration is merely there to make sure the sidewalks are keptclean. It should be the servant of the faculty and the students.”What did that little disembodied mystic omit from his idea of a university? Whopays the salaries of the faculty? Who provides the livelihood of the students?Who publishes the books? Who builds the classrooms, the libraries, thedormitories—and the sidewalks? Leave it to a modern “mystic of muscle” todisplay the kind of contempt for “vulgar material concerns” that anold-fashioned mystic would not quite dare permit himself.Who—besides the university administration—is to be the voiceless, rightless“servant” and sidewalk-sweeper of the faculty and students? No, not only the menof productive genius who create the material wealth that makes universitiespossible, not only the “tycoons of big business,” not only the “financial,industrial, and military establishment”—but every taxpayer of the state ofCalifornia, every man who works for a living, high or low, every human being whoearns his sustenance, struggles with his budget, pays for what he gets, and doesnot permit himself to evade the reality of “vulgar material concerns.”Such is the soul revealed by the ideology of the Berkeley rebellion. Such is themeaning of the rebels’ demands and of the ideological precedents they weretrying to establish.Observe the complexity, the equivocations, the tricks, the twists, theintellectual acrobatics performed by these avowed advocates of unbridledfeelings—and the ideological consistency of these activists who claim to possessno ideology.The first round of the student rebellion has not gone over too well. In spite ofthe gratuitous “puff-job” done by the press, the attitude of the public is amixture of bewilderment, indifference, and antagonism. Indifference—because theevasive vagueness of the press reports was self-defeating: people do notunderstand what it is all about and see no reason to care. Antagonism—becausethe American public still holds a profound respect for universities (as theymight be and ought to be, but are not any longer), and the commentators’half-laudatory, half-humorous platitudes about the “idealism of youth” have notsucceeded in white-washing the fact that brute physical force was brought to auniversity campus. That fact has aroused a vague sense of uneasiness in people,a sense of undefined, apprehensive condemnation.The rebellion’s attempt to invade other campuses did not get very far. Therewere some disgraceful proclamations of appeasement by some universityadministrators and commencement orators this spring, but no discernible publicsympathy.There were a few instances of a proper attitude on the part of universityadministrations—an attitude of firmness, dignity and uncompromisingseverity—notably at Columbia University. A commencement address by Dr. Meng,President of Hunter College, is also worth noting. Declaring that the violationof the rights of others “is intolerable” in an academic community and that anystudent or teacher guilty of it deserves “instant expulsion,” he said:“Yesterday’s ivory tower has become today’s foxhole. The leisure of the theoryclass is increasingly occupied in the organization of picket lines, teach-ins,think-ins, and stake-outs of one sort or another.”60[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-60]But even though the student rebellion has not aroused much public sympathy, themost ominous aspect of the situation is the fact that it has not met anyideological opposition, that the implications of the rebels’ stand have neitherbeen answered nor rejected, that such criticism as it did evoke was, with rareexceptions, evasively superficial.As a trial balloon, the rebellion has accomplished its leaders’ purpose: it hasdemonstrated that they may have gone a bit too far, bared their teeth and clawsa bit too soon, and antagonized many potential sympathizers, even among the“liberals”—but that the road ahead is empty, with no intellectual barricades insight.The battle is to continue. The long-range intentions of the student rebellionhave been proclaimed repeatedly by the same activists who proclaim theirexclusive dedication to the immediate moment. The remnants of the “Free SpeechMovement” at Berkeley have been reorganized into a “Free Student Union,” whichis making militant noises in preparation for another assault. No matter howabsurd their notions, the rebels’ assaults are directed at the most importantphilosophical-political issues of our age. These issues cannot be ignored,evaded, or bribed away by compromise. When brute force is on the march,compromise is the red carpet. When reason is attacked, common sense is notenough.Neither a man nor a nation can exist without some form of philosophy. A man hasthe free will to think or not; if he does not, he takes what he gets. The freewill of a nation is its intellectuals; the rest of the country takes what theyoffer; they set the terms, the values, the course, the goal.In the absence of intellectual opposition, the rebels’ notions will graduallycome to be absorbed into the culture. The uncontested absurdities of today arethe accepted slogans of tomorrow. They come to be accepted by degrees, byprecedent, by implication, by erosion, by default, by dint of constant pressureon one side and constant retreat on the other—until the day when they aresuddenly declared to be the country’s official ideology. That is the way welfarestatism came to be accepted in this country.What we are witnessing today is an acceleration of the attempts to cash-in onthe ideological implications of welfare statism and to push beyond it. Thecollege rebels are merely the commandos, charged with the task of establishingideological beachheads for a full-scale advance of all the statist-collectivistforces against the remnants of capitalism in America; and part of their task isthe take-over of the ideological control of America’s universities.If the collectivists succeed, the terrible historical irony will lie in the factthat what looks like a noisy, reckless, belligerent confidence is, in fact, ahysterical bluff. The acceleration of collectivism’s advance is not the march ofwinners, but the blind stampede of losers. Collectivism has lost the battle formen’s minds; its advocates know it; their last chance consists of the fact thatno one else knows it. If they are to cash-in on decades of philosophicalcorruption, on all the gnawing, scrapping, scratching, burrowing to dig a mazeof philosophical rat-holes which is about to cave in, it’s now or never.As a cultural-intellectual power and a moral ideal, collectivism died in WorldWar II. If we are still rolling in its direction, it is only by the inertia of avoid and the momentum of disintegration. A social movement that began with theponderous, brain-cracking, dialectical constructs of Hegel and Marx, and ends upwith a horde of morally unwashed children stamping their foot and shrieking: “Iwant it now!”—is through.All over the world, while mowing down one helpless nation after another,collectivism has been steadily losing the two elements that hold the key to thefuture: the brains of mankind and its youth. In regard to the first, observeBritain’s “brain drain.” In regard to the second, consider the fact (which wasnot mentioned in the press comments on the student rebellion) that in apredominant number of American universities, the political views of the facultyare perceptibly more “liberal” than those of the student body. (The same is trueof the youth of the country at large—as against the older generation, thethirty-five to fifty age bracket, who were reared under the New Deal and whohold the country’s leadership, at present.) That is one of the facts which thestudent rebellion was intended to disguise.This is not to say that the anti-collectivists represent a numerical majorityamong college students. The passive supporters of the status quo are always themajority in any group, culture, society, or age. But it is not by passivemajorities that the trends of a nation are set. Who sets them? Anyone who caresto do so, if he has the intellectual ammunition to win on the battlefield ofideas, which belongs to those who do care. Those who don’t, are merely socialballast by their own choice and predilection.The fact that the “non-liberals” among college students (and among the youth ofthe world) can be identified at present only as “anti-collectivists” is thedangerous element and the question mark in today’s situation. They are the youngpeople who are not ready to give up, who want to fight against a swamp of evil,but do not know what is the good. They have rejected the sick, worn platitudesof collectivism (along with all of its cultural manifestations, including thecult of despair and depravity—the studied mindlessness of jerk-and-moan dancing,singing or acting—the worship of anti-heroes—the experience of looking up to thedissection of a psychotic’s brain, for inspiration, and to the bare feet of aninarticulate brute, for guidance—the stupor of reduction to sensory stimuli—thesense of life of a movie such as Tom Jones). But they have found, as yet, nodirection, no consistent philosophy, no rational values, no long-range goals.Until and unless they do, their incoherent striving for a better future willcollapse before the final thrust of the collectivists.Historically, we are now in a kind of intellectual no man’s land—and the futurewill be determined by those who venture out of the trenches of the status quo.Our direction will depend on whether the venturers are crusaders fighting for anew Renaissance or scavengers pouncing upon the wreckage left of yesterday’sbattles. The crusaders are not yet ready; the scavengers are.That is why—in a deeper sense than the little zombies of college campuses willever grasp—“Now, now, now!” is the last slogan and cry of the ragged, beardedstragglers who had once been an army rallied by the promise of a scientifically(!) planned society.The two most accurate characterizations of the student rebellion, given in thepress, were: “Political Existentialism” and “Castroite.” Both are conceptspertaining to intellectual bankruptcy: the first stands for the abdication ofreason—the second, for that state of hysterical panic which brandishes a fist asits sole recourse.In preparation for its published survey (March 22, 1965), Newsweek conducted anumber of polls among college students at large, on various subjects, one ofwhich was the question of who are the students’ heroes. The editors of Newsweekinformed me that my name appeared on the resultant list, and sent an interviewerto question me about my views on the state of modern universities. For reasonsbest known to themselves, they chose not to publish any part of that interview.What I said (in briefer form) was what I am now saying in this article—with theexception of the concluding remarks which follow and which I want to addressmost particularly to those college students who chose me as one of their heroes.Young people are constantly asking what they can do to fight today’s disastroustrends; they are seeking some form of action, and wrecking their hopes in blindalleys, particularly every four years, at election time. Those who do notrealize that the battle is ideological had better give up, because they have nochance. Those who do realize it should grasp that the student rebellion offersthem a chance to train themselves for the kind of battle they will have to fightin the world, when they leave the university; a chance, not only to trainthemselves, but to win the first rounds of that wider battle.If they seek an important cause, they have the opportunity to fight the rebels,to fight ideologically, on moral-intellectual grounds—by identifying andexposing the meaning of the rebels’ demands, by naming and answering the basicprinciples which the rebels dare not admit. The battle consists, above all, ofproviding the country (or all those within hearing) with ideological answers—afield of action from which the older generation has deserted under fire.Ideas cannot be fought except by means of better ideas. The battle consists, notof opposing, but of exposing; not of denouncing, but of disproving; not ofevading, but of boldly proclaiming a full, consistent, and radical alternative.This does not mean that rational students should enter debates with the rebelsor attempt to convert them: one cannot argue with self-confessed irrationalists.The goal of an ideological battle is to enlighten the vast, helpless, bewilderedmajority in the universities—and in the country at large—or, rather, the mindsof those among the majority who are struggling to find answers or those who,having heard nothing but collectivist sophistries for years, have withdrawn inrevulsion and given up.The first goal of such a battle is to wrest from a handful of beatniks the titleof “spokesmen for American youth,” which the press is so anxious to grant them.The first step is to make oneself heard, on the campus and outside. There aremany civilized ways to do it: protest meetings, public petitions, speeches,pamphlets, letters-to-editors. It is a much more important issue than picketingthe United Nations or parading in support of the House Un-American ActivitiesCommittee. And while such futile groups as Young Americans for Freedom areengaged in such undertakings, they are letting the collectivist vanguard speakin their name—in the name of American college students—without any audible soundof protest.But in order to be heard, one must have something to say. To have that, one mustknow one’s case. One must know it fully, logically, consistently, all the waydown to philosophical fundamentals. One cannot hope to fight nuclear expertswith Republican pea-shooters. And the leaders behind the student rebellion areexperts at their particular game.But they are dangerous only to those who stare at the issues out of focus andhope to fight ideas by means of faith, feelings, and fund-raising. You would besurprised how quickly the ideologists of collectivism retreat when theyencounter a confident, intellectual adversary. Their case rests on appealing tohuman confusion, ignorance, dishonesty, cowardice, despair. Take the side theydare not approach: appeal to human intelligence.Collectivism has lost the two crucial weapons that raised it to world power andmade all of its victories possible: intellectuality and idealism, or reason andmorality. It had to lose them precisely at the height of its success, since itsclaim to both was a fraud: the full, actual reality ofsocialist-communist-fascist states has demonstrated the brute irrationality ofcollectivist systems and the inhumanity of altruism as a moral code.Yet reason and morality are the only weapons that determine the course ofhistory. The collectivists dropped them, because they had no right to carrythem. Pick them up; you have."},{"pageContent":"23. ALIENATIONby Nathaniel BrandenAnd how am I to face the oddsof man’s bedevilment and God’s?I, a stranger and afraidin a world I never made.In the writings of contemporary psychologists and sociologists, one encountersthese lines from A. E. Housman’s poem more and more often today—quoted as aneloquent summation of the sense of life and psychological plight oftwentieth-century man.In book after book of social commentary, one finds the same message: modern manis overwhelmed by anxiety, modern man suffers from an “identity crisis,” modernman is alienated. “ ‘Who am I?’ ‘Where am I going?’ ‘Do I belong?’: these arethe crucial questions man asks himself in modern mass society,” declares thesociologist and psychoanalyst Hendrik M. Ruitenbeek, in The Individual and theCrowd—A Study of Identity in America.61[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-61]The concept of alienation, in its original psychiatric usage, denoted thementally ill, the severely mentally ill—often, particularly in legal contexts,the insane. It conveyed the notion of the breakdown of rationality andself-determination, the notion of a person driven by forces which he cannotgrasp or control, which are expe-rienced by him as compelling and alien, so thathe feels estranged from himself.The Objectivist Newsletter, July, August, and September 1965.Centuries earlier, medieval theologians had spoken with distress of man’salienation from God—of an over-concern with the world of the senses that causedman to become lost to himself, estranged from his proper spiritual estate.It was the philosopher Hegel who introduced the concept of alienation (outsideof its psychiatric context) to the modern world. The history of man, maintainedHegel, is the history of man’s self-alienation: man is blind to his trueessence, he is lost in the “dead world” of social institutions and of property,which he himself has created, he is estranged from the Universal Being of whichhe is a part—and human progress consists of man’s motion toward that Whole, ashe transcends the limitations of his individual perceptions.“Alienation” was taken over by Karl Marx and given a narrower, less cosmicmeaning. He applied the concept primarily to the worker. The worker’s alienationwas inevitable, he asserted, with the development of the division of labor,specialization, exchange, and private property. The worker must sell hisservices; thus he comes to view himself as a “commodity,” he becomes alienatedfrom the product of his own labor, and his work is no longer the expression ofhis powers, of his inner self. The worker, who is alive, is ruled by that whichis “dead” (i.e., capital, machinery). The consequence, says Marx, is spiritualimpoverishment and mutilation: the worker is alienated from himself, from natureand from his fellow-men; he exists only as an animated object, not as a humanbeing.Since the time of Marx, the idea of alienation has been used more and moreextensively by psychologists, sociologists, and philosophers—gathering to itselfa wide variety of usages and meanings. But from Hegel and Marx onward, thereappears to be an almost universal reluctance, on the part of those who employthe term, to define it precisely; it is as if one were expected to feel itsmeaning, rather than to grasp it conceptually. In a two-volume collection ofessays entitled Alienation, the editor, Gerald Sykes, specifically scorns thosewho are too eager for a definition of the term; haste for a definition, hedeclares, reveals that one suffers from “an advanced case of—alienation.”62[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-62]Certain writers—notably those of a Freudian or Jungian orientation—declare thatthe complexity of modern industrial society has caused man to become“overcivilized,” to have lost touch with the deeper roots of his being, to havebecome alienated from his “instinctual nature.” Others—notably those of anexistentialist or Zen Buddhist orientation—complain that our advancedtechnological society compels man to live too intellectually, to be ruled byabstractions, thus alienating him from the real world which can be experiencedin its “wholeness” only via his emotions. Others—notably those of a petulantmediocrity orientation—decry specifically the alienation of the artist; theyassert that, with the vanishing of the age of patrons, with the artist thrown onhis own resources to struggle in the marketplace—which is ruled by“philistines”—the artist is condemned to fight a losing battle for thepreservation of his spiritual integrity: he is too besieged by materialtemptations.Most of these writers declare that the problem of alienation—and of man’s searchfor identity—is not new, but has been a source of anguish to man in every ageand culture. But they insist that today, in Western civilization—above all, inAmerica—the problem has reached an unprecedented severity. It has become acrisis.What is responsible for this crisis? What has alienated man and deprived him ofidentity? The answer given by most writers on alienation is not always statedexplicitly, but—in their countless disparaging references to “the dehumanizingeffects of industrialism,” “soul-destroying commercialism,” “the aridrationalism of a technological culture,” “the vulgar materialism of the West,”etc.—the villain in their view of things, the destroyer whom they hold chieflyresponsible, is not hard to identify. It is capitalism.This should not be startling. Since its birth, capitalism has been made thescapegoat responsible for almost every real or imagined evil denounced byanyone. As the distinguished economist Ludwig von Mises observes:Nothing is more unpopular today than the free market economy, i.e., capitalism.Everything that is considered unsatisfactory in present-day conditions ischarged to capitalism. The atheists make capitalism responsible for the survivalof Christianity. But the papal encyclicals blame capitalism for the spread ofirreligion and the sins of our contemporaries, and the Protestant churches andsects are no less vigorous in their indictment of capitalist greed. Friends ofpeace consider our wars as an offshoot of capitalist imperialism. But theadamant nationalist warmongers of Germany and Italy indicted capitalism for its“bourgeois” pacifism, contrary to human nature and to the inescapable laws ofhistory. Sermonizers accuse capitalism of disrupting the family and fosteringlicentiousness. But the “progressives” blame capitalism for the preservation ofallegedly outdated rules of sexual restraint. Almost all men agree that povertyis an outcome of capitalism. On the other hand many deplore the fact thatcapitalism, in catering lavishly to the wishes of people intent upon gettingmore amenities and a better living, promotes a crass materialism. Thesecontradictory accusations of capitalism cancel one another. But the fact remainsthat there are few people left who would not condemn capitalism altogether.63[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-63]It is true that a great many men suffer from a chronic feeling of inneremptiness, of spiritual impoverishment, the sense of lacking personal identity.It is true that a great many men feel alienated—from something—even if theycannot say from what—from themselves or other men or the universe. And it isprofoundly significant that capitalism should be blamed for this. Not becausethere is any justification for the charge, but because, by analyzing the reasonsgiven for the accusation, one can learn a good deal about the nature and meaningof men’s sense of alienation and non-identity—and, simultaneously, about thepsychological motives that give rise to hostility toward capitalism.The writers on alienation, as I have indicated, are not an intellectuallyhomogeneous group. They differ in many areas: in their view of what the problemof alienation exactly consists of, in the aspects of modern industrial societyand a free-market economy which they find most objectionable, in theexplicitness with which they identify capitalism as the villain, and in thedetails of their own political inclinations. Some of these writers aresocialists, some are fascists, some are medievalists, some are supporters of thewelfare state, some scorn politics altogether. Some believe that the problem ofalienation is largely or entirely solvable by a new system of socialorganization; others believe that the problem, at bottom, is metaphysical andthat no entirely satisfactory solution can be found.Fortunately for the purposes of this analysis, however, there is onecontemporary writer who manages to combine in his books virtually all of themajor errors perpetrated by commentators in this field: psychologist andsociologist Erich Fromm. Let us, therefore, consider Fromm’s view of man and histheory of alienation in some detail.Man, declares Erich Fromm, is “the freak of the universe.”This theme is crucial and central throughout his writings: man is radicallydifferent from all other living species, he is “estranged” and “alienated” fromnature, he is overwhelmed by a feeling of “isolation” and “separateness”—he haslost, in the process of evolution, the undisturbed tranquillity of otherorganisms, he has lost the “pre-human harmony” with nature which is enjoyed byan animal, a bird, or a worm. The source of his curse is the fact that hepossesses a mind.“Self-awareness, reason, and imagination,” Fromm writes in Man for Himself,“have disrupted the ‘harmony’ which characterizes animal existence. Theiremergence has made man into an anomaly, into the freak of the universe.” Mancannot live as an animal: he is not equipped to adapt himself automatically andunthinkingly to his environment. An animal blindly “repeats the pattern of thespecies,” its behavior is biologically prescribed and stereotyped, it “eitherfits in or it dies out”—but it does not have to solve the problem of survival,it is not conscious of life and death as an issue. Man does and is; this is histragedy. “Reason, man’s blessing, is also his curse. . . .”64[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-64]In The Art of Loving, he writes:What is essential in the existence of man is the fact that he has emerged fromthe animal kingdom, from instinctive adaptation, that he has transcendednature—although he never leaves it; he is part of it—and yet once torn away fromnature, he cannot return to it; once thrown out of paradise—a state of originaloneness with nature—cherubim with flaming swords block his way, if he should tryto return.65 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-65]That man’s rational faculty deprives man of “paradise,” alienating andestranging him from nature, is clearly revealed, says Fromm, in the “existentialdichotomies” which his mind dooms man to confront—“contradictions” inherent inlife itself. What are these tragic “dichotomies”? He names three as central andbasic. Man’s mind permits him to “visualize his own end: death”—yet “his bodymakes him want to be alive.”66 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-66] Man’snature contains innumerable potentialities—yet “the short span of his life doesnot permit their full realization under even the most favorable circumstances.”67 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-67] Man “must be alone when he has tojudge or to make decisions solely by the power of his reason”—yet “he cannotbear to be alone, to be unrelated to his fellow men.”68[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-68]These “contradictions,” says Fromm, constitute the dilemma of the “humansituation”—contradictions with which man is compelled to struggle, but which hecan never resolve or annul, and which alienate man from himself, from his fellowmen, and from nature.If the logic of the foregoing is not readily perceivable, the reason does notlie in the brevity of the synopsis. It lies in the unmitigated arbitrariness ofFromm’s manner of presenting his ideas; he writes, not like a scientist, butlike an oracle who is not obliged to give reasons or proof.It is true that man differs fundamentally from all other living species, byvirtue of possessing a rational, conceptual faculty. It is true that, for man,survival is a problem to be solved—by the exercise of his intelligence. It istrue that no man lives long enough to exhaust his every potentiality. It is truethat every man is alone, separate, and unique. It is true that thinking requiresindependence. These are the facts that grant glory to man’s existence. Why wouldone choose to regard these facts as a terrifying cosmic paradox and to see inthem the evidence of monumentally tragic human problems?There are men who resent the fact that their life is their responsibility andthat the task of their reason is to discover how to maintain it. Large numbersof such men—men who prefer the state of animals—may be found (or used to befound) sleeping on the benches of any public park; they are called tramps. Thereare men who find thought abnormal and unnatural. Large numbers of such men maybe found in mental institutions; they are called morons. There are men whosuffer a chronic preoccupation with death; who bitterly resent the fact thatthey cannot simultaneously be a concert pianist, a business tycoon, a railroadengineer, a baseball player, and a deep-sea diver; who find their existence asseparate, independent entities an unendurable burden. Large numbers of such menmay be found in the offices of psychotherapists; they are called neurotics. Butwhy does Fromm choose tramps, morons, and neurotics as his symbols of humanity,as his image of man—and why does he choose to claim that theirs is the state inwhich all men are destined to start, and out of which they must struggle torise?Fromm does not tell us. Nowhere does he establish any logical connection betweenthe facts he observes and the conclusions he announces.If we are not to regard his conclusions as arbitrary—as mystical revelations, ineffect—then we must assume that he does not bother to give reasons for hisposition because he regards his conclusions as virtually self-evident, asirresistibly conveyed by the facts he cites, easily available to everyone’sexperience and introspection. But if he feels it is readily apparent, byintrospection, that the facts he cites constitute an agonizing problem forman—the most appropriate answer one can give is: “Speak for yourself, brother!”Reason, Fromm insists, and the self-awareness which reason makes possible, turnsman’s “separate, disunited existence” into an “unbearable prison”—and man “wouldbecome insane could he not liberate himself from this prison and reach out,unite himself in some form or other with men, with the world outside.”69[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-69]The following paragraph is typical of what Fromm considers an explanation:The experience of separateness arouses anxiety; it is, indeed, the source of allanxiety. Being separate means being cut off, without any capacity to use myhuman powers. Hence to be separate means to be helpless, unable to grasp theworld—things and people—actively; it means that the world can invade me withoutmy ability to react. Thus, separateness is the source of intense anxiety. Beyondthat, it arouses shame and the feeling of guilt. This experience of guilt andshame in separateness is expressed in the Biblical story of Adam and Eve. AfterAdam and Eve have eaten of the “tree of knowledge of good and evil,” after theyhave disobeyed . . . after they have become human by having emancipatedthemselves from the original animal harmony with nature, i.e., after their birthas human beings—they saw “that they were naked—and they were ashamed.” Should weassume that a myth as old and elementary as this has the prudish morals of thenineteenth-century outlook, and that the important point the story wants toconvey to us is the embarrassment that their genitals were visible? This canhardly be so, and by understanding the story in a Victorian spirit, we miss themain point, which seems to be the following: after man and woman have becomeaware of themselves and of each other, they are aware of their separateness, andof their difference, inasmuch as they belong to different sexes. But whilerecognizing their separateness they remain strangers, because they have not yetlearned to love each other (as is also made very clear by the fact that Adamdefends himself by blaming Eve, rather than by trying to defend her). Theawareness of human separation, without reunion by love—is the source of shame.It is at the same time the source of guilt and anxiety.70[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-70]All social institutions, all cultures, all religions and philosophies, allprogress, asserts Fromm, are motivated by man’s need to escape the terrifyingsense of helplessness and aloneness to which his reason condemns him.The necessity to find ever-new solutions for the contradictions in hisexistence, to find ever-higher forms of unity with nature, his fellowmen andhimself, is the source of all psychic forces which motivate man. . . .71[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-71]In Man for Himself, Fromm states that only through “reason, productiveness andlove” can man solve the problem of his “separateness” and achieve a “new union”with the world around him. Fromm’s claim to be an advocate of reason isdisingenuous, to say the least. He speaks of reason and love as being “only twodifferent forms of comprehending the world.”72[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-72] As if this were not an unequivocalproof of his mysticism, he goes on to speak, in The Art of Loving, of the“paradoxical logic” of Eastern religions, which, he tells us approvingly, is notencumbered by the Aristotelian law of contradiction and which teaches that “mancan perceive reality only in contradictions.”73[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-73] (Hegel and Marx, heasserts—correctly—belong to his “paradoxical” epistemological line.) Hisdiscussion of what he means by “productiveness” is scarcely more gratifying.In The Art of Loving, written some years after Man for Himself, he declares thatreason and productive work, though certainly important, provide only partialand, by themselves, very unsatisfactory solutions: the “unity” they achieve is“not interpersonal,” and the “desire for interpersonal fusion is the mostpowerful striving in man.”74 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-74] Frommpulls an unexplained switch at this point. What began as a problem between manand nature is now to be solved (in some unspecified manner) by human“togetherness.” One is not surprised; in reading Fromm, this is the sort ofpronouncement for which one is waiting—there is a sense of inevitability aboutit. Love and love alone, he tells us with wonderful originality, can allay man’sterror—“Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of humanexistence.”75 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-75]Only through “relating” oneself positively to others, only through feeling “careand responsibility” for them—while preserving one’s personal integrity, he addssomewhat mysteriously—can man establish new ties, a new union, that will releasehim from alienated aloneness.The cat is now ready to be let fully out of the bag. The preceding is Fromm’sview of alienation as a metaphysical problem; its full meaning and implicationbecome clear when one turns to his social-political analysis of alienation. Inthe context of the latter, one can see clearly what sort of “ties,” what sort of“union” and what sort of “love” Fromm has in mind.Every society, as a system of human relationships, may be evaluated by how wellit satisfies man’s basic psychological needs, says Fromm—i.e., he explains, bythe possibilities for love, relatedness, and the experience of personal identitywhich it offers man.Capitalism, Fromm declares, has been disastrous in this regard: far from solvingthe problem of man’s alienation, it worsens it immeasurably in many respects. Inliberating man from medieval regulation and authority, in breaking the chains ofecclesiastical, economic and social tyranny, in destroying the “stability” ofthe feudal order, capitalism and individualism thrust upon man an unprecedentedfreedom that was “bound to create a deep feeling of insecurity, powerlessness,doubt, aloneness, and anxiety.”76 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-76]Scratch a collectivist and you will usually find a medievalist. Fromm is not anexception. Like so many socialists, he is a glamorizer of the Middle Ages. Heperfunctorily acknowledges the faults of that historical period—but incontrasting it with the capitalism that succeeded it, he is enchanted by what heregards as its virtues.What characterizes medieval in contrast to modern society is its lack ofindividual freedom. . . . But although a person was not free in the modernsense, neither was he alone and isolated. In having a distinct, unchangeable,and unquestionable place in the social world from the moment of birth, man wasrooted in a structuralized whole, and thus life had a meaning which left noplace, and no need, for doubt. A person was identical with his role in society;he was a peasant, an artisan, a knight, and not an individual who happened tohave this or that occupation. The social order was conceived as a natural order,and being a definite part of it gave man a feeling of security and of belonging.There was comparatively little competition. One was born into a certain economicposition which guaranteed a livelihood determined by tradition, just as itcarried economic obligations to those higher in the social hierarchy. But withinthe limits of his social sphere the individual actually had much freedom toexpress his self in his work and in his emotional life. Although there was noindividualism in the modern sense of the unrestricted choice between manypossible ways of life (a freedom of choice which is largely abstract), there wasa great deal of concrete individualism in real life.77[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-77]It is not uncommon to encounter this sort of perspective on the Middle Ages,among writers on alienation. But what makes the above passage especiallyshocking and offensive, in the case of Fromm, is that he repeatedly professes tobe a lover of freedom and a valuer of human life.The complete lack of control over any aspect of one’s existence, the ruthlesssuppression of intellectual freedom, the paralyzing restrictions on any form ofindividual initiative and independence—these are cardinal characteristics of theMiddle Ages. But all of this is swept aside by Fromm—along with the famines, theplagues, the exhausting labor from sunrise to sunset, the suffocating routine,the superstitious terror, the attacks of mass hysteria afflicting entire towns,the nightmare brutality of men’s dealings with one another, the use of legalizedtorture as a normal way of life—all of this is swept aside, so entranced isFromm by the vision of a world in which men did not have to invent and compete,they had only to submit and obey.Nowhere does he tell us what specifically the medieval man’s “concreteindividualism” consisted of. One is morbidly curious to know what he would say.With the collapse of medievalism and the emergence of a free-market society,Fromm declares, man was compelled to assume total responsibility for his ownsurvival: he had to produce and to trade—he had to think and to judge—he had noauthority to guide him, and nothing but his own ability to keep him inexistence. No longer could he, by virtue of the class into which he was born,inherit his sense of personal identity: henceforward, he had to achieve it. Thisposed a devastating psychological problem for man, intensifying his basicfeeling of isolation and separateness.“It is true,” Fromm remarks, “that the capitalistic mode of production isconducive to political freedom, while any centrally planned social order is indanger of leading to political regimentation and eventually to dictatorship.” 78[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-78] Capitalism, he further concedes, hasproven itself superlatively capable of producing goods and of raising men’smaterial standard of living to undreamedof heights. But a “sane society” musthave more to offer man than political freedom and material well-being.Capitalism, Fromm insists, is destructive of man’s spirit. He offers severalreasons for this charge, which are very revealing.(1) Like Marx, Fromm decries the humiliating predicament of the worker who hasto sell his services. Capitalism condemns the worker to experience himself, notas a man, but as a commodity, as a thing to be traded. Furthermore, since he isonly a tiny part of a vast production process, since, for example, he does notbuild an entire automobile himself (and then drive home in it), but builds onlya small part of it (the total being subsequently sold to some unknown, distantparty), the worker feels alienated from the product of his own labor and,therefore, feels alienated from his own labor as such—unlike the artisan of theMiddle Ages, whose labor could express the “full richness” of his personality.It is an elementary fact of economics that specialization and exchange, under adivision of labor, make a level of productivity possible which otherwise wouldnot be remotely attainable. In pre-capitalist centuries, when a man’s economicwell-being was limited by the goods he himself could produce with his ownprimitive tools, an unconscionable amount of labor was required to make oracquire the simplest necessities—and the general standard of living wasappallingly low: human existence was a continual, exhausting struggle againstimminent starvation. About half of the children born perished before the age often. But with the development of the wages system under capitalism, theintroduction of machinery and the opportunity for a man to sell his labor, life(to say nothing of an ever-increasing standard of material well-being) was madepossible for millions who could have had no chance at survival in pre-capitalisteconomies. However, for Fromm and those who share his viewpoint, theseconsiderations are, doubtless, too “materialistic.” To offer men a chance toenjoy an unprecedented material well-being, is, evidently, to sentence them toalienation; whereas to hold them down to the stagnant level of a medieval serfor guildsman, is to offer them spiritual fulfillment.(2) Fromm decries the “anonymity of the social forces . . . inherent in thestructure of the capitalistic mode of production.”79[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-79] The laws of the market, of supplyand demand, of economic cause and effect, are ominously impersonal: no singleindividual’s wishes control them. Is it the worker who determines how much he isto be paid? No. It is not even the employer. It is that faceless monster, themarket. It determines the wage level in some manner beyond the worker’s power tograsp. As for the capitalist, his position is scarcely better: he, too, ishelpless. “The individual capitalist expands his enterprise not primarilybecause he wants to, but because he has to, because . . . postponement offurther expansion would mean regression.”80[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-80] If he attempts to stagnate, he willgo out of business. Under such a system, asks Fromm, how can man not feelalienated?Consider what Fromm is denouncing. Under capitalism, the wages paid to a man forhis work are determined objectively—by the law of supply and demand. Themarket—reflecting the voluntary judgments of all those who participate in it,all those who buy and sell, produce and consume, offer or seekemployment—establishes the general price level of goods and services. This isthe context which men are obliged to consider in setting the prices they willask for their work or offer for the work of others; if a man demands more thanthe market value of his work, he will remain unemployed; if a particularemployer offers him less than the market value of his work, the man willseek—and find—employment elsewhere. The same principle applies to the capitalistwho offers his goods for sale. If the prices and quality of his goods arecomparable or preferable to those of other men in the same field of production,he will be able to compete; if others can do better than he can, if they canoffer superior goods and/or lower prices, he will be obliged to improve, togrow, to equal their achievement, or else he will lose his customers. Thestandard determining a producer’s success or failure is the objective value ofhis product—as judged, within the context of the market (and of theirknowledge), by those to whom he offers his product. This is the only rationaland just principle of exchange. But this is what Fromm considers evil.What he rebels against is objectivity. How—he demands—can a man not feelalienated in a system where his wishes are not omnipotent, where the unearned isnot to be had, where growth is rewarded and stagnation is penalized?It is clear from the foregoing that Fromm’s basic quarrel is with reality—sincenature confronts man with the identical conditions, which a free economy merelyreflects: nature, too, holds man to the law of cause and effect; nature, too,makes constant growth a condition of successful life.There are writers on alienation who recognize this and do not bother to centertheir attacks on capitalism: they damn nature outright. They declare that man’slife is intrinsically and inescapably tragic—since reality is “tyrannical,”since contradictory desires cannot be satisfied, since objectivity is a“prison,” since time is a “net” that no one can elude, etc. Existentialists, inparticular, specialize in this sort of pronouncement.(3) As consumer in a capitalist economy, Fromm contends, man is subject tofurther alienating pressures. He is overwhelmed with innumerable products amongwhich he must choose. He is bewildered and brainwashed by the blandishments ofadvertisers, forever urging him to buy their wares. This staggering multiplicityof possible choices is threatening to his sanity. Moreover, he is “conditioned”to consume for the sake of consuming—to long for an ever-higher standard ofliving—merely in order to keep the “system” going. With automatic washingmachines, automatic cameras, and automatic can openers, modern man’srelationship to nature becomes more and more remote. He is increasinglycondemned to the nightmare of an artificial world.No such problem confronted the feudal serf.This much is true: sleeping on an earthen floor, the medieval serf—to saynothing of the caveman—was much closer to nature, in one uncomfortable andunhygienic sense of the word.The above criticism of capitalism has become very fashionable among socialcommentators. What is remarkable is that almost invariably, as in the case ofFromm, the criticism is made by the same writers who are loudest in crying thatman needs more leisure. Yet the purpose of the “gadgets” they condemn is,specifically, to liberate man’s time. Thus they wish to provide man with moreleisure, while damning the material means that make leisure possible.As for the charge—equally popular—that the multiplicity of choices offered toman in capitalistic society is threatening to his mental equilibrium, it shouldbe remembered that fear of choices and decisions is a basic symptom of mentalillness. To whose mentality, then, do these critics of capitalism demand thatsociety be adjusted?(4) The development of a complex, highly industrialized society requires anextreme degree of quantification and abstraction in men’s method of thinking,observes Fromm—and this, in still another way, estranges man from the worldaround him: he loses the ability to relate to things in “their concreteness anduniqueness.”81 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-81]One can agree with Fromm in part: an industrial technological society demandsthe fullest development and exercise of man’s conceptual faculty, i.e., of hisdistinctively human form of cognition. The sensory-perceptual level ofconsciousness—the level of an animal’s cognition—will not do.Those who assert that the conceptual level of consciousness alienates man fromthe real world merely confess that their concepts bear no relation to reality—orthat they do not understand the relation of concepts to reality. But it shouldbe remembered that the capacity to abstract and conceptualize offers man—to theextent that he is rational—a means of “relating” to the world around himimmeasurably superior to that enjoyed by any other species. It does not“alienate” man from nature, it makes him nature’s master: an animal obeys natureblindly; man obeys her intelligently—and thereby acquires the power to commandher.(5) Finally, most alienating of all, perhaps, are the sort of relationships thatexist among men under capitalism, says Fromm.What is the modern man’s relationship to his fellow man? It is one between twoabstractions, two living machines, who use each other. The employer uses theones whom he employs; the salesman uses his customers. . . . There is not muchlove or hate to be found in human relations of our day. There is, rather, asuperficial friendliness, and a more than superficial fairness, but behind thatsurface is distance and indifference. . . . The alienation between man and manresults in the loss of those general and social bonds which characterizemedieval as well as most other pre-capitalist societies.82[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-82]Fromm is claiming that there existed, in pre-capitalist societies, a mutual goodwill among men, an attitude of respect and benevolent solidarity, a regard forthe value of the human person, that vanished with the rise of a free-marketsociety. This is worse than false. The claim is absurd historically anddisgraceful morally.It is notorious that, in the Middle Ages, human relationships were characterizedby mutual suspiciousness, hostility, and cruelty: everyone regarded his neighboras a potential threat, and nothing was held more cheaply than human life. Suchinvariably is the case in any society where men are ruled by brute force. Inputting an end to slavery and serfdom, capitalism introduced a socialbenevolence that would have been impossible under earlier systems. Capitalismvalued a man’s life as it had never been valued before. Capitalism is thepolitico-economic expression of the principle that a man’s life, freedom, andhappiness are his by moral right.There is a passage in The Fountainhead that bears on this issue. “Civilizationis the progress toward a society of privacy. The savage’s whole existence ispublic, ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of settingman free from men.”Under capitalism, men are free to choose their “social bonds”—meaning: to choosewhom they will associate with. Men are not trapped within the prison of theirfamily, tribe, caste, class, or neighborhood. They choose whom they will value,whom they will befriend, whom they will deal with, what kind of relationshipsthey will enter. This implies and entails man’s responsibility to formindependent value-judgments. It implies and entails, also, that a man must earnthe social relationships he desires. But this, clearly, is anathema to Fromm.“Love,” he has told us, “is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problemof human existence”—but, he asserts, love and capitalism are inimical. “Theprinciple underlying capitalistic society and the principle of love areincompatible.”83 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-83] The principle ofcapitalism, says Fromm, is that of “fairness ethics,” of trade, of the exchangeof values, without recourse to force or fraud; individuals deal with one anotheronly on the premise of mutual self-interest; they engage only in thosetransactions from which they expect a profit, reward, or gain. “It may even besaid that the development of fairness ethics is the particular ethicalcontribution of capitalist society.”84[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-84]But to approach love with any concern for one’s self-interest is—he asserts—tonegate the very essence of love. To love an individual is to feel care andresponsibility for him; it is not to appraise his character or personality as a“commodity” from which one expects pleasure. To love “ideally” is to love“unconditionally”—it is to love a human being, not for the fact of what he is,but for the fact that he is—it is to love without reference to values orstandards or judgment. “In essence, all human beings are identical. We are allpart of One; we are One. This being so, it should not make any difference whomwe love.”85 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-85]It should not, in other words, make any difference whether the person we love isa being of stature or a total nonentity, a genius or a fool, a hero or ascoundrel. “We are all part of One.” Is it necessary to point out who stands togain and who to lose by this view of love?The desire to be loved “unconditionally,” the desire to be loved with no concernfor his objective personal worth, is one of man’s “deepest longings,” Fromminsists; whereas to be loved on the basis of merit, “because one deserves it,”invokes doubt and uncertainty, since merit has to be struggled for and sincesuch love can be withdrawn should the merit cease to exist. “Furthermore,‘deserved’ love easily leaves a bitter feeling that one is not loved foroneself, that one is loved only because one pleases . . .”86[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-86]It is typical of Fromm that he should deliver what is in fact (though not inFromm’s estimate) a deadly insult to human nature, without offering anyjustification for his charge. He assumes that all men, by nature, are soprofoundly lacking in self-esteem that they crave a love which bears no relationto their actions, achievements, or character, a love not to be earned but to bereceived only as a free gift.What does it mean to be loved “for oneself”? In reason, it can mean only: to beloved for the values one has achieved in one’s character and person. The highestcompliment one can be paid by another human being is to be told: “Because ofwhat you are, you are essential to my happiness.” But this is the love that,according to Fromm, leaves one with “a bitter feeling.”It is the capitalistic culture, he declares, that inculcates such concepts asthe “deserved” and the “undeserved”—the earned and the unearned—and thus poisonsthe growth of proper love. Proper love, Fromm tells us, should be given solelyout of the richness of the spirit of the giver, in demonstration of the giver’s“potency.” Fromm nowhere reveals the exact nature of this “potency,” of course.“Love is an act of faith . . .”87 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-87]Proper love should raise no questions about the virtue or character of itsobject; it should desire no joy from such virtue as the object mightpossess—for, if it does, it is not proper love, it is only capitalisticselfishness.But, Fromm asks, “how can one act within the framework of existing society andat the same time practice love?”88 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-88]He does not declare that love is impossible under capitalism—merely that it isexceptionally difficult.Commenting, in Who Is Ayn Rand?, on Fromm’s theory of love, I wrote:To love . . . is to value; love, properly, is the consequence and expression ofadmiration—“the emotional price paid by one man for the joy he receives from thevirtues of another.” [Atlas Shrugged] Love is not alms, but a moral tribute.If love did not imply admiration, if it did not imply an acknowledgment of moralqualities that the recipient of love possessed—what meaning or significancewould love have, and why would Fromm or anyone consider it desirable? Only oneanswer is possible, and it is not an attractive one: when love is divorced fromvalues, then “love” becomes, not a tribute, but a moral blank check: a promisethat one will be forgiven anything, that one will not be abandoned, that onewill be taken care of.89 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-89]This view of love is not, of course, peculiar to Fromm; it is a centralcomponent of the mystic-altruist tradition—and is as prevalent amongpsychologists, sociologists, and philosophers as it is among religionists.Perhaps the simplest and most eloquent answer to this view of love is onesentence of John Galt in Atlas Shrugged: “A morality that professes the beliefthat the values of the spirit are more precious than matter, a morality thatteaches you to scorn a whore who gives her body indiscriminately to all men—thissame morality demands that you surrender your soul to promiscuous love for allcomers.”To divorce love from values (and value-judgments) is to confess one’s longingfor the unearned. The idealization of this longing as a proper moral goal is aconstant theme running through Fromm’s writing.That the underlying motive is the desire to be taken care of, the desire to bespared the responsibility of independence, is revealed explicitly in Fromm’ssocio-political “solution” to the problem of alienation.In order that man may be enabled to conquer his feeling of aloneness andalienation, to practice love and to achieve a full sense of personal identity, anew social system must be established, Fromm declares.Private ownership of the means of production must be abolished. The profitmotive must be forbidden. Industry must be decentralized. Society should bedivided into self-governing industrial guilds; factories should be owned and runby all those who work in them.Why—according to Fromm’s social philosophy—should a janitor in an industrialplant not have the same right to determine its management as the man whohappened to create the plant? Does not the janitor’s personality require as muchself-expression as anyone else’s?Under capitalism, says Fromm, men are overwhelmed by and are the pawns of acomplex industrial machine whose omnipotent forces and laws are beyond theircomprehension or control. Under the decentralized, “democratic” system heproposes—which is some sort of blend of guild socialism andsyndicalism—industrial establishments will be broken down into units whosefunction is within everyone’s easy comprehension, with no “alienating” demandsmade on anyone’s abstract capacity.Under this system, he explains, every person will be provided with his minimumsubsistence, whether the person wishes to work or not. This is necessary if manis to develop healthily and happily. However, to discourage parasitism, Frommsuggests that this support should not extend beyond two years. Who is to providethis support, whether they will be willing to do so, and what will happen ifthey are not willing, are questions Fromm does not discuss.So long as men are occupied with the problem of survival, Fromm feels, theirspiritual concerns—the concerns that really matter—are almost inevitablyneglected. How can the worker’s personality not be impoverished, if he must facedaily the necessity of earning a livelihood? How can the businessman develop hiscreative potentialities, if he is in bondage to his obsession with production?How can the artist preserve his soul’s integrity, if he is plagued withtemptations by Hollywood and Madison Avenue? How can the consumer cultivateindividual tastes and preferences, if he is surrounded by the standardizedcommodities begotten by mass production?If one wishes to understand the relevance of epistemology to politics, oneshould observe what is gained for Fromm by that “paradoxical logic” of which hewrites so approvingly. If, as it teaches, “man can perceive reality only incontradictions,” then Fromm does not have to be troubled by the conflict betweenhis claim to be an advocate of reason and his enthusiasm for Easternmysticism—nor does he have to be troubled by the conflict between his claim tobe a defender of individualism and his advocacy of political collectivism. Hisdisdain for the law of contradiction permits him to announce that trueindividualism is possible only in the collectivized community—that true freedomis possible only when production is taken out of the hands of privateindividuals and placed under the absolute control of the group—that men willcease to be objects of “use” by others, only when they are willing to renouncepersonal profit and make social usefulness the goal of their lives.90[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-90]Fromm calls his proposed system “Humanistic Communitarian Socialism.” Under it,he maintains, man will achieve “a new harmony with nature” to replace the one hehas lost—man will enjoy the tranquillity and self-fulfillment of the animalswhose state Fromm finds so enviable.If, often, Fromm is more than a little disingenuous in the presentation of hisviews, he is, nonetheless, extremely explicit. This is what is unusual abouthim. Most writers of his persuasion twist themselves for pages and pages inorder to obscure their advocacy of the ideas—and contradictions—which heannounces openly. With rare exceptions, one will find comparable candor onlyamong the existentialists and Zen Buddhists, many of whose premises Frommshares.His explicitness notwithstanding, he is very representative culturally andshould be recognized as such. The recurrent themes running through theliterature on alienation—and through today’s social commentary generally—are thethemes which Fromm brings into naked focus: that reason is “unnatural,” that anon-contradictory, objective reality “restricts” one’s individuality, that thenecessity of choice is an awesome burden, that it is “tragic” not to be able toeat one’s cake and have it, too, that self-responsibility is frightening, thatthe achievement of personal identity is a social problem—that “love” is theomnipotent solution—and that the political implementation of this solution issocialism.The transparent absurdity or the unintelligibility of most discussions ofalienation might tempt one to believe that the issue is entirely illusory. Butthis would be an error. Although the explanations offered for it are spurious,the problem of alienation is real. A great many men do recognize the painfulemotional state which writers on alienation describe. A great many men do lack asense of personal identity. A great many men do feel themselves to be strangersand afraid in a world they never made.But why? What is the problem of alienation? What is personal identity? Whyshould so many men experience the task of achieving it as a dreaded burden? Andwhat is the significance of the attacks on capitalism in connection with thisissue?These are the questions we must now proceed to answer.The problem of alienation and the problem of personal identity are inseparable.The man who lacks a firm sense of personal identity feels alienated; the man whofeels alienated lacks a firm sense of personal identity.Pain is an organism’s alarm-signal, warning of danger; the particular species ofpain which is the feeling of alienation announces to a man that he is existingin a psychological state improper to him—that his relationship to reality iswrong.No animal faces such questions as: What should I make of myself? What manner oflife is proper to my nature? Such questions are possible only to a rationalbeing, i.e., a being whose characteristic method of cognitive functioning (ofapprehending reality) is conceptual, who is not only conscious but alsoself-conscious, and whose power of abstraction enables him to project manyalternative courses of action. Further, such questions are possible only to abeing whose cognitive faculty is exercised volitionally (thinking is notautomatic)—a being who is self-directing and self-regulating in thought and inaction, and whose existence, therefore, entails a constant process of choice.As a living entity, man is born with specific needs and capacities; theseconstitute his species identity, so to speak—i.e., they constitute his humannature. How he exercises his capacities to satisfy his needs—i.e., how he dealswith the facts of reality, how he chooses to function, in thought and inaction—constitutes his personal or individual identity. His sense of himself—hisimplicit concept or image of the kind of person he is (including his self-esteemor lack of it)—is the cumulative product of the choices he makes. This is themeaning of Ayn Rand’s statement that “man is a being of self-made soul.”A man’s “I,” his ego, his deepest self, is his faculty of awareness, hiscapacity to think. To choose to think, to identify the facts of reality—toassume the responsibility of judging what is true or false, right or wrong—isman’s basic form of self-assertiveness. It is his acceptance of his own natureas a rational being, his acceptance of the responsibility of intellectualindependence, his commitment to the efficacy of his own mind.The essence of selflessness is the suspension of one’s consciousness. When andto the extent that a man chooses to evade the effort and responsibility ofthinking, of seeking knowledge, of passing judgment, his action is one ofself-abdication. To relinquish thought is to relinquish one’s ego—and topronounce oneself unfit for existence, incompetent to deal with the facts ofreality.To the extent that a man chooses to think, his premises and values are acquiredfirst-hand and they are not a mystery to him; he experiences himself as theactive cause of his character, behavior, and goals. To the extent that a manattempts to live without thinking, he experiences himself as passive, his personand actions are the accidental products of forces he does not understand, of hisrange-of-the-moment feelings and random environmental influences. When a mandefaults on the responsibility of thought, he is left at the mercy of hisinvoluntary, subconscious reactions—and these will be at the mercy of theoutside forces impinging upon him, at the mercy of whoever and whatever isaround him. By his default, such a person turns himself into the socialdeterminists’ view of man: into an empty mold waiting to be filled, into awill-less robot waiting to be taken over by any environment and anyconditioners.A strong sense of personal identity is the product of two things: a policy ofindependent thinking—and, as a consequence, the possession of an integrated setof values. Since it is his values that determine a man’s emotions and goals, andgive direction and meaning to his life, a man experiences his values as anextension of himself, as an integral part of his identity, as crucial to thatwhich makes him himself.“Values,” in this context, refers to fundamental and abstract values, not toconcrete value-judgments. For example, a man holding rationality as his abstractvalue may choose a friend who appears to embody this value; if, subsequently, hedecides that he was mistaken in his judgment, that his friend is not rationaland that their relationship should be ended, this does not alter his personalidentity; but if, instead, he decides that he no longer values rationality, hispersonal identity is altered.If a man holds contradictory values, these necessarily do violence to his senseof personal identity. They result in a splintered sense of self, a self brokeninto unintegratable fragments. To avoid this painful experience of a splinteredidentity, a man whose values are contradictory will commonly seek to escapeknowledge of his contradictions by means of evasion, repression,rationalization, etc. Thus, to escape a problem created by a failure of thought,he suspends thinking. To escape a threat to his sense of personal identity, hesuspends his ego—he suspends his self qua thinking, judging entity.Thus, he displaces his sense of self downward, so to speak, from his reason,which is the active, initiating element in man, to his emotions, which are thepassive, reactive element. Moved by feelings whose source he does notunderstand, and by contradictions whose existence he does not acknowledge, hesuffers a progressive sense of self-estrangement, of self-alienation. A man’semotions are the product of his premises and values, of the thinking he has doneor has failed to do. But the man who is run by his emotions, attempting to makethem a substitute for rational judgment, experiences them as alien forces. Theparadox of his position is this: his emotions become his only source of personalidentity, but his experience of identity becomes: a being ruled by demons.It is important to observe that the experience of self-alienation and thefeeling of being alienated from reality, from the world around one, proceed fromthe same cause: one’s default on the responsibility of thinking. The suspensionof proper cognitive contact with reality and the suspension of one’s ego are asingle act. A flight from reality is a flight from self.One of the consequences is a feeling of alienation from other men, the sensethat one is not part of the human race—that one is, in effect, a freak. Inbetraying one’s status as a human being, one makes oneself a metaphysicaloutcast. This is not altered by the knowledge that many other human beings havecommitted the same betrayal. One feels alone and cut off—cut off by theunreality of one’s own existence, by one’s desolate inner sense of spiritualimpoverishment.The same failure of rationality and independence by which men rob themselves ofpersonal identity leads them, most commonly, to the self-destructive policy ofseeking a substitute for identity—or, more precisely, seeking a second-handidentity—through mindless conformity to the values of others. This is thepsychological phenomenon which I have designated as social metaphysics. In myarticle “Rogues Gallery,”91 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-91] dealingwith different types of social metaphysicians, I commented on the type mostrelevant to the present context, the “Conventional” social metaphysician:This is the person who accepts the world and its prevailing values ready-made;his is not to reason why. What is true? What others say is true. What is right?What others believe is right. How should one live? As others live. . . . [Thisis] the person whose sense of identity and personal worth is explicitly afunction of his ability to satisfy the values, terms and expectations of thoseomniscient and omnipresent “others.” . . . In a culture such as the present one,with its disintegrating values, its intellectual chaos, its moralbankruptcy—where the familiar guideposts and rules are vanishing, where theauthoritative mirrors reflecting “reality” are splintering into a thousandunintelligible subcults, where “adjustment” is becoming harder and harder—theConventional social metaphysician is the first to run to a psychiatrist, cryingthat he has lost his identity, because he no longer knows unequivocally what heis supposed to do and be.It would never occur to a person of self-esteem and independent judgment thatone’s “identity” is a thing to be gained from or determined by others. To aperson untouched by self-doubt, the wails heard today about the anguish ofmodern man as he confronts the question “Who am I?” are incomprehensible. But inthe light of the above, the wailing becomes more intelligible. It is the cry ofsocial metaphysicians who no longer know which authorities to obey—and who aremoaning that it is someone’s duty to herd them to a sense of self, that “TheSystem” must provide them with self-esteem.This is the psychological root of the modern intellectuals’ mystique of theMiddle Ages, of the dazed longing for that style of life—and of the massiveevasion concerning the actual conditions of existence during that period. TheMiddle Ages represents the social metaphysician’s unconfessed dream: a system inwhich his dread of independence and self-responsibility is proclaimed to be avirtue and is made a social imperative.When—in any age—a man attempts to evade the responsibility of intellectualindependence, and to derive his sense of identity from “belonging,” he pays adeadly price in terms of the sabotaging of his mental processes thereafter. Thedegree to which a man substitutes the judgment of others for his own, failing tolook at reality directly, is the degree to which his mental processes arealienated from reality. He functions not by means of concepts, but by means ofmemorized cue-words, i.e., learned sounds associated with certain contexts andsituations, but lacking authentic cognitive content for their user. This is theunidentified, unrecognized phenomenon that prompts unthinking people today togrant validity to the charge that modern man lives “too abstractly,” “toointellectually,” and that he needs to “get back to nature.” They sense dimlythat they are out of contact with reality, that something is wrong with theirgrasp of the world around them. But they accept an entirely fallaciousinterpretation of their problem. The truth is not that they are lost among“abstractions,” but that they have failed to discover the nature and proper useof abstractions; they are not lost among concepts, they are lost amongcue-words. They are cut off from reality not because they attempt to grasp ittoo intellectually, but because they attempt to grasp it only as seen by others;they attempt to grasp it second-hand. And they move through an unreal world ofverbal rituals, mouthing the slogans and phrases they hear repeated by others,falsely imagining that those empty words are concepts, and never apprehendingthe proper use of their conceptual faculty, never learning what first-hand,conceptual knowledge consists of. Then they are ready for the Zen Buddhist whotells them that the solution to their alienation from reality is to empty theirmind of all thought and sit for an hour, cross-legged, contemplating the patternof veins on a leaf.It is a well-known psychological fact that when men are neurotically anxious,when they suffer from feelings of dread for which they cannot account, theyoften attempt to make their plight more tolerable by directing their fear atsome external object: they seek to persuade themselves that their fear is arational response to the threat of germs, or the possible appearance ofburglars, or the danger of lightning, or the brain-controlling radiations ofMartians. The process by which men decide that the cause of their alienation iscapitalism is not dissimilar.There are reasons, however, why capitalism is the target for their projectionand rationalization.The alienated man is fleeing from the responsibility of a volitional (i.e.,self-directing) consciousness: the freedom to think or not to think, to initiatea process of reason or to evade it, is a burden he longs to escape. But sincethis freedom is inherent in his nature as man, there is no escape from it; hencehis guilt and anxiety when he abandons reason and sight in favor of feelings andblindness. But there is another level on which man confronts the issue offreedom: the existential or social level—and here escape is possible. Politicalfreedom is not a metaphysical given: it has to be achieved—hence it can berejected. The psychological root of the revolt against freedom in one’sexistence is the revolt against freedom in one’s consciousness. The root of therevolt against self-responsibility in action is the revolt againstself-direction in thought. The man who does not want to think does not want tobear responsibility for the consequences of his actions nor for his own life.It is appropriate, in this connection, to quote a passage from Who Is Ayn Rand?in which I discuss the similarity of the attacks against capitalism launched bynineteenth-century medievalists and socialists:In the writings of both medievalists and socialists, one can observe theunmistakable longing for a society in which man’s existence will beautomatically guaranteed to him—that is, in which man will not have to bearresponsibility for his own survival. Both camps project their ideal society asone characterized by that which they call “harmony,” by freedom from rapidchange or challenge or the exacting demands of competition; a society in whicheach must do his prescribed part to contribute to the well-being of the whole,but in which no one will face the necessity of making choices and decisions thatwill crucially affect his life and future; in which the question of what one hasor has not earned, and does or does not deserve, will not come up; in whichrewards will not be tied to achievement and in which someone’s benevolence willguarantee that one need never bear the consequences of one’s errors. The failureof capitalism to conform to what may be termed this pastoral view of existence,is essential to the medievalists’ and socialists’ indictment of a free society.It is not a Garden of Eden that capitalism offers men.92[rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-92]Today, of course, capitalism has largely been abandoned in favor of a mixedeconomy, i.e., a mixture of freedom and statism—moving steadily in the directionof increasing statism. Today, we are far closer to the “ideal society” of thesocialists than when Marx first wrote of the worker’s “alienation.” Yet withevery advance of collectivism, the cries concerning man’s alienation growlouder. The problem, we are told, is getting worse. In communist countries, whensuch criticisms are allowed to be voiced, some commentators are beginning tocomplain that the Marxist solution to the worker’s alienation has failed, thatman under communism is still alienated, that the “new harmony” with nature andone’s fellow men has not come.It didn’t come to the medieval serf or guildsman, either—the propaganda ofcommentators such as Erich Fromm notwithstanding.Man cannot escape from his nature, and if he establishes a social system whichis inimical to the requirements of his nature—a system which forbids him tofunction as a rational, independent being—psychological and physical disaster isthe result.A free society, of course, cannot automatically guarantee the mental well-beingof all its members. Freedom is not a sufficient condition to assure man’s properfulfillment, but it is a necessary condition. And capitalism—laissez-fairecapitalism—is the only system which provides that condition.The problem of alienation is not metaphysical; it is not man’s natural fate,never to be escaped, like some sort of Original Sin; it is a disease. It is notthe consequence of capitalism or industrialism or “bigness”—and it cannot belegislated out of existence by the abolition of property rights. The problem ofalienation is psycho-epistemological: it pertains to how man chooses to use hisown consciousness. It is the product of man’s revolt against thinking—whichmeans: against reality.If a man defaults on the responsibility of seeking knowledge, choosing valuesand setting goals—if this is the sphere he surrenders to the authority ofothers—how is he to escape the feeling that the universe is closed to him? Itis. By his own choice.The proper answer to the question—And how am I to face the oddsof man’s bedevilment and God’s?I, a stranger and afraidin a world I never made—is: Why didn’t you?"},{"pageContent":"24. REQUIEM FOR MANby Ayn Rand In advocating capitalism, I have said and stressed for years that capitalism isincompatible with altruism and mysticism. Those who chose to doubt that theissue is “either-or” have now heard it from the highest authority of theopposite side: Pope Paul VI.The encyclical “Populorum Progressio” (“On the Development of Peoples”) is anunusual document: it reads as if a long-repressed emotion broke out into theopen, past the barrier of carefully measured, cautiously calculated sentences,with the hissing pressure of centuries of silence. The sentences are full ofcontradictions; the emotion is consistent.The encyclical is the manifesto of an impassioned hatred for capitalism; but itsevil is much more profound and its target is more than mere politics. It iswritten in terms of a mystic-altruist “sense of life.” A sense of life is thesubconscious equivalent of metaphysics: a pre-conceptual, emotionally integratedappraisal of man’s nature and of his relationship to existence. To amystic-altruist sense of life, words are mere approximations; hence theencyclical’s tone of evasion. But what is eloquently revealing is the nature ofthat which is being evaded.The Objectivist, July, August, and September 1967.On the question of capitalism, the encyclical’s position is explicit andunequivocal. Referring to the industrial revolution, the encyclical declares:“But it is unfortunate that on these new conditions of society a system has beenconstructed which considers profit as the key motive for economic progress,competition as the supreme law of economics, and private ownership of the meansof production as an absolute right that has no limits and carries nocorresponding social obligation. . . . But if it is true that a type ofcapitalism has been the source of excessive suffering, injustices andfratricidal conflicts whose effects still persist, it would also be wrong toattribute to industrialization itself evils that belong to the woeful systemwhich accompanied it.” (Paragraph 26)The Vatican is not the city room of a third-rate Marxist tabloid. It is aninstitution geared to a perspective of centuries, to scholarship and timelessphilosophical deliberation. Ignorance, therefore, cannot be the explanation ofthe above. Even the leftists know that the advent of capitalism andindustrialization was not an “unfortunate” coincidence, and that the first madethe second possible.What are the “excessive suffering, injustices and fratricidal conflicts” causedby capitalism? The encyclical gives no answer. What social system, past orpresent, has a better record in respect to any social evil that anyone mightchoose to ascribe to capitalism? Has the feudalism of the Middle Ages? Hasabsolute monarchy? Has socialism or fascism? No answer. If one is to consider“excessive suffering, injustices and fratricidal conflicts,” what aspect ofcapitalism can be placed in the same category with the terror and wholesaleslaughter of Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia? No answer. If there is no causalconnection between capitalism and the people’s progress, welfare, and standardof living, why are these highest in the countries whose systems have the largestelement of capitalistic economic freedom? No answer.Since the encyclical is concerned with history and with fundamental politicalprinciples, yet does not discuss or condemn any social system other thancapitalism, one must conclude that all other systems are compatible with theencyclical’s political philosophy. This is supported by the fact that capitalismis condemned, not for some lesser characteristics, but for its essentials, whichare not the base of any other system: the profit motive, competition, andprivate ownership of the means of production.By what moral standard does the encyclical judge a social system? Its mostspecific accusation directed at capitalism reads as follows: “The desire fornecessities is legitimate, and work undertaken to obtain them is a duty: ‘If anyman will not work, neither let him eat.’ But the acquiring of temporal goods canlead to greed, to the insatiable desire for more, and can make increased power atempting objective. Individuals, families and nations can be overcome byavarice, be they poor or rich, and all can fall victim to a stiflingmaterialism.” (18)Since time immemorial and pre-industrial, “greed” has been the accusation hurledat the rich by the concrete-bound illiterates who were unable to conceive of thesource of wealth or of the motivation of those who produce it. But the above wasnot written by an illiterate.Terms such as “greed” and “avarice” connote the caricature image of twoindividuals, one fat, the other lean, one indulging in mindless gluttony, theother starving over chests of hoarded gold—both symbols of the acquisition ofriches for the sake of riches. Is that the motive-power of capitalism?If all the wealth spent on personal consumption by all the rich of the UnitedStates were expropriated and distributed among our population, it would amountto less than a dollar per person. (Try to figure out the amount, if distributedto the entire population of the globe.) The rest of American wealth is investedin production—and it is this constantly growing investment that raises America’sstandard of living by raising the productivity of its labor. This is primereconomics which Pope Paul VI cannot fail to know.To observe the technique of epistemological manipulation, read that quotedparagraph again—and look past the images invoked by the window-dressing of“greed” and “avarice.” You will observe that the evil being denounced is: “theinsatiable desire for more.” Of what? Of “increased power.” What sort of power?No direct answer is given in that paragraph, but the entire encyclical providesthe answer by means of a significant omission: no distinction is drawn betweeneconomic power and political power (between production and force), they are usedinterchangeably in some passages and equated explicitly in others. If you lookat the facts of reality, you will observe that the “increased power” which menof wealth seek under capitalism is the power of independent production, thepower of an “insatiable” ambition to expand their productive capacity—and thatthis is what the encyclical damns. The evil is not work, but ambitious work.These implications are supported and gently stressed in a subsequent paragraph,which lists the encyclical’s view of “less human” conditions of socialexistence: “The lack of material necessities for those who are without theminimum essential for life, the moral deficiencies of those who are mutilated byselfishness. . . . Oppressive social structures, whether due to the abuses ofownership or to the abuses of power . . .” And, as “more human” conditions: “thepassage from misery toward the possession of necessities. . . .” (21)What “necessities” are the “minimum essential for life”? For what kind of life?Is it for mere physical survival? If so, for how long a survival? No answer isgiven. But the encyclical’s principle is clear: only those who rise no higherthan the barest minimum of subsistence have the right to materialpossessions—and this right supersedes all the rights of all other men, includingtheir right to life. This is stated explicitly:“The Bible, from the first page on, teaches us that the whole of creation is forman, that it is his responsibility to develop it by intelligent effort and bymeans of his labor to perfect it, so to speak, for his use. If the world is madeto furnish each individual with the means of livelihood and the instruments forhis growth and progress, each man has therefore the right to find in the worldwhat is necessary for himself. The recent Council reminded us of this: ‘Godintended the earth and all that it contains for the use of every human being andpeople. Thus, as all men follow justice and charity, created goods should aboundfor them on a reasonable basis.’ All other rights whatsoever, including those ofproperty and of free commerce, are to be subordinated to this principle.” (22)Observe what element is missing from this view of the world, what human facultyis regarded as inessential or non-existent. I shall discuss this aspect later inmore detail. For the moment, I shall merely call your attention to the use ofthe word “man” in the above paragraph (which man?)—and to the term “createdgoods.” Created—by whom? Blank out.That missing element becomes blatant in the encyclical’s next paragraph: “It iswell known how strong were the words used by the fathers of the church todescribe the proper attitude of persons who possess anything toward persons inneed. To quote St. Ambrose: ‘You are not making a gift of your possessions tothe poor person. You are handing over to him what is his. For what has beengiven in common for the use of all, you have arrogated to yourself. The world isgiven to all, and not only to the rich.’ That is, private property does notconstitute for anyone an absolute and unconditional right. No one is justifiedin keeping for his exclusive use what he does not need, when others lacknecessities.” (23)St. Ambrose lived in the fourth century, when such views of property couldconceivably have been explicable, if not justifiable. From the nineteenthcentury on, they can be neither.What solution does the encyclical offer to the problems of today’s world?“Individual initiative alone and the mere free play of competition could neverassure successful development. One must avoid the risk of increasing still morethe wealth of the rich and the dominion of the strong, while leaving the poor intheir misery and adding to the servitude of the oppressed. Hence programs arenecessary in order ‘to encourage, stimulate, coordinate, supplement andintegrate’ the activity of individuals and of intermediary bodies. It pertainsto the public authorities to choose, even to lay down, the objectives to bepursued, the ends to be achieved, and the means for attaining these, and it isfor them to stimulate all the forces engaged in this common activity.” (33)A society in which the government (“the public authorities”) chooses and laysdown the objectives to be pursued, the ends to be achieved, and the means forachieving them is a totalitarian state. It is, therefore, morally shocking toread the very next sentence:“But let them take care to associate private initiative and intermediary bodieswith this work. They will thus avoid the danger of complete collectivization orof arbitrary planning, which, by denying liberty, would prevent the exercise ofthe fundamental rights of the human person.” (33)What are “the fundamental rights of the human person” (which are never definedin the encyclical) in a state where “all other rights whatsoever . . . are to besubordinated to this principle [the “right” to minimum sustenance]”? (22) Whatis “liberty” or “private initiative” in a state where the government lays downthe ends and commandeers the means? What is incomplete collectivization?It is difficult to believe that modern compromisers, to whom that paragraph isaddressed, could stretch their capacity for evasion far enough to take it tomean the advocacy of a mixed economy. A mixed economy is a mixture of capitalismand statism; when the principles and practices of capitalism are damned andannihilated at the root, what is to prevent the statist collectivization frombecoming complete?(The moral shock comes from the realization that the encyclical regards somemen’s capacity for evasion as infinitely elastic. Judging by the reactions itreceived, the encyclical did not miscalculate.)I have always maintained that every political theory is based on some code ofethics. Here again, the encyclical confirms my statement, though from theviewpoint of a moral code which is the opposite of mine. “The same duty ofsolidarity that rests on individuals exists also for nations: ‘Advanced nationshave a very heavy obligation to help the developing peoples.’ It is necessary toput this teaching of the council into effect. Although it is normal that anation should be the first to benefit from the gifts that Providence hasbestowed on it as the fruit of the labors of its people, still no country canclaim on that account to keep its wealth for itself alone.” (48)This seems clear enough, but the encyclical takes pains not to be misunderstood.“In other words, the rule of free trade, taken by itself, is no longer able togovern international relations. . . . One must recognize that it is thefundamental principle of liberalism, as the rule for commercial exchange, whichis questioned here.” (58)“We must repeat once more that the superfluous wealth of rich countries shouldbe placed at the service of poor nations, the rule which up to now held good forthe benefit of those nearest to us, must today be applied to all the needy ofthis world.” (49)If need—global need—is the criterion of morality, if minimum subsistence (thestandard of living of the least developed savages) is the criterion of propertyrights, then every new shirt or dress, every ice cream cone, every automobile,refrigerator, or television set becomes “superfluous wealth.”Remember that “rich” is a relative concept and that the share-croppers of theUnited States are fabulously rich compared to the laborers of Asia or Africa.Yet the encyclical denounces, as “unjust,” free trade among unequally developedcountries, on the grounds that “highly industrialized nations export for themost part manufactured goods, while countries with less developed economies haveonly food, fibers, and other raw materials to sell.” (57) Alleging that thisperpetuates the poverty of the undeveloped countries, the encyclical demandsthat international trade be ruled, not by the laws of the free market, but bythe need of its neediest participants.How this would work in practice is made explicitly clear: “This demands greatgenerosity, much sacrifice and unceasing effort on the part of the rich man. Leteach one examine his conscience, a conscience that conveys a new message for ourtimes. . . . Is he ready to pay higher taxes so that the public authorities canintensify their efforts in favor of development? Is he ready to pay a higherprice for imported goods so that the producer may be more justly rewarded?” (47)It is not only the rich who pay taxes; the major share of the tax burden in theUnited States is carried by the middle and lower income classes. It is not forthe exclusive personal consumption of the rich that foreign goods or rawmaterials are imported. The price of food is not a major concern to the rich; itis a crucial concern to the poor. And since food is listed as one of the chiefproducts of the undeveloped countries, project what the encyclical’s proposalwould mean: it would mean that an American housewife would have to buy foodproduced by men who scratch the soil with bare hands or hand-plows, and wouldpay prices which, if paid to America’s mechanized farmers, would have given hera hundred or a thousand times more. Which items of her family budget would shehave to sacrifice so that those undeveloped producers “may be more justlyrewarded”? Would she sacrifice some purchases of clothing? But her clothingbudget would have shrunk in the same manner and proportion—since she would haveto provide the “just rewards” of the producers of “fibers and other rawmaterials.” And so on. What, then, would happen to her standard of living? Andwhat would happen to the American farmers and producers of raw materials? Forcedto compete, not in terms of productive competence, but of need, they would haveto arrest their “development” and revert to the methods of the hand-plow. What,then, would happen to the standard of living of the whole world?No, it is not possible that Pope Paul VI was so ignorant of economics and solacking in the capacity to concretize his theories that he offered suchproposals in the name of “humanism” without realizing the unspeakably inhumancruelty they entail.It seems inexplicable. But there is a certain basic premise that would explainit. It would integrate the encyclical’s clashing elements—the contradictions,the equivocations, the omissions, the unanswered questions—into a consistentpattern. To discover it, one must ask: What is the encyclical’s view of man’snature?That particular view is seldom admitted or fully identified by those who holdit. It is less a matter of conscious philosophy than of a feeling dictated by asense of life. The conscious philosophy of those who hold it, consistspredominantly of attempts to rationalize it.To identify that view, let us go to its roots, to the kind of phenomena whichgive rise to it, in sense-of-life terms.I will ask you to project the look on a child’s face when he grasps the answerto some problem he has been striving to understand. It is a radiant look of joy,of liberation, almost of triumph, which is unself-conscious, yet self-assertive,and its radiance seems to spread in two directions: outward, as an illuminationof the world—inward, as the first spark of what is to become the fire of anearned pride. If you have seen this look, or experienced it, you know that ifthere is such a concept as “sacred”—meaning: the best, the highest possible toman—this look is the sacred, the not-to-be betrayed, the not-to-be-sacrificedfor anything or anyone.This look is not confined to children. Comic-strip artists are in the habit ofrepresenting it by means of a light-bulb flashing on, above the head of acharacter who has suddenly grasped an idea. In simple, primitive terms, this isan appropriate symbol: an idea is a light turned on in a man’s soul.It is the steady, confident reflection of that light that you look for in thefaces of adults—particularly of those to whom you entrust your most preciousvalues. You look for it in the eyes of a surgeon performing an operation on thebody of a loved one; you look for it in the face of a pilot at the controls ofthe plane in which you are flying; and, if you are consistent, you look for itin the person of the man or woman you marry.That light-bulb look is the flash of a human intelligence in action; it is theoutward manifestation of man’s rational faculty; it is the signal and symbol ofman’s mind. And, to the extent of your humanity, it is involved in everythingyou seek, enjoy, value, or love.But suppose that admiration is not your response to that look on the face of achild or adult? Suppose that your response is a nameless fear? Then you willspend your life and your philosophical capacity on the struggle never to letthat fear be named. You will find rationalizations to hide it, and you will callthat child’s look a look of “selfishness” or “arrogance” or “intransigence” or“pride”—all of which will be true, but not in the way you will struggle tosuggest. You will feel that that look in man’s eyes is your greatest, mostdangerous enemy—and the desire to vanquish that look will become your onlyabsolute, taking precedence over reason, logic, consistency, existence, reality.The desire to vanquish that look is the desire to break man’s spirit.Thus you will acquire the kind of sense of life that produced the encyclical“Populorum Progressio.” It was not produced by the sense of life of any oneperson, but by the sense of life of an institution.The dominant chord of the encyclical’s sense of life is hatred for man’smind—hence hatred for man—hence hatred for life and for this earth—hence hatredfor man’s enjoyment of his life on earth—and hence, as a last and leastconsequence, hatred for the only social system that makes all these valuespossible in practice: capitalism.I could maintain this on the grounds of a single example. Consider the proposalto condemn Americans to a lifetime of unrewarded drudgery at forced labor,making them work as hard as they do or harder, with nothing to gain but thebarest subsistence—while savages collect the products of their effort. When youhear a proposal of this sort, what image leaps into your mind? What I see is theyoung people who start out in life with self-confident eagerness, who work theirway through school, their eyes fixed on their future with a joyous,uncomplaining dedication—and what meaning a new coat, a new rug, an old carbought second-hand, or a ticket to the movies has in their lives, as the fuel oftheir courage. Anyone who evades that image while he plans to dispose of “thefruit of the labors of people” and declares that human effort is not asufficient reason for a man to keep his own product—may claim any motive butlove of humanity.I could rest my case on this alone, but I shan’t. The encyclical offers morethan a sense of life: it contains specific, conscious, philosophicalcorroboration.Observe that it is not aimed at destroying man’s mind, but at a slower, moreagonizing equivalent: at enslaving it.The key to understanding the encyclical’s social theories is contained in astatement of John Galt: “I am the man whose existence your blank-outs wereintended to permit you to ignore. I am the man whom you did not want either tolive or to die. You did not want me to live, because you were afraid of knowingthat I carried the responsibility you dropped and that your lives depended uponme; you did not want me to die, because you knew it.” (Atlas Shrugged)The encyclical neither denies nor acknowledges the existence of humanintelligence: it merely treats it as an inconsequential human attributerequiring no consideration. The main, and virtually only, reference to the roleof intelligence in man’s existence reads as follows: “The introduction ofindustry is a necessity for economic growth and human progress; it is also asign of development and contributes to it. By persistent work and use of hisintelligence, man gradually wrests nature’s secrets from her and finds a betterapplication for her riches. As his self-mastery increases, he develops a tastefor research and discovery, an ability to take a calculated risk, boldness inenterprises, generosity in what he does and a sense of responsibility.” (25)Observe that the creative power of man’s mind (of his basic means of survival,of the faculty that distinguishes him from animals) is described as an acquired“taste”—like a taste for olives or for ladies’ fashions. Observe that even thispaltry acknowledgment is not allowed to stand by itself: lest “research anddiscovery” be taken as a value, they are enmeshed in such irrelevancies as“generosity.”The same pattern is repeated in discussing the subject of work. The encyclicalwarns that “it [work] can sometimes be given exaggerated significance,” butadmits that work is a creative process, then adds that “when work is done incommon, when hope, hardship, ambition and joy are shared . . . men findthemselves to be brothers.” (27) And then: “Work, of course, can have contraryeffects, for it promises money, pleasure and power, invites some to selfishness,others to revolt . . .” (28)This means that pleasure (the kind of pleasure which is earned by productivework) is evil—power (economic power, the kind earned by productive work) isevil—and money (the thing which the entire encyclical begs for passionately) isevil if kept in the hands of those who earned it.Do you see John Galt doing work “in common,” sharing “hope, hardship, ambitionand joy” with James Taggart, Wesley Mouch, and Dr. Floyd Ferris? But these areonly fiction characters, you say? Okay. Do you see Pasteur? Do you see Columbus?Do you see Galileo—and what happened to him when he tried to share his “hope,hardship, ambition and joy” with the Catholic Church?No, the encyclical does not deny the existence of men of genius; if it did, itwould not have to plead so hard for global sharing. If all men wereinterchangeable, if degrees of ability were of no consequence, everyone wouldproduce the same amount and there would be no benefits for anyone to derive fromsharing. The encyclical assumes that the unnamed, unrecognized, unacknowledgedfountainheads of wealth would somehow continue to function—and proceeds to setup conditions of existence which would make their functioning impossible.Remember that intelligence is not an exclusive monopoly of genius; it is anattribute of all men, and the differences are only a matter of degree. Ifconditions of existence are destructive to genius, they are destructive to everyman, each in proportion to his intelligence. If genius is penalized, so is thefaculty of intelligence in every other man. There is only this difference: theaverage man does not possess the genius’s power of self-confident resistance,and will break much faster; he will give up his mind, in hopeless bewilderment,under the first touch of pressure.There is no place for the mind in the world proposed by the encyclical, and noplace for man. The entities populating it are insentient robots geared toperform prescribed tasks in a gigantic tribal machine, robots deprived ofchoice, judgment, values, convictions and self-esteem—above all, of self-esteem.“You are not making a gift of your possessions to the poor person. You arehanding over to him what is his.” (23) Does the wealth created by Thomas A.Edison belong to the bushmen who did not create it? Does the paycheck you earnedthis week belong to the hippies next door who did not earn it? A man would notaccept that notion; a robot would. A man would take pride in his achievement; itis the pride of achievement that has to be burned out of the robots of thefuture.“For what has been given in common for the use of all, you have arrogated toyourself.” (23) “God intended the earth and all that it contains for the use ofevery human being and people.” (22) You are one of the things that the earthcontains; are you, therefore, intended “for the use of every human being andpeople”? The encyclical’s answer is apparently “Yes”—since the world it proposesis based on that premise in every essential respect.A man would not accept that premise. A man, such as John Galt, would say: “Youhave never discovered the industrial age—and you cling to the morality of thebarbarian eras when a miserable form of human subsistence was produced by themuscular labor of slaves. Every mystic had always longed for slaves, to protecthim from the material reality he dreaded. But you, you grotesque littleatavists, stare blindly at the skyscrapers and smokestacks around you and dreamof enslaving the material providers who are scientists, inventors,industrialists. When you clamor for public ownership of the means of production,you are clamoring for public ownership of the mind.” (Atlas Shrugged)But a robot would not say it. A robot would be programmed not to question thesource of wealth—and would never discover that the source of wealth is man’smind.On hearing such notions as “The whole of creation is for man” (22) and “Theworld is given to all” (23), a man would grasp that these are equivocationswhich evade the question of what is necessary to make use of natural resources.He would know that nothing is given to him, that the transformation of rawmaterials into human goods requires a process of thought and labor, which somemen will perform and others will not—and that, in justice, no man can have aprimary right to the goods created by the thought and labor of others. A robotwould not protest; it would see no difference between itself and raw materials;it would take its own motions as the given.A man who loves his work and knows what enormous virtue—what discipline ofthought, of energy, of purpose, of devotion—it requires, would rebel at theprospect of letting it serve those who scorn it. And scorn for materialproduction is splattered all over the encyclical. “Less well off peoples cannever be sufficiently on their guard against this temptation, which comes tothem from wealthy nations.” This temptation is “a way of acting that isprincipally aimed at the conquest of material prosperity.” (41) Advocating a“dialogue” between different civilizations for the purpose of founding “worldsolidarity,” the encyclical stresses that it must be: “A dialogue based on manand not on commodities or technical skills. . . .” (73) Which means thattechnical skills are a negligible characteristic, that no virtue was needed toacquire them, that the ability to produce commodities deserves no acknowledgmentand is not part of the concept “man.”Thus, while the entire encyclical is a plea for the products of industrialwealth, it is scornfully indifferent to their source; it asserts a right to theeffects, but ignores the cause; it purports to speak on a lofty moral plane, butleaves the process of material production outside the realm of morality—as ifthat process were an activity of a low order that neither involved nor requiredany moral principles.I quote from Atlas Shrugged: “An industrialist—blank-out—there is no suchperson. A factory is a ‘natural resource,’ like a tree, a rock or a mud puddle.. . . Who solved the problem of production? Humanity, they answer. What was thesolution? The goods are here. How did they get here? Somehow. What caused it?Nothing has causes.” (The last sentence is inapplicable; the encyclical’s answerwould be: “Providence.”)The process of production is directed by man’s mind. Man’s mind is not anindeterminate faculty; it requires certain conditions in order to function—andthe cardinal one among them is freedom. The encyclical is singularly, eloquentlydevoid of any consideration of the mind’s requirements, as if it expected humanthought to keep on gushing forth anywhere, under any conditions, from under anypressures—or as if it intended that gusher to stop.If concern for human poverty and suffering were one’s primary motive, one wouldseek to discover their cause. One would not fail to ask: Why did some nationsdevelop, while others did not? Why have some nations achieved materialabundance, while others have remained stagnant in subhuman misery? History and,specifically, the unprecedented prosperity-explosion of the nineteenth century,would give an immediate answer: capitalism is the only system that enables mento produce abundance—and the key to capitalism is individual freedom.It is obvious that a political system affects a society’s economics, byprotecting or impeding men’s productive activities. But this is what theencyclical will neither admit nor permit. The relationship of politics andeconomics is the thing it most emphatically ignores or evades and denies. Itdeclares that no such relationship exists.In projecting its world of the future, where the civilized countries are toassume the burden of helping and developing the uncivilized ones, the encyclicalstates: “And the receiving countries could demand that there be no interferencein their political life or subversion of their social structures. As sovereignstates they have the right to conduct their own affairs, to decide on theirpolicies and to move freely toward the kind of society they choose.” (54)What if the kind of society they choose makes production, development, andprogress impossible? What if it practices communism, like Soviet Russia?—orexterminates minorities, like Nazi Germany?—or establishes a religious castesystem, like India?—or clings to a nomadic, anti-industrial form of existence,like the Arab countries?—or simply consists of tribal gangs ruled by bruteforce, like some of the new countries of Africa? The encyclical’s tacit answeris that these are the prerogatives of sovereign states—that we must respectdifferent “cultures”—and that the civilized nations of the world must make upfor these deficits, somehow.Some of the answer is not tacit. “Given the increasing needs of theunderdeveloped countries, it should be considered quite normal for an advancedcountry to devote a part of its production to meet their needs, and to trainteachers, engineers, technicians and scholars prepared to put their knowledgeand their skill at the disposal of less fortunate peoples.” (48)The encyclical gives severely explicit instructions to such emissaries. “Theyought not to conduct themselves in a lordly fashion, but as helpers andco-workers. A people quickly perceives whether those who come to help them do sowith or without affection . . . Their message is in danger of being rejected ifit is not presented in the context of brotherly love.” (71) They should be freeof “all nationalistic pride”; they should “realize that their competence doesnot confer on them a superiority in every field.” They should realize thattheirs “is not the only civilization, nor does it enjoy a monopoly of valuableelements.” They should “be intent on discovering, along with its history, thecomponent elements of the cultural riches of the country receiving them. Mutualunderstanding will be established which will enrich both cultures.” (72)This is said to civilized men who are to venture into countries where sacredcows are fed, while children are left to starve—where female infants are killedor abandoned by the roadside—where men go blind, medical help being forbidden bytheir religion—where women are mutilated, to insure their fidelity—whereunspeakable tortures are ceremonially inflicted on prisoners—where cannibalismis practiced. Are these the “cultural riches” which a Western man is to greetwith “brotherly love”? Are these the “valuable elements” which he is to admireand adopt? Are these the “fields” in which he is not to regard himself assuperior? And when he discovers entire populations rotting alive in suchconditions, is he not to acknowledge, with a burning stab of pride—of pride andgratitude—the achievements of his nation and his culture, of the men who createdthem and left him a nobler heritage to carry forward?The encyclical’s implicit answer is “No.” He is not to judge, not to question,not to condemn—only to love; to love without cause, indiscriminately,unconditionally, in violation of any values, standards, or convictions of hisown.(The only valuable assistance that Western men could, in fact, offer toundeveloped countries is to enlighten them on the nature of capitalism and helpthem to establish it. But this would clash with the natives’ “culturaltraditions”; industrialization cannot be grafted onto superstitiousirrationality; the choice is either-or. Besides, it is a knowledge which theWest itself has lost; and it is the specific element which the encyclicaldamns.)While the encyclical demands a kind of unfastidious relativism in regard tocultural values and stressedly urges respect for the right of primitive culturesto hold any values whatever, it does not extend this tolerance to Westerncivilization. Speaking of Western businessmen who deal with countries “recentlyopened to industrialization,” the encyclical states: “Why, then, do they returnto the inhuman principles of individualism when they operate in less developedcountries?” (70)Observe that the horrors of tribal existence in those undeveloped countriesevoke no condemnation from the encyclical; only individualism—the principle thatraised mankind out of the primordial swamps—is branded as “inhuman.”In the light of that statement, observe the encyclical’s contempt for conceptualintegrity, when it advocates “the construction of a better world, one whichshows deeper respect for the rights and the vocation of the individual.” (65)What are the rights of the individual in a world that regards individualism as“inhuman”? No answer.There is another remark pertaining to Western nations, which is worth noting.The encyclical states: “We are pleased to learn that in certain nations‘military service’ can be partially accomplished by doing ‘social service, ’ a‘service pure and simple.’ ” (74)It is interesting to discover the probable source of the notion of substitutingsocial work for military service, of the claim that American youths owe theircountry some years of servitude pure and simple—a vicious notion, more evil thanthe draft, a singularly un-American notion in that it contradicts everyfundamental principle of the United States.The philosophy that created the United States is the encyclical’s target, theenemy it seeks to obliterate. A casual reference that seems aimed at LatinAmerica is a bit of window-dressing, a booby-trap for compromisers, upon whichthey did pounce eagerly. That reference states: “If certain landed estatesimpede the general prosperity because they are extensive, unused or poorly used. . . the common good sometimes demands their expropriation.” (24)But whatever the sins of Latin America, capitalism is not one of them.Capitalism—a system based on the recognition and protection of individualrights—has never existed in Latin America. In the past and at present, LatinAmerica was and is ruled by a primitive form of fascism: an unorganized,unstructured rule by coup d’état, by militaristic gangs, i.e., by physicalforce, which tolerates a nominal pretense at private property subject toexpropriation by any gang in power (which is the cause of Latin America’seconomic stagnation).The encyclical is concerned with help to the undeveloped nations of the world.Latin America is high on the list of the undeveloped; it is unable to feed itsown people. Can anyone imagine Latin America in the role of global provider,supplying the needs of the entire world? It is only the United States—thecountry created by the principles of individualism, the freest example ofcapitalism in history, the first and last exponent of the Rights of Man—thatcould attempt such a role and would thereby be induced to commit suicide.Now observe that the encyclical is not concerned with man, with the individual;the “unit” of its thinking is the tribe: nations, countries, peoples—and itdiscusses them as if they had a totalitarian power to dispose of their citizens,as if such entities as individuals were of no significance any longer. This isindicative of the encyclical’s strategy: the United States is the highestachievement of the millennia of Western civilization’s struggle towardindividualism, and its last, precarious remnant. With the obliteration of theUnited States—i.e., of capitalism—there will be nothing left to deal with on theface of the globe but collectivized tribes. To hasten that day, the encyclicaltreats it as a fait accompli and addresses itself to the relationships amongtribes.Observe that the same morality—altruism, the morality of self-immolation—which,for centuries, has been preached against the individual, is now preached againstthe civilized nations. The creed of self-sacrifice—the primordial weapon used topenalize man’s success on earth, to undercut his self-confidence, to cripple hisindependence, to poison his enjoyment of life, to emasculate his pride, to stunthis self-esteem and paralyze his mind—is now counted upon to wreak the samedestruction on civilized nations and on civilization as such.I quote John Galt: “You have reached the blind alley of the treason youcommitted when you agreed that you had no right to exist. Once, you believed itwas ‘only a compromise’: you conceded it was evil to live for yourself, butmoral to live for the sake of your children. Then you conceded that it wasselfish to live for your children, but moral to live for your community. Thenyou conceded that it was selfish to live for your community, but moral to livefor your country. Now, you are letting this greatest of countries be devoured byany scum from any corner of the earth, while you concede that it is selfish tolive for your country and that your moral duty is to live for the globe. A manwho has no right to life, has no right to values and will not keep them.” (AtlasShrugged)Rights are conditions of existence required by man’s nature for his propersurvival qua man—i.e., qua rational being. They are not compatible withaltruism.Man’s soul or spirit is his consciousness; the motor of his consciousness isreason; deprive him of freedom, i.e., of the right to use his mind—and what isleft of him is only a physical body, ready to be manipulated by the strings ofany tribe.Ask yourself whether you have ever read a document as body-oriented as thatencyclical. The inhabitants of the world it proposes to establish are robotstuned to respond to a single stimulus: need—the lowest, grossest, physical,physicalistic need of any other robots anywhere: the minimum necessities, thebarely sufficient to keep all robots in working order, eating, sleeping,eliminating, and procreating, to produce more robots to work, eat, sleep,eliminate, and procreate. The most dehumanizing level of poverty is the level onwhich bare animal necessities become one’s only concern and goal; this is thelevel which the encyclical proposes to institutionalize and on which it proposesto immobilize all of mankind forever, with the animal needs of all as the onlymotivation of all (“all other rights whatsoever . . . are to be subordinated tothis principle”).If the encyclical charges that in a capitalist society men fall victim to “astifling materialism,” what is the atmosphere of that proposed world?The survivor of one such plan described it as follows: “We had no way of knowingtheir ability [the ability of others], we had no way of controlling theirneeds—all we knew was that we were beasts of burden struggling blindly in somesort of place that was half-hospital, halfstockyards—a place geared to nothingbut disability, disaster, disease—beasts put there for the relief of whateverwhoever chose to say was whichever’s need. . . . To work—with no chance for anextra ration, till the Cambodians have been fed and the Patagonians have beensent through college. To work—on a blank check held by every creature born, bymen whom you’ll never see, whose needs you’ll never know, whose ability orlaziness or sloppiness or fraud you have no way to learn and no right toquestion—just to work and work and work—and leave it up to the Ivys and theGeralds of the world to decide whose stomach will consume the effort, the dreamsand the days of your life.” (Atlas Shrugged)Do you think that I was exaggerating and that no one preaches ideals of thatkind?But, you say, the encyclical’s ideal will not work? It is not intended to work.It is not intended to relieve suffering or to abolish poverty; it is intended toinduce guilt. It is not intended to be accepted and practiced; it is intended tobe accepted and broken—broken by man’s “selfish” desire to live, which will thusbe turned into a shameful weakness. Men who accept as an ideal an irrationalgoal which they cannot achieve never lift their heads thereafter—and neverdiscover that their bowed heads were the only goal to be achieved.The relief of suffering is not altruism’s motive, it is only itsrationalization. Self-sacrifice is not altruism’s means to a happier end, it isits end—self-sacrifice as man’s permanent state, as a way of life and joylesstoil in the muck of a desolate earth where no “Why?” is ever to flash on in theveiled, extinguished eyes of children.The encyclical comes close to admitting this prospect, and does not attempt tooffer any earthly justification for altruistic martyrdom. It declares: “Far frombeing the ultimate measure of all things, man can only realize himself byreaching beyond himself.” (42) (Beyond the grave?) And: “This road toward agreater humanity requires effort and sacrifice, but suffering itself, acceptedfor the love of our brethren, favors the progress of the entire human family.”(79) And: “We are all united in this progress toward God.” (80)As to the attitude toward man’s mind, the clearest admission is to be foundoutside the encyclical. In a speech to a national conference of Italian bishops,on April 7, 1967, Pope Paul VI denounced the questioning of “any dogma that doesnot please and that demands the humble homage of the mind to be received.” Andhe urged the bishops to combat the “cult of one’s own person.” (The New YorkTimes, April 8, 1967.)On the question of what political system it advocates, the encyclical isscornfully indifferent: it would, apparently, find any political systemacceptable provided it is a version of statism. The vague allusions to somenominal form of private property make it probable that the encyclical favorsfascism. On the other hand, the tone, style, and vulgarity of argumentationsuggest a shopworn Marxism. But this very vulgarity seems to indicate a profoundindifference to intellectual discourse—as if, contemptuous of its audience, theencyclical picked whatever clichés were deemed to be safely fashionable today.The encyclical insists emphatically on only two political demands: that thenations of the future embrace statism, with a totalitarian control of theircitizens’ economic activities—and that these nations unite into a global state,with a totalitarian power over global planning. “This internationalcollaboration on a worldwide scale requires institutions that will prepare,coordinate and direct it . . . Who does not see the necessity of thusestablishing progressively a world authority, capable of acting effectively inthe juridical and political sectors?” (78)Is there any difference between the encyclical’s philosophy and communism? I amperfectly willing, on this matter, to take the word of an eminent Catholicauthority. Under the headline: “Encyclical Termed Rebuff to Marxism,” The NewYork Times of March 31, 1967, reports: “The Rev. John Courtney Murray, theprominent Jesuit theologian, described Pope Paul’s newest encyclical yesterdayas ‘the church’s definitive answer to Marxism.’ . . . ‘The Marxists haveproposed one way, and in pursuing their program they rely on man alone,’ FatherMurray said. ‘Now Pope Paul VI has issued a detailed plan to accomplish the samegoal on the basis of true humanism—humanism that recognizes man’s religiousnature.’ ”Amen.So much for those American “conservatives” who claim that religion is the baseof capitalism—and who believe that they can have capitalism and eat it, too, asthe moral cannibalism of the altruist ethics demands.And so much for those modern “liberals” who pride themselves on being thechampions of reason, science, and progress—and who smear the advocates ofcapitalism as superstitious, reactionary representatives of a dark past. Moveover, comrades, and make room for your latest fellow-travelers, who had alwaysbelonged on your side—then take a look, if you dare, at the kind of past theyrepresent.This is the spectacle of religion climbing on the band-wagon of statism, in adesperate attempt to recapture the power it lost at the time of the Renaissance.The Catholic Church has never given up the hope to re-establish the medievalunion of church and state, with a global state and a global theocracy as itsultimate goal. Since the Renaissance, it has always been cautiously last to jointhat political movement which could serve its purpose at the time. This time, itis too late: collectivism is dead intellectually; the band-wagon on which theChurch has climbed is a hearse. But, counting on that vehicle, the CatholicChurch is deserting Western civilization and calling upon the barbarian hordesto devour the achievements of man’s mind.There is an element of sadness in this spectacle. Catholicism had once been themost philosophical of all religions. Its long, illustrious philosophical historywas illuminated by a giant: Thomas Aquinas. He brought an Aristotelian view ofreason (an Aristotelian epistemology ) back into European culture, and lightedthe way to the Renaissance. For the brief span of the nineteenth century, whenhis was the dominant influence among Catholic philosophers, the grandeur of histhought almost lifted the Church close to the realm of reason (though at theprice of a basic contradiction). Now, we are witnessing the end of the Aquinasline—with the Church turning again to his primordial antagonist, who fits itbetter, to the mind-hating, life-hating St. Augustine. One could only wish theyhad given St. Thomas a more dignified requiem.The encyclical is the voice of the Dark Ages, rising again in today’sintellectual vacuum, like a cold wind whistling through the empty streets of anabandoned civilization.Unable to resolve a lethal contradiction, the conflict between individualism andaltruism, the West is giving up. When men give up reason and freedom, the vacuumis filled by faith and force.No social system can stand for long without a moral base. Project a magnificentskyscraper being built on quicksands: while men are struggling upward to add thehundredth and two-hundredth stories, the tenth and twentieth are vanishing,sucked under by the muck. That is the history of capitalism, of its swaying,tottering attempt to stand erect on the foundation of the altruist morality.It’s either-or. If capitalism’s befuddled, guilt-ridden apologists do not knowit, two fully consistent representatives of altruism do know it: Catholicism andcommunism.Their rapprochement, therefore, is not astonishing. Their differences pertainonly to the supernatural, but here, in reality, on earth, they have threecardinal elements in common: the same morality, altruism—the same goal, globalrule by force—the same enemy, man’s mind.There is a precedent for their strategy. In the German election of 1933, thecommunists supported the Nazis, on the premise that they could fight each otherfor power later, but must first destroy their common enemy, capitalism. Today,Catholicism and communism may well cooperate, on the premise that they willfight each other for power later, but must first destroy their common enemy, theindividual, by forcing mankind to unite to form one neck ready for one leash.The encyclical was endorsed with enthusiasm by the communist press the worldover. “The French Commu nist party newspaper, L’Humanité, said the encyclicalwas ‘often moving’ and constructive for highlighting the evils of capitalismlong emphasized by Marxists,” reports The New York Times (March 30, 1967).Those who do not understand the role of moral self-confidence in human affairswill not appreciate the sardonically ludicrous quality of the following itemfrom the same report: “The French Communists, however, deplored the failure ofthe Pope to make a distinction between rich Communist countries and richcapitalist countries in his general strictures against imbalance between the‘have’ and ‘have-not’ nations.”Thus, wealth acquired by force is rightful property, but wealth earned byproduction is not; looting is moral, but producing is not. And while thelooters’ spokesmen object to the encyclical’s damnation of wealth, theproducers’ spokesmen crawl, evading the issues, accepting the insults, promisingto give their wealth away. If capitalism does not survive, this is the spectaclethat will have made it unworthy of survival.The New York Times (March 30, 1967) declared editorially that the encyclical “isremarkably advanced in its economic philosophy. It is sophisticated,comprehensive and penetrating . . .” If, by “advanced,” the editorial meant thatthe encyclical’s philosophy has caught up with that of modern “liberals,” onewould have to agree—except that the Times is mistaken about the direction of themotion involved: it is not that the encyclical has progressed to the twentiethcentury, it is that the “liberals” have reverted to the fourth.The Wall Street Journal (May 10, 1967) went further. It declared, in effect,that the Pope didn’t mean it. The encyclical, it alleged, was just amisunderstanding caused by some mysterious conspiracy of the Vatican translatorswho misinterpreted the Pope’s ideas in transferring them from the original Latininto English. “His Holiness may not be showering compliments on the free marketsystem. But he is not at all saying what the Vatican’s English version appearedto make him say.”Through minute comparisons of Latin paragraphs with their official andunofficial translations, and columns of casuistic hair-splitting, The WallStreet Journal reached the conclusion that it was not capitalism that the Popewas denouncing, but only “some opinions” of capitalism. Which opinions?According to the unofficial translation, the encyclical’s paragraph 26 reads asfollows: “But out of these new conditions, we know not how, some opinions havecrept into human society according to which profit was regarded (in theseopinions) as the foremost incentive to encourage economic progress, freecompetition as the supreme rule of economics, private ownership of the means ofproduction as an absolute right which would accept neither limits nor a socialduty related to it. . . .”“In the Latin,” said the article, “Pope Paul is acknowledging the hardships . .. in the development of ‘some kinds of capitalism.’ But he puts the blame forthat not on ‘the whole woeful system’—i.e., the whole capitalistic system—but onsome corrupt views of it.”If the views advocating the profit motive, free competition, and privateproperty are “corrupt,” just what is capitalism? Blank out. What is The WallStreet Journal’s definition of capitalism? Blank out. What are we to designateas “capitalism” once all of its essential characteristics are removed? Blankout.This last question indicates the unstated meaning of that article: since thePope does not attack capitalism, but only its fundamental principles, we don’thave to worry.And for what, do you suppose, did that article find courage to reproach theencyclical? “What might have been wished for in the encyclical was anacknowledgment that capitalism can accept, and in the United States as well asother places does accept, a great many social responsibilities.”Sic transit gloria viae Wall.A similar attitude, with a similar range of vision, is taken by Time magazine(April 7, 1967). “Although Pope Paul had probably tried to give a Christianmessage relevant to the world’s contemporary economic situation, his encyclicalvirtually ignored the fact that old-style laissez-faire capitalism is about asdead as Das Kapital. Quite clearly, the Pope’s condemnation of capitalism wasaddressed to the unreconstructed variety that persists, for example, in LatinAmerica.”If this were a competition, the prize would go to Fortune, the businessmen’smagazine (May 1967). Its attitude is aggressively amoral and a-philosophical; itis proudly determined to maintain the separation of economics and ethics.“Capitalism is only an economic system,” it says.First acknowledging the Pope’s “praiseworthy purpose,” Fortune declares: “Butdespite its modern and global vision, Populorum Progressio may be aself-defeating document. It takes a dated and suspicious view of the workings ofeconomic enterprise. . . . The Pope has set up a straw man that has fewdefenders—if this passage [paragraph 26] is taken literally. Unalloyedlaissez-faire in fact governs no significant part of the world’s commerce. . . .‘Ownership,’ in advanced countries, has evolved in a way that subsumes ‘socialobligations.’ . . . ‘Absolute’ private rights are irrelevant in advancedindustrial societies.”After conceding all that, Fortune seems to be astonished and hurt that the Popedid not find it necessary to include businessmen among the “men of good will”whom he calls upon to combat global poverty. “In omitting any specific referenceto the businessman, he slights a natural and necessary ally, who, indeed isalready deeply committed in many parts of the world to the kind of effort thatPaul urges. Perhaps the businessman is taken for granted, as a kind ofprimordial force that can be counted upon to provide motive power, and thatneeds only to be tamed and harnessed and carefully watched. [And isn’t thatFortune’s own view of businessmen in their “unalloyed” state?]“The Vatican has seldom seemed able to look at capitalism as other than anecessary evil, at best, and Populorum Progressio suggests that a betterunderstanding still comes hard. This is not to suggest that capitalism is acomplete formula for social enlightenment and progress; it is only an economicsystem that men of good will can use—more successfully than any other system yetconceived—to attain the social goals that politics and religion help to define.”Observe the indecency of trying to justify capitalism on the grounds ofaltruistic service. Observe also the naiveté of the cynical: it is not theirwealth nor the relief of poverty that the encyclical is after.Militantly concrete-bound, equating cynicism with “practicality,” modernpragmatists are unable to see beyond the range of the moment or to grasp whatmoves the world and determines its direction. Men who are willing to swim withany current, to compromise on anything, to serve as means to anyone’s ends, losethe ability to understand the power of ideas. And while two hordes ofman-haters, who do understand it, are converging on civilization, they sit inthe middle, declaring that principles are straw men.I have heard the same accusation directed at Objectivism: we are fighting astraw man, they say, nobody preaches the kind of ideas we are opposing.Well, as a friend of mine observed, only the Vatican, the Kremlin, and theEmpire State Building93 [rand_9781101137697_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-93] know thereal issues of the modern world."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX: MAN’S RIGHTSby Ayn Rand If one wishes to advocate a free society—that is, capitalism—one must realizethat its indispensable foundation is the principle of individual rights. If onewishes to uphold individual rights, one must realize that capitalism is the onlysystem that can uphold and protect them. And if one wishes to gauge therelationship of freedom to the goals of today’s intellectuals, one may gauge itby the fact that the concept of individual rights is evaded, distorted,perverted and seldom discussed, most conspicuously seldom by the so-called“conservatives.”“Rights” are a moral concept—the concept that provides a logical transition fromthe principles guiding an individual’s actions to the principles guiding hisrelationship with others—the concept that preserves and protects individualmorality in a social context—the link between the moral code of a man and thelegal code of a society, between ethics and politics. Individual rights are themeans of subordinating society to moral law.Reprinted from The Virtue of Selfishness.Every political system is based on some code of ethics. The dominant ethics ofmankind’s history were variants of the altruist-collectivist doctrine whichsubordinated the individual to some higher authority, either mystical or social.Consequently, most political systems were variants of the same statist tyranny,differing only in degree, not in basic principle, limited only by the accidentsof tradition, of chaos, of bloody strife and periodic collapse. Under all suchsystems, morality was a code applicable to the individual, but not to society.Society was placed outside the moral law, as its embodiment or source orexclusive interpreter—and the inculcation of self-sacrificial devotion to socialduty was regarded as the main purpose of ethics in man’s earthly existence.Since there is no such entity as “society,” since society is only a number ofindividual men, this meant, in practice, that the rulers of society were exemptfrom moral law; subject only to traditional rituals, they held total power andexacted blind obedience—on the implicit principle of: “The good is that which isgood for society (or for the tribe, the race, the nation), and the ruler’sedicts are its voice on earth.”This was true of all statist systems, under all variants of thealtruist-collectivist ethics, mystical or social. “The Divine Right of Kings”summarizes the political theory of the first—“Vox populi, vox dei” of thesecond. As witness: the theocracy of Egypt, with the Pharaoh as an embodiedgod—the unlimited majority rule or democracy of Athens—the welfare state run bythe Emperors of Rome—the Inquisition of the late Middle Ages—the absolutemonarchy of France—the welfare state of Bismarck’s Prussia—the gas chambers ofNazi Germany—the slaughterhouse of the Soviet Union.All these political systems were expressions of the altruist-collectivistethics—and their common characteristic is the fact that society stood above themoral law, as an omnipotent, sovereign whim worshiper. Thus, politically, allthese systems were variants of an amoral society.The most profoundly revolutionary achievement of the United States of Americawas the subordination of society to moral law.The principle of man’s individual rights represented the extension of moralityinto the social system—as a limitation on the power of the state, as man’sprotection against the brute force of the collective, as the subordination ofmight to right. The United States was the first moral society in history.All previous systems had regarded man as a sacrificial means to the ends ofothers, and society as an end in itself. The United States regarded man as anend in himself, and society as a means to the peaceful, orderly, voluntarycoexistence of individuals. All previous systems had held that man’s lifebelongs to society, that society can dispose of him in any way it pleases, andthat any freedom he enjoys is his only by favor, by the permission of society,which may be revoked at any time. The United States held that man’s life is hisby right (which means: by moral principle and by his nature), that a right isthe property of an individual, that society as such has no rights, and that theonly moral purpose of a government is the protection of individual rights.A “right” is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom ofaction in a social context. There is only one fundamental right (all the othersare its consequences or corollaries): a man’s right to his own life. Life is aprocess of self-sustaining and self-generated action; the right to life meansthe right to engage in self-sustaining and self-generated action—which means:the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational beingfor the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his ownlife. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit ofhappiness.)The concept of a “right” pertains only to action—specifically, to freedom ofaction. It means freedom from physical compulsion, coercion or interference byother men.Thus, for every individual, a right is the moral sanction of a positive—of hisfreedom to act on his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary,uncoerced choice. As to his neighbors, his rights impose no obligations on themexcept of a negative kind: to abstain from violating his rights.The right to life is the source of all rights—and the right to property is theironly implementation. Without property rights, no other rights are possible.Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man who has no right tothe product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. The man who produceswhile others dispose of his product, is a slave.Bear in mind that the right to property is a right to action, like all theothers: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequencesof producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earnany property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is theright to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values.The concept of individual rights is so new in human history that most men havenot grasped it fully to this day. In accordance with the two theories of ethics,the mystical or the social, some men assert that rights are a gift ofGod—others, that rights are a gift of society. But, in fact, the source ofrights is man’s nature.The Declaration of Independence stated that men “are endowed by their Creatorwith certain unalienable rights.” Whether one believes that man is the productof a Creator or of nature, the issue of man’s origin does not alter the factthat he is an entity of a specific kind—a rational being—that he cannot functionsuccessfully under coercion, and that rights are a necessary condition of hisparticular mode of survival.“The source of man’s rights is not divine law or congressional law, but the lawof identity. A is A—and Man is Man. Rights are conditions of existence requiredby man’s nature for his proper survival. If man is to live on earth, it is rightfor him to use his mind, it is right to act on his own free judgment, it isright to work for his values and to keep the product of his work. If life onearth is his purpose, he has a right to live as a rational being: nature forbidshim the irrational.” (Atlas Shrugged)To violate man’s rights means to compel him to act against his own judgment, orto expropriate his values. Basically, there is only one way to do it: by the useof physical force. There are two potential violators of man’s rights: thecriminals and the government. The great achievement of the United States was todraw a distinction between these two—by forbidding to the second the legalizedversion of the activities of the first.The Declaration of Independence laid down the principle that “to secure theserights, governments are instituted among men.” This provided the only validjustification of a government and defined its only proper purpose: to protectman’s rights by protecting him from physical violence.Thus the government’s function was changed from the role of ruler to the role ofservant. The government was set to protect man from criminals—and theConstitution was written to protect man from the government. The Bill of Rightswas not directed against private citizens, but against the government—as anexplicit declaration that individual rights supersede any public or socialpower.The result was the pattern of a civilized society which—for the brief span ofsome hundred and fifty years—America came close to achieving. A civilizedsociety is one in which physical force is banned from human relationships—inwhich the government, acting as a policeman, may use force only in retaliationand only against those who initiate its use.This was the essential meaning and intent of America’s political philosophy,implicit in the principle of individual rights. But it was not formulatedexplicitly, nor fully accepted nor consistently practiced.America’s inner contradiction was the altruist-collectivist ethics. Altruism isincompatible with freedom, with capitalism and with individual rights. Onecannot combine the pursuit of happiness with the moral status of a sacrificialanimal.It was the concept of individual rights that had given birth to a free society.It was with the destruction of individual rights that the destruction of freedomhad to begin.A collectivist tyranny dare not enslave a country by an outright confiscation ofits values, material or moral. It has to be done by a process of internalcorruption. Just as in the material realm the plundering of a country’s wealthis accomplished by inflating the currency—so today one may witness the processof inflation being applied to the realm of rights. The process entails such agrowth of newly promulgated “rights” that people do not notice the fact that themeaning of the concept is being reversed. Just as bad money drives out goodmoney, so these “printing-press rights” negate authentic rights.Consider the curious fact that never has there been such a proliferation, allover the world, of two contradictory phenomena: of alleged new “rights” and ofslave-labor camps.The “gimmick” was the switch of the concept of rights from the political to theeconomic realm.The Democratic Party platform of 1960 summarizes the switch boldly andexplicitly. It declares that a Democratic Administration “will reaffirm theeconomic bill of rights which Franklin Roosevelt wrote into our nationalconscience sixteen years ago.”Bear clearly in mind the meaning of the concept of “rights” when you read thelist which that platform offers:“1. The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops orfarms or mines of the nation.“2. The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing andrecreation.“3. The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return whichwill give him and his family a decent living.“4. The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphereof freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home andabroad.“5. The right of every family to a decent home.“6. The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoygood health.“7. The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age,sickness, accidents and unemployment.“8. The right to a good education.”A single question added to each of the above eight clauses would make the issueclear: At whose expense?Jobs, food, clothing, recreation (!), homes, medical care, education, etc., donot grow in nature. These are man-made values—goods and services produced bymen. Who is to provide them?If some men are entitled by right to the products of the work of others, itmeans that those others are deprived of rights and condemned to slave labor.Any alleged “right” of one man, which necessitates the violation of the rightsof another, is not and cannot be a right.No man can have a right to impose an unchosen obligation, an unrewarded duty oran involuntary servitude on another man. There can be no such thing as “theright to enslave.”A right does not include the material implementation of that right by other men;it includes only the freedom to earn that implementation by one’s own effort.Observe, in this context, the intellectual precision of the Founding Fathers:they spoke of the right to the pursuit of happiness—not of the right tohappiness. It means that a man has the right to take the actions he deemsnecessary to achieve his happiness; it does not mean that others must make himhappy.The right to life means that a man has the right to support his life by his ownwork (on any economic level, as high as his ability will carry him); it does notmean that others must provide him with the necessities of life.The right to property means that a man has the right to take the economicactions necessary to earn property, to use it and to dispose of it; it does notmean that others must provide him with property.The right of free speech means that a man has the right to express his ideaswithout danger of suppression, interference or punitive action by thegovernment. It does not mean that others must provide him with a lecture hall, aradio station or a printing press through which to express his ideas.Any undertaking that involves more than one man requires the voluntary consentof every participant. Every one of them has the right to make his own decision,but none has the right to force his decision on the others.There is no such thing as “a right to a job”—there is only the right of freetrade, that is: a man’s right to take a job if another man chooses to hire him.There is no “right to a home,” only the right of free trade: the right to builda home or to buy it. There are no “rights to a ‘fair’ wage or a ‘fair’ price” ifno one chooses to pay it, to hire a man or to buy his product. There are no“rights of consumers” to milk, shoes, movies or champagne if no producers chooseto manufacture such items (there is only the right to manufacture them oneself).There are no “rights” of special groups, there are no “rights of farmers, ofworkers, of businessmen, of employees, of employers, of the old, of the young,of the unborn.”There are only the Rights of Man—rights possessed by every individual man and byall men as individuals.Property rights and the right of free trade are man’s only “economic rights”(they are, in fact, political rights)—and there can be no such thing as “aneconomic bill of rights.” But observe that the advocates of the latter have allbut destroyed the former.Remember that rights are moral principles which define and protect a man’sfreedom of action, but impose no obligations on other men. Private citizens arenot a threat to one another’s rights or freedom. A private citizen who resortsto physical force and violates the rights of others is a criminal—and men havelegal protection against him.Criminals are a small minority in any age or country. And the harm they havedone to mankind is infinitesimal when compared to the horrors—the bloodshed, thewars, the persecutions, the confiscations, the famines, the enslavements, thewholesale destructions—perpetrated by mankind’s governments. Potentially, agovernment is the most dangerous threat to man’s rights: it holds a legalmonopoly on the use of physical force against legally disarmed victims. Whenunlimited and unrestricted by individual rights, a government is man’s deadliestenemy. It is not as protection against private actions, but against governmentalactions that the Bill of Rights was written.Now observe the process by which that protection is being destroyed.The process consists of ascribing to private citizens the specific violationsconstitutionally forbidden to the government (which private citizens have nopower to commit) and thus freeing the government from all restrictions. Theswitch is becoming progressively more obvious in the field of free speech. Foryears, the collectivists have been propagating the notion that a privateindividual’s refusal to finance an opponent is a violation of the opponent’sright of free speech and an act of “censorship.”It is “censorship,” they claim, if a newspaper refuses to employ or publishwriters whose ideas are diametrically opposed to its policy.It is “censorship,” they claim, if businessmen refuse to advertise in a magazinethat denounces, insults and smears them.It is “censorship,” they claim, if a TV sponsor objects to some outrageperpetrated on a program he is financing—such as the incident of Alger Hissbeing invited to denounce former Vice-President Nixon.And then there is Newton N. Minow who declares: “There is censorship by ratings,by advertisers, by networks, by affiliates which reject programming offered totheir areas.” It is the same Mr. Minow who threatens to revoke the license ofany station that does not comply with his views on programming—and who claimsthat that is not censorship.Consider the implications of such a trend.“Censorship” is a term pertaining only to governmental action. No private actionis censorship. No private individual or agency can silence a man or suppress apublication; only the government can do so. The freedom of speech of privateindividuals includes the right not to agree, not to listen and not to financeone’s own antagonists.But according to such doctrines as the “economic bill of rights,” an individualhas no right to dispose of his own material means by the guidance of his ownconvictions—and must hand over his money indiscriminately to any speakers orpropagandists, who have a “right” to his property.This means that the ability to provide the material tools for the expression ofideas deprives a man of the right to hold any ideas. It means that a publisherhas to publish books he considers worthless, false or evil—that a TV sponsor hasto finance commentators who choose to affront his convictions—that the owner ofa newspaper must turn his editorial pages over to any young hooligan who clamorsfor the enslavement of the press. It means that one group of men acquires the“right” to unlimited license—while another group is reduced to helplessirresponsibility.But since it is obviously impossible to provide every claimant with a job, amicrophone or a newspaper column, who will determine the “distribution” of“economic rights” and select the recipients, when the owners’ right to choosehas been abolished? Well, Mr. Minow has indicated that quite clearly.And if you make the mistake of thinking that this applies only to big propertyowners, you had better realize that the theory of “economic rights” includes the“right” of every would-be playwright, every beatnik poet, every noise-composerand every non-objective artist (who have political pull) to the financialsupport you did not give them when you did not attend their shows. What else isthe meaning of the project to spend your tax money on subsidized art?And while people are clamoring about “economic rights,” the concept of politicalrights is vanishing. It is forgotten that the right of free speech means thefreedom to advocate one’s views and to bear the possible consequences, includingdisagreement with others, opposition, unpopularity and lack of support. Thepolitical function of “the right of free speech” is to protect dissenters andunpopular minorities from forcible suppression—not to guarantee them thesupport, advantages and rewards of a popularity they have not gained.The Bill of Rights reads: “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging thefreedom of speech, or of the press . . .” It does not demand that privatecitizens provide a microphone for the man who advocates their destruction, or apasskey for the burglar who seeks to rob them, or a knife for the murderer whowants to cut their throats.Such is the state of one of today’s most crucial issues: political rights versus“economic rights.” It’s either-or. One destroys the other. But there are, infact, no “economic rights,” no “collective rights,” no “public-interest rights.”The term “individual rights” is a redundancy: there is no other kind of rightsand no one else to possess them.Those who advocate laissez-faire capitalism are the only advocates of man’srights."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX: THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENTby Ayn Rand A government is an institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce certainrules of social conduct in a given geographical area.Do men need such an institution—and why?Since man’s mind is his basic tool of survival, his means of gaining knowledgeto guide his actions—the basic condition he requires is the freedom to think andto act according to his rational judgment. This does not mean that a man mustlive alone and that a desert island is the environment best suited to his needs.Men can derive enormous benefits from dealing with one another. A socialenvironment is most conducive to their successful survival—but only on certainconditions.“The two great values to be gained from social existence are: knowledge andtrade. Man is the only species that can transmit and expand his store ofknowledge from generation to generation; the knowledge potentially available toman is greater than any one man could begin to acquire in his own lifespan;every man gains an incalculable benefit from the knowledge discovered by others.The second great benefit is the division of labor: it enables a man to devotehis effort to a particular field of work and to trade with others who specializein other fields. This form of cooperation allows all men who take part in it toachieve a greater knowledge, skill and productive return on their effort thanthey could achieve if each had to produce everything he needs, on a desertisland or on a self-sustaining farm.Reprinted from The Virtue of Selfishness.“But these very benefits indicate, delimit and define what kind of men can be ofvalue to one another and in what kind of society: only rational, productive,independent men in a rational, productive, free society.” (“The ObjectivistEthics” in The Virtue of Selfishness.)A society that robs an individual of the product of his effort, or enslaves him,or attempts to limit the freedom of his mind, or compels him to act against hisown rational judgment—a society that sets up a conflict between its edicts andthe requirements of man’s nature—is not, strictly speaking, a society, but a mobheld together by institutionalized gang-rule. Such a society destroys all thevalues of human coexistence, has no possible justification and represents, not asource of benefits, but the deadliest threat to man’s survival. Life on a desertisland is safer than and incomparably preferable to existence in Soviet Russiaor Nazi Germany.If men are to live together in a peaceful, productive, rational society and dealwith one another to mutual benefit, they must accept the basic social principlewithout which no moral or civilized society is possible: the principle ofindividual rights.To recognize individual rights means to recognize and accept the conditionsrequired by man’s nature for his proper survival.Man’s rights can be violated only by the use of physical force. It is only bymeans of physical force that one man can deprive another of his life, or enslavehim, or rob him, or prevent him from pursuing his own goals, or compel him toact against his own rational judgment.The precondition of a civilized society is the barring of physical force fromsocial relationships—thus establishing the principle that if men wish to dealwith one another, they may do so only by means of reason: by discussion,persuasion and voluntary, uncoerced agreement.The necessary consequence of man’s right to life is his right to self-defense.In a civilized society, force may be used only in retaliation and only againstthose who initiate its use. All the reasons which make the initiation ofphysical force an evil, make the retaliatory use of physical force a moralimperative.If some “pacifist” society renounced the retaliatory use of force, it would beleft helplessly at the mercy of the first thug who decided to be immoral. Such asociety would achieve the opposite of its intention: instead of abolishing evil,it would encourage and reward it.If a society provided no organized protection against force, it would compelevery citizen to go about armed, to turn his home into a fortress, to shoot anystrangers approaching his door—or to join a protective gang of citizens whowould fight other gangs, formed for the same purpose, and thus bring about thedegeneration of that society into the chaos of gang-rule, i.e., rule by bruteforce, into the perpetual tribal warfare of prehistorical savages.The use of physical force—even its retaliatory use—cannot be left at thediscretion of individual citizens. Peaceful coexistence is impossible if a manhas to live under the constant threat of force to be unleashed against him byany of his neighbors at any moment. Whether his neighbors’ intentions are goodor bad, whether their judgment is rational or irrational, whether they aremotivated by a sense of justice or by ignorance or by prejudice or by malice—theuse of force against one man cannot be left to the arbitrary decision ofanother.Visualize, for example, what would happen if a man missed his wallet, concludedthat he had been robbed, broke into every house in the neighborhood to searchit, and shot the first man who gave him a dirty look, taking the look to be aproof of guilt.The retaliatory use of force requires objective rules of evidence to establishthat a crime has been committed and to prove who committed it, as well asobjective rules to define punishments and enforcement procedures. Men whoattempt to prosecute crimes, without such rules, are a lynch mob. If a societyleft the retaliatory use of force in the hands of individual citizens, it woulddegenerate into mob rule, lynch law and an endless series of bloody privatefeuds or vendettas.If physical force is to be barred from social relationships, men need aninstitution charged with the task of protecting their rights under an objectivecode of rules.This is the task of a government—of a proper government—its basic task, its onlymoral justification and the reason why men do need a government.A government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force underobjective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws.The fundamental difference between private action and governmental action—adifference thoroughly ignored and evaded today—lies in the fact that agovernment holds a monopoly on the legal use of physical force. It has to holdsuch a monopoly, since it is the agent of restraining and combating the use offorce; and for that very same reason, its actions have to be rigidly defined,delimited and circumscribed; no touch of whim or caprice should be permitted inits performance; it should be an impersonal robot, with the laws as its onlymotive power. If a society is to be free, its government has to be controlled.Under a proper social system, a private individual is legally free to take anyaction he pleases (so long as he does not violate the rights of others), while agovernment official is bound by law in his every official act. A privateindividual may do anything except that which is legally forbidden; a governmentofficial may do nothing except that which is legally permitted.This is the means of subordinating “might” to “right.” This is the Americanconcept of “a government of laws and not of men.”The nature of the laws proper to a free society and the source of itsgovernment’s authority are both to be derived from the nature and purpose of aproper government. The basic principle of both is indicated in The Declarationof Independence: “to secure these [individual] rights, governments areinstituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of thegoverned . . .”Since the protection of individual rights is the only proper purpose of agovernment, it is the only proper subject of legislation: all laws must be basedon individual rights and aimed at their protection. All laws must be objective(and objectively justifiable): men must know clearly, and in advance of takingan action, what the law forbids them to do (and why), what constitutes a crimeand what penalty they will incur if they commit it.The source of the government’s authority is “the consent of the governed.” Thismeans that the government is not the ruler, but the servant or agent of thecitizens; it means that the government as such has no rights except the rightsdelegated to it by the citizens for a specific purpose.There is only one basic principle to which an individual must consent if hewishes to live in a free, civilized society: the principle of renouncing the useof physical force and delegating to the government his right of physicalself-defense, for the purpose of an orderly, objective, legally definedenforcement. Or, to put it another way, he must accept the separation of forceand whim (any whim, including his own).Now what happens in case of a disagreement between two men about an undertakingin which both are involved?In a free society, men are not forced to deal with one another. They do so onlyby voluntary agreement and, when a time element is involved, by contract. If acontract is broken by the arbitrary decision of one man, it may cause adisastrous financial injury to the other—and the victim would have no recourseexcept to seize the offender’s property as compensation. But here again, the useof force cannot be left to the decision of private individuals. And this leadsto one of the most important and most complex functions of the government: tothe function of an arbiter who settles disputes among men according to objectivelaws.Criminals are a small minority in any semi-civilized society. But the protectionand enforcement of contracts through courts of civil law is the most crucialneed of a peaceful society; without such protection, no civilization could bedeveloped or maintained.Man cannot survive, as animals do, by acting on the range of the immediatemoment. Man has to project his goals and achieve them across a span of time; hehas to calculate his actions and plan his life long-range. The better a man’smind and the greater his knowledge, the longer the range of his planning. Thehigher or more complex a civilization, the longer the range of activity itrequires—and, therefore, the longer the range of contractual agreements amongmen, and the more urgent their need of protection for the security of suchagreements.Even a primitive barter society could not function if a man agreed to trade abushel of potatoes for a basket of eggs and, having received the eggs, refusedto deliver the potatoes. Visualize what this sort of whim-directed action wouldmean in an industrial society where men deliver a billion dollars’ worth ofgoods on credit, or contract to build multimillion-dollar structures, or signninety-nine-year leases.A unilateral breach of contract involves an indirect use of physical force: itconsists, in essence, of one man receiving the material values, goods orservices of another, then refusing to pay for them and thus keeping them byforce (by mere physical possession), not by right—i.e., keeping them without theconsent of their owner. Fraud involves a similarly indirect use of force: itconsists of obtaining material values without their owner’s consent, under falsepretenses or false promises. Extortion is another variant of an indirect use offorce: it consists of obtaining material values, not in exchange for values, butby the threat of force, violence or injury.Some of these actions are obviously criminal. Others, such as a unilateralbreach of contract, may not be criminally motivated, but may be caused byirresponsibility and irrationality. Still others may be complex issues with someclaim to justice on both sides. But whatever the case may be, all such issueshave to be made subject to objectively defined laws and have to be resolved byan impartial arbiter, administering the laws, i.e., by a judge (and a jury, whenappropriate).Observe the basic principle governing justice in all these cases: it is theprinciple that no man may obtain any values from others without the owners’consent— and, as a corollary, that a man’s rights may not be left at the mercyof the unilateral decision, the arbitrary choice, the irrationality, the whim ofanother man.Such, in essence, is the proper purpose of a government, to make socialexistence possible to men, by protecting the benefits and combating the evilswhich men can cause to one another.The proper functions of a government fall into three broad categories, all ofthem involving the issues of physical force and the protection of men’s rights:the police, to protect men from criminals—the armed services, to protect menfrom foreign invaders—the law courts, to settle disputes among men according toobjective laws.These three categories involve many corollary and derivative issues—and theirimplementation in practice, in the form of specific legislation, is enormouslycomplex. It belongs to the field of a special science: the philosophy of law.Many errors and many disagreements are possible in the field of implementation,but what is essential here is the principle to be implemented: the principlethat the purpose of law and of government is the protection of individualrights.Today, this principle is forgotten, ignored and evaded. The result is thepresent state of the world, with mankind’s retrogression to the lawlessness ofabsolutist tyranny, to the primitive savagery of rule by brute force.In unthinking protest against this trend, some people are raising the questionof whether government as such is evil by nature and whether anarchy is the idealsocial system. Anarchy, as a political concept, is a naive floating abstraction:for all the reasons discussed above, a society without an organized governmentwould be at the mercy of the first criminal who came along and who wouldprecipitate it into the chaos of gang warfare. But the possibility of humanimmorality is not the only objection to anarchy: even a society whose everymember were fully rational and faultlessly moral, could not function in a stateof anarchy; it is the need of objective laws and of an arbiter for honestdisagreements among men that necessitates the establishment of a government.A recent variant of anarchistic theory, which is befuddling some of the youngeradvocates of freedom, is a weird absurdity called “competing governments.”Accepting the basic premise of the modern statists—who see no difference betweenthe functions of government and the functions of industry, between force andproduction, and who advocate government ownership of business—the proponents of“competing governments” take the other side of the same coin and declare thatsince competition is so beneficial to business, it should also be applied togovernment. Instead of a single, monopolistic government, they declare, thereshould be a number of different governments in the same geographical area,competing for the allegiance of individual citizens, with every citizen free to“shop” and to patronize whatever government he chooses.Remember that forcible restraint of men is the only service a government has tooffer. Ask yourself what a competition in forcible restraint would have to mean.One cannot call this theory a contradiction in terms, since it is obviouslydevoid of any understanding of the terms “competition” and “government.” Nor canone call it a floating abstraction, since it is devoid of any contact with orreference to reality and cannot be concretized at all, not even roughly orapproximately. One illustration will be sufficient: suppose Mr. Smith, acustomer of Government A, suspects that his next-door neighbor, Mr. Jones, acustomer of Government B, has robbed him; a squad of Police A proceeds to Mr.Jones’s house and is met at the door by a squad of Police B, who declare thatthey do not accept the validity of Mr. Smith’s complaint and do not recognizethe authority of Government A. What happens then? You take it from there.The evolution of the concept of “government” has had a long, tortuous history.Some glimmer of the government’s proper function seems to have existed in everyorganized society, manifesting itself in such phenomena as the recognition ofsome implicit (if often non-existent) difference between a government and arobber gang—the aura of respect and of moral authority granted to the governmentas the guardian of “law and order”—the fact that even the most evil types ofgovernment found it necessary to maintain some semblance of order and somepretense at justice, if only by routine and tradition, and to claim some sort ofmoral justification for their power, of a mystical or social nature. Just as theabsolute monarchs of France had to invoke “The Divine Right of Kings,” so themodern dictators of Soviet Russia have to spend fortunes on propaganda tojustify their rule in the eyes of their enslaved subjects.In mankind’s history, the understanding of the government’s proper function is avery recent achievement: it is only two hundred years old and it dates from theFounding Fathers of the American Revolution. Not only did they identify thenature and the needs of a free society, but they devised the means to translateit into practice. A free society—like any other human product—cannot be achievedby random means, by mere wishing or by the leaders’ “good intentions.” A complexlegal system, based on objectively valid principles, is required to make asociety free and to keep it free—a system that does not depend on the motives,the moral character or the intentions of any given official, a system thatleaves no opportunity, no legal loophole for the development of tyranny.The American system of checks and balances was just such an achievement. Andalthough certain contradictions in the Constitution did leave a loophole for thegrowth of statism, the incomparable achievement was the concept of aconstitution as a means of limiting and restricting the power of the government.Today, when a concerted effort is made to obliterate this point, it cannot berepeated too often that the Constitution is a limitation on the government, noton private individuals—that it does not prescribe the conduct of privateindividuals, only the conduct of the government—that it is not a charter forgovernment power, but a charter of the citizens’ protection against thegovernment.Now consider the extent of the moral and political inversion in today’sprevalent view of government. Instead of being a protector of man’s rights, thegovernment is becoming their most dangerous violator; instead of guardingfreedom, the government is establishing slavery; instead of protecting men fromthe initiators of physical force, the government is initiating physical forceand coercion in any manner and issue it pleases; instead of serving as theinstrument of objectivity in human relationships, the government is creating adeadly, subterranean reign of uncertainty and fear, by means of non-objectivelaws whose interpretation is left to the arbitrary decisions of randombureaucrats; instead of protecting men from injury by whim, the government isarrogating to itself the power of unlimited whim—so that we are fast approachingthe stage of the ultimate inversion: the stage where the government is free todo anything it pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission; which isthe stage of the darkest periods of human history, the stage of rule by bruteforce.It has often been remarked that in spite of its material progress, mankind hasnot achieved any comparable degree of moral progress. That remark is usuallyfollowed by some pessimistic conclusion about human nature. It is true that themoral state of mankind is disgracefully low. But if one considers the monstrousmoral inversions of the governments (made possible by the altruist-collectivistmorality) under which mankind has had to live through most of its history, onebegins to wonder how men have managed to preserve even a semblance ofcivilization, and what indestructible vestige of self-esteem has kept themwalking upright on two feet.One also begins to see more clearly the nature of the political principles thathave to be accepted and advocated, as part of the battle for man’s intellectualRenaissance."},{"pageContent":"RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHYFor a study of Objectivism: Branden, Nathaniel, Who Is Ayn Rand?, New York: Random House, 1962; PaperbackLibrary, 1964.The Objectivist, a monthly journal published by The Objectivist, Inc., TheEmpire State Building, 350 Fifth Avenue, New York City.
