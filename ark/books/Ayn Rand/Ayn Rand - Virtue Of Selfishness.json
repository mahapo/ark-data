It is to them that I will give amore explicit answer.It is not a mere semantic issue nor a matter of arbitrary choice. The meaningascribed in popular usage to the word “selfishness” is not merely wrong: itrepresents a devastating intellectual “package-deal,” which is responsible, morethan any other single factor, for the arrested moral development of mankind.In popular usage, the word “selfishness” is a synonym of evil; the image itconjures is of a murderous brute who tramples over piles of corpses to achievehis own ends, who cares for no living being and pursues nothing but thegratification of the mindless whims of any immediate moment.Yet the exact meaning and dictionary definition of the word “selfishness” is:concern with one’s own interests.This concept does not include a moral evaluation; it does not tell us whetherconcern with one’s own interests is good or evil; nor does it tell us whatconstitutes man’s actual interests. It is the task of ethics to answer suchquestions.The ethics of altruism has created the image of the brute, as its answer, inorder to make men accept two inhuman tenets: (a) that any concern with one’s owninterests is evil, regardless of what these interests might be, and (b) that thebrute’s activities are in fact to one’s own interest (which altruism enjoins manto renounce for the sake of his neighbors).For a view of the nature of altruism, its consequences and the enormity of themoral corruption it perpetrates, I shall refer you to Atlas Shrugged—or to anyof today’s newspaper headlines. What concerns us here is altruism’s default inthe field of ethical theory.There are two moral questions which altruism lumps together into one“package-deal”: (1) What are values? (2) Who should be the beneficiary ofvalues? Altruism substitutes the second for the first; it evades the task ofdefining a code of moral values, thus leaving man, in fact, without moralguidance.Altruism declares that any action taken for the benefit of others is good, andany action taken for one’s own benefit is evil. Thus the beneficiary of anaction is the only criterion of moral value—and so long as that beneficiary isanybody other than oneself, anything goes.Hence the appalling immorality, the chronic injustice, the grotesque doublestandards, the insoluble conflicts and contradictions that have characterizedhuman relationships and human societies throughout history, under all thevariants of the altruist ethics.Observe the indecency of what passes for moral judgments today. An industrialistwho produces a fortune, and a gangster who robs a bank are regarded as equallyimmoral, since they both sought wealth for their own “selfish” benefit. A youngman who gives up his career in order to support his parents and never risesbeyond the rank of grocery clerk is regarded as morally superior to the youngman who endures an excruciating struggle and achieves his personal ambition. Adictator is regarded as moral, since the unspeakable atrocities he committedwere intended to benefit “the people,” not himself.Observe what this beneficiary-criterion of morality does to a man’s life. Thefirst thing he learns is that morality is his enemy; he has nothing to gain fromit, he can only lose; self-inflicted loss, self-inflicted pain and the gray,debilitating pall of an incomprehensible duty is all that he can expect. He mayhope that others might occasionally sacrifice themselves for his benefit, as hegrudgingly sacrifices himself for theirs, but he knows that the relationshipwill bring mutual resentment, not pleasure—and that, morally, their pursuit ofvalues will be like an exchange of unwanted, unchosen Christmas presents, whichneither is morally permitted to buy for himself. Apart from such times as hemanages to perform some act of self-sacrifice, he possesses no moralsignificance: morality takes no cognizance of him and has nothing to say to himfor guidance in the crucial issues of his life; it is only his own personal,private, “selfish” life and, as such, it is regarded either as evil or, at best,amoral.Since nature does not provide man with an automatic form of survival, since hehas to support his life by his own effort, the doctrine that concern with one’sown interests is evil means that man’s desire to live is evil—that man’s life,as such, is evil. No doctrine could be more evil than that.Yet that is the meaning of altruism, implicit in such examples as the equationof an industrialist with a robber. There is a fundamental moral differencebetween a man who sees his self-interest in production and a man who sees it inrobbery. The evil of a robber does not lie in the fact that he pursues his owninterests, but in what he regards as to his own interest; not in the fact thathe pursues his values, but in what he chose to value; not in the fact that hewants to live, but in the fact that he wants to live on a subhuman level (see“The Objectivist Ethics”).If it is true that what I mean by “selfishness” is not what is meantconventionally, then this is one of the worst indictments of altruism: it meansthat altruism permits no concept of a self-respecting, self-supporting man—a manwho supports his life by his own effort and neither sacrifices himself norothers. It means that altruism permits no view of men except as sacrificialanimals and profiteers-on-sacrifice, as victims and parasites—that it permits noconcept of a benevolent co-existence among men—that it permits no concept ofjustice.If you wonder about the reasons behind the ugly mixture of cynicism and guilt inwhich most men spend their lives, these are the reasons: cynicism, because theyneither practice nor accept the altruist morality—guilt, because they dare notreject it.To rebel against so devastating an evil, one has to rebel against its basicpremise. To redeem both man and morality, it is the concept of “selfishness”that one has to redeem.The first step is to assert man’s right to a moral existence —that is: torecognize his need of a moral code to guide the course and the fulfillment ofhis own life.For a brief outline of the nature and the validation of a rational morality, seemy lecture on “The Objectivist Ethics” which follows. The reasons why man needsa moral code will tell you that the purpose of morality is to define man’sproper values and interests, that concern with his own interests is the essenceof a moral existence, and that man must be the beneficiary of his own moralactions.Since all values have to be gained and/or kept by men’s actions, any breachbetween actor and beneficiary necessitates an injustice: the sacrifice of somemen to others, of the actors to the nonactors, of the moral to the immoral.Nothing could ever justify such a breach, and no one ever has.The choice of the beneficiary of moral values is merely a preliminary orintroductory issue in the field of morality. It is not a substitute for moralitynor a criterion of moral value, as altruism has made it. Neither is it a moralprimary: it has to be derived from and validated by the fundamental premises ofa moral system.The Objectivist ethics holds that the actor must always be the beneficiary ofhis action and that man must act for his own rational self-interest. But hisright to do so is derived from his nature as man and from the function of moralvalues in human life—and, therefore, is applicable only in the context of arational, objectively demonstrated and validated code of moral principles whichdefine and determine his actual self-interest. It is not a license “to do as hepleases” and it is not applicable to the altruists’ image of a “selfish” brutenor to any man motivated by irrational emotions, feelings, urges, wishes orwhims.This is said as a warning against the kind of “Nietzschean egoists” who, infact, are a product of the altruist morality and represent the other side of thealtruist coin: the men who believe that any action, regardless of its nature, isgood if it is intended for one’s own benefit. Just as the satisfaction of theirrational desires of others is not a criterion of moral value, neither is thesatisfaction of one’s own irrational desires. Morality is not a contest ofwhims. (See Mr. Branden’s articles “Counterfeit Individualism” and “Isn’tEveryone Selfish?” which follow.)A similar type of error is committed by the man who declares that since man mustbe guided by his own independent judgment, any action he chooses to take ismoral if he chooses it. One’s own independent judgment is the means by which onemust choose one’s actions, but it is not a moral criterion nor a moralvalidation: only reference to a demonstrable principle can validate one’schoices.Just as man cannot survive by any random means, but must discover and practicethe principles which his survival requires, so man’s self-interest cannot bedetermined by blind desires or random whims, but must be discovered and achievedby the guidance of rational principles. This is why the Objectivist ethics is amorality of rational self-interest—or of rational selfishness.Since selfishness is “concern with one’s own interests,” the Objectivist ethicsuses that concept in its exact and purest sense. It is not a concept that onecan surrender to man’s enemies, nor to the unthinking misconceptions,distortions, prejudices and fears of the ignorant and the irrational. The attackon “selfishness” is an attack on man’s self-esteem; to surrender one, is tosurrender the other.Now a word about the material in this book. With the exception of the lecture onethics, it is a collection of essays that have appeared in The ObjectivistNewsletter, a monthly journal of ideas, edited and published by NathanielBranden and myself. The Newsletter deals with the application of the philosophyof Objectivism to the issues and problems of today’s culture—more specifically,with that intermediary level of intellectual concern which lies betweenphilosophical abstractions and the journalistic concretes of day-by-dayexistence. Its purpose is to provide its readers with a consistent philosophicalframe of reference.This collection is not a systematic discussion of ethics, but a series of essayson those ethical subjects which needed clarification, in today’s context, orwhich had been most confused by altruism’s influence. You may observe that thetitles of some of the essays are in the form of a question. These come from our“Intellectual Ammunition Department” that answers questions sent in by ourreaders.—AYN RANDNew York, September 1964 P.S.

R."},{"pageContent":"1.The Objectivist Ethicsby Ayn RandSince I am to speak on the Objectivist Ethics, I shall begin by quoting its bestrepresentative—John Galt, in Atlas Shrugged:“Through centuries of scourges and disasters, brought /about by your code ofmorality, you have cried that your code had been broken, that the scourges werepunishment for breaking it, that men were too weak and too selfish to spill allthe blood it required. You damned man, you damned existence, you damned thisearth, but never dared to question your code.... You went on crying that yourcode was noble, but human nature was not good enough to practice it. And no onerose to ask the question: Good?—by what standard?“You wanted to know John Galt’s identity. I am the man who has asked thatquestion.“Yes, this is an age of moral crisis.... Your moral code has reached its climax,the blind alley at the end of its course. And if you wish to go on living, whatyou now need is not to return to morality ... but to discover it.”1[rand_9781101137222_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-1]What is morality, or ethics? It is a code of values to guide man’s choices andactions—the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of hislife. Ethics, as a science, deals with discovering and defining such a code.The first question that has to be answered, as a precondition of any attempt todefine, to judge or to accept any specific system of ethics, is: Why does manneed a code of values?Let me stress this. The first question is not: What particular code of valuesshould man accept? The first question is: Does man need values at all—and why?Is the concept of value, of “good or evil” an arbitrary human invention,unrelated to, underived from and unsupported by any facts of reality—or is itbased on a metaphysical fact, on an unalterable condition of man’s existence? (Iuse the word “metaphysical” to mean: that which pertains to reality, to thenature of things, to existence.) Does an arbitrary human convention, a merecustom, decree that man must guide his actions by a set of principles—or isthere a fact of reality that demands it? Is ethics the province of whims: ofpersonal emotions, social edicts and mystic revelations—or is it the province ofreason? Is ethics a subjective luxury—or an objective necessity?In the sorry record of the history of mankind’s ethics—with a few rare, andunsuccessful, exceptions—moralists have regarded ethics as the province ofwhims, that is: of the irrational. Some of them did so explicitly, byintention—others implicitly, by default. A “whim” is a desire experienced by aperson who does not know and does not care to discover its cause.No philosopher has given a rational, objectively demonstrable, scientific answerto the question of why man needs a code of values. So long as that questionremained unanswered, no rational, scientific, objective code of ethics could bediscovered or defined. The greatest of all philosophers, Aristotle, did notregard ethics as an exact science; he based his ethical system on observationsof what the noble and wise men of his time chose to do, leaving unanswered thequestions of: why they chose to do it and why he evaluated them as noble andwise.Most philosophers took the existence of ethics for granted, as the given, as ahistorical fact, and were not concerned with discovering its metaphysical causeor objective validation. Many of them attempted to break the traditionalmonopoly of mysticism in the field of ethics and, allegedly, to define arational, scientific, nonreligious morality. But their attempts consisted oftrying to justify them on social grounds, merely substituting society for God.The avowed mystics held the arbitrary, unaccountable “will of God” as thestandard of the good and as the validation of their ethics. The neomysticsreplaced it with “the good of society,” thus collapsing into the circularity ofa definition such as “the standard of the good is that which is good forsociety.” This meant, in logic—and, today, in worldwide practice—that “society”stands above any principles of ethics, since it is the source, standard andcriterion of ethics, since “the good” is whatever it wills, whatever it happensto assert as its own welfare and pleasure. This meant that “society” may doanything it pleases, since “the good” is whatever it chooses to do because itchooses to do it. And—since there is no such entity as “society,” since societyis only a number of individual men—this meant that some men (the majority or anygang that claims to be its spokesman) are ethically entitled to pursue any whims(or any atrocities) they desire to pursue, while other men are ethically obligedto spend their lives in the service of that gang’s desires.This could hardly be called rational, yet most philosophers have now decided todeclare that reason has failed, that ethics is outside the power of reason, thatno rational ethics can ever be defined, and that in the field of ethics—in thechoice of his values, of his actions, of his pursuits, of his life’s goals—manmust be guided by something other than reason. By what?Faith—instinct—intuition—revelation—feeling—taste—urge—wish—whim Today, as inthe past, most philosophers agree that the ultimate standard of ethics is whim(they call it “arbitrary postulate” or “subjective choice” or “emotionalcommitment”)—and the battle is only over the question or whose whim: one’s ownor society’s or the dictator’s or God’s. Whatever else they may disagree about,today’s moralists agree that ethics is a subjective issue and that the threethings barred from its field are: reason—mind—reality.If you wonder why the world is now collapsing to a lower and ever lower rung ofhell, this is the reason.If you want to save civilization, it is this premise of modern ethics—and of allethical history—that you must challenge.To challenge the basic premise of any discipline, one must begin at thebeginning. In ethics, one must begin by asking: What are values? Why does manneed them?“Value” is that which one acts to gain and/or keep. The concept “value” is not aprimary; it presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and forwhat? It presupposes an entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the faceof an alternative. Where no alternative exists, no goals and no values arepossible.I quote from Galt’s speech: “There is only one fundamental alternative in theuniverse: existence or nonexistence—and it pertains to a single class ofentities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter isunconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course ofaction. Matter is indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease toexist. It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issueof life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generatedaction. If an organism fails in that action, it dies; its chemical elementsremain, but its life goes out of existence. It is only the concept of ‘Life’that makes the concept of ‘Value’ possible. It is only to a living entity thatthings can be good or evil.”To make this point fully clear, try to imagine an immortal, indestructiblerobot, an entity which moves and acts, but which cannot be affected by anything,which cannot be changed in any respect, which cannot be damaged, injured ordestroyed. Such an entity would not be able to have any values; it would havenothing to gain or to lose; it could not regard anything as for or against it,as serving or threatening its welfare, as fulfilling or frustrating itsinterests. It could have no interests and no goals.Only a living entity can have goals or can originate them. And it is only aliving organism that has the capacity for self-generated, goal-directed action.On the physical level, the functions of all living organisms, from the simplestto the most complex—from the nutritive function in the single cell of an amoebato the blood circulation in the body of a man—are actions generated by theorganism itself and directed to a single goal: the maintenance of the organism’slife. 2 [rand_9781101137222_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-2]An organism’s life depends on two factors: the material or fuel which it needsfrom the outside, from its physical background, and the action of its own body,the action of using that fuel properly. What standard determines what is properin this context? The standard is the organism’s life, or: that which is requiredfor the organism’s survival.No choice is open to an organism in this issue: that which is required for itssurvival is determined by its nature, by the kind of entity it is. Manyvariations, many forms of adaptation to its background are possible to anorganism, including the possibility of existing for a while in a crippled,disabled or diseased condition, but the fundamental alternative of its existenceremains the same: if an organism fails in the basic functions required by itsnature—if an amoeba’s protoplasm stops assimilating food, or if a man’s heartstops beating—the organism dies. In a fundamental sense, stillness is theantithesis of life. Life can be kept in existence only by a constant process ofself-sustaining action. The goal of that action, the ultimate value which, to bekept, must be gained through its every moment, is the organism’s life.An ultimate value is that final goal or end to which all lesser goals are themeans—and it sets the standard by which all lesser goals are evaluated. Anorganism’s life is its standard of value: that which furthers its life is thegood, that which threatens it is the evil.Without an ultimate goal or end, there can be no lesser goals or means: a seriesof means going off into an infinite progression toward a nonexistent end is ametaphysical and epistemological impossibility. It is only an ultimate goal, anend in itself, that makes the existence of values possible. Metaphysically, lifeis the only phenomenon that is an end in itself: a value gained and kept by aconstant process of action. Epistemologically, the concept of “value” isgenetically dependent upon and derived from the antecedent concept of “life.” Tospeak of “value” as apart from “life” is worse than a contradiction in terms.“It is only the concept of ‘Life’ that makes the concept of ‘Value’ possible.”In answer to those philosophers who claim that no relation can be establishedbetween ultimate ends or values and the facts of reality, let me stress that thefact that living entities exist and function necessitates the existence ofvalues and of an ultimate value which for any given living entity is its ownlife. Thus the validation of value judgments is to be achieved by reference tothe facts of reality. The fact that a living entity is, determines what it oughtto do. So much for the issue of the relation between “is” and “ought.”Now in what manner does a human being discover the concept of “value”? By whatmeans does he first become aware of the issue of “good or evil” in its simplestform? By means of the physical sensations of pleasure or pain. Just assensations are the first step of the development of a human consciousness in therealm of cognition, so they are its first step in the realm of evaluation.The capacity to experience pleasure or pain is innate in a man’s body; it ispart of his nature, part of the kind of entity he is. He has no choice about it,and he has no choice about the standard that determines what will make himexperience the physical sensation of pleasure or of pain. What is that standard?His life.The pleasure-pain mechanism in the body of man—and in the bodies of all theliving organisms that possess the faculty of consciousness—serves as anautomatic guardian of the organism’s life. The physical sensation of pleasure isa signal indicating that the organism is pursuing the right course of action.The physical sensation of pain is a warning signal of danger, indicating thatthe organism is pursuing the wrong course of action, that something is impairingthe proper function of its body, which requires action to correct it. The bestillustration of this can be seen in the rare, freak cases of children who areborn without the capacity to experience physical pain; such children do notsurvive for long; they have no means of discovering what can injure them, nowarning signals, and thus a minor cut can develop into a deadly infection, or amajor illness can remain undetected until it is too late to fight it.Consciousness—for those living organisms which possess it—is the basic means ofsurvival.The simpler organisms, such as plants, can survive by means of their automaticphysical functions. The higher organisms, such as animals and man, cannot: theirneeds are more complex and the range of their actions is wider. The physicalfunctions of their bodies can perform automatically only the task of using fuel,but cannot obtain that fuel. To obtain it, the higher organisms need the facultyof consciousness. A plant can obtain its food from the soil in which it grows.An animal has to hunt for it. Man has to produce it.A plant has no choice of action; the goals it pursues are automatic and innate,determined by its nature. Nourishment, water, sunlight are the values its naturehas set it to seek. Its life is the standard of value directing its actions.There are alternatives in the conditions it encounters in its physicalbackground—such as heat or frost, drought or flood—and there are certain actionswhich it is able to perform to combat adverse conditions, such as the ability ofsome plants to grow and crawl from under a rock to reach the sunlight. Butwhatever the conditions, there is no alternative in a plant’s function: it actsautomatically to further its life, it cannot act for its own destruction.The range of actions required for the survival of the higher organisms is wider:it is proportionate to the range of their consciousness. The lower of theconscious species possess only the faculty of sensation, which is sufficient todirect their actions and provide for their needs. A sensation is produced by theautomatic reaction of a sense organ to a stimulus from the outside world; itlasts for the duration of the immediate moment, as long as the stimulus lastsand no longer. Sensations are an automatic response, an automatic form ofknowledge, which a consiousness can neither seek nor evade. An organism thatpossesses only the faculty of sensation is guided by the pleasure-pain mechanismof its body, that is: by an automatic knowledge and an automatic code of values.Its life is the standard of value directing its actions. Within the range ofaction possible to it, it acts automatically to further its life and cannot actfor its own destruction.The higher organisms possess a much more potent form of consciousness: theypossess the faculty of retaining sensations, which is the faculty of perception.A “perception” is a group of sensations automatically retained and integrated bythe brain of a living organism, which gives it the ability to be aware, not ofsingle stimuli, but of entities, of things. An animal is guided, not merely byimmediate sensations, but by percepts. Its actions are not single, discreteresponses to single, separate stimuli, but are directed by an integratedawareness of the perceptual reality confronting it. It is able to grasp theperceptual concretes immediately present and it is able to form automaticperceptual associations, but it can go no further. It is able to learn certainskills to deal with specific situations, such as hunting or hiding, which theparents of the higher animals teach their young. But an animal has no choice inthe knowledge and the skills that it acquires; it can only repeat themgeneration after generation. And an animal has no choice in the standard ofvalue directing its actions: its senses provide it with an automatic code ofvalues, an automatic knowledge of what is good for it or evil, what benefits orendangers its life. An animal has no power to extend its knowledge or to evadeit. In situations for which its knowledge is inadequate, it perishes—as, forinstance, an animal that stands paralyzed on the track of a railroad in the pathof a speeding train. But so long as it lives, an animal acts on its knowledge,with automatic safety and no power of choice: it cannot suspend its ownconsciousness—it cannot choose not to perceive—it cannot evade its ownperceptions—it cannot ignore its own good, it cannot decide to choose the eviland act as its own destroyer.Man has no automatic code of survival. He has no automatic course of action, noautomatic set of values. His senses do not tell him automatically what is goodfor him or evil, what will benefit his life or endanger it, what goals he shouldpursue and what means will achieve them, what values his life depends on, whatcourse of action it requires. His own consciousness has to discover the answersto all these questions—but his consciousness will not function automatically.Man, the highest living species on this earth—the being whose consciousness hasa limitless capacity for gaining knowledge—man is the only living entity bornwithout any guarantee of remaining conscious at all. Man’s particulardistinction from all other living species is the fact that his consciousness isvolitional.Just as the automatic values directing the functions of a plant’s body aresufficient for its survival, but are not sufficient for an animal’s—so theautomatic values provided by the sensory-perceptual mechanism of itsconsciousness are sufficient to guide an animal, but are not sufficient for man.Man’s actions and survival require the guidance of conceptual values derivedfrom conceptual knowledge. But conceptual knowledge cannot be acquiredautomatically.A “concept” is a mental integration of two or more perceptual concretes, whichare isolated by a process of abstraction and united by means of a specificdefinition. Every word of man’s language, with the exception of proper names,denotes a concept, an abstraction that stands for an unlimited number ofconcretes of a specific kind. It is by organizing his perceptual material intoconcepts, and his concepts into wider and still wider concepts that man is ableto grasp and retain, to identify and integrate an unlimited amount of knowledge,a knowledge extending beyond the immediate perceptions of any given, immediatemoment. Man’s sense organs function automatically; man’s brain integrates hissense data into percepts automatically; but the process of integrating perceptsinto concepts—the process of abstraction and of concept-formation—is notautomatic.The process of concept-formation does not consist merely of grasping a fewsimple abstractions, such as “chair,” “table,” “hot,” “cold,” and of learning tospeak. It consists of a method of using one’s consciousness, best designated bythe term “conceptualizing.” It is not a passive state of registering randomimpressions. It is an actively sustained process of identifying one’simpressions in conceptual terms, of integrating every event and everyobservation into a conceptual context, of grasping relationships, differences,similarities in one’s perceptual material and of abstracting them into newconcepts, of drawing inferences, of making deductions, of reaching conclusions,of asking new questions and discovering new answers and expanding one’sknowledge into an ever-growing sum. The faculty that directs this process, thefaculty that works by means of concepts, is: reason. The process is thinking.Reason is the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided byman’s senses. It is a faculty that man has to exercise by choice. Thinking isnot an automatic function. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free tothink or to evade that effort. Thinking requires a state of full, focusedawareness. The act of focusing one’s consciousness is volitional. Man can focushis mind to a full, active, purposefully directed awareness of reatity—or he canunfocus it and let himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to anychance stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his undirectedsensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random, associational connections itmight happen to make.When man unfocuses his mind, he may be said to be conscious in a subhuman senseof the word, since he experiences sensations and perceptions. But in the senseof the word applicable to man—in the sense of a consciousness which is aware ofreality and able to deal with it, a consciousness able to direct the actions andprovide for the survival of a human being—an unfocused mind is not conscious.Psychologically, the choice “to think or not” is the choice “to focus or not.”Existentially, the choice “to focus or not” is the choice “to be conscious ornot.” Metaphysically, the choice “to be conscious or not” is the choice of lifeor death.Consciousness—for those living organisms which possess it—is the basic means ofsurvival. For man, the basic means of survival is reason. Man cannot survive, asanimals do, by the guidance of mere percepts. A sensation of hunger will tellhim that he needs food (if he has learned to identify it as “hunger”), but itwill not tell him how to obtain his food and it will not tell him what food isgood for him or poisonous. He cannot provide for his simplest physical needswithout a process of thought. He needs a process of thought to discover how toplant and grow his food or how to make weapons for hunting. His percepts mightlead him to a cave, if one is available—but to build the simplest shelter, heneeds a process of thought. No percepts and no “instincts” will tell him how tolight a fire, how to weave cloth, how to forge tools, how to make a wheel, howto make an airplane, how to perform an appendectomy, how to produce an electriclight bulb or an electronic tube or a cyclotron or a box of matches. Yet hislife depends on such knowledge—and only a volitional act of his consciousness, aprocess of thought, can provide it.But man’s responsibility goes still further: a process of thought is notautomatic nor “instinctive” nor involuntary—nor infallible. Man has to initiateit, to sustain it and to bear responsibility for its results. He has to discoverhow to tell what is true or false and how to correct his own errors; he has todiscover how to validate his concepts, his conclusions, his knowledge; he has todiscover the rules of thought, the laws of logic, to direct his thinking. Naturegives him no automatic guarantee of the efficacy of his mental effort.Nothing is given to man on earth except a potential and the material on which toactualize it. The potential is a superlative machine: his consciousness; but itis a machine without a spark plug, a machine of which his own will has to be thespark plug, the self-starter and the driver; he has to discover how to use itand he has to keep it in constant action. The material is the whole of theuniverse, with no limits set to the knowledge he can acquire and to theenjoyment of life he can achieve. But everything he needs or desires has to belearned, discovered and produced by him—by his own choice, by his own effort, byhis own mind.A being who does not know automatically what is true or false, cannot knowautomatically what is right or wrong, what is good for him or evil. Yet he needsthat knowledge in order to live. He is not exempt from the laws of reality, heis a specific organism of a specific nature that requires specific actions tosustain his life. He cannot achieve his survival by arbitrary means nor byrandom motions nor by blind urges nor by chance nor by whim. That which hissurvival requires is set by his nature and is not open to his choice. What isopen to his choice is only whether he will discover it or not, whether he willchoose the right goals and values or not. He is free to make the wrong choice,but not free to succeed with it. He is free to evade reality, he is free tounfocus his mind and stumble blindly down any road he pleases, but not free toavoid the abyss he refuses to see. Knowledge, for any conscious organism, is themeans of survival; to a living consciousness, every “is” implies an “ought.” Manis free to choose not to be conscious, but not free to escape the penalty ofunconsciousness: destruction. Man is the only living species that has the powerto act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of hishistory.What, then, are the right goals for man to pursue? What are the values hissurvival requires? That is the question to be answered by the science of ethics.And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why man needs a code of ethics.Now you can assess the meaning of the doctrines which tell you that ethics isthe province of the irrational, that reason cannot guide man’s life, that hisgoals and values should be chosen by vote or by whim—that ethics has nothing todo with reality, with existence, with one’s practical actions and concerns—orthat the goal of ethics is beyond the grave, that the dead need ethics, not theliving.Ethics is not a mystic fantasy—nor a social convention—nor a dispensable,subjective luxury, to be switched or discarded in any emergency. Ethics is anobjective, metaphysical necessity of man’s survival—not by the grace of thesupernatural nor of your neighbors nor of your whims, but by the grace ofreality and the nature of life.I quote from Galt’s speech: “Man has been called a rational being, butrationality is a matter of choice—and the alternative his nature offers him is:rational being or suicidal animal. Man has to be man—by choice; he has to holdhis life as a value—by choice; he has to learn to sustain it—by choice; he hasto discover the values it requires and practice his virtues—by choice. A code ofvalues accepted by choice is a code of morality.”The standard of value of the Objectivist ethics—the standard by which one judgeswhat is good or evil—is man’s life, or: that which is required for man’ssurvival qua man.Since reason is man’s basic means of survival, that which is proper to the lifeof a rational being is the good; that which negates, opposes or destroys it isthe evil.Since everything man needs has to be discovered by his own mind and produced byhis own effort, the two essentials of the method of survival proper to arational being are: thinking and productive work.If some men do not choose to think, but survive by imitating and repeating, liketrained animals, the routine of sounds and motions they learned from others,never making an effort to understand their own work, it still remains true thattheir survival is made possible only by those who did choose to think and todiscover the motions they are repeating. The survival of such mental parasitesdepends on blind chance; their unfocused minds are unable to know whom toimitate, whose motions it is safe to follow. They are the men who march into theabyss, trailing after any destroyer who promises them to assume theresponsibility they evade: the responsibility of being conscious.If some men attempt to survive by means of brute force or fraud, by looting,robbing, cheating or enslaving the men who produce, it still remains true thattheir survival is made possible only by their victims, only by the men whochoose to think and to produce the goods which they, the looters, are seizing.Such looters are parasites incapable of survival, who exist by destroying thosewho are capable, those who are pursuing a course of action proper to man.The men who attempt to survive, not by means of reason, but by means of force,are attempting to survive by the method of animals. But just as animals wouldnot be able to survive by attempting the method of plants, by rejectinglocomotion and waiting for the soil to feed them—so men cannot survive byattempting the method of animals, by rejecting reason and counting on productivemen to serve as their prey. Such looters may achieve their goals for the rangeof a moment, at the price of destruction: the destruction of their victims andtheir own. As evidence, I offer you any criminal or any dictatorship.Man cannot survive, like an animal, by acting on the range of the moment. Ananimal’s life consists of a series of separate cycles, repeated over and overagain, such as the cycle of breeding its young, or of storing food for thewinter; an animal’s consciousness cannot integrate its entire lifespan; it cancarry just so far, then the animal has to begin the cycle all over again, withno connection to the past. Man’s life is a continuous whole: for good or evil,every day, year and decade of his life holds the sum of all the days behind him.He can alter his choices, he is free to change the direction of his course, heis even free, in many cases, to atone for the consequences of his past—but he isnot free to escape them, nor to live his life with impunity on the range of themoment, like an animal, a playboy or a thug. If he is to succeed at the task ofsurvival, if his actions are not to be aimed at his own destruction, man has tochoose his course, his goals, his values in the context and terms of a lifetime.No sensations, percepts, urges or “instincts” can do it; only a mind can.Such is the meaning of the definition: that which is required for man’s survivalqua man. It does not mean a momentary or a merely physical survival. It does notmean the momentary physical survival of a mindless brute, waiting for anotherbrute to crush his skull. It does not mean the momentary physical survival of acrawling aggregate of muscles who is willing to accept any terms, obey any thugand surrender any values, for the sake of what is known as “survival at anyprice,” which may or may not last a week or a year. “Man’s survival qua man”means the terms, methods, conditions and goals required for the survival of arational being through the whole of his lifespan—in all those aspects ofexistence which are open to his choice.Man cannot survive as anything but man. He can abandon his means of survival,his mind, he can turn himself into a subhuman creature and he can turn his lifeinto a brief span of agony—just as his body can exist for a while in the processof disintegration by disease. But he cannot succeed, as a subhuman, in achievinganything but the subhuman—as the ugly horror of the antirational periods ofmankind’s history can demonstrate. Man has to be man by choice—and it is thetask of ethics to teach him how to live like man.The Objectivist ethics holds man’s life as the standard of value—and his ownlife as the ethical purpose of every individual man.The difference between “standard” and “purpose” in this context is as follows: a“standard” is an abstract principle that serves as a measurement or gauge toguide a man’s choices in the achievement of a concrete, specific purpose. “Thatwhich is required for the survival of man qua man” is an abstract principle thatapplies to every individual man. The task of applying this principle to aconcrete, specific purpose—the purpose of living a life proper to a rationalbeing—belongs to every individual man, and the life he has to live is his own.Man must choose his actions, values and goals by the standard of that which isproper to man—in order to achieve, maintain, fulfill and enjoy that ultimatevalue, that end in itself, which is his own life.Value is that which one acts to gain and/or keep—virtue is the act by which onegains and/or keeps it. The three cardinal values of the Objectivist ethics—thethree values which, together, are the means to and the realization of one’sultimate value, one’s own life—are: Reason, Purpose, Self-Esteem, with theirthree corresponding virtues: Rationality, Productiveness, Pride.Productive work is the central purpose of a rational man’s life, the centralvalue that integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values.Reason is the source, the precondition of his productive work—pride is theresult.Rationality is man’s basic virtue, the source of all his other virtues. Man’sbasic vice, the source of all his evils, is the act of unfocusing his mind, thesuspension of his consciousness, which is not blindness, but the refusal to see,not ignorance, but the refusal to know. Irrationality is the rejection of man’smeans of survival and, therefore, a commitment to a course of blind destruction;that which is anti-mind, is anti-life,The virtue of Rationality means the recognition and acceptance of reason asone’s only source of knowledge, one’s only judge of values and one’s only guideto action. It means one’s total commitment to a state of full, consciousawareness, to the maintenance of a full mental focus in all issues, in allchoices, in all of one’s waking hours. It means a commitment to the fullestperception of reality within one’s power and to the constant, active expansionof one’s perception, i.e., of one’s knowledge. It means a commitment to thereality of one’s own existence, i.e., to the principle that all of one’s goals,values and actions take place in reality and, therefore, that one must neverplace any value or consideration whatsoever above one’s perception of reality.It means a commitment to the principle that all of one’s convictions, values,goals, desires and actions must be based on, derived from, chosen and validatedby a process of thought—as precise and scrupulous a process of thought, directedby as ruthlessly strict an application of logic, as one’s fullest capacitypermits. It means one’s acceptance of the responsibility of forming one’s ownjudgments and of living by the work of one’s own mind (which is the virtue ofIndependence). It means that one must never sacrifice one’s convictions to theopinions or wishes of others (which is the virtue of Integrity)—that one mustnever attempt to fake reality in any manner (which is the virtue of Honesty)—that one must never seek or grant the unearned and undeserved, neither inmatter nor in spirit (which is the virtue of Justice). It means that one mustnever desire effects without causes, and that one must never enact a causewithout assuming full responsibility for its effects—that one must never actlike a zombie, i.e., without knowing one’s own purposes and motives—that onemust never make any decisions, form any convictions or seek any values out ofcontext, i.e., apart from or against the total, integrated sum of one’sknowledge—and, above all, that one must never seek to get away withcontradictions. It means the rejection of any form of mysticism, i.e., any claimto some nonsensory, nonrational, nondefinable, supernatural source of knowledge.It means a commitment to reason, not in sporadic fits or on selected issues orin special emergencies, but as a permanent way of life.The virtue of Productiveness is the recognition of the fact that productive workis the process by which man’s mind sustains his life, the process that sets manfree of the necessity to adjust himself to his background, as all animals do,and gives him the power to adjust his background to himself. Productive work isthe road of man’s unlimited achievement and calls upon the highest attributes ofhis character: his creative ability, his ambitiousness, his self-assertiveness,his refusal to bear uncontested disasters, his dedication to the goal ofreshaping the earth in the image of his values. “Productive work” does not meanthe unfocused performance of the motions of some job. It means the consciouslychosen pursuit of a productive career, in any line of rational endeavor, greator modest, on any level of ability. It is not the degree of a man’s ability northe scale of his work that is ethically relevant here, but the fullest and mostpurposeful use of his mind.The virtue of Pride is the recognition of the fact “that as man must produce thephysical values he needs to sustain his life, so he must acquire the values ofcharacter that make his life worth sustaining—that as man is a being ofself-made wealth, so he is a being of self-made soul.” (Atlas Shrugged.) Thevirtue of Pride can best be described by the term: “moral ambitiousness.” Itmeans that one must earn the right to hold oneself as one’s own highest value byachieving one’s own moral perfection—which one achieves by never accepting anycode of irrational virtues impossible to practice and by never failing topractice the virtues one knows to be rational—by never accepting an unearnedguilt and never earning any, or, if one has earned it, never leaving ituncorrected—by never resigning oneself passively to any flaws in one’scharacter—by never placing any concern, wish, fear or mood of the moment abovethe reality of one’s own self-esteem. And, above all, it means one’s rejectionof the role of a sacrificial animal, the rejection of any doctrine that preachesself-immolation as a moral virtue or duty.The basic social principle of the Objectivist ethics is that just as life is anend in itself, so every living human being is an end in himself, not the meansto the ends or the welfare of others—and, therefore, that man must live for hisown sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others tohimself. To live for his own sake means that the achievement of his ownhappiness is man’s highest moral purpose.In psychological terms, the issue of man’s survival does not confront hisconsciousness as an issue of “life or death,” but as an issue of “happiness orsuffering.” Happiness is the successful state of life, suffering is the warningsignal of failure, of death. Just as the pleasure-pain mechanism of man’s bodyis an automatic indicator of his body’s welfare or injury, a barometer of itsbasic alternative, life or death—so the emotional mechanism of man’sconsciousness is geared to perform the same function, as a barometer thatregisters the same alternative by means of two basic emotions: joy or suffering.Emotions are the automatic results of man’s value judgments integrated by hissubconscious; emotions are estimates of that which furthers man’s values orthreatens them, that which is for him or against him—lightning calculatorsgiving him the sum of his profit or loss.But while the standard of value operating the physical pleasure-pain mechanismof man’s body is automatic and innate, determined by the nature of his body—thestandard of value operating his emotional mechanism, is not. Since man has noautomatic knowledge, he can have no automatic values; since he has no innateideas, he can have no innate value judgments.Man is born with an emotional mechanism, just as he is born with a cognitivemechanism; but, at birth, both are “tabula rasa.” It is man’s cognitive faculty,his mind, that determines the content of both. Man’s emotional mechanism is likean electronic computer, which his mind has to program—and the programmingconsists of the values his mind chooses.But since the work of man’s mind is not automatic, his values, like all hispremises, are the product either of his thinking or of his evasions: man chooseshis values by a conscious process of thought—or accepts them by default, bysubconscious associations, on faith, on someone’s authority, by some form ofsocial osmosis or blind imitation. Emotions are produced by man’s premises, heldconsciously or subconsciously, explicitly or implicitly.Man has no choice about his capacity to feel that something is good for him orevil, but what he will consider good or evil, what will give him joy or pain,what he will love or hate, desire or fear, depends on his standard of value. Ifhe chooses irrational values, he switches his emotional mechanism from the roleof his guardian to the role of his destroyer. The irrational is the impossible;it is that which contradicts the facts of reality; facts cannot be altered by awish, but they can destroy the wisher. If a man desires and pursuescontradictions—if he wants to have his cake and eat it, too—he disintegrates hisconsciousness; he turns his inner life into a civil war of blind forces engagedin dark, incoherent, pointless, meaningless conflicts (which, incidentally, isthe inner state of most people today).Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement ofone’s values. If a man values productive work, his happiness is the measure ofhis success in the service of his life. But if a man values destruction, like asadist—or self-torture, like a masochist—or life beyond the grave, like amystic—or mindless “kicks,” like the driver of a hotrod car—his allegedhappiness is the measure of his success in the service of his own destruction.It must be added that the emotional state of all those irrationalists cannot beproperly designated as happiness or even as pleasure: it is merely a moment’srelief from their chronic state of terror.Neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of irrational whims.Just as man is free to attempt to survive by any random means, as a parasite, amoocher or a looter, but not free to succeed at it beyond the range of themoment—so he is free to seek his happiness in any irrational fraud, any whim,any delusion, any mindless escape from reality, but not free to succeed at itbeyond the range of the moment nor to escape the consequences.I quote from Galt’s speech: “Happiness is a state of noncontradictory joy—a joywithout penalty or guilt, a joy that does not clash with any of your values anddoes not work for your own destruction.... Happiness is possible only to arational man, the man who desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing butrational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions.”The maintenance of life and the pursuit of happiness are not two separateissues. To hold one’s own life as one’s ultimate value, and one’s own happinessas one’s highest purpose are two aspects of the same achievement. Existentially,the activity of pursuing rational goals is the activity of maintaining one’slife; psychologically, its result, reward and concomitant is an emotional stateof happiness. It is by experiencing happiness that one lives one’s life, in anyhour, year or the whole of it. And when one experiences the kind of purehappiness that is an end in itself—the kind that makes one think: “This is worthliving for”—what one is greeting and affirming in emotional terms is themetaphysical fact that life is an end in itself.But the relationship of cause to effect cannot be reversed. It is only byaccepting “man’s life” as one’s primary and by pursuing the rational values itrequires that one can achieve happiness—not by taking “happiness” as someundefined, irreducible primary and then attempting to live by its guidance. Ifyou achieve that which is the good by a rational standard of value, it willnecessarily make you happy; but that which makes you happy, by some undefinedemotional standard, is not necessarily the good. To take “whatever makes onehappy” as a guide to action means: to be guided by nothing but one’s emotionalwhims. Emotions are not tools of cognition; to be guided by whims—by desireswhose source, nature and meaning one does not know—is to turn oneself into ablind robot, operated by unknowable demons (by one’s stale evasions), a robotknocking its stagnant brains out against the walls of reality which it refusesto see.This is the fallacy inherent in hedonism—in any variant of ethical hedonism,personal or social, individual or collective. “Happiness” can properly be thepurpose of ethics, but not the standard. The task of ethics is to define man’sproper code of values and thus to give him the means of achieving happiness. Todeclare, as the ethical hedonists do, that “the proper value is whatever givesyou pleasure” is to declare that “the proper value is whatever you happen tovalue”—which is an act of intellectual and philosophical abdication, an actwhich merely proclaims the futility of ethics and invites all men to play itdeuces wild.The philosophers who attempted to devise an allegedly rational code of ethicsgave mankind nothing but a choice of whims: the “selfish” pursuit of one’s ownwhims (such as the ethics of Nietzsche)—or “selfless” service to the whims ofothers (such as the ethics of Bentham, Mill, Comte and of all social hedonists,whether they allowed man to include his own whims among the millions of othersor advised him to turn himself into a totally selfless “shmoo” that seeks to beeaten by others).When a “desire,” regardless of its nature or cause, is taken as an ethicalprimary, and the gratification of any and all desires is taken as an ethicalgoal (such as “the greatest happiness of the greatest number”)—men have nochoice but to hate, fear and fight one another, because their desires and theirinterests will necessarily clash. If “desire” is the ethical standard, then oneman’s desire to produce and another man’s desire to rob him have equal ethicalvalidity; one man’s desire to be free and another man’s desire to enslave himhave equal ethical validity; one man’s desire to be loved and admired for hisvirtues and another man’s desire for undeserved love and unearned admirationhave equal ethical validity. And if the frustration of any desire constitutes asacrifice, then a man who owns an automobile and is robbed of it, is beingsacrificed, but so is the man who wants or “aspires to” an automobile which theowner refuses to give him—and these two “sacrifices” have equal ethical status.If so, then man’s only choice is to rob or be robbed, to destroy or bedestroyed, to sacrifice others to any desire of his own or to sacrifice himselfto any desire of others; then man’s only ethical alternative is to be a sadistor a masochist.The moral cannibalism of all hedonist and altruist doctrines lies in the premisethat the happiness of one man necessitates the injury of another.Today, most people hold this premise as an absolute not to be questioned. Andwhen one speaks of man’s right to exist for his own sake, for his own rationalself-interest, most people assume automatically that this means his right tosacrifice others. Such an assumption is a confession of their own belief that toinjure, enslave, rob or murder others is in man’s self-interest—which he mustselflessly renounce. The idea that man’s self-interest can be served only by anon-sacrificial relationship with others has never occurred to thosehumanitarian apostles of unselfishness, who proclaim their desire to achieve thebrotherhood of men. And it will not occur to them, or to anyone, so long as theconcept “rational” is omitted from the context of “values,” “desires,”“self-interest” and ethics.The Objectivist ethics proudly advocates and upholds rational selfishness—whichmeans: the values required for man’s survival qua man—which means: the valuesrequired for human survival—not the values produced by the desires, theemotions, the “aspirations,” the feelings, the whims or the needs of irrationalbrutes, who have never outgrown the primordial practice of human sacrifices,have never discovered an industrial society and can conceive of no self-interestbut that of grabbing the loot of the moment.The Objectivist ethics holds that human good does not require human sacrificesand cannot be achieved by the sacrifice of anyone to anyone. It holds that therational interests of men do not clash—that there is no conflict of interestsamong men who do not desire the unearned, who do not make sacrifices nor acceptthem, who deal with one another as traders, giving value for value.The principle of trade is the only rational ethical principle for all humanrelationships, personal and social, private and public, spiritual and material.It is the principle of justice.A trader is a man who earns what he gets and does not give or take theundeserved. He does not treat men as masters or slaves, but as independentequals. He deals with men by means of a free, voluntary, unforced, uncoercedexchange—an exchange which benefits both parties by their own independentjudgment. A trader does not expect to be paid for his defaults, only for hisachievements. He does not switch to others the burden of his failures, and hedoes not mortgage his life into bondage to the failures of others.In spiritual issues—(by “spiritual” I mean: “pertaining to man’sconsciousness”)—the currency or medium of exchange is different, but theprinciple is the same. Love, friendship, respect, admiration are the emotionalresponse of one man to the virtues of another, the spiritual payment given inexchange for the personal, selfish pleasure which one man derives from thevirtues of another man’s character. Only a brute or an altruist would claim thatthe appreciation of another person’s virtues is an act of selflessness, that asfar as one’s own selfish interest and pleasure are concerned, it makes nodifference whether one deals with a genius or a fool, whether one meets a heroor a thug, whether one marries an ideal woman or a slut. In spiritual issues, atrader is a man who does not seek to be loved for his weaknesses or flaws, onlyfor his virtues, and who does not grant his love to the weaknesses or the flawsof others, only to their virtues.To love is to value. Only a rationally selfish man, a man of self-esteem, iscapable of love—because he is the only man capable of holding firm, consistent,uncompromising, unbetrayed values. The man who does not value himself, cannotvalue anything or anyone.It is only on the basis of rational selfishness—on the basis of justice—that mencan be fit to live together in a free, peaceful, prosperous, benevolent,rational society.Can man derive any personal benefit from living in a human society? Yes—if it isa human society. The two great values to be gained from social existence are:knowledge and trade. Man is the only species that can transmit and expand hisstore of knowledge from generation to generation; the knowledge potentiallyavailable to man is greater than any one man could begin to acquire in his ownlifespan; every man gains an incalculable benefit from the knowledge discoveredby others. The second great benefit is the division of labor: it enables a manto devote his effort to a particular field of work and to trade with others whospecialize in other fields. This form of cooperation allows all men who takepart in it to achieve a greater knowledge, skill and productive return on theireffort than they could achieve if each had to produce everything he needs, on adesert island or on a self-sustaining farm.But these very benefits indicate, delimit and define what kind of men can be ofvalue to one another and in what kind of society: only rational, productive,independent men in a rational, productive, free society. Parasites, moochers,looters, brutes and thugs can be of no value to a human being—nor can he gainany benefit from living in a society geared to their needs, demands andprotection, a society that treats him as a sacrificial animal and penalizes himfor his virtues in order to reward them for their vices, which means: a societybased on the ethics of altruism. No society can be of value to man’s life if theprice is the surrender of his right to his life.The basic political principle of the Objectivist ethics is: no man may initiatethe use of physical force against others. No man—or group or society orgovernment—has the right to assume the role of a criminal and initiate the useof physical compulsion against any man. Men have the right to use physical forceonly in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use. The ethicalprinciple involved is simple and clear-cut: it is the difference between murderand self-defense. A holdup man seeks to gain a value, wealth, by killing hisvictim; the victim does not grow richer by killing a holdup man. The principleis: no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force.The only proper, moral purpose of a government is to protect man’s rights, whichmeans: to protect him from physical violence—to protect his right to his ownlife, to his own liberty, to his own property and to the pursuit of his ownhappiness. Without property rights, no other rights are possible.I will not attempt, in a brief lecture, to discuss the political theory ofObjectivism. Those who are interested will find it presented in full detail inAtlas Shrugged. I will say only that every political system is based on andderived from a theory of ethics—and that the Objectivist ethics is the moralbase needed by that politico-economic system which, today, is being destroyedall over the world, destroyed precisely for lack of a moral, philosophicaldefense and validation: the original American system, Capitalism. If itperishes, it will perish by default, undiscovered and unidentified: no othersubject has ever been hidden by so many distortions, misconceptions andmisrepresentations. Today, few people know what capitalism is, how it works andwhat was its actual history.When I say “capitalism,” I mean a full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulatedlaissez-faire capitalism—with a separation of state and economics, in the sameway and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church. A puresystem of capitalism has never yet existed, not even in America; various degreesof government control had been undercutting and distorting it from the start.Capitalism is not the system of the past; it is the system of the future—ifmankind is to have a future.For those who are interested in the history and the psychological causes of thephilosophers’ treason against capitalism, I will mention that I discuss them inthe title essay of my book For the New Intellectual. 3[rand_9781101137222_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-3]The present discussion has to be confined to the subject of ethics. I havepresented the barest essentials of my system, but they are sufficient toindicate in what manner the Objectivist ethics is the morality of life—asagainst the three major schools of ethical theory, the mystic, the social, thesubjective, which have brought the world to its present state and whichrepresent the morality of death.These three schools differ only in their method of approach, not in theircontent. In content, they are merely variants of altruism, the ethical theorywhich regards man as a sacrificial animal, which holds that man has no right toexist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification of hisexistence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value.The differences occur only over the question of who is to be sacrificed to whom.Altruism holds death as its ultimate goal and standard of value—and it islogical that renunciation, resignation, self-denial, and every other form ofsuffering, including self-destruction, are the virtues it advocates. And,logically, these are the only things that the practitioners of altruism haveachieved and are achieving now.Observe that these three schools of ethical theory are anti-life, not merely incontent, but also in their method of approach.The mystic theory of ethics is explicitly based on the premise that the standardof value of man’s ethics is set beyond the grave, by the laws or requirements ofanother, supernatural dimension, that ethics is impossible for man to practice,that it is unsuited for and opposed to man’s life on earth, and that man musttake the blame for it and suffer through the whole of his earthly existence, toatone for the guilt of being unable to practice the impracticable. The Dark Agesand the Middle Ages are the existential monument to this theory of ethics.The social theory of ethics substitutes “society” for God—and although it claimsthat its chief concern is life on earth, it is not the life of man, not the lifeof an individual, but the life of a disembodied entity, the collective, which,in relation to every individual, consists of everybody except himself. As far asthe individual is concerned, his ethical duty is to be the selfless, voiceless,rightless slave of any need, claim or demand asserted by others. The motto “dogeat dog”—which is not applicable to capitalism nor to dogs—is applicable to thesocial theory of ethics. The existential monuments to this theory are NaziGermany and Soviet Russia.The subjectivist theory of ethics is, strictly speaking, not a theory, but anegation of ethics. And more: it is a negation of reality, a negation not merelyof man’s existence, but of all existence. Only the concept of a fluid, plastic,indeterminate, Heraclitean universe could permit anyone to think or to preachthat man needs no objective principles of action—that reality gives him a blankcheck on values—that anything he cares to pick as the good or the evil, willdo—that a man’s whim is a valid moral standard, and that the only question ishow to get away with it. The existential monument to this theory is the presentstate of our culture.It is not men’s immorality that is responsible for the collapse now threateningto destroy the civilized world, but the kind of moralities men have been askedto practice. The responsibility belongs to the philosophers of altruism. Theyhave no cause to be shocked by the spectacle of their own success, and no rightto damn human nature: men have obeyed them and have brought their moral idealsinto full reality.It is philosophy that sets men’s goals and determines their course; it is onlyphilosophy that can save them now. Today, the world is facing a choice: ifcivilization is to survive, it is the altruist morality that men have to reject.I will close with the words of John Galt, which I address, as he did, to all themoralists of altruism, past or present:“You have been using fear as your weapon and have been bringing death to man ashis punishment for rejecting your morality. We offer him life as his reward foraccepting ours.”"},{"pageContent":"2.Mental Health versus Mysticism and Self-Sacrificeby Nathaniel BrandenThe standard of mental health—of biologically appropriate mental functioning—isthe same as that of physical health: man’s survival and well-being. A mind ishealthy to the extent that its method of functioning is such as to provide manwith the control over reality that the support and furtherance of his liferequire.The hallmark of this control is self-esteem. Self-esteem is the consequence,expression and reward of a mind fully committed to reason. Reason, the facultythat identifies and integrates the material provided by the senses, is man’sbasic tool of survival. Commitment to reason is commitment to the maintenance ofa full intellectual focus, to the constant expansion of one’s understanding andknowledge, to the principle that one’s actions must be consistent with one’sconvictions, that one must never attempt to fake reality or place anyconsideration above reality, that one must never permit oneselfcontradictions—that one must never attempt to subvert or sabotage the properfunction of consciousness.The proper function of consciousness is: perception, cognition, and the controlof action.An unobstructed consciousness, an integrated consciousness, a thinkingconsciousness, is a healthy consciousness. A blocked consciousness, an evadingconsciousness, a consciousness torn by conflict and divided against itself, aconsciousness disintegrated by fear or immobilized by depression, aconsciousness dissociated from reality, is an unhealthy consciousness. (For afuller discussion of this issue, see the chapter entitled “Objectivism andPsychology” in my book Who Is Ayn Rand?)In order to deal with reality successfully—to pursue and achieve the valueswhich his life requires—man needs self-esteem: he needs to be confident of hisefficacy and worth.Anxiety and guilt, the antipodes of self-esteem and the insignia of mentalillness, are the disintegrators of thought, the distorters of values and theparalyzers of action.When a man of self-esteem chooses his values and sets his goals, when heprojects the long-range purposes that will unify and guide his actions—it islike a bridge thrown to the future, across which his life will pass, a bridgesupported by the conviction that his mind is competent to think, to judge, tovalue, and that he is worthy of enjoying values.This sense of control over reality is not the result of special skills, abilityor knowledge. It is not dependent on particular successes or failures. Itreflects one’s fundamental relationship to reality, one’s conviction offundamental efficacy and worthiness. It reflects the certainty that, in essenceand in principle, one is right for reality. Self-esteem is a metaphysicalestimate.It is this psychological state that traditional morality makes impossible, tothe extent that a man accepts it.Neither mysticism nor the creed of self-sacrifice is compatible with mentalhealth or self-esteem. These doctrines are destructive existentially andpsychologically.(1) The maintenance of his life and the achievement of self-esteem require ofman the fullest exercise of his reason—but morality, men are taught, rests onand requires faith.Faith is the commitment of one’s consciousness to beliefs for which one has nosensory evidence or rational proof.When a man rejects reason as his standard of judgment, only one alternativestandard remains to him: his feelings. A mystic is a man who treats his feelingsas tools of cognition. Faith is the equation of feeling with knowledge.To practice the “virtue” of faith, one must be willing to suspend one’s sightand one’s judgment; one must be willing to live with the unintelligible, withthat which cannot be conceptualized or integrated into the rest of one’sknowledge, and to induce a trancelike illusion of understanding. One must bewilling to repress one’s critical faculty and hold it as one’s guilt; one mustbe willing to drown any questions that rise in protest—to strangle any trust ofreason convulsively seeking to assert its proper function as the protector ofone’s life and cognitive integrity.Remember that all of man’s knowledge and all his concepts have a hierarchicalstructure. The foundation and starting point of man’s thinking are his sensoryperceptions; on this base, man forms his first concepts, then goes on buildingthe edifice of his knowledge by identifying and integrating new concepts on awider and wider scale. If man’s thinking is to be valid, this process must beguided by logic, “the art of noncontradictory identification”—and any newconcept man forms must be integrated without contradiction into the hierarchicalstructure of his knowledge. To introduce into one’s consciousness any idea thatcannot be so integrated, an idea not derived from reality, not validated by aprocess of reason, not subject to rational examination or judgment—and worse: anidea that clashes with the rest of one’s concepts and understanding ofreality—is to sabotage the integrative function of consciousness, to undercutthe rest of one’s convictions and kill one’s capacity to be certain of anything.This is the meaning of John Galt’s statement in Atlas Shrugged that “the allegedshortcut to knowledge, which is faith, is only a short circuit destroying themind.”There is no greater self-delusion than to imagine that one can render untoreason that which is reason’s and unto faith that which is faith’s. Faith cannotbe circumscribed or delimited; to surrender one’s consciousness by an inch, isto surrender one’s consciousness in total. Either reason is an absolute to amind or it is not—and if it is not, there is no place to draw the line, noprinciple by which to draw it, no barrier faith cannot cross, no part of one’slife faith cannot invade: one remains rational until and unless one’s feelingsdecree otherwise.Faith is a malignancy that no system can tolerate with impunity; and the man whosuccumbs to it, will call on it in precisely those issues where he needs hisreason most. When one turns from reason to faith, when one rejects theabsolutism of reality, one undercuts the absolutism of one’s consciousness—andone’s mind becomes an organ one cannot trust any longer. It becomes what themystics claim it to be: a tool of distortion.(2) Man’s need of self-esteem entails the need for a sense of control overreality—but no control is possible in a universe which, by one’s own concession,contains the supernatural, the miraculous and the causeless, a universe in whichone is at the mercy of ghosts and demons, in which one must deal, not with theunknown, but with the unknowable; no control is possible if man proposes, but aghost disposes; no control is possible if the universe is a haunted house.(3) His life and self-esteem require that the object and concern of man’sconsciousness be reality and this earth—but morality, men are taught, consistsof scorning this earth and the world available to sensory perception, and ofcontemplating, instead, a “different” and “higher” reality, a realm inaccessibleto reason and incommunicable in language, but attainable by revelation, byspecial dialectical processes, by that superior state of intellectual lucidityknown to Zen-Buddhists as “No-Mind,” or by death.There is only one reality—the reality knowable to reason. And if man does notchoose to perceive it, there is nothing else for him to perceive; if it is notof this world that he is conscious, then he is not conscious at all.The sole result of the mystic projection of “another” reality, is that itincapacitates man psychologically for this one. It was not by contemplating thetranscendental, the ineffable, the undefinable—it was not by contemplating thenonexistent—that man lifted himself from the cave and transformed the materialworld to make a human existence possible on earth.If it is a virtue to renounce one’s mind, but a sin to use it; if it is a virtueto approximate the mental state of a schizophrenic, but a sin to be inintellectual focus; if it is a virtue to denounce this earth, but a sin to makeit livable; if it is a virtue to mortify the flesh, but a sin to work and act;if it is a virtue to despise life, but a sin to sustain and enjoy it—then noself-esteem or control or efficacy are possible to man, nothing is possible tohim but the guilt and terror of a wretch caught in a nightmare universe, auniverse created by some metaphysical sadist who has cast man into a maze wherethe door marked “virtue” leads to self-destruction and the door marked“efficacy” leads to self-damnation.(4) His life and self-esteem require that man take pride in his power to think,pride in his power to live—but morality, men are taught, holds pride, andspecifically intellectual pride, as the gravest of sins. Virtue begins, men aretaught, with humility: with the recognition of the helplessness, the smallness,the impotence of one’s mind.Is man omniscient?—demand the mystics. Is he infallible? Then how dare hechallenge the word of God, or of God’s representatives, and set himself up asthe judge of—anything?Intellectual pride is not—as the mystics preposterously imply it to be—apretense at omniscience or infallibility. On the contrary, precisely because manmust struggle for knowledge, precisely because the pursuit of knowledge requiresan effort, the men who assume this responsibility properly feel pride.Sometimes, colloquially, pride is taken to mean a pretense at accomplishmentsone has not in fact achieved. But the braggart, the boaster, the man who affectsvirtues he does not possess, is not proud; he has merely chosen the mosthumiliating way to reveal his humility.Pride is one’s response to one’s power to achieve values, the pleasure one takesin one’s own efficacy. And it is this that mystics hold as evil.But if doubt, not confidence, is man’s proper moral state; if self-distrust, notself-reliance, is the proof of his virtue; if fear, not self-esteem, is the markof perfection; if guilt, not pride, is his goal—then mental illness is a moralideal, the neurotics and psychotics are the highest exponents of morality, andthe thinkers, the achievers, are the sinners, those who are too corrupt and tooarrogant to seek virtue and psychological well-being through the belief thatthey are unfit to exist.Humility is, of necessity, the basic virtue of a mystical morality; it is theonly virtue possible to men who have renounced the mind.Pride has to be earned; it is the reward of effort and achievement; but to gainthe virtue of humility, one has only to abstain from thinking—nothing else isdemanded—and one will feel humble quickly enough.(5) His life and self-esteem require of man loyalty to his values, loyalty tohis mind and its judgments, loyalty to his life—but the essence of morality, menare taught, consists of self-sacrifice: the sacrifice of one’s mind to somehigher authority, and the sacrifice of one’s values to whoever may claim torequire it.It is not necessary, in this context, to analyze the almost countless evils,entailed by the precept of self-sacrifice. Its irrationality and destructivenesshave been thoroughly exposed in Atlas Shrugged. But there are two aspects of theissue that are especially pertinent to the subject of mental health.The first is the fact that self-sacrifice means—and can onlymean—mind-sacrifice.A sacrifice, it is necessary to remember, means the surrender of a higher valuein favor of a lower value or of a nonvalue. If one gives up that which one doesnot value in order to obtain that which one does value—or if one gives up alesser value in order to obtain a greater one—this is not a sacrifice, but again.Remember further that all of a man’s values exist in a hierarchy; he values somethings more than others; and, to the extent that he is rational, thehierarchical order of his values is rational: that is, he values things inproportion to their importance in serving his life and well-being. That which isinimical to his life and well-being, that which is inimical to his nature andneeds as a living being, he disvalues.Conversely, one of the characteristics of mental illness is a distorted valuestructure; the neurotic does not value things according to their objectivemerit, in relation to his nature and needs; he frequently values the very thingsthat will lead him to self-destruction. Judged by objective standards, he isengaged in a chronic process of self-sacrifice.But if sacrifice is a virtue, it is not the neurotic but the rational man whomust be “cured.” He must learn to do violence to his own rational judgment—toreverse the order of his value hierarchy—to surrender that which his mind haschosen as the good—to turn against and invalidate his own consciousness.Do mystics declare that all they demand of man is that he sacrifice hishappiness? To sacrifice one’s happiness is to sacrifice one’s desires; tosacrifice one’s desires is to sacrifice one’s values; to sacrifice one’s valuesis to sacrifice one’s judgment; to sacrifice one’s judgment is to sacrificeone’s mind—and it is nothing less than this that the creed of self-sacrificeaims at and demands.The root of selfishness is man’s right—and need—to act on his own judgment. Ifhis judgment is to be an object of sacrifice—what sort of efficacy, control,freedom from conflict, or serenity of spirit will be possible to man?The second aspect that is pertinent here, involves not only the creed ofself-sacrifice but all the foregoing tenents of traditional morality.An irrational morality, a morality set in opposition to man’s nature, to thefacts of reality and to the requirements of man’s survival, necessarily forcesmen to accept the belief that there is an inevitable clash between the moral andthe practical—that they must choose either to be virtuous or to be happy, to beidealistic or to be successful, but they cannot be both. This view establishes adisastrous conflict on the deepest level of man’s being, a lethal dichotomy thattears man apart: it forces him to choose between making himself able to live andmaking himself worthy of living. Yet self-esteem and mental health require thathe achieve both.If man holds life on earth as the good, if he judges his values by the standardof that which is proper to the existence of a rational being, then there is noclash between the requirements of survival and of morality—no clash betweenmaking himself able to live and making himself worthy of living; he achieves thesecond by achieving the first. But there is a clash, if man holds therenunciation of this earth as the good, the renunciation of life, of mind, ofhappiness, of self. Under an anti-life morality, man makes himself worthy ofliving to the extent that he makes himself unable to live—and to the extent thathe makes himself able to live, he makes himself unworthy of living.The answer given by many defenders of traditional morality is: “Oh, but peopledon’t have to go to extremes!”—meaning: “We don’t expect people to be fullymoral. We expect them to smuggle some self-interest into their lives. Werecognize that people have to live, after all.”The defense, then, of this code of morality is that few people will be suicidalenough to attempt to practice it consistently. Hypocrisy is to be man’sprotector against his professed moral convictions. What does that do to hisself-esteem?And what of the victims who are insufficiently hypocritical?What of the child who withdraws in terror into an autistic universe because hecannot cope with the ravings of parents who tell him that he is guilty bynature, that his body is evil, that thinking is sinful, that question-asking isblasphemous, that doubting is depravity, and that he must obey the orders of asupernatural ghost because, if he doesn’t, he will burn forever in hell?Or the daughter who collapses in guilt over the sin of not wanting to devote herlife to caring for the ailing father who has given her cause to feel onlyhatred?Or the adolescent who flees into homosexuality because he has been taught thatsex is evil and that women are to be worshiped, but not desired?Or the businessman who suffers an anxiety attack because, after years of beingurged to be thrifty and industrious, he has finally committed the sin ofsucceeding, and is now told that it shall be easier for the camel to passthrough the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven?Or the neurotic who, in hopeless despair, gives up the attempt to solve hisproblems because he has always heard it preached that this earth is a realm ofmisery, futility and doom, where no happiness or fulfillment is possible to man?If the advocates of these doctrines bear a grave moral responsibility, there isa group who, perhaps, bears a graver responsibility still: the psychologists andpsychiatrists who see the human wreckage of these doctrines, but who remainsilent and do not protest—who declare that philosophical and moral issues do notconcern them, that science cannot pronounce value judgments—who shrug off theirprofessional obligations with the assertion that a rational code of morality isimpossible, and, by their silence, lend their sanction to spiritual murder. (March 1963)"},{"pageContent":"3.The Ethics of Emergenciesby Ayn RandThe psychological results of altruism may be observed in the fact that a greatmany people approach the subject of ethics by asking such questions as: “Shouldone risk one’s life to help a man who is: a) drowning, b) trapped in a fire, c)stepping in front of a speeding truck, d) hanging by his fingernails over anabyss?”Consider the implications of that approach. If a man accepts the ethics ofaltruism, he suffers the following consequences (in proportion to the degree ofhis acceptance):1. Lack of setf-esteem—since his first concern in the realm of values is not howto live his life, but how to sacrifice it.2. Lack of respect for others—since he regards mankind as a herd of doomedbeggars crying for someone’s help.3. A nightmare view of existence—since he believes that men are trapped in a“malevolent universe” where disasters are the constant and primary concern oftheir lives.4. And, in fact, a lethargic indifference to ethics, a hopelessly cynicalamorality—since his questions involve situations which he is not likely ever toencounter, which bear no relation to the actual problems of his own life andthus leave him to live without any moral principles whatever.By elevating the issue of helping others into the central and primary issue ofethics, altruism has destroyed the concept of any authentic benevolence or goodwill among men. It has indoctrinated men with the idea that to value anotherhuman being is an act of selflessness, thus implying that a man can have nopersonal interest in others—that to value another means to sacrificeoneself—that any love, respect or admiration a man may feel for others is notand cannot be a source of his own enjoyment, but is a threat to his existence, asacrificial blank check signed over to his loved ones.The men who accept that dichotomy but choose its other side, the ultimateproducts of altruism’s dehumanizing influence, are those psychopaths who do notchallenge altruism’s basic premise, but proclaim their rebellion againstself-sacrifice by announcing that they are totally indifferent to anythingliving and would not lift a finger to help a man or a dog left mangled by ahit-and-run driver (who is usually one of their own kind).Most men do not accept or practice either side of altruism’s viciously falsedichotomy, but its result is a total intellectual chaos on the issue of properhuman relationships and on such questions as the nature, purpose or extent ofthe help one may give to others. Today, a great many well-meaning, reasonablemen do not know how to identify or conceptualize the moral principles thatmotivate their love, affection or good will, and can find no guidance in thefield of ethics, which is dominated by the stale platitudes of altruism.On the question of why man is not a sacrificial animal and why help to others isnot his moral duty, I refer you to Atlas Shrugged. This present discussion isconcerned with the principles by which one identifies and evaluates theinstances involving a man’s nonsacrificial help to others.“Sacrifice” is the surrender of a greater value for the sake of a lesser one orof a nonvalue. Thus, altruism gauges a man’s virtue by the degree to which hesurrenders, renounces or betrays his values (since help to a stranger or anenemy is regarded as more virtuous, less “selfish,” than help to those oneloves). The rational principle of conduct is the exact opposite: always act inaccordance with the hierarchy of your values, and never sacrifice a greatervalue to a lesser one.This applies to all choices, including one’s actions toward other men. Itrequires that one possess a defined hierarchy of rational values (values chosenand validated by a rational standard). Without such a hierarchy, neitherrational conduct nor considered value judgments nor moral choices are possible.Love and friendship are profoundly personal, selfish values: love is anexpression and assertion of self-esteem, a response to one’s own values in theperson of another. One gains a profoundly personal, selfish joy from the mereexistence of the person one loves. It is one’s own personal, selfish happinessthat one seeks, earns and derives from love.A “selfless,” “disinterested” love is a contradiction in terms: it means thatone is indifferent to that which one values.Concern for the welfare of those one loves is a rational part of one’s selfishinterests. If a man who is passionately in love with his wife spends a fortuneto cure her of a dangerous illness, it would be absurd to claim that he does itas a “sacrifice” for her sake, not his own, and that it makes no difference tohim, personally and selfishly, whether she lives or dies.Any action that a man undertakes for the benefit of those he loves is not asacrifice if, in the hierarchy of his values, in the total context of thechoices open to him, it achieves that which is of greatest personal (andrational) importance to him. In the above example, his wife’s survival is ofgreater value to the husband than anything else that his money could buy, it isof greatest importance to his own happiness and, therefore, his action is not asacrifice.But suppose he let her die in order to spend his money on saving the lives often other women, none of whom meant anything to him—as the ethics of altruismwould require. That would be a sacrifice. Here the difference betweenObjectivism and altruism can be seen most clearly: if sacrifice is the moralprinciple of action, then that husband should sacrifice his wife for the sake often other women. What distinguishes the wife from the ten others? Nothing buther value to the husband who has to make the choice-nothing but the fact thathis happiness requires her survival.The Objectivist ethics would tell him: your highest moral purpose is theachievement of your own happiness, your money is yours, use it to save yourwife, that is your moral right and your rational, moral choice.Consider the soul of the altruistic moralist who would be prepared to tell thathusband the opposite. (And then ask yourself whether altruism is motivated bybenevolence.)The proper method of judging when or whether one should help another person isby reference to one’s own rational self-interest and one’s own hierarchy ofvalues: the time, money or effort one gives or the risk one takes should beproportionate to the value of the person in relation to one’s own happiness.To illustrate this on the altruists’ favorite example: the issue of saving adrowning person. If the person to be saved is a stranger, it is morally properto save him only when the danger to one’s own life is minimal; when the dangeris great, it would be immoral to attempt it: only a lack of self-esteem couldpermit one to value one’s life no higher than that of any random stranger. (And,conversely, if one is drowning, one cannot expect a stranger to risk his lifefor one’s sake, remembering that one’s life cannot be as valuable to him as hisown.)If the person to be saved is not a stranger, then the risk one should be willingto take is greater in proportion to the greatness of that person’s value tooneself. If it is the man or woman one loves, then one can be willing to giveone’s own life to save him or her—for the selfish reason that life without theloved person could be unbearable.Conversely, if a man is able to swim and to save his drowning wife, but becomespanicky, gives in to an unjustified, irrational fear and lets her drown, thenspends his life in loneliness and misery—one would not call him “selfish”; onewould condemn him morally for his treason to himself and to his own values, thatis: his failure to fight for the preservation of a value crucial to his ownhappiness. Remember that values are that which one acts to gain and/or keep, andthat one’s own happiness has to be achieved by one’s own effort. Since one’s ownhappiness is the moral purpose of one’s life, the man who fails to achieve itbecause of his own default, because of his failure to fight for it, is morallyguilty.The virtue involved in helping those one loves is not “selflessness” or“sacrifice,” but integrity. Integrity is loyalty to one’s convictions andvalues; it is the policy of acting in accordance with one’s values, ofexpressing, upholding and translating them into practical reality. If a manprofesses to love a woman, yet his actions are indifferent, inimical or damagingto her, it is his lack of integrity that makes him immoral.The same principle applies to relationships among friends. If one’s friend is introuble, one should act to help him by whatever nonsacrificial means areappropriate. For instance, if one’s friend is starving, it is not a sacrifice,but an act of integrity to give him money for food rather than buy someinsignificant gadget for oneself, because his welfare is important in the scaleof one’s personal values. If the gadget means more than the friend’s suffering,one had no business pretending to be his friend.The practical implementation of friendship, affection and love consists ofincorporating the welfare (the rational welfare) of the person involved intoone’s own hierarchy of values, then acting accordingly.But this is a reward which men have to earn by means of their virtues and whichone cannot grant to mere acquaintances or strangers.What, then, should one properly grant to strangers? The generalized respect andgood will which one should grant to a human being in the name of the potentialvalue he represents—until and unless he forfeits it.A rational man does not forget that life is the source of all values and, assuch, a common bond among living beings (as against inanimate matter), thatother men are potentially able to achieve the same virtues as his own and thusbe of enormous value to him. This does not mean that he regards human lives asinterchangeable with his own. He recognizes the fact that his own life is thesource, not only of all his values, but of his capacity to value. Therefore, thevalue he grants to others is only a consequence, an extension, a secondaryprojection of the primary value which is himself.“The respect and good will that men of self-esteem feel toward other humanbeings is profoundly egoistic; they feel, in effect: ‘Other men are of valuebecause they are of the same species as myself.’ In revering living entities,they are revering their own life. This is the psychological base of any emotionof sympathy and any feeling of species solidarity.’ ”4[rand_9781101137222_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-4]Since men are born tabula rasa, both cognitively and morally, a rational manregards strangers as innocent until proved guilty, and grants them that initialgood will in the name of their human potential. After that, he judges themaccording to the moral character they have actualized. If he finds them guiltyof major evils, his good will is replaced by contempt and moral condemnation.(If one values human life, one cannot value its destroyers.) If he finds them tobe virtuous, he grants them personal, individual value and appreciation, inproportion to their virtues.It is on the ground of that generalized good will and respect for the value ofhuman life that one helps strangers in an emergency—and only in an emergency.It is important to differentiate between the rules of conduct in an emergencysituation and the rules of conduct in the normal conditions of human existence.This does not mean a double standard of morality: the standard and the basicprinciples remain the same, but their application to either case requiresprecise definitions.An emergency is an unchosen, unexpected event, limited in time, that createsconditions under which human survival is impossible—such as a flood, anearthquake, a fire, a shipwreck. In an emergency situation, men’s primary goalis to combat the disaster, escape the danger and restore normal conditions (toreach dry land, to put out the fire, etc.).By “normal” conditions I mean metaphysically normal, normal in the nature ofthings, and appropriate to human existence. Men can live on land, but not inwater or in a raging fire. Since men are not omnipotent, it is metaphysicallypossible for unforeseeable disasters to strike them, in which case their onlytask is to return to those conditions under which their lives can continue. Byits nature, an emergency situation is temporary; if it were to last, men wouldperish.It is only in emergency situations that one should volunteer to help strangers,if it is in one’s power. For instance, a man who values human life and is caughtin a shipwreck, should help to save his fellow passengers (though not at theexpense of his own life). But this does not mean that after they all reachshore, he should devote his efforts to saving his fellow passengers frompoverty, ignorance, neurosis or whatever other troubles they might have. Nordoes it mean that he should spend his life sailing the seven seas in search ofshipwreck victims to save.Or to take an example that can occur in everyday life: suppose one hears thatthe man next door is ill and penniless. Illness and poverty are not metaphysicalemergencies, they are part of the normal risks of existence; but since the manis temporarily helpless, one may bring him food and medicine, if one can affordit (as an act of good will, not of duty) or one may raise a fund among theneighbors to help him out. But this does not mean that one must support him fromthen on, nor that one must spend one’s life looking for starving men to help.In the normal conditions of existence, man has to choose his goals, project themin time, pursue them and achieve them by his own effort. He cannot do it if hisgoals are at the mercy of and must be sacrificed to any misfortune happening toothers. He cannot live his life by the guidance of rules applicable only toconditions under which human survival is impossible.The principle that one should help men in an emergency cannot be extended toregard all human suffering as an emergency and to turn the misfortune of someinto a first mortgage on the lives of others.Poverty, ignorance, illness and other problems of that kind are not metaphysicalemergencies. By the metaphysical nature of man and of existence, man has tomaintain his life by his own effort; the values he needs—such as wealth orknowledge—are not given to him automatically, as a gift of nature, but have tobe discovered and achieved by his own thinking and work. One’s sole obligationtoward others, in this respect, is to maintain a social system that leaves menfree to achieve, to gain and to keep their values.Every code of ethics is based on and derived from a metaphysics, that is: from atheory about the fundamental nature of the universe in which man lives and acts.The altruist ethics is based on a “malevolent universe” metaphysics, on thetheory that man, by his very nature, is helpless and doomed—that success,happiness, achievement are impossible to him—that emergencies, disasters,catastrophes are the norm of his life and that his primary goal is to combatthem.As the simplest empirical refutation of that metaphysics—as evidence of the factthat the material universe is not inimical to man and that catastrophes are theexception, not the rule of his existence—observe the fortunes made by insurancecompanies.Observe also that the advocates of altruism are unable to base their ethics onany facts of men’s normal existence and that they always offer “lifeboat”situations as examples from which to derive the rules of moral conduct. (“Whatshould you do if you and another man are in a lifeboat that can carry only one?”etc.)The fact is that men do not live in lifeboats—and that a lifeboat is not theplace on which to base one’s metaphysics.The moral purpose of a man’s life is the achievement of his own happiness. Thisdoes not mean that he is indifferent to all men, that human life is of no valueto him and that he has no reason to help others in an emergency. But it doesmean that he does not subordinate his life to the welfare of others, that hedoes not sacrifice himself to their needs, that the relief of their suffering isnot his primary concern, that any help he gives is an exception, not a rule, anact of generosity, not of moral duty, that it is marginal and incidental —asdisasters are marginal and incidental in the course of human existence—and thatvalues, not disasters, are the goal, the first concern and the motive power ofhis life.

Isn’t this an instance of a conflict ofinterests, and isn’t the benefit of one man achieved at the price of thesacrifice of the other?”There are four interrelated considerations which are involved in a rationalman’s view of his interests, but which are ignored or evaded in the abovequestion and in all similar approaches to the issue. I shall designate thesefour as: (a) “Reality,” (b) “Context,” (c) “Responsibility,” (d) “Effort. ”(a) Reality. The term “interests” is a wide abstraction that covers the entirefield of ethics. It includes the issues of: man’s values, his desires, his goalsand their actual achievement in reality. A man’s “interests” depend on the kindof goals he chooses to pursue, his choice of goals depends on his desires, hisdesires depend on his values—and, for a rational man, his values depend on thejudgment of his mind.Desires (or feelings or emotions or wishes or whims) are not tools of cognition;they are not a valid standard of value, nor a valid criterion of man’sinterests. The mere fact that a man desires something does not constitute aproof that the object of his desire is good, nor that its achievement isactually to his interest.To claim that a man’s interests are sacrificed whenever a desire of his isfrustrated—is to hold a subjectivist view of man’s values and interests. Whichmeans: to believe that it is proper, moral and possible for man to achieve hisgoals, regardless of whether they contradict the facts of reality or not. Whichmeans: to hold an irrational or mystical view of existence. Which means: todeserve no further consideration.In choosing his goals (the specific values he seeks to gain and/or keep), arational man is guided by his thinking (by a process of reason)—not by hisfeelings or desires. He does not regard desires as irreducible primaries, as thegiven, which he is destined irresistibly to pursue. He does not regard “becauseI want it” or “because I feel like it” as a sufficient cause and validation ofhis actions. He chooses and/or identifies his desires by a process of reason,and he does not act to achieve a desire until and unless he is able rationallyto validate it in the full context of his knowledge and of his other values andgoals. He does not act until he is able to say: “I want it because it is right.”The Law of Identity (A is A) is a rational man’s paramount consideration in theprocess of determining his interests. He knows that the contradictory is theimpossible, that a contradiction cannot be achieved in reality and that theattempt to achieve it can lead only to disaster and destruction. Therefore, hedoes not permit himself to hold contradictory values, to pursue contradictorygoals, or to imagine that the pursuit of a contradiction can ever be to hisinterest.Only an irrationalist (or mystic or subjectivist—in which category I place allthose who regard faith, feelings or desires as man’s standard of value) existsin a perpetual conflict of “interests.” Not only do his alleged interests clashwith those of other men, but they clash also with one another.No one finds it difficult to dismiss from philosophical consideration theproblem of a man who wails that life entraps him in an irreconcilable conflictbecause he cannot eat his cake and have it, too. That problem does not acquireintellectual validity by being expanded to involve more than cake—whether oneexpands it to the whole universe, as in the doctrines of Existentialism, or onlyto a few random whims and evasions, as in most people’s views of theirinterests.When a person reaches the stage of claiming that man’s interests conflict withreality, the concept “interests” ceases to be meaningful—and his problem ceasesto be philosophical and becomes psychological.(b) Context. Just as a rational man does not hold any conviction out ofcontext—that is: without relating it to the rest of his knowledge and resolvingany possible contradictions—so he does not hold or pursue any desire out ofcontext. And he does not judge what is or is not to his interest out of context,on the range of any given moment.Context-dropping is one of the chief psychological tools of evasion. In regardto one’s desires, there are two major ways of context-dropping: the issues ofrange and of means.A rational man sees his interests in terms of a lifetime and selects his goalsaccordingly. This does not mean that he has to be omniscient, infallible orclairvoyant. It means that he does not live his life short-range and does notdrift like a bum pushed by the spur of the moment. It means that he does notregard any moment as cut off from the context of the rest of his life, and thathe allows no conflicts or contradictions between his short-range and long-rangeinterests. He does not become his own destroyer by pursuing a desire today whichwipes out all his values tomorrow.A rational man does not indulge in wistful longings for ends divorced frommeans. He does not hold a desire without knowing (or learning) and consideringthe means by which it is to be achieved. Since he knows that nature does notprovide man with the automatic satisfaction of his desires, that a man’s goalsor values have to be achieved by his own effort, that the lives and efforts ofother men are not his property and are not there to serve his wishes—a rationalman never holds a desire or pursues a goal which cannot be achieved directly orindirectly by his own effort.It is with a proper understanding of this “indirectly” that the crucial socialissue begins.Living in a society, instead of on a desert island, does not relieve a man ofthe responsibility of supporting his own life. The only difference is that hesupports his life by trading his products or services for the products orservices of others. And, in this process of trade, a rational man does not seekor desire any more or any less than his own effort can earn. What determines hisearnings? The free market, that is: the voluntary choice and judgment of the menwho are willing to trade him their effort in return.When a man trades with others, he is counting—explicitly or implicitly—on theirrationality, that is: on their ability to recognize the objective value of hiswork. (A trade based on any other premise is a con game or a fraud.) Thus, whena rational man pursues a goal in a free society, he does not place himself atthe mercy of whims, the favors or the prejudices of others; he depends onnothing but his own effort: directly, by doing objectively valuablework—indirectly, through the objective evaluation of his work by others.It is in this sense that a rational man never holds a desire or pursues a goalwhich cannot be achieved by his own effort. He trades value for value. He neverseeks or desires the unearned. If he undertakes to achieve a goal that requiresthe cooperation of many people, he never counts on anything but his own abilityto persuade them and their voluntary agreement.Needless to say, a rational man never distorts or corrupts his own standards andjudgment in order to appeal to the irrationality, stupidity or dishonesty ofothers. He knows that such a course is suicidal. He knows that one’s onlypractical chance to achieve any degree of success or anything humanly desirablelies in dealing with those who are rational, whether there are many of them orfew. If, in any given set of circumstances, any victory is possible at all, itis only reason that can win it. And, in a free society, no matter how hard thestruggle might be, it is reason that ultimately wins.Since he never drops the context of the issues he deals with, a rational manaccepts that struggle as to his interest—because he knows that freedom is to hisinterest. He knows that the struggle to achieve his values includes thepossibility of defeat. He knows also that there is no alternative and noautomatic guarantee of success for man’s effort, neither in dealing with naturenor with other men. So he does not judge his interests by any particular defeatnor by the range of any particular moment. He lives and judges long-range. Andhe assumes the full responsibility of knowing what conditions are necessary forthe achievement of his goals.(c) Responsibility. This last is the particular form of intellectualresponsibility that most people evade. That evasion is the major cause of theirfrustrations and defeats.Most people hold their desires without any context whatever, as ends hanging ina foggy vacuum, the fog hiding any concept of means. They rouse themselvesmentally only long enough to utter an “I wish,” and stop there, and wait, as ifthe rest were up to some unknown power.What they evade is the responsibility of judging the social world. They take theworld as the given. “A world I never made” is the deepest essence of theirattitude—and they seek only to adjust themselves uncritically to theincomprehensible requirements of those unknowable others who did make the world,whoever those might be.But humility and presumptuousness are two sides of the same psychological medal.In the willingness to throw oneself blindly on the mercy of others there is theimplicit privilege of making blind demands on one’s masters.There are countless ways in which this sort of “metaphysical humility” revealsitself. For instance, there is the man who wishes to be rich, but never thinksof discovering what means, actions and conditions are required to achievewealth. Who is he to judge? He never made the world—and “nobody gave him abreak.”There is the girl who wishes to be loved, but never thinks of discovering whatlove is, what values it requires, and whether she possesses any virtues to beloved for. Who is she to judge? Love, she feels, is an inexplicable favor—so shemerely longs for it, feeling that somebody has deprived her of her share in thedistribution of favors.There are the parents who suffer deeply and genuinely, because their son (ordaughter) does not love them, and who, simultaneously, ignore, oppose or attemptto destroy everything they know of their son’s convictions, values and goals,never thinking of the connection between these two facts, never making anattempt to understand their son. The world they never made and dare notchallenge, has told them that children love parents automatically.There is the man who wants a job, but never thinks of discovering whatqualifications the job requires or what constitutes doing one’s work well. Whois he to judge? He never made the world. Somebody owes him a living. How?Somehow.A European architect of my acquaintance was talking, one day, of his trip toPuerto Rico. He described—with great indignation at the universe at large—thesqualor of the Puerto Ricans’ living conditions. Then he described what wondersmodem housing could do for them, which he had daydreamed in detail, includingelectric refrigerators and tiled bathrooms. I asked: “Who would pay for it?” Heanswered, in a faintly offended, almost huffy tone of voice: “Oh, that’s not forme to worry about! An architect’s task is only to project what should be done.Let somebody else think about the money.”That is the psychology from which all “social reforms” or “welfare states” or“noble experiments” or the destruction of the world have come.In dropping the responsibility for one’s own interests and life, one drops theresponsibility of ever having to consider the interests and lives of others—ofthose others who are, somehow, to provide the satisfaction of one’s desires.Whoever allows a “somehow” into his view of the means by which his desires areto be achieved, is guilty of that “metaphysical humility” which,psychologically, is the premise of a parasite. As Nathaniel Branden pointed outin a lecture, “somehow” always means “somebody.”(d) Effort. Since a rational man knows that man must achieve his goals by hisown effort, he knows that neither wealth nor jobs nor any human values exist ina given, limited, static quantity, waiting to be divided. He knows that allbenefits have to be produced, that the gain of one man does not represent theloss of another, that a man’s achievement is not earned at the expense of thosewho have not achieved it.Therefore, he never imagines that he has any sort of unearned, unilateral claimon any human being—and he never leaves his interests at the mercy of any oneperson or single, specific concrete. He may need clients, but not any oneparticular customer—he may need a job, but not any one particular job.If he encounters competition, he either meets it or chooses another line ofwork. There is no job so slow that a better, more skillful performance of itwould pass unnoticed and unappreciated; not in a free society. Ask any officemanager.It is only the passive, parasitical representatives of the “humilitymetaphysics” school who regard any competitor as a threat, because the thoughtof earning one’s position by personal merit is not part of their view of life.They regard themselves as interchangeable mediocrities who have nothing to offerand who fight, in a “static” universe, for someone’s causeless favor.A rational man knows that one does not live by means of “luck,” “breaks” orfavors, that there is no such thing as an “only chance” or a single opportunity,and that this is guaranteed precisely by the existence of competition. He doesnot regard any concrete, specific goal or value as irreplaceable. He knows thatonly persons are irreplaceable—only those one loves.He knows also that there are no conflicts of interests among rational men evenin the issue of love. Like any other value, love is not a static quantity to bedivided, but an unlimited response to be earned. The love for one friend is nota threat to the love for another, and neither is the love for the variousmembers of one’s family, assuming they have earned it. The most exclusiveform—romantic love—is not an issue of competition. If two men are in love withthe same woman, what she feels for either of them is not determined by what shefeels for the other and is not taken away from him. If she chooses one of them,the “loser” could not have had what the “winner” has earned.It is only among the irrational, emotion-motivated persons, whose love isdivorced from any standards of value, that chance rivalries, accidentalconflicts and blind choices prevail. But then, whoever wins does not win much.Among the emotion-driven, neither love nor any other emotion has any meaning.Such, in brief essence, are the four major considerations involved in a rationalman’s view of his interests.Now let us return to the question originally asked—about the two men applyingfor the same job—and observe in what manner it ignores or opposes these fourconsiderations.(a) Reality. The mere fact that two men desire the same job does not constituteproof that either of them is entitled to it or deserves it, and that hisinterests are damaged if he does not obtain it.(b) Context. Both men should know that if they desire a job, their goal is madepossible only by the existence of a business concern able to provideemployment—that that business concern requires the availability of more than oneapplicant for any job—that if only one applicant existed, he would not obtainthe job, because the business concern would have to close its doors—and thattheir competition for the job is to their interest, even though one of them willlose in that particular encounter.(c) Responsibility. Neither man has the moral right to declare that he doesn’twant to consider all those things, he just wants a job. He is not entitled toany desire or to any “interest” without knowledge of what is required to makeits fulfillment possible.(d) Effort. Whoever gets the job, has earned it (assuming that the employer’schoice is rational). This benefit is due to his own merit—not to the “sacrifice”of the other man who never had any vested right to that job. The failure to giveto a man what had never belonged to him can hardly be described as “sacrificinghis interests.”All of the above discussion applies only to the relationships among rational menand only to a free society. In a free society, one does not have to deal withthose who are irrational. One is free to avoid them.In a nonfree society, no pursuit of any interests is possible to anyone; nothingis possible but gradual and general destruction. (August 1962)"},{"pageContent":"5.Isn’t Everyone Selfish?by Nathaniel BrandenSome variety of this question is often raised as an objection to those whoadvocate an ethics of rational self-interest. For example, it is sometimesclaimed: “Everyone does what he really wants to do—otherwise, he wouldn’t doit.” Or: “No one ever really sacrifices himself. Since every purposeful actionis motivated by some value or goal that the actor desires, one always actsselfishly, whether one knows it or not.”To untangle the intellectual confusion involved in this viewpoint, let usconsider what facts of reality give rise to such an issue as selfishness versusself-sacrifice, or egoism versus altruism, and what the concept of “selfishness”means and entails.The issue of selfishness versus self-sacrifice arises in an ethical context.Ethics is a code of values to guide man’s choices and actions—the choices andactions that determine the purpose and course of his life. In choosing hisactions and goals, man faces constant alternatives. In order to choose, herequires a standard of value—a purpose which his actions are to serve or atwhich they are to aim. “‘Value’ presupposes an answer to the question: of valueto whom and for what?” (Atlas Shrugged.) What is to be the goal or purpose of aman’s actions? Who is to be the intended beneficiary of his actions? Is he tohold, as his primary moral purpose, the achievement of his own life andhappiness—or should his primary moral purpose be to serve the wishes and needsof others?The clash between egoism and altruism lies in their conflicting answers to thesequestions. Egoism holds that man is an end in himself; altruism holds that manis a means to the ends of others. Egoism holds that, morally, the beneficiary ofan action should be the person who acts; altruism holds that, morally, thebeneficiary of an action should be someone other than the person who acts.To be selfish is to be motivated by concern for one’s self-interest. Thisrequires that one consider what constitutes one’s self-interest and how toachieve it—what values and goals to pursue, what principles and policies toadopt. If a man were not concerned with this question, he could not be saidobjectively to be concerned with or to desire his self-interest; one cannot beconcerned with or desire that of which one has no knowledge.Selfishness entails: (a) a hierarchy of values set by the standard of one’sself-interest, and (b) the refusal to sacrifice a higher value to a lower one orto a nonvalue.A genuinely selfish man knows that only reason can determine what is, in fact,to his self-interest, that to pursue contradictions or attempt to act indefiance of the facts of reality is self-destructive—and self-destruction is notto his self-interest. “To think, is to man’s self-interest; to suspend hisconsciousness, is not. To choose his goals in the full context of his knowledge,his values and his life, is to man’s self-interest; to act on the impulse of themoment, without regard for his long-range context, is not. To exist as aproductive being, is to man’s self-interest; to attempt to exist as a parasite,is not. To seek the life proper to his nature, is to man’s self-interest; toseek to live as an animal, is not.”5 [rand_9781101137222_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-5]Because a genuinely selfish man chooses his goals by the guidance of reason—andbecause the interests of rational men do not clash—other men may often benefitfrom his actions. But the benefit of other men is not his primary purpose orgoal; his own benefit is his primary purpose and the conscious goal directinghis actions.To make this principle fully clear, let us consider an extreme example of anaction which, in fact, is selfish, but which conventionally might be calledself-sacrificial: a man’s willingness to die to save the life of the woman heloves. In what way would such a man be the beneficiary of his action?The answer is given in Atlas Shrugged—in the scene when Galt, knowing he isabout to be arrested, tells Dagny: “If they get the slightest suspicion of whatwe are to each other, they will have you on a torture rack—I mean, physicaltorture—before my eyes, in less than a week. I am not going to wait for that. Atthe first mention of a threat to you, I will kill myself and stop them rightthere.... I don’t have to tell you that if I do it, it won’t be an act ofself-sacrifice. I do not care to live on their terms. I do not care to obey themand I do not care to see you enduring a drawn-out murder. There will be novalues for me to seek after that—and I do not care to exist without values.” Ifa man loves a woman so much that he does not wish to survive her death, if lifecan have nothing more to offer him at that price, then his dying to save her isnot a sacrifice.The same principle applies to a man, caught in a dictatorship, who willinglyrisks death to achieve freedom. To call his act a “self-sacrifice,” one wouldhave to assume that he preferred to live as a slave. The selfishness of a manwho is willing to die, if necessary, fighting for his freedom, lies in the factthat he is unwilling to go on living in a world where he is no longer able toact on his own judgment—that is, a world where human conditions of existence areno longer possible to him.The selfishness or unselfishness of an action is to be determined objectively:it is not determined by the feelings of the person who acts. Just as feelingsare not a tool of cognition, so they are not a criterion in ethics.Obviously, in order to act, one has to be moved by some personal motive; one hasto “want,” in some sense, to perform the action. The issue of an action’sselfishness or unselfishness depends, not on whether or not one wants to performit, but on why one wants to perform it. By what standard was the action chosen?To achieve what goal?If a man proclaimed that he felt he would best benefit others by robbing andmurdering them, men would not be willing to grant that his actions werealtruistic. By the same logic and for the same reasons, if a man pursues acourse of blind self-destruction, his feeling that he has something to gain byit does not establish his actions as selfish.If, motivated solely by a sense of charity, compassion, duty or altruism, aperson renounces a value, desire or goal in favor of the pleasure, wishes orneeds of another person whom he values less than the thing he renounced—that isan act of self-sacrifice. The fact that a person may feel that he “wants” to doit, does not make his action selfish or establish objectively that he is itsbeneficiary.Suppose, for example, that a son chooses the career he wants by rationalstandards, but then renounces it in order to please his mother who prefers thathe pursue a different career, one that will have more prestige in the eyes ofthe neighbors. The boy accedes to his mother’s wish because he has accepted thatsuch is his moral duty: he believes that his duty as a son consists of placinghis mother’s happiness above his own, even if he knows that his mother’s demandis irrational and even if he knows that he is sentencing himself to a life ofmisery and frustration. It is absurd for the advocates of the “everyone isselfish” doctrine to assert that since the boy is motivated by the desire to be“virtuous” or to avoid guilt, no self-sacrifice is involved and his action isreally selfish. What is evaded is the question of why the boy feels and desiresas he does. Emotions and desires are not causeless, irreducible primaries: theyare the product of the premises one has accepted. The boy “wants” to renouncehis career only because he has accepted the ethics of altruism; he believes thatit is immoral to act for his self-interest. That is the principle directing hisactions.Advocates of the “everyone is selfish” doctrine do not deny that, under thepressure of the altruist ethics, men can knowingly act against their ownlong-range happiness. They merely assert that in some higher, undefinable sensesuch men are still acting “selfishly.” A definition of “selfishness” thatincludes or permits the possibility of knowingly acting against one’s long-rangehappiness, is a contradiction in terms.It is only the legacy of mysticism that permits men to imagine that they arestill speaking meaningfully when they declare that one can seek one’s happinessin the renunciation of one’s happiness.The basic fallacy in the “everyone is selfish” argument consists of anextraordinarily crude equivocation. It is a psychological truism—atautology—that all purposeful behavior is motivated. But to equate “motivatedbehavior” with “selfish behavior” is to blank out the distinction between anelementary fact of human psychology and the phenomenon of ethical choice. It isto evade the central problem of ethics, namely: by what is man to be motivated?A genuine selfishness—that is: a genuine concern with discovering what is toone’s self-interest, an acceptance of the responsibility of achieving it, arefusal ever to betray it by acting on the blind whim, mood, impulse or feelingof the moment, an uncompromising loyalty to one’s judgment, convictions andvalues—represents a profound moral achievement. Those who assert that “everyoneis selfish” commonly intend their statement as an expression of cynicism andcontempt. But the truth is that their statement pays mankind a compliment itdoes not deserve. (September 1962)"},{"pageContent":"6.The Psychology of Pleasureby Nathaniel BrandenPleasure, for man, is not a luxury, but a profound psychological need.Pleasure (in the widest sense of the term) is a metaphysical concomitant oflife, the reward and consequence of successful action—just as pain is theinsignia of failure, destruction, death.Through the state of enjoyment, man experiences the value of life, the sensethat life is worth living, worth struggling to maintain. In order to live, manmust act to achieve values. Pleasure or enjoyment is at once an emotionalpayment for successful action and an incentive to continue acting.Further, because of the metaphysical meaning of pleasure to man, the state ofenjoyment gives him a direct experience of his own efficacy, of his competenceto deal with the facts of reality, to achieve his values, to live. Implicitlycontained in the experience of pleasure is the feeling: “I am in control of myexistence”—just as implicitly contained in the experience of pain is thefeeling: “I am helpless.” As pleasure emotionally entails a sense of efficacy,so pain emotionally entails a sense of impotence.Thus, in letting man experience, in his own person, the sense that life is avalue and that he is a value, pleasure serves as the emotional fuel of man’sexistence.Just as the pleasure-pain mechanism of man’s body works as a barometer of healthor injury, so the pleasure-pain mechanism of his consciousness works on the sameprinciple, acting as a barometer of what is for him or against him, what isbeneficial to his life or inimical. But man is a being of volitionalconsciousness, he has no innate ideas, no automatic or infallible knowledge ofwhat his survival depends on. He must choose the values that are to guide hisactions and set his goals. His emotional mechanism will work according to thekind of values he chooses. It is his values that determine what a man feels tobe for him or against him; it is his values that determine what a man seeks forpleasure.If a man makes an error in his choice of values, his emotional mechanism willnot correct him: it has no will of its own. If a man’s values are such that hedesires things which, in fact and in reality, lead to his destruction, hisemotional mechanism will not save him, but will, instead, urge him on towarddestruction: he will have set it in reverse, against himself and against thefacts of reality, against his own life. Man’s emotional mechanism is like anelectronic computer: man has the power to program it, but no power to change itsnature—so that if he sets the wrong programming, he will not be able to escapethe fact that the most self-destructive desires will have, for him, theemotional intensity and urgency of lifesaving actions. He has, of course, thepower to change the programming—but only by changing his values.A man’s basic values reflect his conscious or subconscious view of himself andof existence. They are the expression of (a) the degree and nature of hisself-esteem or lack of it, and (b) the extent to which he regards the universeas open to his understanding and action or closed—i.e., the extent to which heholds a benevolent or malevolent view of existence. Thus, the things which a manseeks for pleasure or enjoyment are profoundly revealing psychologically; theyare the index of his character and soul. (By “soul,” I mean: a man’sconsciousness and his basic motivating values.)There are, broadly, five (interconnected) areas that allow man to experience theenjoyment of life: productive work, human relationships, recreation, art, sex.Productive work is the most fundamental of these: through his work man gains hisbasic sense of control over existence—his sense of efficacy—which is thenecessary foundation of the ability to enjoy any other value. The man whose lifelacks direction or purpose, the man who has no creative goal, necessarily feelshelpless and out of control; the man who feels helpless and out of control,feels inadequate to and unfit for existence; and the man who feels unfit forexistence is incapable of enjoying it.One of the hallmarks of a man of self-esteem, who regards the universe as opento his effort, is the profound pleasure he experiences in the productive work ofhis mind; his enjoyment of life is fed by his unceasing concern to grow inknowledge and ability—to think, to achieve, to move forward, to meet newchallenges and overcome them—to earn the pride of a constantly expandingefficacy.A different kind of soul is revealed by the man who, predominantly, takespleasure in working only at the routine and familiar, who is inclined to enjoyworking in a semi-daze, who sees happiness in freedom from challenge or struggleor effort: the soul of a man profoundly deficient in self-esteem, to whom theuniverse appears as unknowable and vaguely threatening, the man whose centralmotivating impulse is a longing for safety, not the safety that is won byefficacy, but the safety of a world in which efficacy is not demanded.Still a different kind of soul is revealed by the man who finds it inconceivablethat work—any form of work—can be enjoyable, who regards the effort of earning aliving as a necessary evil, who dreams only of the pleasures that begin when theworkday ends, the pleasure of drowning his brain in alcohol or television orbilliards or women, the pleasure of not being conscious: the soul of a man withscarcely a shred of self-esteem, who never expected the universe to becomprehensible and takes his lethargic dread of it for granted, and whose onlyform of relief and only notion of enjoyment is the dim flicker of undemandingsensations.Still another kind of soul is revealed by the man who takes pleasure, not inachievement, but in destruction, whose action is aimed, not at attainingefficacy, but at ruling those who have attained it: the soul of a man soabjectly lacking in self-value, and so overwhelmed by terror of existence, thathis sole form of self-fulfillment is to unleash his resentment and hatredagainst those who do not share his state, those who are able to live—as if, bydestroying the confident, the strong and the healthy, he could convert impotenceinto efficacy.A rational, self-confident man is motivated by a love of values and by a desireto achieve them. A neurotic is motivated by fear and by a desire to escape it.This difference in motivation is reflected, not only in the things each type ofman will seek for pleasure, but in the nature of the pleasure they willexperience.The emotional quality of the pleasure experienced by the four men describedabove, for instance, is not the same. The quality of any pleasure depends on themental processes that give rise to and attend it, and on the nature of thevalues involved. The pleasure of using one’s consciousness properly, and the“pleasure” of being unconscious, are not the same—just as the pleasure ofachieving real values, of gaining an authentic sense of efficacy, and the“pleasure” of temporarily diminishing one’s sense of fear and helplessness, arenot the same. The man of self-esteem experiences the pure, unadulteratedenjoyment of using his faculties properly and of achieving actual values inreality—a pleasure of which the other three men can have no inkling, just as hehas no inkling of the dim, murky state which they call “pleasure.”This same principle applies to all forms of enjoyment. Thus, in the realm ofhuman relationships, a different form of pleasure is experienced, a differentsort of motivation is involved, and a different kind of character is revealed,by the man who seeks for enjoyment the company of human beings of intelligence,integrity and self-esteem, who share his exacting standards—and by the man whois able to enjoy himself only with human beings who have no standards whateverand with whom, therefore, he feels free to be himself—or by the man who findspleasure only in the company of people he despises, to whom he can comparehimself favorably—or by the man who finds pleasure only among people he candeceive and manipulate, from whom he derives the lowest neurotic substitute fora sense of genuine efficacy: a sense of power.For the rational, psychologically healthy man, the desire for pleasure is thedesire to celebrate his control over reality. For the neurotic, the desire forpleasure is the desire to escape from reality.Now consider the sphere of recreation. For instance, a party. A rational manenjoys a party as an emotional reward for achievement, and he can enjoy it onlyif in fact it involves activities that are enjoyable, such as seeing people whomhe likes, meeting new people whom he finds interesting, engaging inconversations in which something worth saying and hearing is being said andheard. But a neurotic can “enjoy” a party for reasons unrelated to the realactivities taking place; he may hate or despise or fear all the people present,he may act like a noisy fool and feel secretly ashamed of it—but he will feelthat he is enjoying it all, because people are emitting the vibrations ofapproval, or because it is a social distinction to have been invited to thisparty, or because other people appear to be gay, or because the party has sparedhim, for the length of an evening, the terror of being alone.The “pleasure” of being drunk is obviously the pleasure of escaping from theresponsibility of consciousness. And so are the kind of social gatherings, heldfor no other purpose than the expression of hysterical chaos, where the guestswander around in an alcoholic stupor, prattling noisily and senselessly, andenjoying the illusion of a universe where one is not burdened with purpose,logic, reality or awareness.Observe, in this connection, the modern “beatniks”—for instance, their manner ofdancing. What one sees is not smiles of authentic enjoyment, but the vacant,staring eyes, the jerky, disorganized movements of what looks like decentralizedbodies, all working very hard—with a kind of flat-footed hysteria—at projectingan air of the purposeless, the senseless, the mindless. This is the “pleasure”of unconsciousness.Or consider the quieter kind of “pleasures” that fill many people’s lives:family picnics, ladies’ parties or “coffee klatches,” charity bazaars,vegetative kinds of vacation—all of them occasions of quiet boredom for allconcerned, in which the boredom is the value. Boredom, to such people, meanssafety, the known, the usual, the routine—the absence of the new, the exciting,the unfamiliar, the demanding.What is a demanding pleasure? A pleasure that demands the use of one’s mind; notin the sense of problem solving, but in the sense of exercising discrimination,judgment, awareness.One of the cardinal pleasures of life is offered to man by works of art. Art, atits highest potential, as the projection of things “as they might be and oughtto be,” can provide man with an invaluable emotional fuel. But, again, the kindof art works one responds to, depends on one’s deepest values and premises.A man can seek the projection of the heroic, the intelligent, the efficacious,the dramatic, the purposeful, the stylized, the ingenious, the challenging; hecan seek the pleasure of admiration, of looking up to great values. Or he canseek the satisfaction of contemplating gossip-column variants of the folks nextdoor, with nothing demanded of him, neither in thought nor in value standards;he can feel himself pleasantly warmed by projections of the known and familiar,seeking to feel a little less of “a stranger and afraid in a world [he] nevermade.” Or his soul can vibrate affirmatively to projections of horror and humandegradation, he can feel gratified by the thought that he’s not as bad as thedope-addicted dwarf or the crippled lesbian he’s reading about; he can relish anart which tells him that man is evil, that reality is unknowable, that existenceis unendurable, that no one can help anything, that his secret terror is normal.Art projects an implicit view of existence—and it is one’s own view of existencethat determines the art one will respond to. The soul of the man whose favoriteplay is Cyrano de Bergerac is radically different from the soul of the man whosefavorite play is Waiting for Godot.Of the various pleasures that man can offer himself, the greatest is pride—thepleasure he takes in his own achievements and in the creation of his owncharacter. The pleasure he takes in the character and achievements of anotherhuman being is that of admiration. The highest expression of the most intenseunion of these two responses—pride and admiration—is romantic love. Itscelebration is sex.It is in this sphere above all—in a man’s romantic-sexual responses—that hisview of himself and of existence stands eloquently revealed. A man falls in lovewith and sexually desires the person who reflects his own deepest values.There are two crucial respects in which a man’s romantic-sexual responses arepsychologically revealing: in his choice of partner—and in the meaning, to him,of the sexual act.A man of self-esteem, a man in love with himself and with life, feels an intenseneed to find human beings he can admire—to find a spiritual equal whom he canlove. The quality that will attract him most is self-esteem—self-esteem and anunclouded sense of the value of existence. To such a man, sex is an act ofcelebration, its meaning is a tribute to himself and to the woman he has chosen,the ultimate form of experiencing concretely and in his own person the value andjoy of being alive.The need for such an experience is inherent in man’s nature. But if a man lacksthe self-esteem to earn it, he attempts to fake it—and he chooses his partner(subconsciously) by the standard of her ability to help him fake it, to give himthe illusion of a self-value he does not possess and of a happiness he does notfeel.Thus, if a man is attracted to a woman of intelligence, confidence and strength,if he is attracted to a heroine, he reveals one kind of soul; if, instead, he isattracted to an irresponsible, helpless scatterbrain, whose weakness enables himto feel masculine, he reveals another kind of soul; if he is attracted to afrightened slut, whose lack of judgment and standards allows him to feel free ofreproach, he reveals another kind of soul.The same principle, of course, applies to a woman’s romantic-sexual choices.The sexual act has a different meaning for the person whose desire is fed bypride and admiration, to whom the pleasurable self-experience it affords is anend in itself—and for the person who seeks in sex the proof of masculinity (orfemininity), or the amelioration of despair, or a defense against anxiety, or anescape from boredom.Paradoxically, it is the so-called pleasure-chasers—the men who seemingly livefor nothing but the sensation of the moment, who are concerned only with having“a good time”—who are psychologically incapable of enjoying pleasure as an endin itself. The neurotic pleasure-chaser imagines that, by going through themotions of a celebration, he will be able to make himself feel that he hassomething to celebrate.One of the hallmarks of the man who lacks self-esteem —and the real punishmentfor his moral and psychological default—is the fact that all his pleasures arepleasures of escape from the two pursuers whom he has betrayed and from whomthere is no escape: reality and his own mind.Since the function of pleasure is to afford man a sense of his own efficacy, theneurotic is caught in a deadly conflict: he is compelled, by his nature as man,to feel a desperate need for pleasure, as a confirmation and expression of hiscontrol over reality—but he can find pleasure only in an escape from reality.That is the reason why his pleasures do not work, why they bring him, not asense of pride, fulfillment, inspiration, but a sense of guilt, frustration,hopelessness, shame. The effect of pleasure on a man of self-esteem is that of areward and a confirmation. The effect of pleasure on a man who lacks self-esteemis that of a threat—the threat of anxiety, the shaking of the precariousfoundation of his pseudo-self-value, the sharpening of the ever-present fearthat the structure will collapse and he will find himself face to face with astern, absolute, unknown and unforgiving reality.One of the commonest complaints of patients who seek psychotherapy, is thatnothing has the power to give them pleasure, that authentic enjoyment seemsimpossible to them. This is the inevitable dead end of the policy ofpleasure-as-escape.To preserve an unclouded capacity for the enjoyment of life, is an unusual moraland psychological achievement. Contrary to popular belief, it is theprerogative, not of mindlessness, but of an unremitting devotion to the act ofperceiving reality, and of a scrupulous intellectual integrity. It is the rewardof self-esteem. (February 1964)"},{"pageContent":"7.Doesn’t Life Require Compromise?by Ayn RandA compromise is an adjustment of conflicting claims by mutual concessions. Thismeans that both parties to a compromise have some valid claim and some value tooffer each other. And this means that both parties agree upon some fundamentalprinciple which serves as a base for their deal.It is only in regard to concretes or particulars, implementing a mutuallyaccepted basic principle, that one may compromise. For instance, one may bargainwith a buyer over the price one wants to receive for one’s product, and agree ona sum somewhere between one’s demand and his offer. The mutually accepted basicprinciple, in such case, is the principle of trade, namely: that the buyer mustpay the seller for his product. But if one wanted to be paid and the allegedbuyer wanted to obtain one’s product for nothing, no compromise, agreement ordiscussion would be possible, only the total surrender of one or the other.There can be no compromise between a property owner and a burglar; offering theburglar a single teaspoon of one’s silverware would not be a compromise, but atotal surrender—the recognition of his right to one’s property. What value orconcession did the burglar offer in return? And once the principle of unilateralconcessions is accepted as the base of a relationship by both parties, it isonly a matter of time before the burglar would seize the rest. As an example ofthis process, observe the present foreign policy of the United States.There can be no compromise between freedom and government controls; to accept“just a few controls” is to surrender the principle of inalienable individualrights and to substitute for it the principle of the government’s unlimited,arbitrary power, thus delivering oneself into gradual enslavement. As an exampleof this process, observe the present domestic policy of the United States.There can be no compromise on basic principles or on fundamental issues. Whatwould you regard as a “compromise” between life and death? Or between truth andfalsehood? Or between reason and irrationality?Today, however, when people speak of “compromise,” what they mean is not alegitimate mutual concession or a trade, but precisely the betrayal of one’sprinciples—the unilateral surrender to any groundless, irrational claim. Theroot of that doctrine is ethical subjectivism, which holds that a desire or awhim is an irreducible moral primary, that every man is entitled to any desirehe might feel like asserting, that all desires have equal moral validity, andthat the only way men can get along together is by giving in to anything and“compromising” with anyone. It is not hard to see who would profit and who wouldlose by such a doctrine.The immorality of this doctrine—and the reason why the term “compromise”implies, in today’s general usage, an act of moral treason—lies in the fact thatit requires men to accept ethical subjectivism as the basic principlesuperseding all principles in human relationships and to sacrifice anything as aconcession to one another’s whims.The question “Doesn’t life require compromise?” is usually asked by those whofail to differentiate between a basic principle and some concrete, specificwish. Accepting a lesser job than one had wanted is not a “compromise.” Takingorders from one’s employer on how to do the work for which one is hired, is nota “compromise.” Failing to have a cake after one has eaten it, is not a“compromise.”Integrity does not consist of loyalty to one’s subjective whims, but of loyaltyto rational principles. A “compromise” (in the unprincipled sense of that word)is not a breach of one’s comfort, but a breach of one’s convictions. A“compromise” does not consist of doing something one dislikes, but of doingsomething one knows to be evil. Accompanying one’s husband or wife to a concert,when one does not care for music, is not a “compromise”; surrendering to his orher irrational demands for social conformity, for pretended religious observanceor for generosity toward boorish in-laws, is. Working for an employer who doesnot share one’s ideas, is not a “compromise”; pretending to share his ideas, is.Accepting a publisher’s suggestions to make changes in one’s manuscript, whenone sees the rational validity of his suggestions, is not a “compromise”; makingsuch changes in order to please him or to please “the public,” against one’s ownjudgment and standards, is.The excuse, given in all such cases, is that the “compromise” is only temporaryand that one will reclaim one’s integrity at some indeterminate future date. Butone cannot correct a husband’s or wife’s irrationality by giving in to it andencouraging it to grow. One cannot achieve the victory of one’s ideas by helpingto propagate their opposite. One cannot offer a literary masterpiece, “when onehas become rich and famous,” to a following one has acquired by writing trash.If one found it difficult to maintain one’s loyalty to one’s own convictions atthe start, a succession of betrayals—which helped to augment the power of theevil one lacked the courage to fight—will not make it easier at a later date,but will make it virtually impossible.There can be no compromise on moral principles. “In any compromise between foodand poison, it is only death that can win. In any compromise between good andevil, it is only evil that can profit.” (Atlas Shrugged.) The next time you aretempted to ask: “Doesn’t life require compromise?” translate that question intoits actual meaning: “Doesn’t life require the surrender of that which is trueand good to that which is false and evil?” The answer is that that precisely iswhat life forbids—if one wishes to achieve anything but a stretch of torturedyears spent in progressive self-destruction. (July 1962)"},{"pageContent":"8.How Does One Lead a Rational Life in an Irrational Society?by Ayn RandI will confine my answer to a single, fundamental aspect of this question. Iwill name only one principle, the opposite of the idea which is so prevalenttoday and which is responsible for the spread of evil in the world. Thatprinciple is: One must never fail to pronounce moral judgment.Nothing can corrupt and disintegrate a culture or a man’s character asthoroughly as does the precept of moral agnosticism, the idea that one mustnever pass moral judgment on others, that one must be morally tolerant ofanything, that the good consists of never distinguishing good from evil.It is obvious who profits and who loses by such a precept. It is not justice orequal treatment that you grant to men when you abstain equally from praisingmen’s virtues and from condemning men’s vices. When your impartial attitudedeclares, in effect, that neither the good nor the evil may expect anything fromyou—whom do you betray and whom do you encourage?But to pronounce moral judgment is an enormous responsibility. To be a judge,one must possess an unimpeachable character; one need not be omniscient orinfallible, and it is not an issue of errors of knowledge; one needs anun-breached integrity, that is, the absence of any indulgence in conscious,willful evil. Just as a judge in a court of law may err, when the evidence isinconclusive, but may not evade the evidence available, nor accept bribes, norallow any personal feeling, emotion, desire or fear to obstruct his mind’sjudgment of the facts of reality—so every rational person must maintain anequally strict and solemn integrity in the courtroom within his own mind, wherethe responsibility is more awesome than in a public tribunal, because he, thejudge, is the only one to know when he has been impeached.There is, however, a court of appeal from one’s judgments: objective reality. Ajudge puts himself on trial every time he pronounces a verdict. It is only intoday’s reign of amoral cynicism, subjectivism and hooliganism that men mayimagine themselves free to utter any sort of irrational judgment and to sufferno consequences. But, in fact, a man is to be judged by the judgments hepronounces. The things which he condemns or extols exist in objective realityand are open to the independent appraisal of others. It is his own moralcharacter and standards that he reveals, when he blames or praises. If hecondemns America and extols Soviet Russia—or if he attacks businessmen anddefends juvenile delinquents—or if he denounces a great work of art and praisestrash—it is the nature of his own soul that he confesses.It is their fear of this responsibility that prompts most people to adopt anattitude of indiscriminate moral neutrality. It is the fear best expressed inthe precept: “Judge not, that ye be not judged.” But that precept, in fact, isan abdication of moral responsibility: it is a moral blank check one gives toothers in exchange for a moral blank check one expects for oneself.There is no escape from the fact that men have to make choices; so long as menhave to make choices, there is no escape from moral values; so long as moralvalues are at stake, no moral neutrality is possible. To abstain from condemninga torturer, is to become an accessory to the torture and murder of his victims.The moral principle to adopt in this issue, is: “Judge, and be prepared to bejudged. ”The opposite of moral neutrality is not a blind, arbitrary, self-righteouscondemnation of any idea, action or person that does not fit one’s mood, one’smemorized slogans or one’s snap judgment of the moment. Indiscriminate toleranceand indiscriminate condemnation are not two opposites: they are two variants ofthe same evasion. To declare that “everybody is white” or “everybody is black”or “everybody is neither white nor black, but gray,” is not a moral judgment,but an escape from the responsibility of moral judgment.To judge means: to evaluate a given concrete by reference to an abstractprinciple or standard. It is not an easy task; it is not a task that can beperformed automatically by one’s feelings, “instincts” or hunches. It is a taskthat requires the most precise, the most exacting, the most ruthlessly objectiveand rational process of thought. It is fairly easy to grasp abstract moralprinciples; it can be very difficult to apply them to a given situation,particularly when it involves the moral character of another person. When onepronounces moral judgment, whether in praise or in blame, one must be preparedto answer “Why?” and to prove one’s case—to oneself and to any rationalinquirer.The policy of always pronouncing moral judgment does not mean that one mustregard oneself as a missionary charged with the responsibility of “savingeveryone’s soul”—nor that one must give unsolicited moral appraisals to allthose one meets. It means: (a) that one must know clearly, in full, verballyidentified form, one’s own moral evaluation of every person, issue and eventwith which one deals, and act accordingly; (b) that one must make one’s moralevaluation known to others, when it is rationally appropriate to do so.This last means that one need not launch into unprovoked moral denunciations ordebates, but that one must speak up in situations where silence can objectivelybe taken to mean agreement with or sanction of evil. When one deals withirrational persons, where argument is futile, a mere “I don’t agree with you” issufficient to negate any implication of moral sanction. When one deals withbetter people, a full statement of one’s views may be morally required. But inno case and in no situation may one permit one’s own values to be attacked ordenounced, and keep silent.Moral values are the motive power of a man’s actions. By pronouncing moraljudgment, one protects the clarity of one’s own perception and the rationalityof the course one chooses to pursue. It makes a difference whether one thinksthat one is dealing with human errors of knowledge or with human evil.Observe how many people evade, rationalize and drive their minds into a state ofblind stupor, in dread of discovering that those they deal with—their “lovedones” or friends or business associates or political rulers—are not merelymistaken, but evil. Observe that this dread leads them to sanction, to help andto spread the very evil whose existence they fear to acknowledge.If people did not indulge in such abject evasions as the claim that somecontemptible liar “means well”—that a mooching bum “can’t help it”—that ajuvenile delinquent “needs love”—that a criminal “doesn’t know any better”—thata power-seeking politician is moved by patriotic concern for “the publicgood”—that communists are merely “agrarian reformers”—the history of the pastfew decades, or centuries, would have been different.Ask yourself why totalitarian dictatorships find it necessary to pour money andeffort into propaganda for their own helpless, chained, gagged slaves, who haveno means of protest or defense. The answer is that even the humblest peasant orthe lowest savage would rise in blind rebellion, were he to realize that he isbeing immolated, not to some incomprehensible “noble purpose,” but to plain,naked human evil.Observe also that moral neutrality necessitates a progressive sympathy for viceand a progressive antagonism to virtue. A man who struggles not to acknowledgethat evil is evil, finds it increasingly dangerous to acknowledge that the goodis the good. To him, a person of virtue is a threat that can topple all of hisevasions—particularly when an issue of justice is involved, which demands thathe take sides. It is then that such formulas as “Nobody is ever fully right orfully wrong” and “Who am I to judge?” take their lethal effect. The man whobegins by saying: “There is some good in the worst of us,” goes on to say:“There is some bad in the best of us”—then: “There’s got to be some bad in thebest of us”—and then: “It’s the best of us who make life difficult—why don’tthey keep silent?—who are they to judge?”And then, on some gray, middle-aged morning, such a man realizes suddenly thathe has betrayed all the values he had loved in his distant spring, and wondershow it happened, and slams his mind shut to the answer, by telling himselfhastily that the fear he had felt in his worst, most shameful moments was rightand that values have no chance in this world.An irrational society is a society of moral cowards—of men paralyzed by the lossof moral standards, principles and goals. But since men have to act, so long asthey live, such a society is ready to be taken over by anyone willing to set itsdirection. The initiative can come from only two types of men: either from theman who is willing to assume the responsibility of asserting rational values—orfrom the thug who is not troubled by questions of responsibility.No matter how hard the struggle, there is only one choice that a rational mancan make in the face of such an alternative. (April 1962)"},{"pageContent":"9.The Cult of Moral Graynessby Ayn RandOne of the most eloquent symptoms of the moral bankruptcy of today’s culture, isa certain fashionable attitude toward moral issues, best summarized as: “Thereare no blacks and whites, there are only grays.”This is asserted in regard to persons, actions, principles of conduct, andmorality in general. “Black and white,” in this context, means “good and evil.”(The reverse order used in that catch phrase is interesting psychologically.)In any respect one cares to examine, that notion is full of contradictions(foremost among them is the fallacy of “the stolen concept”). If there is noblack and white, there can be no gray—since gray is merely a mixture of the two.Before one can identify anything as “gray,” one has to know what is black andwhat is white. In the field of morality, this means that one must first identifywhat is good and what is evil. And when a man has ascertained that onealternative is good and the other is evil, he has no justification for choosinga mixture. There can be no justification for choosing any part of that which oneknows to be evil. In morality, “black” is predominantly the result of attemptingto pretend to oneself that one is merely “gray.”If a moral code (such as altruism) is, in fact, impossible to practice, it isthe code that must be condemned as “black,” not its victims evaluated as “gray.”If a moral code prescribes irreconcilable contradictions—so that by choosing thegood in one respect, a man becomes evil in another—it is the code that must berejected as “black.” If a moral code is inapplicable to reatity—if it offers noguidance except a series of arbitrary, groundless, out-of-context injunctionsand commandments, to be accepted on faith and practiced automatically, as blinddogma—its practitioners cannot properly be classified as “white” or “black” or“gray”: a moral code that forbids and paralyzes moral judgment is acontradiction in terms.If, in a complex moral issue, a man struggles to determine what is right, andfails or makes an honest error, he cannot be regarded as “gray”; morally, he is“white.” Errors of knowledge are not breaches of morality; no proper moral codecan demand infallibility or omniscience.But if, in order to escape the responsibility of moral judgment, a man closeshis eyes and mind, if he evades the facts of the issue and struggles not toknow, he cannot be regarded as “gray”; morally, he is as “black” as they come.Many forms of confusion, uncertainty and epistemological sloppiness help toobscure the contradictions and to disguise the actual meaning of the doctrine ofmoral grayness.Some people believe that it is merely a restatement of such bromides as “Nobodyis perfect in this world”—i.e., everybody is a mixture of good and evil, and,therefore, morally “gray.” Since the majority of those one meets are likely tofit that description, people accept it as some sort of natural fact, withoutfurther thought. They forget that morality deals only with issues open to man’schoice (i.e., to his free will)—and. therefore, that no statisticalgeneralizations are valid in this matter.If man is “gray” by nature, no moral concepts are applicable to him, including“grayness,” and no such thing as morality is possible. But if man has free will,then the fact that ten (or ten million) men made the wrong choice, does notnecessitate that the eleventh one will make it; it necessitates nothing—andproves nothing—in regard to any given individual.There are many reasons why most people are morally imperfect, i.e., hold mixed,contradictory premises and values (the altruist morality is one of the reasons),but that is a different issue. Regardless of the reasons of their choices, thefact that most people are morally “gray,” does not invalidate man’s need ofmorality and of moral “whiteness”; if anything, it makes the need more urgent.Nor does it warrant the epistemological “package deal” of dismissing the problemby consigning all men to moral “grayness” and thus refusing to recognize or topractice “whiteness.” Nor does it serve as an escape from the responsibility ofmoral judgment: unless one is prepared to dispense with morality altogether andto regard a petty chiseller and a murderer as morally equal, one still has tojudge and evaluate the many shadings of “gray” that one may encounter in thecharacters of individual men. (And the only way to judge them is by a clearlydefined criterion of “black” and “white.”)A similar notion, involving similar errors, is held by some people who believethat the doctrine of moral grayness is merely a restatement of the proposition:“There are two sides to every issue,” which they take to mean that nobody isever fully right or fully wrong. But that is not what that proposition means orimplies. It implies only that in judging an issue, one should take cognizance ofor give a hearing to both sides. This does not mean that the claims of bothsides will necessarily be equally valid, nor even that there will be somemodicum of justice on both sides. More often than not, justice will be on oneside, and unwarranted presumption (or worse) on the other.There are, of course, complex issues in which both sides are right in somerespects and wrong in others—and it is here that the “package deal” ofpronouncing both sides “gray” is least permissible. It is in such issues thatthe most rigorous precision of moral judgment is required to identify andevaluate the various aspects involved—which can be done only by unscrambling themixed elements of “black” and “white.”The basic error in all these various confusions is the same: it consists offorgetting that morality deals only with issues open to man’s choice—whichmeans: forgetting the difference between “unable” and “unwilling.” This permitspeople to translate the catch phrase “There are no blacks and whites” into: “Menare unable to be wholly good or wholly evil”—which they accept, in foggyresignation, without questioning the metaphysical contradictions it entails.But not many people would accept it, if that catch phrase were translated intothe actual meaning it is intended to smuggle into their minds: “Men areunwilling to be wholly good or wholly evil.”The first thing one would say to any advocate of such a proposition, is: “Speakfor yourself, brother!” And that, in effect, is what he is actually doing;consciously or subconsciously, intentionally or inadvertently, when a mandeclares: “There are no blacks and whites,” he is making a psychologicalconfession, and what he means is: “I am unwilling to be wholly good—and pleasedon’t regard me as wholly evil!”Just as, in epistemology, the cult of uncertainty is a revolt against reason—so,in ethics, the cult of moral grayness is a revolt against moral values. Both area revolt against the absolutism of reality.Just as the cult of uncertainty could not succeed by an open rebellion againstreason and, therefore, struggles to elevate the negation of reason into somesort of superior reasoning—so the cult of moral grayness could not succeed by anopen rebellion against morality, and struggles to elevate the negation ofmorality into a superior kind of virtue.Observe the form in which one encounters that doctrine: it is seldom presentedas a positive, as an ethical theory or a subject of discussion; predominantly,one hears it as a negative, as a snap objection or reproach, uttered in a mannerimplying that one is guilty of breaching an absolute so self-evident as torequire no discussion. In tones ranging from astonishment to sarcasm to anger toindignation to hysterical hatred, the doctrine is thrown at you in the form ofan accusatory: “Surely you don’t think in terms of black-and-white, do you?”Prompted by confusion, helplessness and fear of the entire subject of morality,most people hasten to answer guiltily: “No, of course, I don’t,” without anyclear idea of the nature of the accusation. They do not pause to grasp that thataccusation is saying, in effect: “Surely you are not so unfair as todiscriminate between good and evil, are you?”—or: “Surely you are not so evil asto seek the good, are you?”—or: “Surely you are not so immoral as to believe inmorality!”Moral guilt, fear of moral judgment, and a plea for blanket forgiveness, are soobviously the motive of that catch phrase that a glance at reality would besufficient to tell its proponents what an ugly confession they are uttering. Butescape from reality is both the precondition and the goal of the cult of moralgrayness.Philosophically, that cult is a negation of morality—but, psychologically, thisis not its adherents’ goal. What they seek is not amorality, but something moreprofoundly irrational a nonabsolute, fluid, elastic, middle-of-the-roadmorality. They do not proclaim themselves “beyond good and evil”—they seek topreserve the “advantages” of both. They are not moral challengers, nor do theyrepresent a medieval version of flamboyant evil worshipers. What gives themtheir peculiarly modern flavor is that they do not advocate selling one’s soulto the Devil; they advocate selling it piecemeal, bit by bit, to any retailbidder.They are not a philosophical school of thought; they are the typical product ofphilosophical default—of the intellectual bankruptcy that has producedirrationalism in epistemology, a moral vacuum in ethics, and a mixed economy inpolitics. A mixed economy is an amoral war of pressure groups, devoid ofprinciples, values or any reference to justice, a war whose ultimate weapon isthe power of brute force, but whose outward form is a game of compromise. Thecult of moral grayness is the ersatz morality which made it possible and towhich men now cling in a panicky attempt to justify it.Observe that their dominant overtone is not a quest for the “white,” but anobsessive terror of being branded “black” (and with good reason). Observe thatthey are pleading for a morality which would hold compromise as its standard ofvalue and would thus make it possible to gauge virtue by the number of valuesone is willing to betray.The consequences and the “vested interests” of their doctrine are visible allaround us.Observe, in politics, that the term extremism has become a synonym of “evil,”regardless of the content of the issue (the evil is not what you are “extreme”about, but that you are “extreme”—i.e., consistent). Observe the phenomenon ofthe so-called neutralists in the United Nations: the “neutralists” are worsethan merely neutral in the conflict between the United States and Soviet Russia;they are committed, on principle, to see no difference between the two sides,never to consider the merits of an issue, and always to seek a compromise, anycompromise in any conflict—as, for instance, between an aggressor and an invadedcountry.Observe, in literature, the emergence of a thing called anti-hero, whosedistinction is that he possesses no distinction—no virtues, no values, no goals,no character, no significance—yet who occupies, in plays and novels, theposition formerly held by a hero, with the story centered on his actions, eventhough he does nothing and gets nowhere. Observe that the term “good guys andbad guys” is used as a sneer—and, particularly in television, observe the revoltagainst happy endings, the demands that the “bad guys” be given an equal chanceand an equal number of victories.Like a mixed economy, men of mixed premises may be called “gray”; but, in bothcases, the mixture does not remain “gray” for long. “Gray,” in this context, ismerely a prelude to “black.” There may be “gray” men, but there can be no “gray”moral principles. Morality is a code of black and white. When and if men attempta compromise, it is obvious which side will necessarily lose and which willnecessarily profit.Such are the reasons why—when one is asked: “Surely you don’t think in terms ofblack-and-white, do you?”—the proper answer (in essence, if not in form) shouldbe: “You’re damn right I do!” (June 1964)"},{"pageContent":"10.Collectivized Ethicsby Ayn RandCertain questions, which one frequently hears, are not philosophical queries,but psychological confessions. This is particularly true in the field of ethics.It is especially in discussions of ethics that one must check one’s premises (orremember them), and more: one must learn to check the premises of one’sadversaries.For instance, Objectivists will often hear a question such as: “What will bedone about the poor or the handicapped in a free society?”The altruist-collectivist premise, implicit in that question, is that men are“their brothers’ keepers” and that the misfortune of some is a mortgage onothers. The questioner is ignoring or evading the basic premises of Objectivistethics and is attempting to switch the discussion onto his own collectivistbase. Observe that he does not ask: “Should anything be done?” but: “What willbe done?”—as if the collectivist premise had been tacitly accepted and all thatremains is a discussion of the means to implement it.Once, when Barbara Branden was asked by a student: “What will happen to the poorin an Objectivist society?”—she answered: “If you want to help them, you willnot be stopped.”This is the essence of the whole issue and a perfect example of how one refusesto accept an adversary’s premises as the basis of discussion.Only individual men have the right to decide when or whether they wish to helpothers; society—as an organized political system—has no rights in the matter atall.On the question of when and under what conditions it is morally proper for anindividual to help others, I refer you to Galt’s speech in Atlas Shrugged. Whatconcerns us here is the collectivist premise of regarding this issue aspolitical, as the problem or duty of “society as a whole.”Since nature does not guarantee automatic security, success and survival to anyhuman being, it is only the dictatorial presumptuousness and the moralcannibalism of the altruist-collectivist code that permits a man to suppose (oridly to daydream) that he can somehow guarantee such security to some men at theexpense of others.If a man speculates on what “society” should do for the poor, he accepts therebythe collectivist premise that men’s lives belong to society and that he, as amember of society, has the right to dispose of them, to set their goals or toplan the “distribution” of their efforts.This is the psychological confession implied in such questions and in manyissues of the same kind.At best, it reveals a man’s psycho-epistemological chaos; it reveals a fallacywhich may be termed “the fallacy of the frozen abstraction” and which consistsof substituting some one particular concrete for the wider abstract class towhich it belongs—in this case, substituting a specific ethics (altruism) for thewider abstraction of “ethics.” Thus, a man may reject the theory of altruism andassert that he has accepted a rational code—but, failing to integrate his ideas,he continues unthinkingly to approach ethical questions in terms established byaltruism.More often, however, that psychological confession reveals a deeper evil: itreveals the enormity of the extent to which altruism erodes men’s capacity tograsp the concept of rights or the value of an individual life; it reveals amind from which the reality of a human being has been wiped out.Humility and presumptuousness are always two sides of the same premise, andalways share the task of filling the space vacated by self-esteem in acollectivized mentality. The man who is willing to serve as the means to theends of others, will necessarily regard others as the means to his ends. Themore neurotic he is or the more conscientious in the practice of altruism (andthese two aspects of his psychology will act reciprocally to reinforce eachother), the more he will tend to devise schemes “for the good of mankind” or of“society” or of “the public” or of “future generations” —or of anything exceptactual human beings.Hence the appalling recklessness with which men propose, discuss and accept“humanitarian” projects which are to be imposed by political means, that is, byforce, on an unlimited number of human beings. If, according to collectivistcaricatures, the greedy rich indulged in profligate material luxury, on thepremise of “price no object”—then the social progress brought by today’scollectivized mentalities consists of indulging in altruistic politicalplanning, on the premise of “human lives no object.”The hallmark of such mentalities is the advocacy of some grand scale publicgoal, without regard to context, costs or means. Out of context, such a goal canusually be shown to be desirable; it has to be public, because the costs are notto be earned, but to be expropriated; and a dense patch of venomous fog has toshroud the issue of means—because the means are to be human lives.“Medicare” is an example of such a project. “Isn’t it desirable that the agedshould have medical care in times of illness?” its advocates clamor. Consideredout of context, the answer would be: yes, it is desirable. Who would have areason to say no? And it is at this point that the mental processes of acollectivized brain are cut off; the rest is fog. Only the desire remains in hissight—it’s the good, isn’t it?—it’s not for myself, it’s for others, it’s forthe public, for a helpless, ailing public ... The fog hides such facts as theenslavement and, therefore, the destruction of medical science, theregimentation and disintegration of all medical practice, and the sacrifice ofthe professional integrity, the freedom, the careers, the ambitions, theachievements, the happiness, the lives of the very men who are to provide that“desirable” goal—the doctors.After centuries of civilization, most men—with the exception of criminals—havelearned that the above mental attitude is neither practical nor moral in theirprivate lives and may not be applied to the achievement of their private goals.There would be no controversy about the moral character of some young hoodlumwho declared: “Isn’t it desirable to have a yacht, to live in a penthouse and todrink champagne?”—and stubbornly refused to consider the fact that he had robbeda bank and killed two guards to achieve that “desirable” goal.There is no moral difference between these two examples; the number ofbeneficiaries does not change the nature of the action, it merely increases thenumber of victims. In fact, the private hoodlum has a slight edge of moralsuperiority: he has no power to devastate an entire nation and his victims arenot legally disarmed.It is men’s views of their public or political existence that the collectivizedethics of altruism has protected from the march of civilization and haspreserved as a reservoir, a wildlife sanctuary, ruled by the mores ofprehistorical savagery. If men have grasped some faint glimmer of respect forindividual rights in their private dealings with one another, that glimmervanishes when they turn to public issues—and what leaps into the political arenais a caveman who can’t conceive of any reason why the tribe may not bash in theskull of any individual if it so desires.The distinguishing characteristic of such tribal mentality is: the axiomatic,the almost “instinctive” view of human life as the fodder, fuel or means for anypublic project.The examples of such projects are innumerable: “Isn’t it desirable to clean upthe slums?” (dropping the context of what happens to those in the next incomebracket)—“Isn’t it desirable to have beautiful, planned cities, all of oneharmonious style?” (dropping the context of whose choice of style is to beforced on the home builders)—“Isn’t it desirable to have an educated public?”(dropping the context of who will do the educating, what will be taught, andwhat will happen to dissenters)—“Isn’t it desirable to liberate the artists, thewriters, the composers from the burden of financial problems and leave them freeto create?” (dropping the context of such questions as: which artists, writersand composers?—chosen by whom?—at whose expense?—at the expense of the artists,writers and composers who have no political pull and whose miserably precariousincomes will be taxed to “liberate” that privileged elite?)—“Isn’t sciencedesirable? Isn’t it desirable for man to conquer space?”And here we come to the essence of the unreality—the savage, blind, ghastly,bloody unreality—that motivates a collectivized soul.The unanswered and unanswerable question in all of their “desirable” goals is:To whom? Desires and goals presuppose beneficiaries. Is science desirable? Towhom? Not to the Soviet serfs who die of epidemics, filth, starvation, terrorand firing squads—while some bright young men wave to them from space capsulescircling over their human pig-sties. And not to the American father who died ofheart failure brought on by overwork, struggling to send his son throughcoUege—or to the boy who could not afford college—or to the couple killed in anautomobile wreck, because they could not afford a new car—or to the mother wholost her child because she could not afford to send him to the best hospital—notto any of those people whose taxes pay for the support of our subsidized scienceand public research projects.Science is a value only because it expands, enriches and protects man’s life. Itis not a value outside that context. Nothing is a value outside that context.And “man’s life” means the single, specific, irreplaceable lives of individualmen.The discovery of new knowledge is a value to men only when and if they are freeto use and enjoy the benefits of the previously known. New discoveries are apotential value to all men, but not at the price of sacrificing all of theiractual values. A “progress” extended into infinity, which brings no benefit toanyone, is a monstrous absurdity. And so is the “conquest of space” by some men,when and if it is accomplished by expropriating the labor of other men who areleft without means to acquire a pair of shoes.Progress can come only out of men’s surplus, that is: from the work of those menwhose ability produces more than their personal consumption requires, those whoare intellectually and financially able to venture out in pursuit of the new.Capitalism is the only system where such men are free to function and whereprogress is accompanied, not by forced privations, but by a constant rise in thegeneral level of prosperity, of consumption and of enjoyment of life.It is only to the frozen unreality inside a collectivized brain that human livesare interchangeable—and only such a brain can contemplate as “moral” or“desirable” the sacrifice of generations of living men for the alleged benefitswhich public science or public industry or public concerts will bring to theunborn.Soviet Russia is the clearest, but not the only, illustration of theachievements of collectivized mentalities. Two generations of Russians havelived, toiled and died in misery, waiting for the abundance promised by theirrulers, who pleaded for patience and commanded austerity, while building public“industrialization” and killing public hope in five-year installments. At first,the people starved while waiting for electric generators and tractors; they arestill starving, while waiting for atomic energy and interplanetary travel.That waiting has no end—the unborn profiteers of that wholesale sacrificialslaughter will never be bom—the sacrificial animals will merely breed new hordesof sacrificial animals—as the history of all tyrannies has demonstrated—whilethe unfocused eyes of a collectivized brain will stare on, undeterred, and speakof a vision of service to mankind, mixing interchangeably the corpses of thepresent with the ghosts of the future, but seeing no men.Such is the status of reality in the soul of any Milquetoast who looks with envyat the achievements of industrialists and dreams of what beautiful public parkshe could create if only everyone’s lives, efforts and resources were turned overto him.All public projects are mausoleums, not always in shape, but always in cost.The next time you encounter one of those “public-spirited” dreamers who tellsyou rancorously that “some very desirable goals cannot be achieved withouteverybody’s participation,” tell him that if he cannot obtain everybody’svoluntary participation, his goals had jolly well better remain un-achieved—andthat men’s lives are not his to dispose of.And, if you wish, give him the following example of the ideals he advocates. Itis medically possible to take the corneas of a man’s eyes immediately after hisdeath and transplant them to the eyes of a living man who is blind, thusrestoring his sight (in certain types of blindness). Now, according tocollectivized ethics, this poses a social problem. Should we wait until a man’sdeath to cut out his eyes, when other men need them? Should we regardeverybody’s eyes as public property and devise a “fair method of distribution”?Would you advocate cutting out a living man’s eye and giving it to a blind man,so as to “equalize” them? No? Then don’t struggle any further with questionsabout “public projects” in a free society. You know the answer. The principle isthe same. (January 1963)"},{"pageContent":"11.The Monument Buildersby Ayn RandWhat had once been an alleged ideal is now a ragged skeleton rattling like ascarecrow in the wind over the whole world, but men lack the courage to glanceup and to discover the grinning skull under the bloody rags. That skeleton issocialism.Fifty years ago, there might have been some excuse (though not justification)for the widespread belief that socialism is a political theory motivated bybenevolence and aimed at the achievement of men’s well-being. Today, that beliefcan no longer be regarded as an innocent error. Socialism has been tried onevery continent of the globe. In the light of its results, it is time toquestion the motives of socialism’s advocates.The essential characteristic of socialism is the denial of individual propertyrights; under socialism, the right to property (which is the right of use anddisposal) is vested in “society as a whole,” i.e., in the collective, withproduction and distribution controlled by the state, i.e., by the government.Socialism may be established by force, as in the Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics—or by vote, as in Nazi (National Socialist) Germany. The degree ofsocialization may be total, as in Russia—or partial, as in England.Theoretically, the differences are superficial; practically, they are only amatter of time. The basic principle, in all cases, is the same.The alleged goals of socialism were: the abolition of poverty, the achievementof general prosperity, progress, peace and human brotherhood. The results havebeen a terrifying failure—terrifying, that is, if one’s motive is men’s welfare.Instead of prosperity, socialism has brought economic paralysis and/or collapseto every country that tried it. The degree of socialization has been the degreeof disaster. The consequences have varied accordingly.England, once the freest and proudest nation of Europe, has been reduced to thestatus of a second-rate power and is perishing slowly from hemophilia, losingthe best of her economic blood: the middle class and the professions. The able,competent, productive, independent men are leaving by the thousands, migratingto Canada or the United States, in search of freedom. They are escaping from thereign of mediocrity, from the mawkish poorhouse where, having sold their rightsin exchange for free dentures, the inmates are now whining that they’d rather beRed than dead.In more fully socialized countries, famine was the start, the insigniaannouncing socialist rule—as in Soviet Russia, as in Red China, as in Cuba. Inthose countries, socialism reduced the people to the unspeakable poverty of thepre-industrial ages, to literal starvation, and has kept them on a stagnantlevel of misery.No, it is not “just temporary,” as socialism’s apologists have been saying—forhalf a century. After forty-five years of government planning, Russia is stillunable to solve the problem of feeding her population.As far as superior productivity and speed of economic progress are concerned,the question of any comparisons between capitalism and socialism has beenanswered once and for all—for any honest person—by the present differencebetween West and East Berlin.Instead of peace, socialism has introduced a new kind of gruesome lunacy intointernational relations—the “cold war,” which is a state of chronic war withundeclared periods of peace between wantonly sudden invasions—with Russiaseizing one-third of the globe, with socialist tribes and nations at oneanother’s throats, with socialist India invading Goa, and communist Chinainvading socialist India.An eloquent sign of the moral corruption of our age is the callous complacencywith which most of the socialists and their sympathizers, the “liberals,” regardthe atrocities perpetrated in socialistic countries and accept rule by terror asa way of life—while posturing as advocates of “human brotherhood.” In the1930’s, they did protest against the atrocities of Nazi Germany. But,apparently, it was not an issue of principle, but only the protest of a rivalgang fighting for the same territory—because we do not hear their voices anylonger.In the name of “humanity,” they condone and accept the following: the abolitionof all freedom and all rights, the expropriation of all property, executionswithout trial, torture chambers, slave-labor camps, the mass slaughter ofcountless millions in Soviet Russia—and the bloody horror of East Berlin,including the bullet-riddled bodies of fleeing children.When one observes the nightmare of the desperate efforts made by hundreds ofthousands of people struggling to escape from the socialized countries ofEurope, to escape over barbed-wire fences, under machine-gun fire—one can nolonger believe that socialism, in any of its forms, is motivated by benevolenceand by the desire to achieve men’s welfare.No man of authentic benevolence could evade or ignore so great a horror on sovast a scale.Socialism is not a movement of the people. It is a movement of theintellectuals, originated, led and controlled by the intellectuals, carried bythem out of their stuffy ivory towers into those bloody fields of practice wherethey unite with their allies and executors: the thugs.What, then, is the motive of such intellectuals? Power-lust. Power-lust—as amanifestation of helplessness, of self-loathing and of the desire for theunearned.The desire for the unearned has two aspects: the unearned in matter and theunearned in spirit. (By “spirit” I mean: man’s consciousness.) These two aspectsare necessarily inter-related, but a man’s desire may be focused predominantlyon one or the other. The desire for the unearned in spirit is the moredestructive of the two and the more corrupt. It is a desire for unearnedgreatness; it is expressed (but not defined) by the foggy murk of the term“prestige. ”The seekers of unearned material benefits are merely financial parasites,moochers, looters or criminals, who are too limited in number and in mind to bea threat to civilization, until and unless they are released and legalized bythe seekers of unearned greatness.Unearned greatness is so unreal, so neurotic a concept that the wretch who seeksit cannot identify it even to himself: to identify it, is to make it impossible.He needs the irrational, undefinable slogans of altruism and collectivism togive a semiplausible form to his nameless urge and anchor it to reality—tosupport his own self-deception more than to deceive his victims. “The public,”“the public interest,” “service to the public” are the means, the tools, theswinging pendulums of the power-luster’s self-hypnosis.Since there is no such entity as “the public,” since the public is merely anumber of individuals, any claimed or implied conflict of “the public interest”with private interests means that the interests of some men are to be sacrificedto the interests and wishes of others. Since the concept is so convenientlyundefinable, its use rests only on any given gang’s ability to proclaim that“The public, c’est moi”—and to maintain the claim at the point of a gun.No such claim has ever been or can ever be maintained without the help of agun—that is, without physical force. But, on the other hand, without that claim,gunmen would remain where they belong: in the underworld, and would not rise tothe councils of state to rule the destinies of nations.There are two ways of claiming that “The public, c’est moi”: one is practiced bythe crude material parasite who clamors for government handouts in the name of a“public” need and pockets what he has not earned; the other is practiced by hisleader, the spiritual parasite, who derives his illusion of “greatness”—like afence receiving stolen goods—from the power to dispose of that which he has notearned and from the mystic view of himself as the embodied voice of “thepublic.”Of the two, the material parasite is psychologically healthier and closer toreality: at least, he eats or wears his loot. But the only source ofsatisfaction open to the spiritual parasite, his only means to gain “prestige”(apart from giving orders and spreading terror), is the most wasteful, uselessand meaningless activity of all: the building of public monuments.Greatness is achieved by the productive effort of a man’s mind in the pursuit ofclearly defined, rational goals. But a delusion of grandeur can be served onlyby the switching, undefinable chimera of a public monument—which is presented asa munificent gift to the victims whose forced labor or extorted money had paidfor it—which is dedicated to the service of all and none, owned by all and none,gaped at by all and enjoyed by none.This is the ruler’s only way to appease his obsession: “prestige.” Prestige—inwhose eyes? In anyone’s. In the eyes of his tortured victims, of the beggars inthe streets of his kingdom, of the bootlickers at his court, of the foreigntribes and their rulers beyond the borders. It is to impress all those eyes—theeyes of everyone and no one—that the blood of generations of subjects has beenspilled and spent.One may see, in certain biblical movies, a graphic image of the meaning ofpublic monument building: the building of the pyramids. Hordes of starved,ragged, emaciated men straining the last effort of their inadequate muscles atthe inhuman task of pulling the ropes that drag large chunks of stone, straininglike tortured beasts of burden under the whips of overseers, collapsing on thejob and dying in the desert sands—that a dead Pharaoh might lie in an imposinglysenseless structure and thus gain eternal “prestige” in the eyes of the unbornof future generations.Temples and palaces are the only monuments left of mankind’s earlycivilizations. They were created by the same means and at the same price—a pricenot justified by the fact that primitive peoples undoubtedly believed, whiledying of starvation and exhaustion, that the “prestige” of their tribe, theirrulers or their gods was of value to them somehow.Rome fell, bankrupted by statist controls and taxation, while its emperors werebuilding coliseums. Louis XIV of France taxed his people into a state ofindigence, while he built the palace of Versailles, for his contemporarymonarchs to envy and for modern tourists to visit. The marble-lined Moscowsubway, built by the unpaid “volunteer” labor of Russian workers, includingwomen, is a public monument, and so is the Czarist-like luxury of thechampagne-and-caviar receptions at the Soviet embassies, which is needed—whilethe people stand in line for inadequate food rations—to “maintain the prestigeof the Soviet Union.”The great distinction of the United States of America, up to the last fewdecades, was the modesty of its public monuments. Such monuments as did existwere genuine: they were not erected for “prestige,” but were functionalstructures that had housed events of great historical importance. If you haveseen the austere simplicity of Independence Hall, you have seen the differencebetween authentic grandeur and the pyramids of “public-spirited”prestige-seekers.In America, human effort and material resources were not expropriated for publicmonuments and public projects, but were spent on the progress of the private,personal, individual well-being of individual citizens. America’s greatness liesin the fact that her actual monuments are not public.The skyline of New York is a monument of a splendor that no pyramids or palaceswill ever equal or approach. But America’s skyscrapers were not built by publicfunds nor for a public purpose: they were built by the energy, initiative andwealth of private individuals for personal profit. And, instead of impoverishingthe people, these skyscrapers, as they rose higher and higher, kept raising thepeople’s standard of living—including the inhabitants of the slums, who lead alife of luxury compared to the life of an ancient Egyptian slave or of a modemSoviet Socialist worker.Such is the difference—both in theory and practice—be—tween capitalism andsocialism.It is impossible to compute the human suffering, degradation, deprivation andhorror that went to pay for a single, much-touted skyscraper of Moscow, or forthe Soviet factories or mines or dams, or for any part of theirloot-and-blood-supported “industrialization.” What we do know, however, is thatforty-five years is a long time: it is the span of two generations; we do knowthat, in the name of a promised abundance, two generations of human beings havelived and died in subhuman poverty; and we do know that today’s advocates ofsocialism are not deterred by a fact of this kind.Whatever motive they might assert, benevolence is one they have long since lostthe right to claim.The ideology of socialization (in a neo-fascist form) is now floating, bydefault, through the vacuum of our intellectual and cultural atmosphere. Observehow often we are asked for undefined “sacrifices” to unspecified purposes.Observe how often the present administration is invoking “the public interest.”Observe what prominence the issue of international prestige has suddenlyacquired and what grotesquely suicidal policies are justified by references tomatters of “prestige.” Observe that during the recent Cuban crisis—when thefactual issue concerned nuclear missiles and nuclear war—our diplomats andcommentators found it proper seriously to weigh such things as the “prestige,”the personal feelings and the “face-saving” of the sundry socialist rulersinvolved.There is no difference between the principles, policies and practical results ofsocialism—and those of any historical or prehistorical tyranny. Socialism ismerely democratic absolute monarchy—that is, a system of absolutism without afixed head, open to seizure of power by all comers, by any ruthless climber,opportunist, adventurer, demagogue or thug.When you consider socialism, do not fool yourself about its nature. Rememberthat there is no such dichotomy as “human rights” versus “property rights.” Nohuman rights can exist without property rights. Since material goods areproduced by the mind and effort of individual men, and are needed to sustaintheir lives, if the producer does not own the result of his effort, he does notown his life. To deny property rights means to turn men into property owned bythe state. Whoever claims the “right” to “redistribute” the wealth produced byothers is claiming the “right” to treat human beings as chattel.When you consider the global devastation perpetrated by socialism, the sea ofblood and the millions of victims, remember that they were sacrificed, not for“the good of mankind” nor for any “noble ideal,” but for the festering vanity ofsome scared brute or some pretentious mediocrity who craved a mantle of unearned“greatness”—and that the monument to socialism is a pyramid of public factories,public theaters and public parks, erected on a foundation of human corpses, withthe figure of the ruler posturing on top, beating his chest and screaming hisplea for “prestige” to the starless void above him. (December 1962)"},{"pageContent":"12.Man’s Rightsby Ayn RandIf one wishes to advocate a free society—that is, capitalism—one must realizethat its indispensable foundation is the principle of individual rights. If onewishes to uphold individual rights, one must realize that capitalism is the onlysystem that can uphold and protect them. And if one wishes to gauge therelationship of freedom to the goals of today’s intellectuals, one may gauge itby the fact that the concept of individual rights is evaded, distorted,perverted and seldom discussed, most conspicuously seldom by the so-called“conservatives.”“Rights” are a moral concept—the concept that provides a logical transition fromthe principles guiding an individual’s actions to the principles guiding hisrelationship with others—the concept that preserves and protects individualmorality in a social context—the link between the moral code of a man and thelegal code of a society, between ethics and politics. Individual rights are themeans of subordinating society to moral law.Every political system is based on some code of ethics. The dominant ethics ofmankind’s history were variants of the altruist-collectivist doctrine whichsubordinated the individual to some higher authority, either mystical or social.Consequently, most political systems were variants of the same statist tyranny,differing only in degree, not in basic principle, limited only by the accidentsof tradition, of chaos, of bloody strife and periodic collapse. Under all suchsystems, morality was a code applicable to the individual, but not to society.Society was placed outside the moral law, as its embodiment or source orexclusive interpreter—and the inculcation of self-sacrificial devotion to socialduty was regarded as the main purpose of ethics in man’s earthly existence.Since there is no such entity as “society,” since society is only a number ofindividual men, this meant, in practice, that the rulers of society were exemptfrom moral law; subject only to traditional rituals, they held total power andexacted blind obedience—on the implicit principle of: “The good is that which isgood for society (or for the tribe, the race, the nation), and the ruler’sedicts are its voice on earth.”This was true of all statist systems, under all variants of thealtruist-collectivist ethics, mystical or social. “The Divine Right of Kings”summarizes the political theory of the first—“Vox populi, vox dei” of thesecond. As witness: the theocracy of Egypt, with the Pharaoh as an embodiedgod—the unlimited majority rule or democracy of Athens—the welfare state run bythe Emperors of Rome—the Inquisition of the late Middle Ages—the absolutemonarchy of France—the welfare state of Bismarck’s Prussia—the gas chambers ofNazi Germany—the slaughterhouse of the Soviet Union.All these political systems were expressions of the altruist-collectivistethics—and their common characteristic is the fact that society stood above themoral law, as an omnipotent, sovereign whim worshiper. Thus, politically, allthese systems were variants of an amoral society.The most profoundly revolutionary achievement of the United States of Americawas the subordination of society to moral law.The principle of man’s individual rights represented the extension of moralityinto the social system—as a limitation on the power of the state, as man’sprotection against the brute force of the collective, as the subordination ofmight to right. The United States was the first moral society in history.All previous systems had regarded man as a sacrificial means to the ends ofothers, and society as an end in itself. The United States regarded man as anend in himself, and society as a means to the peaceful, orderly, voluntaryco-existence of individuals. All previous systems had held that man’s lifebelongs to society, that society can dispose of him in any way it pleases, andthat any freedom he enjoys is his only by favor, by the permission of society,which may be revoked at any time. The United States held that man’s life is hisby right (which means: by moral principle and by his nature), that a right isthe property of an individual, that society as such has no rights, and that theonly moral purpose of a government is the protection of individual rights.A “right” is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom ofaction in a social context. There is only one fundamental right (all the othersare its consequences or corollaries): a man’s right to his own life. Life is aprocess of self-sustaining and self-generated action; the right to life meansthe right to engage in self-sustaining and self-generated action—which means:the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a rational beingfor the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the enjoyment of his ownlife. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit ofhappiness.)The concept of a “right” pertains only to action—specifically, to freedom ofaction. It means freedom from physical compulsion, coercion or interference byother men.Thus, for every individual, a right is the moral sanction of a positive—of hisfreedom to act on his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary,uncoerced choice. As to his neighbors, his rights impose no obligations on themexcept of a negative kind: to abstain from violating his rights.The right to life is the source of all rights—and the right to property is theironly implementation. Without property rights, no other rights are possible.Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man who has no right tothe product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. The man who produceswhile others dispose of his product, is a slave.Bear in mind that the right to property is a right to action, like all theothers: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequencesof producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earnany property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is theright to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values.The concept of individual rights is so new in human history that most men havenot grasped it fully to this day. In accordance with the two theories of ethics,the mystical or the social, some men assert that rights are a gift ofGod—others, that rights are a gift of society. But, in fact, the source ofrights is man’s nature.The Declaration of Independence stated that men “are endowed by their Creatorwith certain unalienable rights.” Whether one believes that man is the productof a Creator or of nature, the issue of man’s origin does not alter the factthat he is an entity of a specific kind—a rational being—that he cannot functionsuccessfully under coercion, and that rights are a necessary condition of hisparticular mode of survival.“The source of man’s rights is not divine law or congressional law, but the lawof identity. A is A—and Man is Man. Rights are conditions of existence requiredby man’s nature for his proper survival. If man is to live on earth, it is rightfor him to use his mind, it is right to act on his own free judgment, it isright to work for his values and to keep the product of his work. If life onearth is his purpose, he has a right to live as a rational being: nature forbidshim the irrational.” (Atlas Shrugged.)To violate man’s rights means to compel him to act against his own judgment, orto expropriate his values. Basically, there is only one way to do it: by the useof physical force. There are two potential violators of man’s rights: thecriminals and the government. The great achievement of the United States was todraw a distinction between these two—by forbidding to the second the legalizedversion of the activities of the first.The Declaration of Independence laid down the principle that “to secure theserights, governments are instituted among men.” This provided the only validjustification of a government and defined its only proper purpose: to protectman’s rights by protecting him from physical violence.Thus the government’s function was changed from the role of ruler to the role ofservant. The government was set to protect man from criminals—and theConstitution was written to protect man from the government. The Bill of Rightswas not directed against private citizens, but against the government—as anexplicit declaration that individual rights supersede any public or socialpower.The result was the pattern of a civilized society which—for the brief span ofsome hundred and fifty years—America came close to achieving. A civilizedsociety is one in which physical force is banned from human relationships—inwhich the government, acting as a policeman, may use force only in retaliationand only against those who initiate its use.This was the essential meaning and intent of America’s political philosophy,implicit in the principle of individual rights. But it was not formulatedexplicitly, nor fully accepted nor consistently practiced.America’s inner contradiction was the altruist-collectivist ethics. Altruism isincompatible with freedom, with capitalism and with individual rights. Onecannot combine the pursuit of happiness with the moral status of a sacrificialanimal.It was the concept of individual rights that had given birth to a free society.It was with the destruction of individual rights that the destruction of freedomhad to begin.A collectivist tyranny dare not enslave a country by an outright confiscation ofits values, material or moral. It has to be done by a process of internalcorruption. Just as in the material realm the plundering of a country’s wealthis accomplished by inflating the currency—so today one may witness the processof inflation being applied to the realm of rights. The process entails such agrowth of newly promulgated “rights” that people do not notice the fact that themeaning of the concept is being reversed. Just as bad money drives out goodmoney, so these “printing-press rights” negate authentic rights.Consider the curious fact that never has there been such a proliferation, allover the world, of two contradictory phenomena: of alleged new “rights” and ofslave-labor camps.The “gimmick” was the switch of the concept of rights from the political to theeconomic realm.The Democratic Party platform of 1960 summarizes the switch boldly andexplicitly. It declares that a Democratic Administration “will reaffirm theeconomic bill of rights which Franklin Roosevelt wrote into our nationalconscience sixteen years ago.”Bear clearly in mind the meaning of the concept of “rights” when you read thelist which that platform offers:“1. The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops orfarms or mines of the nation.“2. The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing andrecreation.“3. The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return whichwill give him and his family a decent living.“4. The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphereof freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home andabroad.“5. The right of every family to a decent home.“6. The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoygood health.“7. The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age,sickness, accidents and unemployment.“8. The right to a good education.”A single question added to each of the above eight clauses would make the issueclear: At whose expense?Jobs, food, clothing, recreation (!), homes, medical care, education, etc., donot grow in nature. These are man-made values—goods and services produced bymen. Who is to provide them?If some men are entitled by right to the products of the work of others, itmeans that those others are deprived of rights and condemned to slave labor.Any alleged “right” of one man, which necessitates the violation of the rightsof another, is not and cannot be a right.No man can have a right to impose an unchosen obligation, an unrewarded duty oran involuntary servitude on another man. There can be no such thing as “theright to enslave. ”A right does not include the material implementation of that right by other men;it includes only the freedom to earn that implementation by one’s own effort.Observe, in this context, the intellectual precision of the Founding Fathers:they spoke of the right to the pursuit of happiness—not of the right tohappiness. It means that a man has the right to take the actions he deemsnecessary to achieve his happiness; it does not mean that others must make himhappy.The right to life means that a man has the right to support his life by his ownwork (on any economic level, as high as his ability will carry him); it does notmean that others must provide him with the necessities of life.The right to property means that a man has the right to take the economicactions necessary to earn property, to use it and to dispose of it; it does notmean that others must provide him with property.The right of free speech means that a man has the right to express his ideaswithout danger of suppression, interference or punitive action by thegovernment. It does not mean that others must provide him with a lecture hall, aradio station or a printing press through which to express his ideas.Any undertaking that involves more than one man, requires the voluntary consentof every participant. Every one of them has the right to make his own decision,but none has the right to force his decision on the others.There is no such thing as “a right to a job”—there is only the right of freetrade, that is: a man’s right to take a job if another man chooses to hire him.There is no “right to a home,” only the right of free trade: the right to builda home or to buy it. There are no “rights to a ‘fair’ wage or a ‘fair’ price” ifno one chooses to pay it, to hire a man or to buy his product. There are no“rights of consumers” to milk, shoes, movies or champagne if no producers chooseto manufacture such items (there is only the right to manufacture them oneself).There are no “rights” of special groups, there are no “rights of farmers, ofworkers, of businessmen, of employees, of employers, of the old, of the young,of the unborn.” There are only the Rights of Man— rights possessed by everyindividual man and by all men as individuals.Property rights and the right of free trade are man’s only “economic rights”(they are, in fact, political rights)—and there can be no such thing as “aneconomic bill of rights.” But observe that the advocates of the latter have allbut destroyed the former.Remember that rights are moral principles which define and protect a man’sfreedom of action, but impose no obligations on other men. Private citizens arenot a threat to one another’s rights or freedom. A private citizen who resortsto physical force and violates the rights of others is a criminal—and men havelegal protection against him.Criminals are a small minority in any age or country. And the harm they havedone to mankind is infinitesimal when compared to the horrors—the bloodshed, thewars, the persecutions, the confiscations, the famines, the enslavements, thewholesale destructions—perpetrated by mankind’s governments. Potentially, agovernment is the most dangerous threat to man’s rights: it holds a legalmonopoly on the use of physical force against legally disarmed victims. Whenunlimited and unrestricted by individual rights, a government is men’s deadliestenemy. It is not as protection against private actions, but against governmentalactions that the Bill of Rights was written.Now observe the process by which that protection is being destroyed.The process consists of ascribing to private citizens the specific violationsconstitutionally forbidden to the government (which private citizens have nopower to commit) and thus freeing the government from all restrictions. Theswitch is becoming progressively more obvious in the field of free speech. Foryears, the collectivists have been propagating the notion that a privateindividual’s refusal to finance an opponent is a violation of the opponent’sright of free speech and an act of “censorship.”It is “censorship,” they claim, if a newspaper refuses to employ or publishwriters whose ideas are diametrically opposed to its policy.It is “censorship,” they claim, if businessmen refuse to advertise in a magazinethat denounces, insults and smears them.It is “censorship,” they claim, if a TV sponsor objects to some outrageperpetrated on a program he is financing—such as the incident of Alger Hissbeing invited to denounce former Vice-President Nixon.And then there is Newton N. Minow who declares: “There is censorship by ratings,by advertisers, by networks, by affiliates which reject programming offered totheir areas.” It is the same Mr. Minow who threatens to revoke the license ofany station that does not comply with his views on programming—and who claimsthat that is not censorship.Consider the implications of such a trend.“Censorship” is a term pertaining only to governmental action. No private actionis censorship. No private individual or agency can silence a man or suppress apublication; only the government can do so. The freedom of speech of privateindividuals includes the right not to agree, not to listen and not to financeone’s own antagonists.But according to such doctrines as the “economic bill of rights,” an individualhas no right to dispose of his own material means by the guidance of his ownconvictions—and must hand over his money indiscriminately to any speakers orpropagandists, who have a “right” to his property.This means that the ability to provide the material tools for the expression ofideas deprives a man of the right to hold any ideas. It means that a publisherhas to publish books he considers worthless, false or evil—that a TV sponsor hasto finance commentators who choose to affront his convictions—that the owner ofa newspaper must turn his editorial pages over to any young hooligan who clamorsfor the enslavement of the press. It means that one group of men acquires the“right” to unlimited license—while another group is reduced to helplessirresponsibility.But since it is obviously impossible to provide every claimant with a job, amicrophone or a newspaper column, who will determine the “distribution” of“economic rights” and select the recipients, when the owners’ right to choosehas been abolished? Well, Mr. Minow has indicated that quite clearly.And if you make the mistake of thinking that this applies only to big propertyowners, you had better realize that the theory of “economic rights” includes the“right” of every would-be playwright, every beatnik poet, every noise-composerand every nonobjective artist (who have political pull) to the financial supportyou did not give them when you did not attend their shows. What else is themeaning of the project to spend your tax money on subsidized art?And while people are clamoring about “economic rights,” the concept of politicalrights is vanishing. It is forgotten that the right of free speech means thefreedom to advocate one’s views and to bear the possible consequences, includingdisagreement with others, opposition, unpopularity and lack of support. Thepolitical function of “the right of free speech” is to protect dissenters andunpopular minorities from forcible suppression—not to guarantee them thesupport, advantages and rewards of a popularity they have not gained.The Bill of Rights reads: “Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedomof speech, or of the press ...” It does not demand that private citizens providea microphone for the man who advocates their destruction, or a passkey for theburglar who seeks to rob them, or a knife for the murderer who wants to cuttheir throats.Such is the state of one of today’s most crucial issues: political rights versus“economic rights.” It’s either-or. One destroys the other. But there are, infact, no “economic rights,” no “collective rights,” no “public-interest rights.”The term “individual rights” is a redundancy: there is no other kind of rightsand no one else to possess them.Those who advocate laissez-faire capitalism are the only advocates of man’srights. (April 1963)"},{"pageContent":"13.Collectivized “Rights”by Ayn RandRights are a moral principle defining proper social relationships. Just as a manneeds a moral code in order to survive (in order to act, to choose the rightgoals and to achieve them), so a society (a group of men) needs moral principlesin order to organize a social system consonant with man’s nature and with therequirements of his survival.Just as a man can evade reality and act on the blind whim of any given moment,but can achieve nothing save progressive self-destruction—so a society can evadereality and establish a system ruled by the blind whims of its members or itsleader, by the majority gang of any given moment, by the current demagogue or bya permanent dictator. But such a society can achieve nothing save the rule ofbrute force and a state of progressive self-destruction.What subjectivism is in the realm of ethics, collectivism is in the realm ofpolitics. Just as the notion that “Anything I do is right because I chose to doit,” is not a moral principle, but a negation of morality—so the notion that“Anything society does is right because society chose to do it,” is not a moralprinciple, but a negation of moral principles and the banishment of moralityfrom social issues.When “might” is opposed to “right,” the concept of “might” can have only onemeaning: the power of brute, physical force—which, in fact, is not a “power” butthe most hopeless state of impotence; it is merely the “power” to destroy; it isthe “power” of a stampede of animals running amuck.Yet that is the goal of most of today’s intellectuals. At the root of all theirconceptual switches, there lies another, more fundamental one: the switch of theconcept of rights from the individual to the collective—which means: thereplacement of “The Rights of Man” by “The Rights of Mob.”Since only an individual man can possess rights, the expression “individualrights” is a redundancy (which one has to use for purposes of clarification intoday’s intellectual chaos). But the expression “collective rights” is acontradiction in terms.Any group or “collective,” large or small, is only a number of individuals. Agroup can have no rights other than the rights of its individual members. In afree society, the “rights” of any group are derived from the rights of itsmembers through their voluntary, individual choice and contractual agreement,and are merely the application of these individual rights to a specificundertaking. Every legitimate group undertaking is based on the participants’right of free association and free trade. (By “legitimate,” I mean: noncriminaland freely formed, that is, a group which no one was forced to join.)For instance, the right of an industrial concern to engage in business isderived from the right of its owners to invest their money in a productiveventure—from their right to hire employees—from the right of the employees tosell their services—from the right of all those involved to produce and to selltheir products—from the right of the customers to buy (or not to buy) thoseproducts. Every link of this complex chain of contractual relationships rests onindividual rights, individual choices, individual agreements. Every agreement isdelimited, specified and subject to certain conditions, that is, dependent upona mutual trade to mutual benefit.This is true of all legitimate groups or associations in a free society:partnerships, business concerns, professional associations, labor unions(voluntary ones), political parties, etc. It applies also to all agencyagreements: the right of one man to act for or represent another or others isderived from the rights of those he represents and is delegated to him by theirvoluntary choice, for a specific, delimited purpose—as in the case of a lawyer,a business representative, a labor union delegate, etc.A group, as such, has no rights. A man can neither acquire new rights by joininga group nor lose the rights which he does possess. The principle of individualrights is the only moral base of all groups or associations.Any group that does not recognize this principle is not an association, but agang or a mob.Any doctrine of group activities that does not recognize individual rights is adoctrine of mob rule or legalized lynching.The notion of “collective rights” (the notion that rights belong to groups, notto individuals) means that “rights” belong to some men, but not to others—thatsome men have the “right” to dispose of others in any manner they please—andthat the criterion of such privileged position consists of numericalsuperiority.Nothing can ever justify or validate such a doctrine—and no one ever has. Likethe altruist morality from which it is derived, this doctrine rests onmysticism: either on the old-fashioned mysticism of faith in supernaturaledicts, like “The Divine Right of Kings”—or on the social mystique of modemcollectivists who see society as a super-organism, as some supernatural entityapart from and superior to the sum of its individual members.The amorality of that collectivist mystique is particularly obvious today in theissue of national rights.A nation, like any other group, is only a number of individuals and can have norights other than the rights of its individual citizens. A free nation—a nationthat recognizes, respects and protects the individual rights of its citizens—hasa right to its territorial integrity, its social system and its form ofgovernment. The government of such a nation is not the ruler, but the servant oragent of its citizens and has no rights other than the rights delegated to it bythe citizens for a specific, delimited task (the task of protecting them fromphysical force, derived from their right of self-defense).The citizens of a free nation may disagree about the specific legal proceduresor methods of implementing their rights (which is a complex problem, theprovince of political science and of the philosophy of law), but they agree onthe basic principle to be implemented: the principle of individual rights. Whena country’s constitution places individual rights outside the reach of publicauthorities, the sphere of political power is severely delimited—and thus thecitizens may, safely and properly, agree to abide by the decisions of a majorityvote in this delimited sphere. The lives and property of minorities ordissenters are not at stake, are not subject to vote and are not endangered byany majority decision; no man or group holds a blank check on power over others.Such a nation has a right to its sovereignty (derived from the rights of itscitizens) and a right to demand that its sovereignty be respected by all othernations.But this right cannot be claimed by dictatorships, by savage tribes or by anyform of absolutist tyranny. A nation that violates the rights of its owncitizens cannot claim any rights whatsoever. In the issue of rights, as in allmoral issues, there can be no double standard. A nation ruled by brute physicalforce is not a nation, but a horde—whether it is led by Attila, Genghis Khan,Hitler, Khrushchev or Castro. What rights could Attila claim and on whatgrounds?This applies to all forms of tribal savagery, ancient or modern, primitive or“industrialized.” Neither geography nor race nor tradition nor previous state ofdevelopment can confer on some human beings the “right” to violate the rights ofothers.The right of “the self-determination of nations” applies only to free societiesor to societies seeking to establish freedom; it does not apply todictatorships. Just as an individual’s right of free action does not include the“right” to commit crimes (that is, to violate the rights of others), so theright of a nation to determine its own form of government does not include theright to establish a slave society (that is, to legalize the enslavement of somemen by others). There is no such thing as “the right to enslave.” A nation cando it, just as a man can become a criminal—but neither can do it by right.It does not matter, in this context, whether a nation was enslaved by force,like Soviet Russia, or by vote, like Nazi Germany. Individual rights are notsubject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of aminority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minoritiesfrom oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is theindividual). Whether a slave society was conquered or chose to be enslaved, itcan claim no national rights and no recognition of such “rights” by civilizedcountries—just as a mob of gangsters cannot demand a recognition of its “rights”and a legal equality with an industrial concern or a university, on the groundthat the gangsters chose by unanimous vote to engage in that particular kind ofgroup activity.Dictatorship nations are outlaws. Any free nation had the right to invade NaziGermany and, today, has the right to invade Soviet Russia, Cuba or any otherslave pen. Whether a free nation chooses to do so or not is a matter of its ownself-interest, not of respect for the nonexistent “rights” of gang rulers. It isnot a free nation’s duty to liberate other nations at the price ofself-sacrifice, but a free nation has the right to do it, when and if it sochooses.This right, however, is conditional. Just as the suppression of crimes does notgive a policeman the right to engage in criminal activities, so the invasion anddestruction of a dictatorship does not give the invader the right to establishanother variant of a slave society in the conquered country.A slave country has no national rights, but the individual rights of itscitizens remain valid, even if unrecognized, and the conqueror has no right toviolate them. Therefore, the invasion of an enslaved country is morallyjustified only when and if the conquerors establish a free social system, thatis, a system based on the recognition of individual rights.Since there is no fully free country today, since the so-called “Free World”consists of various “mixed economies,” it might be asked whether every countryon earth is morally open to invasion by every other. The answer is: No. There isa difference between a country that recognizes the principle of individualrights, but does not implement it fully in practice, and a country that deniesand flouts it explicitly. All “mixed economies” are in a precarious state oftransition which, ultimately, has to turn to freedom or collapse intodictatorship. There are four characteristics which brand a country unmistakablyas a dictatorship: one-party rule—executions without trial or with a mock trial,for political offenses—the nationalization or expropriation of privateproperty—and censorship. A country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moralprerogatives, any claim to national rights or sovereignty, and becomes anoutlaw.Observe, on this particular issue, the shameful end-of- , trail and theintellectual disintegration of modem “liberals.”Internationalism had always been one of the “liberals’ ” basic tenets. Theyregarded nationalism as a major social evil, as a product of capitalism and asthe cause of wars. They opposed any form of national self-interest; they refusedto differentiate between rational patriotism and blind, racist chauvinism,denouncing both as “fascist.” They advocated the dissolution of nationalboundaries and the merging of all nations into “One World.” Next to propertyrights, “national rights” were the special target of their attacks.Today, it is “national rights” that they invoke as their last, feeble, fadinghold on some sort of moral justification for the results of their theories—forthe brood of little statist dictatorships spreading, like a skin disease, overthe surface of the globe, in the form of so-called “newly emerging nations,”semi-socialist, semi-communist, semi-fascist, and wholly committed only to theuse of brute force.It is the “national right” of such countries to choose their own form ofgovernment (any form they please) that the “liberals” offer as a moralvalidation and ask us to respect. It is the “national right” of Cuba to its formof government, they claim, that we must not violate or interfere with. Havingall but destroyed the legitimate national rights of free countries, it is fordictatorships that the “liberals” now claim the sanction of “national rights.”And worse: it is not mere nationalism that the “liberals” champion, butracism—primordial tribal racism.Observe the double standard: while, in the civilized countries of the West, the“liberals” are still advocating internationalism and global self-sacrifice-thesavage tribes of Asia and Africa are granted the sovereign “right” to slaughterone another in racial warfare. Mankind is reverting to a pre-industrial,prehistorical view of society: to racial collectivism.Such is the logical result and climax of the “liberals’ ” moral collapse whichbegan when, as a prelude to the collectivization of property, they accepted thecollectivization of rights.Their own confession of guilt lies in their terminology. Why do they use theword “rights” to denote the things they are advocating? Why don’t they preachwhat they practice? Why don’t they name it openly and attempt to justify it, ifthey can?The answer is obvious. (June 1963)"},{"pageContent":"14.The Nature of Governmentby Ayn RandA government is an institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce certainrules of social conduct in a given geographical area.Do men need such an institution—and why?Since man’s mind is his basic tool of survival, his means of gaining knowledgeto guide his actions—the basic condition he requires is the freedom to think andto act according to his rational judgment. This does not mean that a man mustlive alone and that a desert island is the environment best suited to his needs.Men can derive enormous benefits from dealing with one another. A socialenvironment is most conducive to their successful survival—but only on certainconditions.“The two great values to be gained from social existence are: knowledge andtrade. Man is the only species that can transmit and expand his store ofknowledge from generation to generation; the knowledge potentially available toman is greater than any one man could begin to acquire in his own lifespan;every man gains an incalculable benefit from the knowledge discovered by others.The second great benefit is the division of labor: it enables a man to devotehis effort to a particular field of work and to trade with others who specializein other fields. This form of cooperation allows all men who take part in it toachieve a greater knowledge, skill and productive return on their effort thanthey could achieve if each had to produce everything he needs, on a desertisland or on a self-sustaining farm.“But these very benefits indicate, delimit and define what kind of men can be ofvalue to one another and in what kind of society: only rational, productive,independent men in a rational, productive, free society.” (“The ObjectivistEthics.”)A society that robs an individual of the product of his effort, or enslaves him,or attempts to limit the freedom of his mind; or compels him to act against hisown rational judgment—a society that sets up a conflict between its edicts andthe requirements of man’s nature—is not, strictly speaking, a society, but a mobheld together by institutionalized gang-rule. Such a society destroys all thevalues of human coexistence, has no possible justification and represents, not asource of benefits, but the deadliest threat to man’s survival. Life on a desertisland is safer than and incomparably preferable to existence in Soviet Russiaor Nazi Germany.If men are to live together in a peaceful, productive, rational society and dealwith one another to mutual benefit, they must accept the basic social principlewithout which no moral or civilized society is possible: the principle ofindividual rights. (See Chapters 12 and 13.)To recognize individual rights means to recognize and accept the conditionsrequired by man’s nature for his proper survival.Man’s rights can be violated only by the use of physical force. It is only bymeans of physical force that one man can deprive another of his life, or enslavehim, or rob him, or prevent him from pursuing his own goals, or compel him toact against his own rational judgment.The precondition of a civilized society is the barring of physical force fromsocial relationships—thus establishing the principle that if men wish to dealwith one another, they may do so only by means of reason: by discussion,persuasion and voluntary, uncoerced agreement.The necessary consequence of man’s right to life is his right to self-defense.In a civilized society, force may be used only in retaliation and only againstthose who initiate its use. All the reasons which make the initiation ofphysical force an evil, make the retaliatory use of physical force a moralimperative.If some “pacifist” society renounced the retaliatory use of force, it would beleft helplessly at the mercy of the first thug who decided to be immoral. Such asociety would achieve the opposite of its intention: instead of abolishing evil,it would encourage and reward it.If a society provided no organized protection against force, it would compelevery citizen to go about armed, to turn his home into a fortress, to shoot anystrangers approaching his door—or to join a protective gang of citizens whowould fight other gangs, formed for the same purpose, and thus bring about thedegeneration of that society into the chaos of gang-rule, i.e., rule by bruteforce, into perpetual tribal warfare of prehistorical savages.The use of physical force—even its retaliatory use—cannot be left at thediscretion of individual citizens. Peaceful coexistence is impossible if a manhas to live under the constant threat of force to be unleashed against him byany of his neighbors at any moment. Whether his neighbors’ intentions are goodor bad, whether their judgment is rational or irrational, whether they aremotivated by a sense of justice or by ignorance or by prejudice or by malice—theuse of force against one man cannot be left to the arbitrary decision ofanother.Visualize, for example, what would happen if a man missed his wallet, concludedthat he had been robbed, broke into every house in the neighborhood to searchit, and shot the first man who gave him a dirty look, taking the look to be aproof of guilt.The retaliatory use of force requires objective rules of evidence to establishthat a crime has been committed and to prove who committed it, as well asobjective rules to define punishments and enforcement procedures. Men whoattempt to prosecute crimes, without such rules, are a lynch mob. If a societyleft the retaliatory use of force in the hands of individual citizens, it woulddegenerate into mob rule, lynch law and an endless series of bloody privatefeuds or vendettas.If physical force is to be barred from social relationships, men need aninstitution charged with the task of protecting their rights under an objectivecode of rules.This is the task of a government—of a proper government—its basic task, is onlymoral justification and the reason why men do need a government.A government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force underobjective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws.The fundamental difference between private action and governmental action—adifference thoroughly ignored and evaded today—lies in the fact that agovernment holds a monopoly on the legal use of physical force. It has to holdsuch a monopoly, since it is the agent of restraining and combating the use offorce; and for that very same reason, its actions have to be rigidly defined,delimited and circumscribed; no touch of whim or caprice should be permitted inits performance; it should be an impersonal robot, with the laws as its onlymotive power. If a society is to be free, its government has to be controlled.Under a proper social system, a private individual is legally free to take anyaction he pleases (so long as he does not violate the rights of others), while agovernment official is bound by law in his every official act. A privateindividual may do anything except that which is legally forbidden; a governmentofficial may do nothing except that which is legally permitted.This is the means of subordinating “might” to “right.” This is the Americanconcept of “a government of laws and not of men.”The nature of the laws proper to a free society and the source of itsgovernment’s authority are both to be derived from the nature and purpose of aproper government. The basic principle of both is indicated in The Declarationof Independence: “to secure these [individual] rights, governments areinstituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of thegoverned ...”Since the protection of individual rights is the only proper purpose of agovernment, it is the only proper subject of legislation: all laws must be basedon individual rights and aimed at their protection. All laws must be objective(and objectively justifiable): men must know clearly, and in advance of takingan action, what the law forbids them to do (and why), what constitutes a crimeand what penalty they will incur if they commit it.The source of the government’s authority is “the consent of the governed.” Thismeans that the government is not the ruler, but the servant or agent of thecitizens; it means that the government as such has no rights except the rightsdelegated to it by the citizens for a specific purpose.There is only one basic principle to which an individual must consent if hewishes to live in a free, civilized society: the principle of renouncing the useof physical force and delegating to the government his right of physicalself-defense, for the purpose of an orderly, objective, legally definedenforcement. Or, to put it another way, he must accept the separation of forceand whim (any whim, including his own).Now what happens in case of a disagreement between two men about an undertakingin which both are involved?In a free society, men are not forced to deal with one another. They do so onlyby voluntary agreement and, when a time element is involved, by contract. If acontract is broken by the arbitrary decision of one man, it may cause adisastrous financial injury to the other—and the victim would have no recourseexcept to seize the offender’s property as compensation. But here again, the useof force cannot be left to the decision of private individuals. And this leadsto one of the most important and most complex functions of the government: tothe function of an arbiter who settles disputes among men according to objectivelaws.Criminals are a small minority in any semicivilized society. But the protectionand enforcement of contracts through courts of civil law is the most crucialneed of a peaceful society; without such protection, no civilization could bedeveloped or maintained.Man cannot survive, as animals do, by acting on the range of the immediatemoment. Man has to project his goals and achieve them across a span of time; hehas to calculate his actions and plan his life long-range. The better a man’smind and the greater his knowledge, the longer the range of his planning. Thehigher or more complex a civilization, the longer the range of activity itrequires—and, therefore, the longer the range of contractual agreements amongmen, and the more urgent their need of protection for the security of suchagreements.Even a primitive barter society could not function if a man agreed to trade abushel of potatoes for a basket of eggs and, having received the eggs, refusedto deliver the potatoes. Visualize what this sort of whim-directed action wouldmean in an industrial society where men deliver a billion dollars’ worth ofgoods on credit, or contract to build multimillion-dollar structures, or signninety-nine-year leases.A unilateral breach of contract involves an indirect use of physical force: itconsists, in essence, of one man receiving the material values, goods orservices of another, then refusing to pay for them and thus keeping them byforce (by mere physical possession), not by right—i.e., keeping them without theconsent of their owner. Fraud involves a similarly indirect use of force: itconsists of obtaining material values without their owner’s consent, under falsepretenses or false promises. Extortion is another variant of an indirect use offorce: it consists of obtaining material values, not in exchange for values, butby the threat of force, violence or injury.Some of these actions are obviously criminal. Others, such as a unilateralbreach of contract, may not be criminally motivated, but may be caused byirresponsibility and irrationality. Still others may be complex issues with someclaim to justice on both sides. But whatever the case may be, all such issueshave to be made subject to objectively defined laws and have to be resolved byan impartial arbiter, administering the laws, i.e., by a judge (and a jury, whenappropriate).Observe the basic principle governing justice in all these cases: it is theprinciple that no man may obtain any values from others without the owners’consent—and, as a corollary, that a man’s rights may not be left at the mercy ofthe unilateral decision, the arbitrary choice, the irrationality, the whim ofanother man.Such, in essence, is the proper purpose of a government: to make socialexistence possible to men, by protecting the benefits and combating the evilswhich men can cause to one another.The proper functions of a government fall into three broad categories, all ofthem involving the issues of physical force and the protection of men’s rights:the police, to protect men from criminals—the armed services, to protect menfrom foreign invaders—the law courts, to settle disputes among men according toobjective laws.These three categories involve many corollary and derivative issues—and theirimplementation in practice, in the form of specific legislation, is enormouslycomplex. It belongs to the field of a special science: the philosophy of law.Many errors and many disagreements are possible in the field of implementation,but what is essential here is the principle to be implemented: the principlethat the purpose of law and of government is the protection of individualrights.Today, this principle is forgotten, ignored and evaded. The result is thepresent state of the world, with mankind’s retrogression to the lawlessness ofabsolutist tyranny, to the primitive savagery of rule by brute force.In unthinking protest against this trend, some people are raising the questionof whether government as such is evil by nature and whether anarchy is the idealsocial system. Anarchy, as a political concept, is a naive floating abstraction:for all the reasons discussed above, a society without an organized governmentwould be at the mercy of the first criminal who came along and who wouldprecipitate it into the chaos of gang warfare. But the possibility of humanimmorality is not the only objection to anarchy: even a society whose everymember were fully rational and faultlessly moral, could not function in a stateof anarchy; it is the need of objective laws and of an arbiter for honestdisagreements among men that necessitates the establishment of a government.A recent variant of anarchistic theory, which is befuddling some of the youngeradvocates of freedom, is a weird absurdity called “competing governments.”Accepting the basic premise of the modern statists—who see no difference betweenthe functions of government and the functions of industry, between force andproduction, and who advocate government ownership of business—the proponents of“competing governments” take the other side of the same coin and declare thatsince competition is so beneficial to business, it should also be applied togovernment. Instead of a single, monopolistic government, they declare, thereshould be a number of different governments in the same geographical area,competing for the allegiance of individual citizens, with every citizen free to“shop” and to patronize whatever government he chooses.Remember that forcible restraint of men is the only service a government has tooffer. Ask yourself what a competition in forcible restraint would have to mean.One cannot call this theory a contradiction in terms, since it is obviouslydevoid of any understanding of the terms “competition” and “government.” Nor canone call it a floating abstraction, since it is devoid of any contact with orreference to reality and cannot be concretized at all, not even roughly orapproximately. One illustration will be sufficient: suppose Mr. Smith, acustomer of Government A, suspects that his next-door neighbor, Mr. Jones, acustomer of Government B, has robbed him; a squad of Police A proceeds to Mr.Jones’ house and is met at the door by a squad of Police B, who declare thatthey do not accept the validity of Mr. Smith’s complaint and do not recognizethe authority of Government A. What happens then? You take it from there.The evolution of the concept of “government” has had a long, tortuous history.Some glimmer of the government’s proper function seems to have existed in everyorganized society, manifesting itself in such phenomena as the recognition ofsome implicit (if often nonexistent) difference between a government and arobber gang—the aura of respect and of moral authority granted to the governmentas the guardian of “law and order”—the fact that even the most evil types ofgovernment found it necessary to maintain some semblance of order and somepretense at justice, if only by routine and tradition, and to claim some sort ofmoral justification for their power, of a mystical or social nature. Just as theabsolute monarchs of France had to invoke “The Divine Right of Kings,” so themodem dictators of Soviet Russia have to spend fortunes on propaganda to justifytheir rule in the eyes of their enslaved subjects.In mankind’s history, the understanding of the government’s proper function is avery recent achievement: it is only two hundred years old and it dates from theFounding Fathers of the American Revolution. Not only did they identify thenature and the needs of a free society, but they devised the means to translateit into practice. A free society—like any other human product—cannot be achievedby random means, by mere wishing or by the leaders’ “good intentions.” A complexlegal system, based on objectively valid principles, is required to make asociety free and to keep it free—a system that does not depend on the motives,the moral character or the intentions of any given official, a system thatleaves no opportunity, no legal loophole for the development of tyranny.The American system of checks and balances was just such an achievement. Andalthough certain contradictions in the Constitution did leave a loophole for thegrowth of statism, the incomparable achievement was the concept of aconstitution as a means of limiting and restricting the power of the government.Today, when a concerted effort is made to obliterate this point, it cannot berepeated too often that the Constitution is a limitation on the government, noton private individuals—that it does not prescribe the conduct of privateindividuals, only the conduct of the government—that it is not a charter forgovernment power, but a charter of the citizens’ protection against thegovernment.Now consider the extent of the moral and political inversion in today’sprevalent view of government. Instead of being a protector of man’s rights, thegovernment is becoming their most dangerous violator; instead of guardingfreedom, the government is establishing slavery; instead of protecting men fromthe initiators of physical force, the government is initiating physical forceand coercion in any manner and issue it pleases; instead of serving as theinstrument of objectivity in human relationships, the government is creating adeadly, subterranean reign of uncertainty and fear, by means of nonobjectivelaws whose interpretation is left to the arbitrary decisions of randombureaucrats; instead of protecting men from injury by whim, the government isarrogating to itself the power of unlimited whim—so that we are fast approachingthe stage of the ultimate inversion: the stage where the government is free todo anything it pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission; which isthe stage of the darkest periods of human history, the stage of rule by bruteforce.It has often been remarked that in spite of its material progress, mankind hasnot achieved any comparable degree of moral progress. That remark is usuallyfollowed by some pessimistic conclusion about human nature. It is true that themoral state of mankind is disgracefully low. But if one considers the monstrousmoral inversions of the governments (made possible by the altruist-collectivistmorality) under which mankind has had to live through most of its history, onebegins to wonder how men have managed to preserve even a semblance ofcivilization, and what indestructible vestige of self-esteem has kept themwalking upright on two feet.One also begins to see more clearly the nature of the political principles thathave to be accepted and advocated, as part of the battle for man’s intellectualRenaissance. (December 1963)"},{"pageContent":"15.Government Financing in a Free Societyby Ayn Rand“What would be the proper method of financing the government in a fully freesociety?”This question is usually asked in connection with the Objectivist principle thatthe government of a free society may not initiate the use of physical force andmay use force only in retaliation against those who initiate its use. Since theimposition of taxes does represent an initiation of force, how, it is asked,would the government of a free country raise the money needed to finance itsproper services?In a fully free society, taxation—or, to be exact, payment for governmentalservices—would be voluntary. Since the proper services of a government—thepolice, the armed forces, the law courts—are demonstrably needed by individualcitizens and affect their interests directly, the citizens would (and should) bewilling to pay for such services, as they pay for insurance.The question of how to implement the principle of voluntary governmentfinancing—how to determine the best means of applying it in practice—is a verycomplex one and belongs to the field of the philosophy of law. The task ofpolitical philosophy is only to establish the nature of the principle and todemonstrate that it is practicable. The choice of a specific method ofimplementation is more than premature today—since the principle will bepracticable only in a fully free society, a society whose government has beenconstitutionally reduced to its proper, basic functions. (For a discussion ofthese functions, see Chapter 14.)There are many possible methods of voluntary government financing. A governmentlottery, which has been used in some European countries, is one such method.There are others.As an illustration (and only as an illustration), consider the followingpossibility. One of the most vitally needed services, which only a governmentcan render, is the protection of contractual agreements among citizens. Supposethat the government were to protect—i.e., to recognize as legally valid andenforceable—only those contracts which had been insured by the payment, to thegovernment, of a premium in the amount of a legally fixed percentage of the sumsinvolved in the contractual transaction. Such an insurance would not becompulsory; there would be no legal penalty imposed on those who did not chooseto take it—they would be free to make verbal agreements or to sign uninsuredcontracts, if they so wished. The only consequence would be that such agreementsor contracts would not be legally enforceable; if they were broken, the injuredparty would not be able to seek redress in a court of law.All credit transactions are contractual agreements. A credit transaction is anyexchange which involves a passage of time between the payment and the receipt ofgoods or services. This includes the vast majority of economic transactions in acomplex industrial society. Only a very small part of the gigantic network ofcredit transactions ever ends up in court, but the entire network is madepossible by the existence of the courts, and would collapse overnight withoutthat protection. This is a government service which people need, use, rely uponand should pay for. Yet, today, this service is provided gratuitously andamounts, in effect, to a subsidy.When one considers the magnitude of the wealth involved in credit transactions,one can see that the percentage required to pay for such governmental insurancewould be infinitesimal—much smaller than that paid for other types ofinsurance—yet it would be sufficient to finance all the other functions of aproper government. (If necessary, that percentage could be legally increased intime of war; or other, but similar, methods of raising money could beestablished for clearly defined wartime needs.)This particular “plan” is mentioned here only as an illustration of a possiblemethod of approach to the problem—not as a definitive answer nor as a program toadvocate at present. The legal and technical difficulties involved are enormous:they include such questions as the need of an ironclad constitutional provisionto prevent the government from dictating the content of private contracts (anissue which exists today and needs much more objective definitions) -the need ofobjective standards (or safeguards) for establishing the amount of the premiums,which cannot be left to the arbitrary discretion of the government, etc.Any program of voluntary government financing is the last, not the first, stepon the road to a free society—the last, not the first, reform to advocate. Itwould work only when the basic principles and institutions of a free societyhave been established. It would not work today.Men would pay voluntarily for insurance protecting their contracts. But theywould not pay voluntarily for insurance against the danger of aggression byCambodia. Nor would the plywood manufacturers of Wisconsin and their workers payvoluntarily for insurance to assist the development of the plywood industry ofJapan which would put them out of business.A program of voluntary government financing would be amply sufficient to pay forthe legitimate functions of a proper government. It would not be sufficient toprovide unearned support for the entire globe. But no type of taxation issufficient for that—onty the suicide of a great country might be and then onlytemporarily.Just as the growth of controls, taxes and “government obligations” in thiscountry was not accomplished overnight—so the process of liberation cannot beaccomplished overnight. A process of liberation would be much more rapid thanthe process of enslavement had been, since the facts of reality would be itsally. But still, a gradual process is required—and any program of voluntarygovernment financing has to be regarded as a goal for a distant future.What the advocates of a fully free society have to know, at present, is only theprinciple by which that goal can be achieved.The principle of voluntary government financing rests on the following premises:that the government is not the owner of the citizens’ income and, therefore,cannot hold a blank check on that income—that the nature of the propergovernmental services must be constitutionally defined and delimited, leavingthe government no power to enlarge the scope of its services at its ownarbitrary discretion. Consequently, the principle of voluntary governmentfinancing regards the government as the servant, not the ruler, of thecitizens—as an agent who must be paid for his services, not as a benefactorwhose services are gratuitous, who dispenses something for nothing.This last, along with the notion of compulsory taxation, is a remnant of thetime when the government was regarded as the omnipotent ruler of the citizens.An absolute monarch, who owned the work, income, property and lives of hissubjects, had to be an unpaid “benefactor,” protector and dispenser of favors.Such a monarch would have considered it demeaning to be paid for hisservices—just as the atavistic mentalities of his descendants-in-spirit (theremnants of Europe’s ancient feudal aristocracy, and the modern welfarestatists) still consider an earned, commercial income as demeaning and asmorally inferior to an unearned one which is acquired by mooching or looting, bycharitable donations or governmental force.When a government, be it a monarch or a “democratic” parliament, is regarded asa provider of gratuitous services, it is only a question of time before itbegins to enlarge its services and the sphere of the gratuitous (today, thisprocess is called the growth of “the public sector of the economy”) until itbecomes, and has to become, the instrument of pressure-group warfare—of economicgroups looting one another.The premise to check (and to challenge) in this context is the primordial notionthat any governmental services (even the legitimate ones) should be given to thecitizens gratuitously. In order fully to translate into practice the Americanconcept of the government as a servant of the citizens, one has to regard thegovernment as a paid servant. Then, on that basis, one can proceed to devise theappropriate means of tying government revenues directly to the governmentservices rendered.It may be observed, in the example given above, that the cost of such voluntarygovernment financing would be automatically proportionate to the scale of anindividual’s economic activity; those on the lowest economic levels (who seldom,if ever, engage in credit transactions) would be virtually exempt—though theywould still enjoy the benefits of legal protection, such as that offered by thearmed forces, by the police and by the courts dealing with criminal offenses.These benefits may be regarded as a bonus to the men of lesser economic ability,made possible by the men of greater economic ability—without any sacrifice ofthe latter to the former.It is in their own interests that the men of greater ability have to pay for themaintenance of armed forces, for the protection of their country againstinvasion; their expenses are not increased by the fact that a marginal part ofthe population is unable to contribute to these costs. Economically, thatmarginal group is nonexistent as far as the costs of war are concerned. The sameis true of the costs of maintaining a police force: it is in their own intereststhat the abler men have to pay for the apprehension of criminals, regardless ofwhether the specific victim of a given crime is rich or poor.It is important to note that this type of free protection for thenoncontributors represents an indirect benefit and is merely a marginalconsequence of the contributors’ own interests and expenses. This type of bonuscannot be stretched to cover direct benefits, or to claim—as the welfarestatists are claiming—that direct handouts to the non-producers are in theproducers’ own interests.The difference, briefly, is as follows: if a railroad were running a train andallowed the poor to ride without payment in the seats left empty, it would notbe the same thing (nor the same principle) as providing the poor withfirst-class carriages and special trains.Any type of nonsacrificial assistance, of social bonus, gratuitous benefit orgift value possible among men, is possible only in a free society, and is properso long as it is nonsacrificial. But, in a free society, under a system ofvoluntary government financing, there would be no legal loophole, no legalpossibility, for any “redistribution of wealth”—for the unearned support of somemen by the forced labor and extorted income of others—for the draining,exploitation and destruction of those who are able to pay the costs ofmaintaining a civilized society, in favor of those who are unable or unwillingto pay the cost of maintaining their own existence. (February 1964)"},{"pageContent":"16.The Divine Right of Stagnationby Nathaniel BrandenFor every living species, growth is a necessity of survival. Life is motion, aprocess of self-sustaining action that an organism must carry on in order toremain in existence. This principle is equally evident in the simpleenergy-conversions of a plant and in the long-range, complex activities of man.Biologically, inactivity is death.The nature and range of possible motion and development varies from species tospecies. The range of a plant’s action and development is far less than ananimal’s; an animal’s is far less than man’s. An animal’s capacity fordevelopment ends at physical maturity and thereafter its growth consists of theaction necessary to maintain itself at a fixed level; after reaching maturity,it does not, to any significant extent, continue to grow in efficacy—that is, itdoes not significantly increase its ability to cope with the environment. Butman’s capacity for development does not end at physical maturity; his capacityis virtually limitless. His power to reason is man’s distinguishingcharacteristic, his mind is man’s basic means of survival—and his ability tothink, to learn, to discover new and better ways of dealing with reality, toexpand the range of his efficacy, to grow intellectually, is an open door to aroad that has no end.Man survives, not by adjusting himself to his physical environment in the mannerof an animal, but by transforming his environment through productive work. “If adrought strikes them, animals perish—man builds irrigation canals; if a floodstrikes them, animals perish—man builds dams; if a carnivorous pack attacksthem, animals perish— man writes the Constitution of the United States.” (AynRand, For the New Intellectual.)If life is a process of self-sustaining action, then this is the distinctlyhuman mode of action and survival: to think—to produce—to meet the challenges ofexistence by a never-ending effort and inventiveness.When man discovered how to make fire to keep himself warm, his need of thoughtand effort was not ended; when he discovered how to fashion a bow and arrow, hisneed of thought and effort was not ended; when he discovered how to build ashelter out of stone, then out of brick, then out of glass and steel, his needof thought and effort was not ended; when he moved his life expectancy fromnineteen to thirty to forty to sixty to seventy, his need of thought and effortwas not ended; so long as he lives, his need of thought and effort is neverended.Every achievement of man is a value in itself, but it is also a stepping-stoneto greater achievements and values. Life is growth; not to move forward, is tofall backward; life remains life, only so long as it advances. Every step upwardopens to man a wider range of action and achievement—and creates the need forthat action and achievement. There is no final, permanent “plateau.” The problemof survival is never “solved,” once and for all, with no further thought ormotion required. More precisely, the problem of survival is solved, byrecognizing that survival demands constant growth and creativeness.Constant growth is, further, a psychological need of man. It is a condition ofhis mental well-being. His mental well-being requires that he possess a firmsense of control over reality, of control over his existence—the conviction thathe is competent to live. And this requires, not omniscience or omnipotence, butthe knowledge that one’s methods of dealing with reality—the principles by whichone functions—are right. Passivity is incompatible with this state. Self-esteemis not a value that, once achieved, is maintained automatically thereafter; likeevery other human value, including life itself, it can be maintained only byaction. Self-esteem, the basic conviction that one is competent to live, can bemaintained only so long as one is engaged in a process of growth, only so longas one is committed to the task of increasing one’s efficacy. In livingentities, nature does not permit stillness: when one ceases to grow, oneproceeds to disintegrate—in the mental realm no less than in the physical.Observe, in this connection, the widespread phenomenon of men who are old by thetime they are thirty. These are men who, having in effect concluded that theyhave “thought enough,” drift on the diminishing momentum of their pasteffort—and wonder what happened to their fire and energy, and why they are dimlyanxious, and why their existence seems so desolately impoverished, and why theyfeel themselves sinking into some nameless abyss—and never identify the factthat, in abandoning the will to think, one abandons the will to live.Man’s need to grow—and his need, therefore, of the social or existentialconditions that make growth possible—are facts of crucial importance to beconsidered in judging or evaluating any politico-economic system. One should beconcerned to ask: Is a given politico-economic system pro-life or anti-life,conducive or inimical to the requirements of man’s survival?The great merit of capitalism is its unique appropriateness to the requirementsof human survival and to man’s need to grow. Leaving men free to think, to act,to produce, to attempt the untried and the new, its principles operate in a waythat rewards effort and achievement, and penalizes passivity.This is one of the chief reasons for which it is denounced.In Who Is Ayn Rand?, discussing the nineteenth-century attacks on capitalism, Iwrote: “In the writings of both medievalists and socialists, one can observe theunmistakable longing for a society in which man’s existence will beautomatically guaranteed to him—that is, in which man will not have to bearresponsibility for his own survival. Both camps project their ideal society asone characterized by that which they call ‘harmony,’ by freedom from rapidchange or challenge or the exacting demands of competition; a society in whicheach must do his prescribed part to contribute to the well-being of the whole,but in which no one will face the necessity of making choices and decisions thatwill crucially affect his life and future; in which the question of what one hasor has not earned, and does or does not deserve, will not come up; in whichrewards will not be tied to achievement and in which someone’s benevolence willguarantee that one need never bear the consequences of one’s errors. The failureof capitalism to conform to what may be termed this pastoral view of existence,is essential to the medievalists’ and socialists’ indictment of a free society.It is not a Garden of Eden that capitalism offers men.”Among the arguments used by those who long for a “pastoral” existence, is adoctrine which, translated into explicit statement, consists of: the divineright of stagnation.This doctrine is illustrated in the following incident. Once, on a plane trip, Ibecame engaged in conversation with an executive of a labor union. He began todecry the “disaster” of automation, asserting that increasing thousands ofworkers would be permanently unemployed as a result of new machines and that“something ought to be done about it.” I answered that this was a myth that hadbeen exploded many times; that the introduction of new machines invariablyresulted in increasing the demand for labor as well as in raising the generalstandard of living; that this was demonstrable theoretically and observablehistorically. I remarked that automation increased the demand for skilled laborrelative to unskilled labor, and that doubtless many workers would need to learnnew skills. “But,” he asked indignantly, “what about the workers who don’t wantto learn new skills? Why should they have troubles?”This means that the ambition, the farsightedness, the drive to do better andstill better, the living energy of creative men are to be throttled andsuppressed—for the sake of men who have “thought enough” and “learned enough”and do not wish to be concerned with the future nor with the bothersome questionof what their jobs depend on.Alone on a desert island, bearing sole responsibility for his own survival, noman could permit himself the delusion that tomorrow is not his concern, that hecan safely rest on yesterday’s knowledge and skills, and that nature owes him“security.” It is only in society—where the burden of a man’s default can bepassed to the shoulders of a man who did not default—that such a delusion can beindulged in. (And it is here that the morality of altruism becomesindispensable, to provide a sanction for such parasitism.)The claim that men doing the same type of job should all be paid the same wages,regardless of differences in their performance or output, thus penalizing thesuperior worker in favor of the inferior—this is the doctrine of the divineright of stagnation.The claim that men should keep their jobs or be promoted on grounds, not ofmerit, but of seniority, so that the mediocrity who is “in” is favored above thetalented newcomer, thus blocking the newcomer’s future and that of his potentialemployer—this is the doctrine of the divine right of stagnation.The claim that an employer should be compelled to deal with a specific unionwhich has an arbitrary power to exclude applicants for membership, so that thechance to work at a certain craft is handed down from father to son and nonewcomer can enter to threaten the established vested interests, thus blockingprogress in the entire field, like the guild system of the Middle Ages—this isthe doctrine of the divine right of stagnation.The claim that men should be retained in jobs that have become unnecessary,doing work that is wasteful or superfluous, to spare them the difficulties ofretraining for new jobs—thus contributing, as in the case of railroads, to thevirtual destruction of an entire industry—this is the doctrine of the divineright of stagnation.The denunciation of capitalism for such “iniquities” as allowing an old cornergrocer to be driven out of business by a big chain store, the denunciationimplying that the economic well-being and progress of the old grocer’s customersand of the chain store owners should be throttled to protect the limitations ofthe old grocer’s initiative or skill—this is the doctrine of the divine right ofstagnation.The court’s decree, under the antitrust laws, that a successful businessestablishment does not have a right to its patents, but must give them,royalty-free, to a would-be competitor who cannot afford to pay for them(General Electric case, 1948)—this is the doctrine of the divine right ofstagnation.The court’s edict convicting and blocking a business concern for the crime offarsightedness, the crime of anticipating future demand and expanding plantcapacity to meet it, and of thereby possibly “discouraging” future competitors(ALCOA case, 1945)—this is the legal penalizing of growth, this is thepenalizing of ability for being abitity—and this is the naked essence and goalof the doctrine of the divine right of stagnation.Capitalism, by its nature, entails a constant process of motion, growth andprogress. It creates the optimum social conditions for man to respond to thechallenges of nature in such a way as best to further his life. It operates tothe benefit of all those who choose to be active in the productive process,whatever their level of ability. But it is not geared to the demands ofstagnation. Neither is reality.When one considers the spectacular success, the unprecedented prosperity, thatcapitalism has achieved in practice (even with hampering controls)—and when oneconsiders the dismal failure of every variety of collectivism—it should be clearthat the enemies of capitalism are not motivated, at root, by economicconsiderations. They are motivated by metaphysical considerations—by a rebellionagainst the human mode of survival, a rebellion against the fact that life is aprocess of self-sustaining and self-generated action—and by the dream that, ifonly they can harness the men who do not resent the nature of life, they willmake existence tolerable for those who do resent it. (August 1963)"},{"pageContent":"17.Racismby Ayn RandRacism is the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism. It is thenotion of ascribing moral, social or political significance to a man’s geneticlineage—the notion that a man’s intellectual and characterological traits areproduced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry. Which means, inpractice, that a man is to be judged, not by his own character and actions, butby the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors.Racism claims that the content of a man’s mind (not his cognitive apparatus, butits content) is inherited; that a man’s convictions, values and character aredetermined before he is born, by physical factors beyond his control. This isthe caveman’s version of the doctrine of innate ideas—or of inheritedknowledge—which has been thoroughly refuted by philosophy and science. Racism isa doctrine of, by and for brutes. It is a barnyard or stock-farm version ofcollectivism, appropriate to a mentality that differentiates between variousbreeds of animals, but not between animals and men.Like every form of determinism, racism invalidates the specific attribute whichdistinguishes man from all other living species: his rational faculty. Racismnegates two aspects of man’s life: reason and choice, or mind and morality,replacing them with chemical predestination.The respectable family that supports worthless relatives or covers up theircrimes in order to “protect the family name” (as if the moral stature of one mancould be damaged by the actions of another)—the bum who boasts that hisgreat-grandfather was an empire-builder, or the small-town spinster who boaststhat her maternal great-uncle was a state senator and her third cousin gave aconcert at Carnegie Hall (as if the achievements of one man could rub off on themediocrity of another)—the parents who search genealogical trees in order toevaluate their prospective sons-in-law—the celebrity who starts hisautobiography with a detailed account of his family history—all these aresamples of racism, the atavistic manifestations of a doctrine whose fullexpression is the tribal warfare of prehistorical savages, the wholesaleslaughter of Nazi Germany, the atrocities of today’s so-called “newly emergingnations.”The theory that holds “good blood” or “bad blood” as a moral-intellectualcriterion, can lead to nothing but torrents of blood in practice. Brute force isthe only avenue of action open to men who regard themselves as mindlessaggregates of chemicals.Modern racists attempt to prove the superiority or inferiority of a given raceby the historical achievements of some of its members. The frequent historicalspectacle of a great innovator who, in his lifetime, is jeered, denounced,obstructed, persecuted by his countrymen, and then, a few years after his death,is enshrined in a national monument and hailed as a proof of the greatness ofthe German (or French or Italian or Cambodian) race—is as revolting a spectacleof collectivist expropriation, perpetrated by racists, as any expropriation ofmaterial wealth perpetrated by communists.Just as there is no such thing as a collective or racial mind, so there is nosuch thing as a collective or racial achievement. There are only individualminds and individual achievements—and a culture is not the anonymous product ofundifferentiated masses, but the sum of the intellectual achievements ofindividual men.Even if it were proved—which it is not—that the incidence of men of potentiallysuperior brain power is greater among the members of certain races than amongthe members of others, it would still tell us nothing about any given individualand it would be irrelevant to one’s judgment of him. A genius is a genius,regardless of the number of morons who belong to the same race—and a moron is amoron, regardless of the number of geniuses who share his racial origin. It ishard to say which is the more outrageous injustice: the claim of Southernracists that a Negro genius should be treated as an inferior because his racehas “produced” some brutes—or the claim of a German brute to the status of asuperior because his race has “produced” Goethe, Schiller and Brahms.These are not two different claims, of course, but two applications of the samebasic premise. The question of whether one alleges the superiority or theinferiority of any given race is irrelevant; racism has only one psychologicalroot: the racist’s sense of his own inferiority.Like every other form of collectivism, racism is a quest for the unearned. It isa quest for automatic knowledge—for an automatic evaluation of men’s charactersthat bypasses the responsibility of exercising rational or moral judgment—and,above all, a quest for an automatic self-esteem (or pseudo-self-esteem).To ascribe one’s virtues to one’s racial origin, is to confess that one has noknowledge of the process by which virtues are acquired and, most often, that onehas failed to acquire them. The overwhelming majority of racists are men whohave earned no sense of personal identity, who can claim no individualachievement or distinction, and who seek the illusion of a “tribal self-esteem”by alleging the inferiority of some other tribe. Observe the hystericalintensity of the Southern racists; observe also that racism is much moreprevalent among the poor white trash than among their intellectual betters.Historically, racism has always risen or fallen with the rise or fall ofcollectivism. Collectivism holds that the individual has no rights, that hislife and work belong to the group (to “society,” to the tribe, the state, thenation) and that the group may sacrifice him at its own whim to its owninterests. The only way to implement a doctrine of that kind is by means ofbrute force—and statism has always been the political corollary of collectivism.The absolute state is merely an institutionalized form of gang-rule, regardlessof which particular gang seizes power. And—since there is no rationaljustification for such rule, since none has ever been or can ever be offered—themystique of racism is a crucial element in every variant of the absolute state.The relationship is reciprocal: statism rises out of prehistorical tribalwarfare, out of the notion that the men of one tribe are the natural prey forthe men of another—and establishes its own internal subcategories of racism, asystem of castes determined by a man’s birth, such as inherited titles ofnobility or inherited serfdom.The racism of Nazi Germany—where men had to fill questionnaires about theirancestry for generations back, in order to prove their Aryan descent—has itscounterpart in Soviet Russia, where men had to fill similar questionnaires toshow that their ancestors had owned no property and thus to prove theirproletarian descent. The Soviet ideology rests on the notion that men can beconditioned to communism genetically—that is, that a few generations conditionedby dictatorship will transmit communist ideology to their descendants, who willbe communists at birth. The persecution of racial minorities in Soviet Russia,according to the racial descent and whim of any given commissar, is a matter ofrecord; anti-Semitism is particularly prevalent—only the official pogroms arenow called “political purges.”There is only one antidote to racism: the philosophy of individualism and itspolitico-economic corollary, laissez-faire capitalism.Individualism regards man—every man—as an independent, sovereign entity whopossesses an inalienable right to his own life, a right derived from his natureas a rational being. Individualism holds that a civilized society, or any formof association, cooperation or peaceful coexistence among men, can be achievedonly on the basis of the recognition of individual rights—and that a group, assuch, has no rights other than the individual rights of its members. (SeeChapters 12 and 13.)It is not a man’s ancestors or relatives or genes or body chemistry that countin a free market, but only one human attribute: productive ability. It is by hisown individual ability and ambition that capitalism judges a man and rewards himaccordingly.No political system can establish universal rationality by law (or by force).But capitalism is the only system that functions in a way which rewardsrationality and penalizes all forms of irrationality, including racism.A fully free, capitalist system has not yet existed anywhere. But what isenormously significant is the correlation of racism and political controls inthe semifree economies of the nineteenth century. Racial and/or religiouspersecutions of minorities stood in inverse ratio to the degree of a country’sfreedom. Racism was strongest in the more controlled economies, such as Russiaand Germany—and weakest in England, the then freest country of Europe.It is capitalism that gave mankind its first steps toward freedom and a rationalway of life. It is capitalism that broke through national and racial barriers,by means of free trade. It is capitalism that abolished serfdom and slavery inall the civilized countries of the world. It is the capitalist North thatdestroyed the slavery of the agrarian-feudal South in the United States.Such was the trend of mankind for the brief span of some hundred and fiftyyears. The spectacular results and achievements of that trend need norestatement here.The rise of collectivism reversed that trend.When men began to be indoctrinated once more with the notion that the individualpossesses no rights, that supremacy, moral authority and unlimited power belongto the group, and that a man has no significance outside his group—theinevitable consequence was that men began to gravitate toward some group oranother, in self-protection, in bewilderment and in subconscious terror. Thesimplest collective to join, the easiest one to identify—particularly for peopleof limited intelligence—the least demanding form of “belonging” and of“togetherness” is: race.It is thus that the theoreticians of collectivism, the “humanitarian” advocatesof a “benevolent” absolute state, have led to the rebirth and the new, virulentgrowth of racism in the twentieth century.In its great era of capitalism, the United States was the freest country onearth—and the best refutation of racist theories. Men of all races came here,some from obscure, culturally undistinguished countries, and accomplished featsof productive ability which would have remained stillborn in theircontrol-ridden native lands. Men of racial groups that had been slaughtering oneanother for centuries, learned to live together in harmony and peacefulcooperation. America had been called “the melting pot,” with good reason. Butfew people realized that America did not melt men into the gray conformity of acollective: she united them by means of protecting their right to individuality.The major victims of such race prejudice as did exist in America were theNegroes. It was a problem originated and perpetuated by the noncapitalist South,though not confined to its boundaries. The persecution of Negroes in the Southwas and is truly disgraceful. But in the rest of the country, so long as menwere free, even that problem was slowly giving way under the pressure ofenlightenment and of the white men’s own economic interests.Today, that problem is growing worse—and so is every other form of racism.America has become race-conscious in a manner reminiscent of the worst days inthe most backward countries of nineteenth-century Europe. The cause is the same:the growth of collectivism and statism.In spite of the clamor for racial equality, propagated by the “liberals” in thepast few decades, the Census Bureau reported recently that “[the Negro’s]economic status relative to whites has not improved for nearly 20 years.” It hadbeen improving in the freer years of our “mixed economy”; it deteriorated withthe progressive enlargement of the “liberals’ ” Welfare State.The growth of racism in a “mixed economy” keeps step with the growth ofgovernment controls. A “mixed economy” disintegrates a country into aninstitutionalized civil war of pressure groups, each fighting for legislativefavors and special privileges at the expense of one another.The existence of such pressure groups and of their political lobbies is openlyand cynically acknowledged today. The pretense at any political philosophy, anyprinciples, ideals or long-range goals is fast disappearing from our scene—andit is all but admitted that this country is now floating without direction, atthe mercy of a blind, short-range power game played by various statist gangs,each intent on getting hold of a legislative gun for any special advantage ofthe immediate moment.In the absence of any coherent political philosophy, every economic group hasbeen acting as its own destroyer, selling out its future for some momentaryprivilege. The policy of the businessmen has, for some time, been the mostsuicidal one in this respect. But it has been surpassed by the current policy ofthe Negro leaders.So long as the Negro leaders were fighting against government-enforceddiscrimination—right, justice and morality were on their side. But that is notwhat they are fighting any longer. The confusions and contradictions surroundingthe issue of racism have now reached an incredible climax.It is time to clarify the principles involved.The policy of the Southern states toward Negroes was and is a shamefulcontradiction of this country’s basic principles. Racial discrimination, imposedand enforced by law, is so blatantly inexcusable an infringement of individualrights that the racist statutes of the South should have been declaredunconstitutional long ago.The Southern racists’ claim of “states’ rights” is a contradiction in terms:there can be no such thing as the “right” of some men to violate the rights ofothers. The constitutional concept of “states’ rights” pertains to the divisionof power between local and national authorities, and serves to protect thestates from the Federal government; it does not grant to a state government anunlimited, arbitrary power over its citizens or the privilege of abrogating thecitizens’ individual rights.It is true that the Federal government has used the racial issue to enlarge itsown power and to set a precedent of encroachment upon the legitimate rights ofthe states, in an unnecessary and unconstitutional manner. But this merely meansthat both governments are wrong; it does not excuse the policy of the Southernracists.One of the worst contradictions, in this context, is the stand of many so-called“conservatives” (not confined exclusively to the South) who claim to bedefenders of freedom, of capitalism, of property rights, of the Constitution,yet who advocate racism at the same time. They do not seem to possess enoughconcern with principles to realize that they are cutting the ground from undertheir own feet. Men who deny individual rights cannot claim, defend or upholdany rights whatsoever. It is such alleged champions of capitalism who arehelping to discredit and destroy it.The “liberals” are guilty of the same contradiction, but in a different form.They advocate the sacrifice of all individual rights to unlimited majorityrule—yet posture as defenders of the rights of minorities. But the smallestminority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights, cannotclaim to be defenders of minorities.This accumulation of contradictions, of shortsighted pragmatism, of cynicalcontempt for principles, of outrageous irrationality, has now reached its climaxin the new demands of the Negro leaders.Instead of fighting against racial discrimination, they are demanding thatracial discrimination be legalized and enforced. Instead of fighting againstracism, they are demanding the establishment of racial quotas. Instead offighting for “color-blindness” in social and economic issues, they areproclaiming that “color-blindness” is evil and that “color” should be made aprimary consideration. Instead of fighting for equal rights, they are demandingspecial race privilegesThey are demanding that racial quotas be established in regard to employment andthat jobs be distributed on a racial basis, in proportion to the percentage of agiven race among the local population. For instance, since Negroes constitute 25per cent of the population of New York City, they demand 25 per cent of the jobsin a given establishment.Racial quotas have been one of the worst evils of racist regimes. There wereracial quotas in the universities of Czarist Russia, in the population ofRussia’s major cities, etc. One of the accusations against the racists in thiscountry is that some schools practice a secret system of racial quotas. It wasregarded as a victory for justice when employment questionnaires ceased toinquire about an applicant’s race or religion.Today, it is not an oppressor, but an oppressed minority group that is demandingthe establishment of racial quotas. (!)This particular demand was too much even for the “liberals.” Many of themdenounced it—properly—with shocked indignation.Wrote The N. Y. Times (July 23, 1963): “The demonstrators are following a trulyvicious principle in playing the ‘numbers game.’ A demand that 25 per cent (orany other percentage) of jobs be given to Negroes (or any other group) is wrongfor one basic reason: it calls for a ‘quota system,’ which is in itselfdiscriminatory.... This newspaper has long fought a religious quota in respectto judge-ships; we equally oppose a racial quota in respect to jobs from themost elevated to the most menial.”As if the blatant racism of such a demand were not enough, some Negro leaderswent still farther. Whitney M. Young Jr., executive director of the NationalUrban League, made the following statement (N. Y. Times, August 1):“The white leadership must be honest enough to grant that throughout our historythere has existed a special privileged class of citizens who received preferredtreatment. That class was white. Now we’re saying this: If two men, one Negroand one white, are equally qualified for a job, hire the Negro.”Consider the implications of that statement. It does not merely demand specialprivileges on racial grounds—it demands that white men be penalized for the sinsof their ancestors. It demands that a white laborer be refused a job because hisgrandfather may have practiced racial discrimination. But perhaps hisgrandfather had not practiced it. Or perhaps his grandfather had not even livedin this country. Since these questions are not to be considered, it means thatthat white laborer is to be charged with collective racial guilt, the guiltconsisting merely of the color of his skin.But that is the principle of the worst Southern racist who charges all Negroeswith collective racial guilt for any crime committed by an individual Negro, andwho treats them all as inferiors on the ground that their ancestors weresavages.The only comment one can make about demands of that kind, is: “By what right?—Bywhat code?—By what standard?”That absurdly evil policy is destroying the moral base of the Negroes’ fight.Their case rested on the principle of individual rights. If they demand theviolation of the rights of others, they negate and forfeit their own. Then thesame answer applies to them as to the Southern racists: there can be no suchthing as the “right” of some men to violate the rights of others.Yet the entire policy of the Negro leaders is now moving in that direction. Forinstance, the demand for racial quotas in schools, with the proposal thathundreds of children, white and Negro, be forced to attend school in distantneighborhoods—for the purpose of “racial balance.” Again, this is pure racism.As opponents of this demand have pointed out, to assign children to certainschools by reason of their race, is equally evil whether one does it forpurposes of segregation or integration. And the mere idea of using children aspawns in a political game should outrage all parents, of any race, creed orcolor.The “civil rights” bill, now under consideration in Congress, is another exampleof a gross infringement of individual rights. It is proper to forbid alldiscrimination in government-owned facilities and establishments: the governmenthas no right to discriminate against any citizens. And by the very sameprinciple, the government has no right to discriminate for some citizens at theexpense of others. It has no right to violate the right of private property byforbidding discrimination in privately owned establishments.No man, neither Negro nor white, has any claim to the property of another man. Aman’s rights are not violated by a private individual’s refusal to deal withhim. Racism is an evil, irrational and morally contemptible doctrine—butdoctrines cannot be forbidden or prescribed by law. Just as we have to protect acommunist’s freedom of speech, even though his doctrines are evil, so we have toprotect a racist’s right to the use and disposal of his own property. Privateracism is not a legal, but a moral issue—and can be fought only by privatemeans, such as economic boycott or social ostracism.Needless to say, if that “civil rights” bill is passed, it will be the worstbreach of property rights in the sorry record of American history in respect tothat subject.6 [rand_9781101137222_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-6]It is an ironic demonstration of the philosophical insanity and the consequentlysuicidal trend of our age, that the men who need the protection of individualrights most urgently—the Negroes—are now in the vanguard of the destruction ofthese rights.A word of warning: do not become victims of the same racists by succumbing toracism; do not hold against all Negroes the disgraceful irrationality of some oftheir leaders. No group has any proper intellectual leadership today or anyproper representation.In conclusion, I shall quote from an astonishing editorial in The N. Y. Times ofAugust 4—astonishing because ideas of this nature are not typical of our age:“But the question must be not whether a group recognizable in color, features orculture has its rights as a group. No, the question is whether any Americanindividual, regardless of color, features or culture, is deprived of his rightsas an American. If the individual has all the rights and privileges due himunder the laws and the Constitution, we need not worry about groups andmasses—those do not, in fact, exist, except as figures of speech.” (September 1963)"},{"pageContent":"18.Counterfeit Individualismby Nathaniel BrandenThe theory of individualism is a central component of the Objectivistphilosophy. Individualism is at once an ethical-political concept and anethical-psychological one. As an ethical-political concept, individualismupholds the supremacy of individual rights, the principle that man is an end inhimself, not a means to the ends of others. As an ethical-psychological concept,individualism holds that man should think and judge independently, valuingnothing higher than the sovereignty of his intellect.The philosophical base and validation of individualism, as Ayn Rand has shown inAtlas Shrugged, is the fact that individualism, ethically, politically andpsychologically, is an objective requirement of man’s proper survival, of man’ssurvival qua man, qua rational being. It is implicit in, and necessitated by, acode of ethics that holds man’s life as its standard of value.The advocacy of individualism as such is not new; what is new is the Objectivistvalidation of the theory of individualism and the definition of a consistent wayto practice it.Too often, the ethical-political meaning of individualism is held to be: doingwhatever one wishes, regardless of the rights of others. Writers such asNietzsche and Max Stirner are sometimes quoted in support of thisinterpretation. Altruists and collectivists have an obvious vested interest inpersuading men that such is the meaning of individualism, that the man whorefuses to be sacrificed intends to sacrifice others.The contradiction in, and refutation of, such an interpretation of individualismis this: since the only rational base of individualism as an ethical principleis the requirements of man’s survival qua man, one man cannot claim the moralright to violate the rights of another. If he denies inviolate rights to othermen, he cannot claim such rights for himself; he has rejected the base ofrights. No one can claim the moral right to a contradiction.Individualism does not consist merely of rejecting the belief that man shouldlive for the collective. A man who seeks escape from the responsibility ofsupporting his life by his own thought and effort, and wishes to survive byconquering, ruling and exploiting others, is not an individualist. Anindividualist is a man who lives for his own sake and by his own mind; heneither sacrifices himself to others nor sacrifices others to himself; he dealswith men as a trader—not as a looter; as a Producer—not as an Attila.It is the recognition of this distinction that altruists and collectivists wishmen to lose: the distinction between a trader and a looter, between a Producerand an Attila.If the meaning of individualism, in its ethical-political context, has beenperverted and debased predominantly by its avowed antagonists, the meaning ofindividualism, in its ethical-psychological context, has been perverted anddebased predominantly by its professed supporters: by those who wish to dissolvethe distinction between an independent judgment and a subjective whim. These arethe alleged “individualists” who equate individualism, not with independentthought, but with “independent feelings.” There are no such things as“independent feelings.” There is only an independent mind.An individualist is, first and foremost, a man of reason. It is upon the abilityto think, upon his rational faculty, that man’s life depends; rationality is theprecondition of independence and self-reliance. An “individualist” who isneither independent nor self-reliant, is a contradiction in terms; individualismand independence are logically inseparable. The basic independence of theindividualist consists of his loyalty to his own mind: it is his perception ofthe facts of reality, his understanding, his judgment, that he refuses tosacrifice to the unproved assertions of others. That is the meaning ofintellectual independence—and that is the essence of an individualist. He isdispassionately and intransigently fact-centered.Man needs knowledge in order to survive, and only reason can achieve it; men whoreject the responsibility of thought and reason, can exist only as parasites onthe thinking of others. And a parasite is not an individualist. Theirrationalist, the whim-worshiper who regards knowledge and objectivity as“restrictions” on his freedom, the range-of-the-moment hedonist who acts on hisprivate feelings, is not an individualist. The “independence” that anirrationalist seeks is independence from reality—likeDostoevsky’s Undergroundman who cries: “What do I care for the laws of nature and arithmetic, when, forsome reason, I dislike those laws and the fact that twice two makes four?”To the irrationalist, existence is merely a clash between his whims and thewhims of others; the concept of an objective reality has no reality to him.Rebelliousness or unconventionality as such do not constitute proof ofindividualism. Just as individualism does not consist merely of rejectingcollectivism, so it does not consist merely of the absence of conformity. Aconformist is a man who declares, “It’s true because others believe it”—but anindividualist is not a man who declares, “It’s true because I believe it.” Anindividualist declares, “I believe it because I see in reason that it’s true.”There is an incident in The Fountainhead that is worth recalling in thisconnection. In the chapter on the life and career of collectivist EllsworthToohey, Ayn Rand describes the various groups of writers and artists that Tooheyorganized : there was “... a woman who never used capitals in her books, and aman who never used commas ... and another who wrote poems that neither rhymednor scanned ... There was a boy who used no canvas, but did something with birdcages and metronomes ... A few friends pointed out to Ellsworth Toohey that heseemed guilty of inconsistency; he was so deeply opposed to individualism, theysaid, and here were all these writers and artists of his, and every one of themwas a rabid individualist. ‘Do you really think so?” said Toohey, smilingblandly.”7 [rand_9781101137222_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-7]What Toohey knew—and what students of Objectivism would do well to understand—isthat such subjectivists, in their rebellion against “the tyranny of reality,”are less independent and more abjectly parasitical than the most commonplaceBabbitt whom they profess to despise. They originate or create nothing; they areprofoundly selfless— and they struggle to fill the void of the egos they do notpossess, by means of the only form of “self-assertiveness” they recognize:defiance for the sake of defiance, irrationality for the sake of irrationality,destruction for the sake of destruction, whims for the sake of whims.A psychotic is scarcely likely to be accused of conformity; but neither apsychotic nor a subjectivist is an exponent of individualism.Observe the common denominator in the attempts to corrupt the meaning ofindividualism as an ethical-political concept and as an ethical-psychologicalconcept: the attempt to divorce individualism from reason. But it is only in thecontext of reason and man’s needs as a rational being that the principle ofindividualism can be justified. Tom out of this context, any advocacy of“individualism” becomes as arbitrary and irrational as the advocacy ofcollectivism.This is the basis of Objectivism’s total opposition to any alleged“individualists” who attempt to equate individualism with subjectivism.And this is the basis of Objectivism’s total repudiation of any self-styled“Objectivists” who permit themselves to believe that any compromise, meetingground or rapprochement is possible between Objectivism and that counterfeitindividualism which consists of declaring: “It’s right because I feel it” or“It’s good because I want it” or “It’s true because I believe it.” (April 1962)"},{"pageContent":"19.The Argument from Intimidationby Ayn RandThere is a certain type of argument which, in fact, is not an argument, but ameans of forestalling debate and extorting an opponent’s agreement with one’sundiscussed notions. It is a method of bypassing logic by means of psychologicalpressure. Since it is particularly prevalent in today’s culture and is going togrow more so in the next few months, one would do well to learn to identify itand be on guard against it.This method bears a certain resemblance to the fallacy ad hominem, and comesfrom the same psychological root, but is different in essential meaning. The adhominem fallacy consists of attempting to refute an argument by impeaching thecharacter of its proponent. Example: “Candidate X is immoral, therefore hisargument is false.”But the psychological pressure method consists of threatening to impeach anopponent’s character by means of his argument, thus impeaching the argumentwithout debate. Example: “Only the immoral can fail to see that Candidate X’sargument is false.”In the first case, Candidate X’s immorality (real or invented) is offered asproof of the falsehood of his argument. In the second case, the falsehood of hisargument is asserted arbitrarily and offered as proof of his immorality.In today’s epistemological jungle, that second method is used more frequentlythan any other type of irrational argument. It should be classified as a logicalfallacy and may be designated as “The Argument from Intimidation.”The essential characteristic of the Argument from Intimidation is its appeal tomoral self-doubt and its reliance on the fear, guilt or ignorance of the victim.It is used in the form of an ultimatum demanding that the victim renounce agiven idea without discussion, under threat of being considered morallyunworthy. The pattern is always: “Only those who are evil (dishonest, heartless.insensitive, ignorant, etc.) can hold such an idea.”The classic example of the Argument from Intimidation is the story The Emperor’sNew Clothes.In that story, some charlatans sell nonexistent garments to the Emperor byasserting that the garments’ unusual beauty makes them invisible to those whoare morally depraved at heart. Observe the psychological factors required tomake this work: the charlatans rely on the Emperor’s self-doubt; the Emperordoes not question their assertion nor their moral authority; he surrenders atonce, claiming that he does see the garments—thus denying the evidence of hisown eyes and invalidating his own consciousness—rather than face a threat to hisprecarious self-esteem. His distance from reality may be gauged by the fact thathe prefers to walk naked down the street, displaying his nonexistent garments tothe people—rather than risk incurring the moral condemnation of two scoundrels.The people, prompted by the same psychological panic, try to surpass one anotherin loud exclamations on the splendor of his ctothes—until a child cries out thatthe Emperor is naked.This is the exact pattern of the working of the Argument from Intimidation, asit is being worked all around us today.We have all heard it and are hearing it constantly:“Only those who lack finer instincts can fail to accept the morality ofaltruism.”—“Only the ignorant can fail to know that reason has beeninvalidated.”—“Only black-hearted reactionaries can advocate capitalism.”—“Onlywar-mongers can oppose the United Nations.”—“Onlythe lunatic fringe can stillbelieve in freedom.”—“Only cowards can fail to see that life is a sewer.”—“Onlythe superficial can seek beauty, happiness, achievement, values or heroes.”As an example of an entire field of activity based on nothing but the Argumentfrom Intimidation, I give you modern art—where, in order to prove that they dopossess the special insight possessed only by the mystic “elite,” the populaceare trying to surpass one another in loud exclamations on the splendor of somebare (but smudged) piece of canvas.The Argument from Intimidation dominates today’s discussions in two forms. Inpublic speeches and print, it flourishes in the form of long, involved,elaborate structures of unintelligible verbiage, which convey nothing clearlyexcept a moral threat. (“Only the primitive-minded can fail to realize thatclarity is oversimplification.”) But in private, day-to-day experience, it comesup wordlessly, between the lines, in the form of inarticulate sounds conveyingunstated implications. It relies, not on what is said, but on how it is said—noton content, but on tone of voice.The tone is usually one of scornful or belligerent incredulity. “Surely you arenot an advocate of capitalism, are you?” And if this does not intimidate theprospective victim—who answers, properly: “I am,”—the ensuing dialogue goessomething like this: “Oh, you couldn’t be! Not really!” “Really.” “But everybodyknows that capitalism is outdated!” “I don’t.” “Oh, come now!” “Since I don’tknow it, will you please tell me the reasons for thinking that capitalism isoutdated?” “Oh, don’t be ridiculous!” “Will you tell me the reasons?” “Well,really, if you don’t know, I couldn’t possibly tell you!”All this is accompanied by raised eyebrows, wide-eyed stares, shrugs, grunts,snickers and the entire arsenal of nonverbal signals communicating ominousinnuendoes and emotional vibrations of a single kind: disapproval.If those vibrations fail, if such debaters are challenged, one finds that theyhave no arguments, no evidence, no proof, no reason, no ground to stand on—thattheir noisy aggressiveness serves to hide a vacuum—that the Argument fromIntimidation is a confession of intellectual impotence.The primordial archetype of that Argument is obvious (and so are the reasons ofits appeal to the neo-mysticism of our age): “To those who understand, noexplanation is necessary; to those who don’t, none is possible.”The psychological source of that Argument is social metaphysics. 8[rand_9781101137222_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-8]A social metaphysician is one who regards the consciousness of other men assuperior to his own and to the facts of reality. It is to a social metaphysicianthat the moral appraisal of himself by others is a primary concern whichsupersedes truth, facts, reason, logic. The disapproval of others is soshatteringly terrifying to him that nothing can withstand its impact within hisconsciousness; thus he would deny the evidence of his own eyes and invalidatehis own consciousness for the sake of any stray charlatan’s moral sanction. Itis only a social metaphysician who could conceive of such absurdity as hoping towin an intellectual argument by hinting: “But people won’t like you!”Strictly speaking, a social metaphysician does not conceive of his Argument inconscious terms: he finds it “instinctively” by introspection—since itrepresents his psycho-epistemological way of life. We have all met theexasperating type of person who does not listen to what one says, but to theemotional vibrations of one’s voice, anxiously translating them into approval ordisapproval, then answering accordingly. This is a kind of self-imposed Argumentfrom Intimidation, to which a social metaphysician surrenders in most of hishuman encounters. And thus when he meets an adversary, when his premises arechallenged, he resorts automatically to the weapon that terrifies him most: thewithdrawal of a moral sanction.Since that kind of terror is unknown to psychologically healthy men, they may betaken in by the Argument from Intimidation, precisely because of theirinnocence. Unable to understand that Argument’s motive or to believe that it ismerely a senseless bluff, they assume that its user has some sort of knowledgeor reasons to back up his seemingly self-confident, belligerent assertions; theygive him the benefit of the doubt—and are left in helplessly bewilderedconfusion. It is thus that the social metaphysicians can victimize the young,the innocent, the conscientious.This is particularly prevalent in college classrooms. Many professors use theArgument from Intimidation to stifle independent thinking among the students, toevade questions they cannot answer, to discourage any critical analysis of theirarbitrary assumptions or any departure from the intellectual status quo.“Aristotle? My dear fellow—” (a weary sigh) “if you had read ProfessorSpiffkin’s piece in—” (reverently) “the January 1912 issue of Intellectmagazine, which—” (contemptuously) “you obviously haven’t, you would know—”(airily) “that Aristotle has been refuted.”“Professor X?” (X standing for the name of a distinguished theorist offree-enterprise economics.) “Are you quoting Professor X? Oh no, notreally!”—followed by a sarcastic chuckle intended to convey that Professor X hadbeen thoroughly discredited. (By whom? Blank out.)Such teachers are frequently assisted by the “liberal” goon squad of theclassroom, who burst into laughter at appropriate moments.In our political life, the Argument from Intimidation is the almost exclusivemethod of discussion. Predominantly, today’s political debates consist of smearsand apologies, or imtimidation and appeasement. The first is usually (though notexclusively) practiced by the “liberals,” the second by the “conservatives.” Thechampions, in this respect, are the “liberal” Republicans who practice both: thefirst, toward their “conservative” fellow Republicans—the second, toward theDemocrats.All smears are Arguments from Intimidation: they consist of derogatoryassertions without any evidence or proof, offered as a substitute for evidenceor proof, aimed at the moral cowardice or unthinking credulity of the hearers.The Argument from Intimidation is not new; it has been used in all ages andcultures, but seldom on so wide a scale as today. It is used more crudely inpolitics than in other fields of activity, but it is not confined to politics.It permeates our entire culture. It is a symptom of cultural bankruptcy.How does one resist that Argument? There is only one weapon against it: moralcertainty.When one enters any intellectual battle, big or small, public or private, onecannot seek, desire or expect the enemy’s sanction. Truth or falsehood must beone’s sole concern and sole criterion of judgment—not anyone’s approval ordisapproval; and, above all, not the approval of those whose standards are theopposite of one’s own.Let me emphasize that the Argument from Intimidation does not consist ofintroducing moral judgment into intellectual issues, but of substituting moraljudgment for intellectual argument. Moral evaluations are implicit in mostintellectual issues; it is not merely permissible, but mandatory to pass moraljudgment when and where appropriate; to suppress such judgment is an act ofmoral cowardice. But a moral judgment must always follow, not precede (orsupersede), the reasons on which it is based.When one gives reasons for one’s verdict, one assumes responsibility for it andlays oneself open to objective judgment: if one’s reasons are wrong or false,one suffers the consequences. But to condemn without giving reasons is an act ofirresponsibility, a kind of moral “hit-and-run” driving, which is the essence ofthe Argument from Intimidation.Observe that the men who use that Argument are the ones who dread a reasonedmoral attack more than any other kind of battle—and when they encounter amorally confident adversary, they are loudest in protesting that “moralizing”should be kept out of intellectual discussions. But to discuss evil in a mannerimplying neutrality, is to sanction it.The Argument from Intimidation illustrates why it is important to be certain ofone’s premises and of one’s moral ground. It illustrates the kind ofintellectual pitfall that awaits those who venture forth without a full, clear,consistent set of convictions, wholly integrated all the way down tofundamentals—those who recklessly leap into battle, armed with nothing but a fewrandom notions floating in a fog of the unknown, the unidentified, theundefined, the unproved, and supported by nothing but their feelings, hopes andfears. The Argument from Intimidation is their Nemesis. In moral andintellectual issues, it is not enough to be right: one has to know that one isright.The most illustrious example of the proper answer to the Argument fromIntimidation was given in American history by the man who, rejecting the enemy’smoral standards and with full certainty of his own rectitude, said:“If this be treason, make the most of it.” (July 1964)"},{"pageContent":"INDEXPrepared by Allan GotthelfALTRUISMDEFINITION OFPSYCHOLOGICAL RESULTS OFSEE ALSO COLLECTIVISM: PSYCHOLOGY OFSEE ALSO COLLECTIVISM; MYSTICISMANARCHYANTITRUST LAWSARISTOTLEARTANTI-HERO INAS ENJOYMENTMODERNSUBSIDIZEDATLAS SHRUGGED (AYN RAND)AUTOMATIONBENTHAM, JEREMYBERLIN, EAST AND WESTBILL OF RIGHTS, THE“BLACK-AND-WHITE” IN ETHICSBRANDEN, BARBARABRANDEN, NATHANIELCAPITALISMATTACKS ONAND PROGRESSCENSORSHIPCOLLECTIVISMDEFINITION OFPSYCHOLOGY OFSEE ALSO ALTRUISMCOMPROMISESEE ALSO “BLACK-AND-WHITE” IN ETHICSCOMTE, AUGUSTECONCEPTSDEFINITION OFFORMATION OFSEE ALSO REASONCONSCIOUSNESSAS BASIC MEANS OF SURVIVALMAN’SFOCUSING OFPROPER FUNCTION OFSABOTAGE OFUNFOCUSING OFVOLITIONAL; SEE VOLITIONSEE ALSO CONCEPTS; LIFE: MAN’S; PERCEPTION; REASON; SENSATION“CONSERVATIVES”CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATESCONTEXT-DROPPINGCONTRACTSCUBADECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, THE.DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLATFORM (1960)DESIRESIN RELATION TO ETHICS SEE ALSO EMOTIONS; WHIMSDICTATORSHIPCHARACTERISTICS OF SEE ALSO CUBA; GERMANY, NAZI; RUSSIA, SOVIETDOSTOEVSKY, FYODOREGOISM; SEE SELFISHNESSEMOTIONSEMOTIONAL MECHANISMSEE ALSO DESIRES; WHIMSEND IN ITSELFENGLANDETHICAL SUBJECTIVISM; SEE SUBJECTIVISM, ETHICALETHICAL THEORIESETHICS, OBJECTIVISTFUNDAMENTALS OFBASIC POLITICAL PRINCIPLEBASIC SOCIAL PRINCIPLEBENEFICIARY OF MORAL ACTIONCARDINAL VALUESCARDINAL VIRTUESDEFINITION OF GOOD AND EVILHIGHEST MORAL PURPOSEMAN’S NEED OF ETHICSSTANDARD OF VALUEVALIDATION OF A RATIONAL ETHICSSEE ALSO METAETHICS; RATIONALITY; REASON; RIGHTSEVILDEFINITION OFEXISTENTIALISM“EXTREMISM”FAITHDEFINITION OFAND MENTAL HEALTHAND MORALITY SEE ALSO MYSTICISMFALLACY OF THE ARGUMENT FROM INTIMIDATIONFOR THE NEW INTELLECTUAL (AYN RAND)FORCEINITIATION OFIN RETALIATIONSEE ALSO GOVERNMENTFOUNTAINHEAD, THE (AYN RAND)FREE SPEECH SEE ALSO CENSORSHIPFREE TRADEFREE WILL; SEE VOLITIONFREEDOM; SEE CAPITALISM; RIGHTSFRIENDSHIPGERMANY, NAZIGOODDEFINITION OF SEE ALSO ETHICS, OBJECTIVISTGOVERNMENTNATURE OFPROPER FUNCTIONS OFPURPOSE OFVOLUNTARY FINANCING OF SEE ALSO DICTATORSHIPHAPPINESSDEFINITION OFTHE FALLACY IN HEDONISMAND LIFEAS MORAL PURPOSEAND REASONAND VALUES SEE ALSO PLEASUREHEDONISMHELP TO OTHERS, NON-SACRIFICIALHENRY, PATRICK, QUOTEDHONESTYHUMILITYINDEPENDENCEINDIVIDUALISM SEE ALSO SELFISHNESSINTEGRITYINTERESTS, “CONFLICTS” OFJUSTICELAISSEZ-FAIRE CAPITALISM; SEE CAPITALISMLAW, OBJECTIVELAW OF IDENTITY“LIBERALS”LIFEANIMALDERIVATION OF VALUE FROMAS ETHICAL PURPOSEAND HAPPINESSMAN’SPLANTAS STANDARD OF VALUEAS ULTIMATE VALUELOVEAND ALTRUISMROMANTIC-SEXUALAS SELFISHMAN, NATURE OF SEE ALSO LIFE: MAN’S; RATIONALITY; REASONMENTAL HEALTHSTANDARD OF SEE ALSO SELF-ESTEEMMETAETHICSDEFINITION OF ETHICSDEFINITION OF VALUEFIRST QUESTION OF ETHICS SEE ALSO ETHICS, OBJECTIVIST: VALIDATION OF A RATIONALETHICSMILL, JOHN STUARTMIND; SEE REASONMINOW, NEWTON N.MIXED ECONOMYMORAL JUDGMENT, NECESSITY OFMYSTICISMIN ETHICS SEE ALSO FAITHNEUROSISNEW YORK TIMES, THENIETZSCHE, FRIEDRICHNOTES FROM UNDERGROUND (F.
