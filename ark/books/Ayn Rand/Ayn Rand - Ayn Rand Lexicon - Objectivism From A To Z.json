Her writing, accordingly, is extensive, and the rangeof issues she covers enormous—so much so that it is often difficult for a readerto know where in her many books and articles to look for a specific formulationor topic. Even Miss Rand herself was sometimes hard-pressed in this regard.The Ayn Rand Lexicon solves this problem. It is a compilation of key statementsfrom Ayn Rand (and from a few other authorized Objectivist texts) on severalhundred alphabetized topics in philosophy and related fields. The book wasinitially conceived by Harry Binswanger, who undertook it during Miss Rand’slifetime with her permission and approval.Two different audiences can profit from the Lexicon. Those who know Miss Rand’sworks will find it a comprehensive guide to the literature. It will enable themto locate topics or passages easily, and—by virtue of its detailed indexes andcross-references—to check on their wider context and ramifications. Newcomers toAyn Rand will find the book an intriguing introduction to her thought, oneeminently suited to browsing. Many such browsers, I venture to say, aftersampling the entries under REASON, SELFISHNESS, CAPITALISM, and a few more suchtopics, will become hooked by the logic and originality of Ayn Rand’s ideas. Ifthis happens to you, the next step is to turn to one of her books.By its nature, this kind of project requires an editor with a professionalknowledge of philosophy in general and of Ayn Rand’s philosophy, Objectivism, inparticular. Harry Binswanger qualifies on both counts. He is a Ph.D. fromColumbia University and taught philosophy for many years at Hunter College. Dr.Binswanger was an associate of Miss Rand’s. He taught Objectivism at the NewSchool in New York City, and assisted in a course on the subject at theUniversity of California (Berkeley). At present, Dr. Binswanger is editor of TheObjectivist Forum, a magazine that applies Objectivism to philosophical andcultural issues.In preparing the Lexicon, Dr. Binswanger has done a thorough and meticulous job.He has covered not only the familiar works of Ayn Rand, but also obscure andlittle-known sources. He has done the excerpting skillfully and accurately,always selecting essentials; as a result, the passages he offers are generallyself-contained and self-intelligible. And he has arranged the material within agiven topic in a logical sequence, each excerpt building on the earlier ones. Ifone reads straight through a topic, one will discover not a series ofdisconnected sentences, but a definite structure and development; this makes thereading even more illuminating and enjoyable.The Lexicon is a welcome addition to the growing Ayn Rand Library, of which itis Volume IV. It is going to be extremely helpful to me personally, and I amhappy to recommend it to anyone interested in the thought of Ayn Rand. Sheherself, I know, would have been pleased to see it become a reality. —Leonard Peikoff South Laguna, California January 1986"},{"pageContent":"Editor’s PrefaceTHE philosophic WRITINGS of Ayn Rand and her associates have grown to includealmost two thousand pages distributed among eight books—plus various lecturecourses, newsletter articles, and pamphlets. Accordingly, I conceived the ideaof creating a reference work, organized by topic, to function as an Objectivistdictionary or mini-encyclopedia.I first proposed this idea to Ayn Rand in 1977. She was originally somewhatskeptical about its feasibility, being concerned as to whether her writingswould lend themselves to the kind of excerpting that would be required. To sellher on the project, I wrote a detailed prospectus of the book and worked up asample—the entries beginning with the letter “N.” She was favorably impressedwith the results and gave me permission to go ahead. She commented extensivelyon several dozen entries, helping me to define appropriate standards forexcerpting and topic selection.As the work progressed, Miss Rand became increasingly enthusiastic about theproject. One value of the book had special meaning to her: it eliminates anyshred of excuse (if ever there had been one) for the continual grossmisrepresentation of her philosophy at the hands of hostile commentators. As shequipped to me, “People will be able to took up BREAKFAST and see that I did notadvocate eating babies for breakfast.”Miss Rand had intended to read over the entire book, but after cornpleting theletter “A” I had to shelve the project in order to found and edit TheObjectivist Forum, and did not resume work on it until two years after herdeath. Consequently, she read only about 10 percent of the material.I have endeavored to cull from the Objectivist corpus all the significant topicsin philosophy and closely allied fields, such as psychology, economics, andintellectual history. The Lexicon, however, does not cover Ayn Rand’s fictionwritings, except for those philosophical passages from her novels that werereprinted in her book For the New Intellectual. Material by authors other thanMiss Rand is included only if she had given it an explicit public endorsement—aswith Leonard Peikoff’s book The Ominous Parallels and his lecture course “ThePhilosophy of Objectivism”—or if it was originally published under hereditorship in The Objectivist Neusletier, The Objectivist, or The Ayn RandLetter. I have also made use of four Objectivist Forum articles that Miss Randread and approved.To keep the book to a manageable size, I have had to omit many passages whichcould have been included. I have sought to include under each heading only theessential passages, roughly proportioning the length of the entries to theirscope and importance, within the limits of the amount of material available inthe sources. The entry under Immanuel Kant, for instance, is as long as it isnot merely because Miss Rand had so much to say about Kant’s philosophy, butbecause of his immense influence on the history of philosophy, and thus onhistory proper. Miss Rand regarded Kant as her chief philosophical antagonist.Nevertheless, I may have missed some passages that merit inclusion, and readersare invited to send me any such passages c/o New American Library for theirpossible inclusion in future editions. For some headings (e.g., KNOWLEDGE), Igive only the term’s definition and rely on the cross-references to lead thereader to other topics for elaboration.In accordance with Miss Rand’s wishes, I have included statements about otherphilosophies only in selected instances: on Aristotle (whose system is theclosest to that of Objectivism), on Kant (whose system is the diametricalopposite of Objectivism), on Friedrich Nietzsche (whose views, thoughfundamentally opposed to Ayn Rand’s, are often taken to be similar), on JohnStuart Mill (the philosophical father of today’s “conservatives”), and on someinfluential contemporary schools: Pragmatism, Logical Positivism, and LinguisticAnalysis. Those interested in the Objectivist analysis of other philosophies mayconsult For the New Intellectual and The Ominous Parallels.In a number of instances, I have used oral material from Leonard Peikoff’stape-recorcfed lecture courses. Dr. Peikoff has edited these passages for thispurpose. I have also included a few statements by Miss Rand from thequestion-and-answer periods following these lectures. Miss Rand’s answers, whichwere wholly extemporaneous, are presented virtually unedited.In excerpting from written material, I have sought to minimize the clutter ofellipses and square brackets. Where I have excised material from within acontinuous passage, I have, of course, used ellipses to indicate that deletion.But I have not used ellipses at the beginning or end of entire passages, evenwhen I have made initial or terminal cuts. Thus, the reader is put on noticethat, at the beginning of a passage, some words from the start of the originalsentence may have been dropped. Likewise, at the end of a passage, sentences inthe original may continue on beyond where they end here.Square brackets are used to indicate my own interpolated words or introductorynotes (except that I have retained the square brackets used by Ayn Rand, LeonardPeikoff, etc. to insert their own comments within a direct quotation fromsomeone else). In a few instances, I have deleted italics, but as a rule theyare as they appear in the original texts; in no case did I add italics.Some entry headings appear in quotation marks. The quotes are used to indicateeither a concept that Objectivism regards as invalid or obfuscatory (as with“COLLECTIVE RIGHTS”), or a term used in a new or special sense (as with “STOLENCONCEPT,” FALLACY OF). The content of the entry should make clear whichfunction, in a given case, these quotation marks serve.Some explanation is necessary about the manner in which I have identified thesources of the passages quoted. The references include page numbers for bothhardcover and paperback editions when possible (only paperback editions arecurrently available for Intruductiun to Objectivist Epistemology, The New Left:The Anti-Industrial Revolution, and Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal). I have citedthe page number only for the passage’s beginning even when it continues beyondthat page in the original (e.g., a page reference normally given as “54-56”would appear here only as ”54”). And, unless otherwise stated, all quotationsare from Ayn Rand.Note also that paperback page references for The Romantic Manifesto and The NewLeft refer to the second editions of these works. The first edition of theformer did not include “Art and Cognition,” and “The Age of Envy” was notincluded in the first edition of the latter.All the books cited are available in paperback editions from New AmericanLibrary. Much of the other material, including back issues of Miss Rand’speriodicals and some separate pamphlets, is available from The ObjectivistForum, P.O. Box 5311, FDR Station, New York, NY 10150. (When an articlepublished in a periodical has been reprinted in a book, only the book referenceis given.)I wish to thank Leonard Peikoff for his continued encouragement and editorialadvice. Thanks are also due to Allison Thomas Kunze for identifying severalpassages that were worthy of inclusion and to Michael Palumbo for his meticulousassistance in assembling the manuscript.I must stress that the Lexicon is not intended as a substitute for the primarysources from which it is derived. It is a fundamental tenet of Objectivism thatphilosophy is not a haphazard collecaion of out-of-context pronouncements, butan integrated, hierarchically structured system, which has to be studied andjudged as such. For a brief indication of what Objectivism as a philosophicsystem advocates, the reader may refer to the entry, OBJECTIVISM. For a fullerstatement, the best single source is Galt’s speech in Atlas Shrugged (reprintedin For the New Intellectual). -Harry BinswangerNew York CityFebruary 1986"},{"pageContent":"Conceptual IndexTHIS INDEX groups the topics under the headings: Philosophy, Psychology,Economics, and General. Philosophy is broken down into its branches: metaphysics(the study of the fundamental nature of reality and of man), epistemology (thetheory of knowledge), ethics (the science of moral values), politics (includingboth political theory and more concrete public policy issues), and esthetics(the philosophy of art).

An embryo has no riglels. Rights do not pertain to a potential, onlyto an actual being. A child cannot acquire any rights until it is born. Theliving take precedence over the not-yet-living (or the unborn).Abortion is a moral right—which should be left to the sole discretion of thewoman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to beconsidered. Who can conceivably have the right to dictate to her whatdisposition she is to make of the functions of her own body?[“Of Living Death,” TO, Oct. 1968, 6.] Never mind the vicious nonsense of claiming that an embryo has a “right tolife.” A piece of protoplasm has no rights—and no life in the human sense of theterm. One may argue about the later stages of a pregnancy, but the essentialissue concerns only the first three months. To equate a potential with anactual, is vicious; to advocate the sacrifice of the latter to the former, isunspeakable.... Observe that by ascribing rights to the unborn, i.e., thenonliving, the antiabortionists obliterate the rights of the living: the rightof young people to set the course of their own lives. The task of raising achild is a tremendous, lifelong responsibility, which no one should undertakeunwittingly or unwillingly. Procreation is not a duty: human beings are notstock-farm animals. For conscientious persons, an unwanted pregnancy is adisaster; to oppose its termination is to advocate sacrifice, not for the sakeof anyone’s benefit, but for the sake of misery qua misery, for the sake offorbidding happiness and fulfillment to living human beings.[“A Last Survey,” ARL, IV, 2, 3.] If any among you are confused or taken in by the argument that the cells of anembryo are living human cells, remember that so are all the cells of your body,including the cells of your skin, your tonsils, or your ruptured appendix—andthat cutting them is murder, according to the notions of that proposed law.Remember also that a potentiality is not the equivalent of an actuality—and thata human being’s life begins at birth.The question of abortion involves much more than the termination of a pregnancy:it is a question of the entire life of the parents. As I have said before,parenthood is an enormous responsibility; it is an impossible responsibility foryoung people who are ambitious and struggling, but poor; particularly if theyare intelligent and conscientious enough not to abandon their child on adoorstep nor to surrender it to adoption. For such young people, pregnancy is adeath sentence: parenthood would force them to give up their future, and condemnthem to a life of hopeless drudgery, of slavery to a child’s physical andfinancial needs. The situation of an unwed mother, abandoned by her lover, iseven worse.I cannot quite imagine the state of mind of a person who would wish to condemn afellow human being to such a horror. I cannot project the degree of hatredrequired to make those women run around in crusades against abortion. Hatred iswhat they certainly project, not love for the embryos, which is a piece ofnonsense no one could experience, but hatred, a virulent hatred for an unnamedobject. Judging by the degree of those women’s intensity, I would say that it isan issue of self-esteem and that their fear is metaphysical. Their hatred isdirected against human beings as such, against the mind, against reason, againstambition, against success, against love, against any value that brings happinessto human life. In compliance with the dishonesty that dominates today’sintellectual field, they call themselves “pro-life.”By what right does anyone claim the power to dispose of the lives of others andto dictate their personal choices?[“The Age of Mediocrity,” TOF, June 1981, 3.] A proper, philosophically valid definition of man as “a rational animal,” wouldnot permit anyone to ascribe the status of “person” to a few human cells.[Ibid., 2.] See also BIRTH CONTROL; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; LIFE, RIGHT to; MAN; SEX. Absolutes. Reality is an absolute, existence is an absolute, a speck of dust isan absolute and so is a human life. Whether you live or die is an absolute.Whether you have a piece of bread or not, is an absolute. Whether you eat yourbread or see it vanish into a looter’s stomach, is an absolute.[GS, FNI, 216; pb 173.] “There are no absolutes,” they chatter, blanking out the fact that they areuttering an absolute.[Ibid., 192; pb 154.]Just as, in epistemology, the cult of uncertainty is a revolt against reason—so,in ethics, the cult of moral grayness is a revolt against moral values. Both area revolt against the absolutism of reality.[“The Cult of Moral Grayness,” VOS, 99; pb 77.] A moral code impossible to practice, a code that demands imperfection or death,has taught you to dissolve all ideas in fog, to permit no firm definitions, toregard any concept as approximate and any rule of conduct as elastic, to hedgeon any principle, to compromise on any value, to take the middle of any road. Byextorting your acceptance of supernatural absolutes, it has forced you to rejectthe absolute of nature.[GS, FNI, 216; pb 172.] See also AXIOMS; COMPROMISE; METAPHYSICAL vs. MAN-MADE; PRAGMATISM; PRIMACY ofEXISTENCE vs. PRlMACY CONSCIOUSNESS. Abstraction (process of). The act of isolation involved [in concept-formation]is a process of abstraction: i.e., a selective mental focus that takes out orseparates a certain aspect of reality from all others (e.g., isolates a certainattribute from the entities possessing it, or a certain action from the entitiesperforming it, etc.).[ITOE, 11.] The higher animals are able to perceive entities, motions, attributes, andcertain numbers of entities. But what an animal cannot perform is the process ofabstraction—of mentally separating attributes, motions or numbers from entities.It has been said that an animal can perceive two oranges or two potatoes, butcannot grasp the concept “two.”[Ibid., 19.] See also CONCEPT-FORMATION; CONCEPTS; INTEGRATION (MENTAL ). Abstractions and Concretes. Abstractions as such do not exist: they are merelyman’s epistemological method of perceiving that which exists—and that whichexists is concrete.[“The Psycho-Epistemology of Art,” RM, 27; pb 23.]See also CONCEPTS; ENTITY; PERCEPTION; PLATONIC REALLSM. Acting. See Performing Arts. Agnosticism. [There is] a widespread approach to ideas which Objectivismrepudiates altogether: agnosticism. I mean this term in a sense which applies tothe question of God, but to many other issues also, such as extra-sensoryperception or the claim that the stars influence man’s destiny. In regard to allsuch claims, the agnostic is the type who says, “I can’t prove these claims aretrue, but you can’t prove they are false, so the only proper conclusion is: Idon’t know; no one knows; no one can know one way or the other.”The agnostic viewpoint poses as fair, impartial, and balanced. See how manyfallacies you can find in it. Here are a few obvious ones: First, the agnosticallows the arbitrary into the realm of human cognition. He treats arbitraryclaims as ideas proper to consider, discuss, evaluate—and then he regretfullysays, “I don’t know,” instead of dismissing the arbitrary out of hand. Second,the onus-of-proof issue: the agnostic demands proof of a negative in a contextwhere there is no evidence for the positive. “It’s up to you,” he says, “toprove that the fourth moon of Jupiter did not cause your sex life and that itwas not a result of your previous incarnation as the Pharaoh of Egypt.” Third,the agnostic says, “Maybe these things will one day be proved.” In other words,he asserts possibilities or hypotheses with no jot of evidential basis.The agnostic miscalculates. He thinks he is avoiding any position that willantagonize anybody. In fact, he is taking a position which is much moreirrational than that of a man who takes a definite but mistaken stand on a givenissue, because the agnostic treats arbitrary claims as meriting cognitiveconsideration and epistemological respect. He treats the arbitrary as on a parwith the rational and evidentially supported. So he is the ultimateepistemological egalitarian: he equates the groundless and the proved. As such,he is an epistemological destroyer. The agnostic thinks that he is not takingany stand at all and therefore that he is safe, secure, invulnerable to attack.The fact is that his view is one of the falsest—and most cowardly—stands therecan be.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism lecture series (1976), Lecture6.]See also ARBITRARY; ATHEISM; CERTAINTY; “OPEN MIND” and “CLOSED MIND”;SKEPTICISM. Altruism. TheoryWhat is the moral code of altruism? The basic principle of altruism is that manhas no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the onlyjustification of his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moralduty, virtue and value.Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights ofothers. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruismmakes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute, isself-sacrifice—which means; self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial,self-destruction—which means: the self as a standard of evil, the selffess as astandard of the good.Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should notgive a dime to a beggar. That is not the issue. The issue is whether you do ordo not have the right to exist zuithnut giving him that dime. The issue iswhether you must keep buying your life, dime by dime, from any beggar who mightchoose to approach you. The issue is whether the need of others is the firstmortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence. The issue iswhether man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal. Any man of self-esteemwill answer: “No.” Altruism says: “Yes.”[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 74; pb 61.] There are two moral questions which altruism lumps together into one“package-deal”: (1) What are values? (2) Who should be the beneficiary ofvalues? Altruism substitutes the second for the first; it evades the task ofdefining a code of moral values, thus leaving man, in fact, without moralguidance.Altruism declares that any action taken for the benefit of others is good, andany action taken for one’s own benefit is evil. Thus the beneficiary of anaction is the only criterion of moral value—and so long as that beneficiary isanybody other than oneself, anything goes.[“Introduction,” VOS, x; pb viii.] It is your mind that they want you to surrender—all those who preach the creedof sacrifice, whatever their tags or their motives, whether they demand it forthe sake of your soul or of your body, whether they promise you another life inheaven or a full stomach on this earth. Those who start by saying: “It isselfish to pursue your own wishes, you must sacrifice them to the wishes ofothers”—end up by saying: “It is selfish to uphold your convictions, you mustsacrifice them to the convictions of others.” (GS, FNI, 176; pb 142.] Now there is one word—a single word—which can blast the morality of altruism outof existence and which it cannot withstand—the word: “Why?” Why must man livefor the sake of others? Why must he be a sacrificial animal? why is that thegood? There is no earthly reason for it—and. ladies and gentlemen, in the wholehistory of philosophy no earthly reason has ever been given.It is only mysticism that can permit moralists to get away with it. It wasmysticism, the unearthly, the supernatural, the irrational that has always beencalled upon to justify it—or, to be exact, to escape the necessity ofjustification. One does not justify the irrational, one just takes it on faith.What most moralists—and few of their victims—realize is that reason and altruismare incompatible.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 74; pb 61 .] Why is it moral to serve the happiness of others, but not your own? If enjoymentis a value, why is it moral when experienced by others, but immoral whenexperienced by you? If the sensation of eating a cake is a value, why is it animmoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goal for you to achieve in thestomach of others? Why is it immoral for you to desire, but moral for others todo so? Why is it immoral to produce a value and keep it, but moral to give itaway? And if it is not moral for you to keep a value, why is it moral for othersto accept it? If you are selfless and virtuous when you give it, are they notselfish and vicious when they take it? Does virtue consist of serving vice? Isthe moral purpose of those who are good, self-immolation for the sake of thosewho are evil?The answer you evade, the monstrous answer is: No, the takers are not evil,provided they did not earn the value you gave them. It is not immoral for themto accept it, provided they are unable to produce it, unable to deserve it,unable to give you any value in return. It is not immoral for them to enjoy it,provided they do not obtain it by right.Such is the secret core of your creed, the other half of your double standard:it is immoral to live by your own effort, but moral to live by the effort ofothers—it is immoral to consume your own product, but moral to consume theproducts of others—it is immoral to earn, but moral to mooch—it is the parasiteswho are the moral justification for the existence of the producers, but theexistence of the parasites is an end in itself—it is evil to profit byachievement, but good to profit by sacrifice—it is evil to create your ownhappiness, but good to enjoy it at the price of the blood of others.Your code divides mankind into two castes and commands them to live by oppositerules: those who may desire anything and those who may desire nothing, thechosen and the damned, the riders and the carriers, the eaters and the eaten.What standard determines your caste? What passkey admits you to the moral elite?The passkey is lack of value.Whatever the value involved, it is your lack of it that gives you a claim uponthose who don’t lack it. It is your need that gives you a claim to rewards. Ifyou are able to satisfy your need, your ability annuls your right to satisfy it.But a need you are unable to satisfy gives you first right to the lives ofmankind.If you succeed, any man who fails is your master; if you fail, any man whosucceeds is your serf. Whether your failure is just or not, whether your wishesare rational or not, whether your misfortune is undeserved or the result of yourvices, it is misfortune that gives you a right to rewards. It is pain,regardless of its nature or cause, pain as a primary absolute, that gives you amortgage on all of existence.If you heal your pain by your own effort, you receive no moral credit: your coderegards it scornfully as an act of self-interest. Whatever value you seek toacquire, be it wealth or food or love or rights, if you acquire it by means ofyour virtue, your code does not regard it as a moral acquisition: you occasionno loss to anyone, it is a trade, not alms; a payment, not a sacrifice. Thedeserved belongs in the selfish, commercial realm of mutual profit; it is onlythe undeserved that calls for that moral transaction which consists of profit toone at the price of disaster to the other. To demand rewards for your virtue isselfish and immoral; it is your lack of virtue that transforms your demand intoa moral right.A morality that holds need as a claim, holds emptiness—non-existence —as itsstandard of value; it rewards an absence, a defect: weakness, inability,incompetence, suffering, disease, disaster, the lack, the fault, the flaw—thezero.[GS, FNI, 178; pb 144.] Altruism holds death as its ultimate goal and standard of value.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 33; pb 34.] Since nature does not provide man with an automatic form of survival, since hehas to support his life by his own effort, the doctrine that concern with one’sown interests is evil means that man’s desire to live is evil—that man’s life,as such, is evil. No doctrine could be more evil than that.Yet that is the meaning of altruism.[“Introdttction,” VOS, xii; pb ix.] Practice Observe what this beneficiary-criterion of [the altruist] morality does to aman’s life. the first thing he learns is that morality is his enemy: he hasnothing to gain from it, he can only lose; self-inflicted loss, self-inflictedpain and the gray, debilitating pall of an incomprehensible duty is all that hecan expect. He may hope that others might occasionally sacrifice themselves forhis benefit, as he grudgingly sacrifices himself for theirs, but he knows thatthe relationship will bring mutual resentment, not pleasure—and that, morally,their pursuit of values will be like an exchange of unwanted, unchosen Christmaspresents, which neither is morally permitted to buy for himself. Apart from suchtimes as he manages to perform some act of self-sacrifice, he possesses no moralsignificance: morality takes no cognizance of him and has nothing to say to himfor guidance in the crucial issues of his life; it is only his own personal,private, “selfish” life and, as such, it is regarded either as evil or, at best,amoral.[Ibid., xi; pb viii.] Even though altruism declares that “it is more blessed to give than to receive,”it does not work that way in practice. The givers are never blessed; the morethey give, the more is demanded of them; complaints, reproaches and insults arethe only response they get for practicing altruism’s virtues (or for theiractual virtues). Altruism cannot permit a recognition of virtue; it cannotpermit self-esteem or moral innocence. Guilt is altruism’s stock in trade, andthe inducing of guilt is its only means of self-perpetuation. If the giver isnot kept under a torrent of degrading, demeaning accusations, he might take alook around and put an end to the self-sacrificing.Altruists are concerned only with those who suffer—not with those who providerelief from suffering, not even enough to care whether they are able to survive.When no actual suffering can be found, the altruists are compelled to invent ormanufacture it.[“Moral Inflation,” ARL., III, 13, 2.] Some unphilosophical, eclectic altruists, invoking such concepts as “inalienablerights,” “personal freedom,” “private choice,” have claimed that service toothers, though morally obligatory, should not be compulsory. The committed,philosophical altruists, however, are consistent: recognizing that such conceptsrepresent an individualist approach to ethics and that this is incompatible withthe altruist morality, they declare that there is nothing wrong with compulsionin a good cause—that the use of force to counteract selfishness is ethicallyjustified—and more: that it is ethically mandatory.Every man, they argue, is morally the property of others—of those others it ishis lifelong duty to serve; as such, he has no moral right to invest the majorpart of his time and energy in his own private concerns. If he attempts it, ifhe refuses voluntarily to make the requisite sacrifices, he is by that factharming others, i.e., depriving them of what is morally theirs—he is violatingmen’s rights, i.e., the right of others to his service —he is a moraldelinquent, and it is an assertion of morality if others forcibly intervene toextract from him the fulfillment of his altiuist obligations, on which he isattempting to default. Justice, they conclude, “social justice,” demands theinitiation of force against the non-sacrificial individual; it demands thatothers put a stop to his evil. Thus has moral fervor been joined to the rule ofphysical force, raising it from a criminal tactic to a governing principle ofhuman relationships. [Leonard Peikoff, “Altruism, Pragmatism, and Brutality,”ARL. II, 6, 3.] The social system based on and consonant with the altruist morality —with thecode of self-sacrifice—is socialism, in all or any of its variants: fascism,Nazism, communism. All of them treat man as a sacrificial animal to be immolatedfor the benefit of the group, the tribe, the society, the state. Soviet Russiais the ultimate result, the final product, the full, consistent embodiment ofthe altruist morality in practice; it represents the only way that that moralitycan ever be practiced.[“Conservatism: An Obituary,” CUI, 195.] America’s inner contradiction was the altruist-collectivist ethics. Alauism isincompatible with freedom, with capitalism and with individual rights. Onecannot combine the pursuit of happiness with the moral status of a sacrificialanimal.[“Man’s Rights,., VOS, 127; pb 95.] From her start, America was torn by the clash of her political system with thealtruist morality. Capitalism and altruism are incompatible; they arephilosophical opposites; they cannot co-exist in the same man or in the samesociety. Today, the conflict has reached its ultimate climax; the choice isclear-cut: either a new morality of rational self-interest, with itsconsequences of freedom, justice, progress and man’s happiness on earth—or theprimordial morality of altruism, with its consequences of slavery, brute force,stagnant terror and sacrificial furnaces.[“For the New Intellecrual.” FNI. 62: pb 54.] PsychologyIt is obvious why the morality of altruism is a tribal phenomenon. Prehistoricalmen were physically unable to survive without clinging to a tribe for leadershipand protection against other tribes. The cause of altruism’s perpetuation intocivilized eras is not physical, but psycho-epistemological : the men ofself-arrested, perceptual mentality ate unable to survive without triballeadership and “protection” against reality. The doctrine of self-sacrifice doesnot offend them: they have no sense of self or of personal value—they do notknow what it is that they are asked to sacrifice—they have no firsthand inklingof such things as intellectual integrity, love of truth, personally chosenvalues, or a passionate dedication to an idea. When they hear injunctionsagainst “selfishness,” they believe that what they must renounce is the brute,mindless whim-worship of a tribal lone wolf. But their leaders—the theoreticiansof ahruism—know better. Immanuel Kant knew it; John Dewey knew it; B. F. Skinnerknows it; John Rawls knows it. Observe that it is not the mindless brute, butreason, intelligence, ability, merit, self-confidence, self-esteem that they areout to destroy.[“Selfishness Without a Self,” PWNI, 61; pb 50.] The advocates of mysticism are motivated not by a quest for truth, but by hatredfor man’s mind; ... the advocates of altruism are motivated not by compassionfor suffering, but by hatred for man’s life.[“An Untitled Letter,” PWNI, 123; pb 102.] The psychological results of altruism may be observed in the fact that a greatmany people approach the subject of ethics by asking such questions as: “Shouldone risk one’s life to help a man who is: a) drowning, b) trapped in a fire, c)stepping in front of a speeding truck, d) hanging by his fingernails over anabyss?”Consider the implications of that approach. If a man accepts the ethics ofaltruism, he suffers the following consequences (in proportion to the degree ofhis acceptance):1. Lack of seif-esteem—since his first concern in the realm of values is not howto live his life, but how to sacrifice it.2. Lack of respect for others—since he regards mankind as a herd of doomedbeggars crying for someone’s help.3. A nightmare view of existence—since he believes that men are trapped in a“malevolent universe” where disasters are the constant and primary concern oftheir lives.4. And, in fact, a lethargic indifference to ethics, a hopelessly cynicalamorality—since his questions involve situations which he is not likely ever toencounter, which bear no relation to the actual problems of his own life andthus leave him to live without any moral principles whatever.By elevating the issue of helping others into the central and primary issue ofethics, altruism has destroyed the concept of any authentic benevolence or goodwill among men. It has indoctrinated men with the idea that to value anotherhuman being is an act of selflessness, thus implying that a man can have nopersonal interest in others—that to value another means to sacrificeoneself—that any love, respect or admiration a man may feel for others is notand cannot be a source of his own enjoyment, but is a threat to his existence, asacrifical blank check signed over to his loved ones.The men who accept that dichotomy but choose its other side, the ultimateproducts of altruism’s dehumanizing influence, are those psychopaths who do notchallenge altruism’s basic premise, but proclaim their rebellion againstself-sacrifice by announcing that they are totally indifferent to anythingliving and would not lift a finger to help a man or a dog left mangled by ahit-and-run driver (who is usually one of their own kind).[“The Ethics of Emergencies,” VOS, 46; pb 43.] [Intellectual appeasement] is an attempt to apologize for his intellectualconcerns and to escape from the loneliness of a thinker by professing that histhinking is dedicated to some social-altruistic goal. It is an attempt thatamounts to the wordless equivalent of the plea: “I’m not an outsider! I’m yourfriend! Please forgive me for using my mind—I’m using it only in order to serveyou!”Whatever remnants of personal value he may preserve after a deal of that kind,self-esteern is not one of them.Such decisions are seldom, if ever, made consciously. They are made gradually,by subconscious emotional motivation and semi-conscious rationalization.Altruism offers an arsenal of such rationalizations: if an unformed adolescentcan tell himself that his cowardice is humanitarian love, that his subservienceis unselfishrress, that his moral treason is spiritual nobility, he is hooked.[“Altruism as Appeasement,” TO, Jan. 1966, 2.] The injunction “don’t judge” is the ultimate climax of the altruist moralitywhich, today, can be seen in its naked essence. When men plead for forgiveness,for the nameless, cosmic forgiveness of an unconfessed evil, when they reactwith instantaneous compassion to any guilt, to the perpetrators of any atrocity,while turning away indifferently from the bleeding bodies of the victims and theinnocent—one may see the actual purpose, motive and psychological appeal of thealtruist code. When these same compassionate men turn with snarling hatred uponanyone who pronounces moral judgments, when they scream that the only evil isthe determination to fight against evil—one may see the kind of moral blankcheck that the altruist morality hands out.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 50; pb 45.] See also CHARITY; COLLECTIVISM; “DUTY”; KANT, IMMANUEL; MORALITY; MYSTICISM;SACRIFICE; SELFISHNESS; SELFLESSNESS; SOVIET RUSSIA; SUFFERING; TRIBALISM.Ambition. “Ambition” means the systematic pursuit of achievement and of constantimprovement in respect to one’s goal. Like the word “selfishness,” and for thesame reasons, the word “ambition” has been perverted to mean only the pursuit ofdubious or evil goals, such as the pursuit of power; this left no concept todesignate the pursuit of actual values. But “ambition” as such is a neutralconcept: the evaluation of a given ambition as moral or immoral depends on thenature of the goal. A great scientist or a great artist is the most passionatelyambitious of men. A demagogue seeking political power is ambitious. So is asocial climber seeking “prestige.” So is a modest laborer who worksconscientiously to acquire a home of his own. The common denominator is thedrive to improve the conditions of one’s existence, however broadly or narrowlyconceived. (“Improvement” is a moral term and depends on one’s standard ofvalues. An ambition guided by an irrational standard does not, in fact, lead toimprovement, but to self-destruction.)[“Tax Credits for Education,” ARL, I, 12, 1.] Politically, the goal of today’s dominant trend is statism. Philosophically, thegoal is the obliteration of reason; psychologically, it is the erosion ofambition.The political goal presupposes the two others. The human characteristic requiredby statism is docility, which is the product of hopelessness and intellectualstagnation. Thinking men cannot be ruled; ambitious men do not stagnate.[Ibid.] See also C:AREER; PRODUCTIVENESS; PURPOSE; VALUES. America. I can say—not as a patriotic bromide, but with full knowledge of thenecessary metaphysical, epistemological, ethical, political and estheticroots—that the United States of America is the greatest, the noblest and, in itsoriginal founding principles, the only moral country in the history of theworld.[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 12; pb 10.] Since the golden age of Greece, there has been only one era of reason intwenty-three centuries of Western philosophy. During the final decades of thatera, the United States of America was created as an independent nation. This isthe key to the country—to its nature, its development, and its uniqueness: theUnited States is the nation of the Enlightenment.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 101; pb 100.]America’s founding ideal was the princeple of individual rights. Nothingmore—and nothing less. The rest—everything that America achieved, everything shebecame, everything “noble and just,” and heroic, and great, and unprecedented inhuman history—was the logical consequence of fidelity to that one principle. Thefirst consequence was the principle of political freedom, i.e., an individual’sfreedom from physical compulsion, coercion or interference by the government.The next was the economic implementation of political freedom: the system ofcapitalism.[“A Preview,” ARL, 1, 24, 5.] The most profoundly revolutionary y achievement of the United States of Americawas the subordination of society to moral law.The principle of man’s individual rights represented the extension of moralityinto the social system—as a limitation on the power of the state, as man’sprotection against the brute force of the collective, as the subordination ofmight to right. The United States was the first moral society in history.All previous systems had regarded man as a sacrificial means to the ends ofothers, and society as an end in itself, The United States regarded man as anend in himself, and society as a means to the peaceful, orderly, voluntaryco-existence of individuals. All previous systems had held that man’s lifebelongs to society, that society can dispose of him in any way it pleases, andthat any freedom he enjoys is his only by favor, by the permission of society,which may be revoked at any time. The United States held that man’s life is hisby right (which means: by moral principle and by his nature), that a right isthe property of an individual, that society as such has no rights, and that theonly moral purpose of a government is the protection of individual rights.[“Man’s Rights,” VOS, 124; pb 93.] It took centuries of intellectual, philosophical development to achievepolitical freedom. It was a long struggle, stretching from Aristotle to JohnLocke to the Founding Fathers. The system they established was not based onunlimited majority rule, but on its opposite: on individual rights, which werenot to be alienated by majority vote or minority plotting. The individual wasnot left at the mercy of his neighbors or his leaders: the Constitutional systemof checks and balances was scientifically devised to protect him from both.This was the great American achievement—and if concern for the actual welfare ofother nations were our present leaders’ motive, this is what we should have beenteaching the world.[“Theory and Practice,” CUI, 138.]To the glory of mankind, there was, for the first and only time in history, acountry of money—and I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to America,for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement.For the first time, man’s mind and money were set free, and there were nofortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen andslaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, thehighest type of human being—the self-made man—the American industrialist.If you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I wouldchoose—because it contains all the others—the fact that they were the people whocreated the phrase “to make money.” No other language or nation had ever usedthese words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantity—to beseized, begged, inherited, shared, looted or obtained as a favor. Americans werethe first to understand that wealth has to be created.[“The Meaning of Money,” FNI, 111; pb 93.] America’s abundance was not created by public sacrifices to “the common good,”but by the productive genius of free men who pursued their own personalinterests and the making of their own private fortunes. They did not starve thepeople to pay for America’s industrialization. They gave the people better jobs,higher wages, and cheaper goods with every new machine they invented, with everyscientific discovery or technological advance—and thus the whole country wasmoving forward and profiting, not suffering, every step of the way.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 29.] In its great era of capitalism, the United States was the freest country onearth—and the best refutation of racist theories. Men of all races came here,some from obscure, culturally undistinguished countries, and accomplished featsof productive ability which would have remained stillborn in theircontrol-ridden native lands. Men of racial groups that had been slaughtering oneanother for centuries, learned to live together in harmony and peacefulcooperation. America had been called “the melting pot,” with good reason. Butfew people realized that America did not melt men into the gray conformity of acollective: she united them by means of protecting their right to individuality.The major victims of such race prejudice as did exist in America were theNegroes. It was a problem originated and perpetuated by the non-capitalistSouth, though not confined to its boundaries. The persecution of Negroes in theSouth was and is truly disgraceful. But in the rest of the country, so long asmen were free, even that problem was slowly giving way under the pressure ofenlightenment and of the white men’s own economic interests.Today, that problem is growing worse—and so is every other form of racism.America has become race-conscious in a manner reminiscent of the worst days inthe most backward countries of nineteenth-century Europe. The cause is the same:the growth of collectivism and statism.[“Racism,” VOS, 178; pb 130.1 ] The Americans were political revolutionaries but not ethical revolutionaries.Whatever their partial (and largely implicit) acceptance of the principle ofethical egoism, they remained explicitly within the standard European tradition,avowing their primary allegiance to a moral code stressing philanthropic serviceand social duty. Such was the American conflict: an impassioned politicspresupposing one kind of ethics, within a cultural atmosphere professing thesublimity of an opposite kind of ethics.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 117; pb 115.] America’s inner contradiction was the altruist-collectivist ethics. Altruism isincompatible with freedom, with capitalism and with individual rights. Onecannot combine the pursuit of happiness with the moral status of a sacrificialanimal.[“Man’s Rights,” VOS, 127; pb 95.] This country—the product of reason—could not survive on the morality ofsacrifice. It was not built by men who sought self-immolation or by men whosought handouts. It could not stand on the mystic split that divorced man’s soulfrom his body. It could not live by the mystic doctrine that damned this earthas evil and those who succeeded on earth as depraved. From its start, thiscountry was a threat to the ancient rule of mystics. In the brilliantrocket-explosion of its youth, this country displayed to an incredulous worldwhat greatness was possible to man, what happiness was possible on earth. It wasone or the other: America or mystics. The mystics knew it; you didn’t. You letthem infect you with the worship of need-and this country became a giant in bodywith a mooching midget in place of its soul, while its living soul was drivenunderground to labor and feed you in silence, unnamed, unhonored, negated, itssoul and hero: the industrialist.[GS, FNI, 228; pb 181.] A dictatorship cannot take hold in America today. This country, as yet, cannotbe ruled—but it can explode. It can blow up into the helpless rage and blindviolence of a civil war. It cannot be cowed into submission, passivity,malevolence, resignation. It cannot be “pushed around.” Defiance, not obedience,is the American’s answer to overbearing authority. The nation that ran anunderground railroad to help human beings escape from slavery, or began drinkingon principle in the face of Prohibition, will not say “Yes, sir,” to theenforcers of ration coupons and cereal prices. Not yet.[“Don’t Let It Go,” PWNI, 260; pb 213.] Americans have known how to erect a superlative material achievement in themidst of an untouched wilderness, against the resistance of savage tribes. Whatwe need today is to erect a corresponding philosophical structure, without whichthe material greatness cannot survive. A skyscraper cannot stand oncrackerbarrels, nor on wall mottoes, nor on full-page ads, nor on prayers, noron meta-language. The new wilderness to reclaim is philosophy, now all butdeserted, with the weeds of prehistoric doctrines rising again to swallow theruins. To support a culture, nothing less than a new philosophical foundationwill do.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 58; pb 50.] America vs. EuropeIt was a European who discovered America, but it was Americans who were thefirst nation to discover this earth and man’s proper place in it, and man’spotential for happiness, and the world which is man’s to win. What they failedto discover is the words to name their achievement, the concepts to identify it,the principles to guide it, i.e., the appropriate philosophy and itsconsequence: an American culture.America has never had an original culture, i.e., a body of ideas derived fromher philosophical (Aristotelian) base and expressing her profound differencefrom all other countries in history.American intellectuals were Europe’s passive dependents and poor relativesalmost from the beginning. They lived on Europe’s drying crumbs and discardedfashions, including even such hand-me-downs as Freud and Wittgenstein. America’ssole contribution* to philosophy—Pragmatism—was a bad recycling ofKantian-Hegelian premises.[“Don’t Let It Go,” PWNI, 256; pb 210.] Europeans do believe in Original Sin, i.e., in man’s innate depravity; Americansdo not. Americans see man as a value—as clean, free, creative, rational. But theAmerican view of man has not been expressed or upheld in philosophical terms(not since the time of our first Founding Father, Aristotle; see his descriptionof the “magnanimous man”).[Ibid., 258; pb 211.]There have never been any “masses” in America: the poorest American is anindividual and, subconsciously, an individualist. Marxism, which has conqueredour universities, is a dismal failure as far as the people are concerned:Americans cannot be sold on any sort of class war; American workers do not seethemselves as a “proletariat,” but are among the proudest of property owners. Itis professors and businessmen who advocate cooperation with SovietRussia—American labor unions do not. [Ibid., 258; pb 212.] America is the land of the uncommon man. It is the land where man is free todevelop his genius—and to get its just rewards. It is the land where each mantries to develop whatever quality he may possess and to rise to whatever degreehe can, great or modest. It is not the land where one glories or is taught toglory in one’s mediocrity.No self-respecting man in America is or thinks of himself as “little,” no matterhow poor he may be. That, precisely, is the difference he-tween an Americanworking man and a European serf.[“Screen Guide for Americans,” Plain Talk, Nov. 1947, 40.] Tribalism (which is the best name to give to all the group manifestations of theanti-conceptual mentality) is a dominant element in Europe, as a reciprocallyreinforcing cause and result of Europe’s long history of caste systems, ofnational and local (provincial) chauvinism, of rule by brute force and endless,bloody wars. As an example, observe the Balkan nations, which are perenniallybent upon exterminating one another over minuscule differences of tradition orlanguage. Tribalism had no place in the United States—until recent decades. Itcould not take root here, its imported seedlings were withering away and turningto slag in the melting pot whose fire was fed by two inexhaustible sources ofenergy: individual rights and objective law; these two were the only protectionman needed.“The Missing Link,” PWNI, 51: pb 42.] A European is disarmed in the face of a dictatorship: he may hate it. but hefeels that he is wrong and, metaphysically, the State is right. An Americanwould rebel to the bottom of his soul....

The clearest symptom by which one can recognize [the amoralist] ishis total inability to judge himself, his actions, or his work by any sort ofstandard. The normal pattern of self-appraisal requires a reference to someabstract value or virtue—e.g.. “I am good because I am rational,” “I am goodbecause I am honest,” even the second-hander’s notion of “I am good becausepeople like me.” Regardless of whether the value-standards involved are true orfalse, these examples imply the recognition of an essential moral principle:that one’s own value has to be earned.The amoralist’s implicit pattern of self-appraisal (which he seldom identifiesor admits) is: “I am good because it’s me.”Beyond the age of about three to five (i.e., beyond the perceptual level ofmental development), this is not an expression of pride or self-esteem, but ofthe opposite: of a vacuum—of a stagnant, arrested mentality confessing itsimpotence to achieve any personal value or virtue.Do not confuse this pattern with psychological subjectivism. A psychologicalsubjectivist is unable fully to identify his values or to prove their objectivevalidity, but he may be profoundly consistent and loyal to them in practice(though with terrible psycho-epistemological difficulty). The amoralist does nothold subjective values; he does not hold any values. The implicit pattern of allhis estimates is: “It’s good because I like it”—“It’s right because I didit”—“It’s true because I want it to be true.” What is the “I” in thesestatements? A physical hulk driven by chronic anxiety.[“Selfishness Without a Self,” PWNI, 60; pb 47.] [The amoralist] will walk over piles of corpses—in order to assert himself?no—in order to hide (or fill) the nagging inner vacuum left by his aborted self.The grim joke on mankind is the fact that he is held up as a symbol ofselfishness.[Ibid., 58; pb 5(l.]See also ANTI-CONCEPTUAL MENTALITY; MORALITY; SELFISII-NESS; SELF; SELF-ESTEEM;TRIBALISM.

Thecognitive function of concepts was undercut by a series of grotesquedevices—such, for instance, as the “analytic-synthetic” dichotomy which, by aroute of tortuous circumlocutions and equivocations, leads to the dogma that a“necessarily” true proposition cannot be factual, and a factual propositioncannot be “necessarily” true.[ITOF, 102.] Objectivism rejects the theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy as false—inprinciple, at root, and in every one of its variants....An analytic proposition is defined as one which can be validated merely by ananalysis of the meaning of its constituent concepts. The critical question is:What is included in “the meaning of a concept”? Does a concept mean theexistents which it subsumes, including all their characteristics? Or does itmean only certain aspects of these existents, designating some of theircharacteristics but excluding others?The latter viewpoint is fundamental to every version of the analytic-syntheticdichotomy. The advocates of this dichotomy divide the characteristics of theexistents subsumed under a concept into two groups: those which are included inthe meaning of the concept, and those—the great majority—which, they claim, areexcluded from its meaning. The dichotomy among propositions follows directly. Ifa proposition links the “included” characteristics with the concept, it can bevalidated merely by an “analysis” of the concept; if it links the “excluded”characteristics with the concept, it represents an act of “synthesis.”[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 127.] The Objectivist theory of concepts undercuts the theory of theanalytic-synthetic dichotomy at its root.... Since a concept is an integrationof units, it has no content or meaning apart from its units. The meaning of aconcept consists of the units-the existents-which it incilidilig all thecharacteristics of these units.Observe that concepts mean existents, not arbitrarily selected portions ofexistents. There is no basis whatever—neither metaphysical nor epistemological,neither in the nature of reality nor of a conceptual consciousness—for adivision of the characteristics of a concept’s units into two groups, one ofwhich is excluded from the concept’s meaning....The fact that certain characteristics are, at a given time, unknown to man, doesnot indicate that these characteristics are excluded from the entity—or from theconcept. A is A; existents are what they are, independent of the state of humanknowledge; and a concept means the existents which it integrates. Thus, aconcept subsumes and includes all the characteristics of its referents, knownand not-yet-known.[ibid., 131.] The theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy has its roots in two types oferror: one epistemological, the other metaphysical. The epistemological error,as I have discussed, is an incorrect view of the nature of concepts. Themetaphysical error is: the dichotomy between necessary and contingent facts.[ibid., 144.] Only in regard to the man-made is it valid to claim: “It happens to be, but itcould have been otherwise.” Even here, the term “contingent” is highlymisleading. Historically, that term has been used to designate a metaphysicalcategory of much wider scope than the realm of human action; and it has alwaysbeen associated with a metaphysics which, in one form or another, denies thefacts of Identity and Causality. The “necessary-contingent” terminology servesonly to introduce confusion, and should be abandoned. What is required in thiscontext is the distinction between the “metaphysical” and the “man-made.” ...Truths about metaphysical and about man-made facts are learned and validated bythe same process: by observation; and, qua truths, both are equally necessary.Some facts are not necessary, but all truths are. [Ibid., 150.1 The failure to recognize that logic is man’s method of cognition, has produced abrood of artificial splits and dichotomies which represent restatements of theanalytic-synthetic dichotomy from various aspects. Three in particular areprevalent today: logical truth vs. factual truth; the logically possible vs. theempirically possible; and the a priori vs. the a posteriori.[Ibid., 152.] The theory of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy presents men with the followingchoice: If your statement is proved, it says nothing about that which exists; ifit is about existents, it cannot be proved. If it is demonstrated by logicalargument, it represents a subjective convention; if it asserts a fact, logiccannot establish it. If you validate it by an appeal to the meanings of yourconcepts, then it is cut off from reality; if you validate it by an appeal toyour percepts, then you cannot be certain of it.[Ibid., 126.] See also CAUSALITY; CONCEPT-FORMATION; CONCEPTS; DEFINITIONS; MEANING (ofCONCEPTS); METAPHYSICAL vs. MAN-MADE; NECESSITY. Anarchism. Anarchy, as a political concept, is a naive floating abstraction: ...a society without an organized government would be at the mercy of the firstcriminal who came along and who would precipitate it into the chaos of gangwarfare. But the possibility of human immorality is not the only objection toanarchy: even a society whose every member were fully rational and faultlesslymoral, could not function in a state of anarchy; it is the need of objectivelaws and of an arbiter for honest disagreements among men that necessitates theestablishment of a government.[“The Nature of Government,” VOS, 152; pb 112.] If a society provided no organized protection against force, it would compelevery citizen to go about armed, to turn his home into a fortress, to shoot anystrangers approaching his door—or to join a protective gang of citizens whowould fight other gangs, formed for the same purpose, and thus bring about thedegeneration of that society into the chaos of gang-rule, i.e., rule by bruteforce, into perpetual tribal warfare of prehistorical savages.The use of physical force—even its retaliatory use—cannot be left at thediscretion of individual citizens. Peaceful coexistence is impossible if a manhas to live under the constant threat of force to he unleashed against him byany of his neighbors at any moment. Whether his neighbors’ intentions are goodor bad, whether their judgment is rational or irrational, whether they aremotivated by a sense of justice or by ignorance or by prejudice or by malice—theuse of force against one man cannot be left to the arbitrary decision ofanother.[Ibid., 146; pb 108.] A recent variant of anarchistic theory, which is befuddling some of the youngeradvocates of freedom, is a weird absurdity called “competing governments.”Accepting the basic premise of the modern statists—who see no difference betweenthe functions of government and the functions of industry, between force andproduction, and who advocate government ownership of business—the proponents of“competing governments” take the other side of the same coin and declare thatsince competition is so beneficial to business, it should also be applied togovernment. Instead of a single, monopolistic government, they declare, thereshould be a number of different governments in the same geographical area,competing for the allegiance of individual citizens. with every citizen free to“shop” and to patronize whatever government he chooses.Remember that forcible restraint of men is the only service a government has tooffer. Ask yourself what a competition in forcible restraint would have to mean.One cannot call this theory a contradiction in terms, since it is ohviouslydevoid of any understanding of the terms “competition” and “government.” Nor canone call it a floating abstraction, since it is devoid of any contact with orreference to reality and cannot be concretized at all, not even roughly orapproximately. One illustration will be sufficient : suppose Mr. Smith, acustomer of Government A, suspects that his next-door neighbor, Mr. Jones, acustomer of Government B, has robbed him; a squad of Police A proceeds to Mr.Jones’ house and is met at the door by a squad of Police B, who declare thatthey do not accept the validity of Mr. Smith’s complaint and do not recognizethe authority of Government A. What happens then? You take it from there.[Ibid., 152; pb 112.] The common denominator of such [advocates of “competing governments”] is thedesire to escape from objectivity (objectivity requires a very long conceptualchain and very abstract principles), to act on whim, and to deal with men ratherthan with ideas—i.e., with the men of their own gang bound by the sameconcretes.[“The Missing Link,” PWNI, 53; pb 44.] Picture a band of strangers marching down Main Street, submachine guns at theready. When confronted by the police, the leader of the band announces: “Me andthe boys are only here to see that justice is done, so you have no right tointerfere with us.” According to the “libertarian” anarchists, in such aconfrontation the police are morally bound to withdraw, on pain of betraying therights of self-defense and free trade.[Harry Binswanger. “Q & A Department: Anarchism,” TOF, Aug. 1981, 12.] Private force is force not authorized by the government, not validated by itsprocedural safeguards, and not subject to its supervision. The government has toregard such private force as a threat—i.e., as a potential violation ofindividual rights. In barring such private force, the government is retaliatingagainst that threat.[Ibid., 11.] See also COMPETITION; GOVERNMENT; ECONOMIC POWER vs. POLITICAL POWER; LAW,OBJECTIVE and NON-OBJECTIVE; OBJECTIVITY; RETALIATORY FORCE; WHIMS/WHIM-WORSHIP. Ancient Greece. The sound of the first human step in recorded history, theprelude to the entrance of the producer on the historical scene, was the birthof philosophy in ancient Greece. All earlier cultures had been ruled, not byreason, but by mysticism: the task of philosophy --the formulation of anintegrated view of man, of existence, of the universe—was the monopoly ofvarious religions. that enforced their views by the authority of a claim tosupernatural knowledge and dictated the rules that controlled men’s lives.Philosophy was born in a period when ... a comparative degree of politicalfreedom undercut the power of mysticism and, for the first time, man was free toface an unobstructed universe, free to declare that his mind was competent todeal with all the problems of his existence and that reason was his only meansof knowledge.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 19; pb 22.] Ancient Greece tore away the heavy shroud of mysticism woven for centuries inmurky temples, and achieved, in three centuries, what Egypt had not dreamed ofin thirty: a civilization that was essentially pro-man and pro-life. Theachievements of the Greeks rested on their confidence in the power of man’smind—the power of reason. For the first time, men sought to understand thecauses of natural phenomena, and gradually replaced superstition with thebeginnings of science. For the first time, men sought to guide their lives bythe judgment of reason, instead of resorting exclusively to divine will andrevelation.The Greeks built temples for their gods, but they conceived of their gods asperfect human beings, rejecting the cats, crocodiles and cow-headedmonstrosities enshrined and worshiped by the Egyptians. Greek gods personifiedabstractions such as Beauty, Wisdom, Justice, Victory, which are proper humanvalues. In the Greek religion, there was no omnipotent mystical authority and noorganized priesthood. The Greek had only a vague idea of, and little interestin, an afterlife.[Mary Ann Sures, “Metaphysics in Marble,” TO, Feb. 1969, 12.]See also ART; HISTORY; MYSTICISM; REASON; PHILOSOPHY. “Anti-Concepts.” An anti-concept is an unnecessary and rationally unusable termdesigned to replace and obliterate some legitimate concept. The use ofanti-concepts gives the listeners a sense of approximate understanding. But inthe realm of cognition, nothing is as bad as the approximate....One of today’s fashionable anti-concepts is “polarization.” Its meaning is notvery clear, except that it is something bad—undesirabte, socially destructive,evil—something that would split the country into irrecortcilable camps andconflicts. It is used mainly in political issues and serves as a kind of“argument from intimidation”: it replaces a discussion of the merits (the truthor falsehood) of a given idea by the menacing accusation that such an idea would“polarize” the country—which is supposed to make one’s opponents retreat,protesting that they didn’t mean it. Mean—what? ...It is doubtfut—even in the midst of today’s intellectual decadence—that onecould get away with declaring explicitly: “Let us abolish all debate onfundamental principles!” (though some men have tried it). If, however, onedeclares: “Don’t let us polarize,” and suggests a vague image of warring campsready to fight (with no mention of the fight’s object), one has a chance tosilence the mentally weary. The use of “polarization” as a pejorative termmeans: the suppression of fundamental principles. Such is the pattern of thefunction of anti-concepts.[“Credibility and Polarization,” ARL, I, 1, 1.] Observe the technique involved ... It consists of creating an artificial,unnecessary, and (rationally) unusable term, designed to replace and obliteratesome legitimate concepts—a term which sounds like a concept, but stands for a“package-deal” of disparate, incongruous, contradictory elements taken out ofany logical conceptual order or context, a “package-deal” whose (approximately)defining characteristic is always a non-essential. This last is the essence ofthe trick.Let me remind you that the purpose of a definition is to distinguish the thingssubsumed under a single concept from all other things in existence; and,therefore, their defining characteristic must always be that essentialcharacteristic which distinguishes them from everything else.So long as men use language, that is the way they will use it. There is no otherway to communicate. And if a man accepts a term with a definition bynon-essentials, his mind will substitute for it the essential characteristic ofthe objects he is trying to designate.... Thus the real meaning of the term willautomatically replace the alleged meaning.[“ ‘Extremism,’ or The Art of Smearing,” CUI, 176.] [Some other terms that Ayn Rand identified as anti-concepts are “consumerisrn,”“duty,” “ethnicity,” “extremism,” “isolationism,” “McCarthyism,” “meritocracy,”and “simplistic.”] See also ARGUMENT from INTIMIDATION; CONCEPTS; DEFINITIONS; INVALID CONCEPTS;“PACKAGE-DEALING,” FALLACY of. Anti-Conceptual Mentality. The main characteristic of this mentality is aspecial kind of passivity: not passivity as such and not across-the-board, butpassivity beyond a certain limit—i.e., passivity in regard to the process ofconceptualization and, therefore, in regard to fundamental principles. It is amentality which decided, at a certain point of development, that it knows enoughand does not care to look further. What does it accept as “enough”? Theimmediately given, directly perceivable concretes of its background....To grasp and deal with such concretes, a human being needs a certain degree ofconceptual development, a process which the brain of an animal cannot perform.But after the initial feat of learning to speak, a child can counterfeit thisprocess, by memorization and imitation. The anti-conceptual mentality stops onthis level of development—on the first levels of abstractions, which identifyperceptual material consisting predominantly of physical objects—and does notchoose to take the next, crucial, fully volitional step: the higher levels ofabstraction from abstractions, which cannot be learned by imitation. (See mybook Introduction to Objectivist Epestencology.) ...The anti-conceptual mentality takes most things as irreducible primaries andregards them as “self-evident.” It treats concepts as if they were (memorized)percepts; it treats abstractions as if they were perceptual concretes. To such amentality, everything is the given: the passage of time, the four seasons, theinstitution of marriage, the weather, the breeding of children, a flood, a fire,an earthquake, a revolution, a book are phenomena of the same order. Thedistinction between the metaphysical and the man-made is not merely unknown tothis mentality, it is incommunicable.[“The Missing Link,” PWNI, 45; pb 38.] [This type of mentality] has learned to speak, but has never grasped the processof conceptualization. Concepts, to him, are merely some sort of code signalsemployed by other people for some inexplicable reason, signals that have norelation to reality or to himself. He treats concepts as if they were percepts,and their meaning changes with any change of circumstances. Whatever he learnsor happens to retain is treated, in his mind, as if it had always been there, asif it were an item of direct awareness, with no memory of how he acquired it—asa random store of unprocessed material that comes and goes at the mercy ofchance.... He does not seek knowledge-he “exposes himself” to “experience,”hoping, in effect, that it will push something into his mind; if nothinghappens, he feels with self-righteous rancor that there is nothing he can doabout it. Mental action, i.e., mental effort—any sort of processing,identifying, organizing, integrating, critical evaluation or control of hismental content—is an alien realm.[“The Age of Envy,” NL, 177.]This mentality is not the product of ignorance (nor is it caused by lack ofintelligence): it is self-made, i.e., self-arrested.[“The Missing Link,” PWNI, 50; pb 42.] In the brain of an anti-conceptual person, the process of integration is largelyreplaced by a process of association. What his subconscious stores andautomatizes is not ideas, but an indiscriminate accumulation of sundryconcretes, random facts, and unidentified feelings, piled into unlabeled mentalfile folders. This works, up to a certain point—i.e., so long as such a persondeals with other persons whose folders are stuffed similarly, and thus no searchthrough the entire filing system is ever required. Within such limits, theperson can be active and willing to work hard....A person of this mentality may uphold some abstract principles or profess someintellectual convictions (without remembering where or how he picked them up).But if one asks him what he means by a given idea, he will not be able toanswer. If one asks him the reasons of his convictions, one will discover thathis convictions are a thin, fragile film floating over a vacuum, like an oilslick in empty space—and one will be shocked by the number of questions it hadnever occurred to him to ask.[Ibid., 47; pb 39.] He seems able to understand a discussion or a rational argument, sometimes evenon an abstract, theoretical level. He is able to participate, to agree ordisagree after what appears to be a critical examination of the issue. But thenext time one meets him, the conclusions he reached are gone from his mind, asif the discussion had never occurred even though he remembers it: he remembersthe event, i.e., a discussion, not its intellectual content.It is beside the point to accuse him of hypocrisy or lying (though some part ofboth is necessarily involved). His problem is much worse than that: he wassincere, he meant what he said in and for that moment. But it ended with thatmoment. Nothing happens in his mind to an idea he accepts or rejects; there isno processing, no integration, no application to himself, his actions or hisconcerns; he is unable to use it or even to retain it. Ideas, i.e.,abstractions, have no reality to him; abstractions involve the past and thefuture, as well as the present; nothing is fully real to him except the present.Concepts, in his mind, become percepts —percepts of people uttering sounds; andpercepts end when the stimuli vanish. When he uses words, his mental operationsare closer to those of a parrot than of a human being. In the strict sense ofthe word, he has not learned to speak.But there is one constant in his mental flux. The subconscious is an integratingmechanism; when left without conscious control, it goes on integrating on itsown—and, like an automatic blender, his subconscious squeezes its clutter oftrash to produce a single basic emotion: fear.[“The Comprachicos,” NI., 218.] It is the fundamentals of philosophy (particularly, of ethics) that ananti-conceptual person dreads above all else. To understand and to apply themrequires a long conceptual chain, which he has made his mind incapable ofholding beyond the first, rudimentary links. If his professed beiiefs—i.e., therules and slogans of his group—are challenged, he feels his consciousnessdissolving in fog. Hence, his fear of outsiders. The word “outsiders,” to him,means the whole wide world beyond the confines of his village or town organg—the world of all those people who do not live by his “rules.” He does notknow why he feels that outsiders are a deadly threat to him and why they fillhim with helpless terror. The threat is not existential, butpsycho-episternulogical: to deal with them requires that he rise above his“rules” to the level of abstract principles. He would die rather than attemptit.“Protection from outsiders” is the benefit he seeks in clinging to his group.What the group demands in return is obedience to its rules, which he is eager toobey: those rules are his protection—from the dreaded realm of abstract thought.[“The Missing Link,” PWNI, 49; pb 40.] Racism is an obvious manifestation of the anti-conceptual mentality. So isxenophobia—the fear or hatred of foreigners (“outsiders”). So is any castesystem, which prescribes a man’s status (i.e., assigns him to a tribe) accordingto his birth; a caste system is perpetuated by a special kind of snobbishness(i.e., group loyalty) not merely among the aristocrats, but, perhaps morefiercely, among the commoners or even the serfs, who like to “know their place”and to guard it jealously against the outsiders from above or from below. So isguild socialism. So is any kind of ancestor worship or of family “solidarity”(the family including uncles, aunts and third cousins). So is any criminal gang.Tribalism ... is the best name to give to all the group manifestations of theanti-conceptual mentality.[Ibid., 50; pb 42.] Observe that today’s resurgence of tribalism is not a product of the lowerclasses—of the poor, the helpless, the ignorant—but of the intellectuals, thecollege-educated “elitists” (which is a purely tribalistic term). Observe theproliferation of grotesque herds or gangs—hippies, yippies, beatniks, peaceniks,Women’s Libs, Gay Libs, Jesus Freaks, Earth Children—which are not tribes, butshifting aggregates of people desperately seeking tribal “protection.”The common denominator of all such gangs is the belief in motion (massdemonstrations), not action—in chanting, not arguing—in demanding, notachieving—in feeling, not thinking—in denouncing “outsiders,” not in pursuingvalues—in focusing only on the “now,” the “today” without a “tomorrow”—inseeking to return to “nature,” to “the earth,” to the mud, to physical labor,i.e., to all the things which a perceptual mentality is able to handle. Youdon’t see advocates of reason and science clogging a street in the belief thatusing their bodies to stop traffic, will solve any problem.[Ibid., 52; pb 43.1 See also CONCEPTS; PERCEPTION; PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY; RAC ISM; REASON; TRIBALISM. Antitrust Laws. The Antitrust laws—an unenforceable, uncompliable, unjudicablemess of contradictions—have for decades kept American businessmen under asilent, growing reign of terror. Yet these laws were created and, to this day,are upheld by the “conservatives,” as a grim monument to their lack of politicalphilosophy, of economic knowledge and of any concern with principles. Under theAntitrust laws, a man becomes a criminal from the moment he goes into business,no matter what he does. For instance, if he charges prices which some buteaucrats judge as too high, he can be prosecuted for monopoly or for asuccessful “intent to monopolize”; if he charges prices lower than those of hiscompetitors, he can be prosecuted for “unfair competition” or “restraint oftrade”; and if he charges the same prices as his competitors, he can beprosecuted for “collusion” or “conspiracy.” There is only one difference in thelegal treatment accorded to a criminal or to a businessman: the criminal’srights are protected much more securely and objectively than the businessman’s.[“Choose Your Issues,” TON, Jan. 1962, 1.] The alleged purpose of the Antitrust laws was to protect competition; thatpurpose was based on the socialistic fallacy that a free, unregulated marketwill inevitably lead to the establishment of coercive monopolies. But, in fact,no coercive monopoly has ever been or ever can be established by means of freetrade on a free market. Every coercive monopoly was created by governmentintervention into the economy: by special privileges, such as franchises orsubsidies, which closed the entry of competitors into a given field, bylegislative action. (For a full demonstration of this fact, I refer you to theworks of the best economists.) The Antitrust laws were the classic example of amoral inversion prevalent in the history of capitalism: an example of thevictims, the businessmen, taking the blame for the evils caused by thegovernment, and the government using its own guilt as a justification foracquiring wider powers, on the pretext of “correcting” the evils.“Free competition enforced by law” is a grotesque contradiction in terms. [“Antitrust: The Rule of Unreason,” TON, Feb. 1962, 1.] [There is only one] meaning and purpose these laws could have, whether theirauthors intended it or not: the penalizing of ability for being ability. thepenalizing of success for being success, and the sacrifice of productive geniusto the demands of envious mediocrity.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 57.]See also CAPITALISM; COMPETITION; ECONOMIC POWER vs. POLITICAL POWER; FREEMARKET; LAW, OBJECTIVE AND NON-OBJECTIVE; MONOPOLY; PROPERTY RIGHTS. Appeasement. Do not confuse appeasement with tactfulness or generosity.Appeasement is not consideration for the feelings of others, it is considerationfor and compliance with the unjust, irrational and evil feelitigs of others. Itis a policy of exempting the emotions of others from moral judgment, and ofwillingness to sacrifice innocent, virtuous victims to the evil malice of suchemotions. [“The Age of Envy.” NL, 160.] The truly and deliberately evil men are a very small minority; it is theappeaser who unleashes them on mankind; it is the appeaser’s intellectualabdication that invites them to take over. When a culture’s dominant trend isgeared to irrationality, the thugs win over the appeasers. When intellectualleaders fail to foster the best in the mixed, unformed, vacillating character ofpeople at large, the thugs are sure to bring out the worst. When the ablest menturn into cowards, the average men turn into brutes.[“Altruism as Appeasement,” TO, Jan. 1966. 6.] It is understandable that men might seek to hide their vices from the eyes ofpeople whose judgment they respect. But there are men who hide their virtuesfrom the eyes of monsters. There are men who apologize for their ownachievements, deride their own values. debase their own character—for the sakeof pleasing those they know to be stupid, corrupt, malicious, evil.[“The Age of Envy,” NL, 158.] [Intellectual appeasement] is an attempt to apologize for his intellectualconcerns and to escape from the loneliness of a thinker by professing that histhinking is dedicated to some social-altruistic goal. It is an attempt thatamounts to the wordless equivalent of the plea: “I’m not an outsider! I’m yourfriend! Please forgive me for using my mind—I’m using it only in order to serveyou!” ... An intellectual appeaser surrenders morality, the realm of values, inorder to be permitted to use his mind. [“Altruism as Appeasement,” TO. Jan. 1966, 2.]See also COMPROMISE; EVIL,- INTEGRITY; MORAL COWARDICE; MORAL JUDGMENT;TACTFULNESS. “A Priori.” The failure to recognize that logic is man’s method of cognition,has produced a brood of artificial splits and dichotomies which representrestatements of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy from various aspects. Three inparticular are prevalent today: logical truth vs. factual truth; the logicallypossible vs. the empirically possible; and the a priori vs. the a posteriori.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 152.] Any theory that propounds an opposition between the logical and the empirical,represents a failure to grasp the nature of logic and its role in humancognition. Man’s knowledge is not acquired by logic apart from experience or byexperience apart from logic, but by the application of logic to experience. Alltruths are the product of a logical identification of the facts of experience.[Ibid., 151.]See also ANALYTIC-SYNTHETIC DICHOTOMY; LOGIC; TRUTH. Arbitrary. “Arbitrary” means a claim put forth in the absence of evidence of anysort, perceptual or conceptual; its basis is neither direct observation nor anykind of theoretical argument. [An arbitrary idea is] a sheer assertion with noattempt to validate it or connect it to reality.If a man asserts such an idea, whether he does so by error or ignorance orcorruption, his idea is thereby epistemologically invalidated. lt has norelation to reality or to human cognition.Remember that man’s consciousness is not automatic, and not automaticallycorrect. So if man is to be able to claim any proposition as true, or even aspossible, he must follow definite epistemological rules, rules designed to guidehis mental processes and keep his conclusions in correspondence to reality. Insum, if man is to achieve knowledge, he must adhere to objective validatingmethods—i.e., he must shun the arbitrary....Since an arbitrary statement has no connection to man’s means of knowledge orhis grasp of reality, cognitively speaking such a statement must be treated asthough nothing had been said.Let me elaborate this point. An arbitrary claim has no cognitive statuswhatever. According to Objectivism, such a claim is not to be regarded as trueor as false. If it is arbitrary, it is entitled to no epistemological assessmentat all; it is simply to be dismissed as though it hadn’t come up.... The truthis established by reference to a body of evidence and within a context; thefalse is pronounced false because it contradicts the evidence. The arbitrary,however, has no relation to evidence, facts, or context. It is the humanequivalent of [noises produced by] a parrot ... sounds without any tie toreality, without content or significance.In a sense, therefore, the arbitrary is even worse than the false. The false atleast has a relation (albeit a negative one) to reality; it has reached thefield of human cognition, although it represents an error—but in that sense itis closer to reality than the brazenly arbitrary.I want to note here parenthetically that the words expressing an arbitrary claimmay perhaps be judged as true or false in some other cognitive context (if andwhen they are no longer put forth as arbitrary), but this is in elevant to thepresent issue, because it changes the epistemological situation. For instance,if a savage utters “Two plus two equals four” as a memorized lesson which hedoesn’t understand or see any reason for, then in that context it is arbitraryand the savage did not utter truth or falsehood (it’s just like the parrotexample). In this sort of situation, the utterance is only sounds; in acognitive context, when the speaker does know the meaning and the reasons, thesame sounds may be used to utter a true proposition. It is inexact to describethis situation by saying, “The same idea is arbitrary in one case and true inanother.” The exact description would be: in the one case the verbiage does notexpress an idea at all, it is merely noise unconnected to reality; to therational man, the words do express an idea: they are conceptual symbols denotingfacts.It is not your responsibility to refute someone’s arbitrary assertion—to try tofind or imagine arguments that will show that his assertion is false. It is afundamental error on your part even to try to do this. The rational procedure inregard to an arbitrary assertion is to dismiss it out of hand, merelyidentifying it as arbitrary, and as such inadmissible and undiscussable.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture6.J There is no escape from the law of identity, neither in the universe with which[one] deals nor in the working of his own consciousness, and if he is to acquireknowledge of the first, he must discover the proper method of using the second;... there is no room for the arbitrary in any activity of man, least of all inhis method of cognition—and just as he has learned to be guided by objectivecriteria in making his physical tools, so he must be guided by objectivecriteria in forming his tools of cognition: his concepts.[ITOE, 110. ] See also AGNOSTICISM; CERTAINTY; OBJECTIVITY; POSSIBLE; PROOF; SKEPTICISM;TRUTH. Argument from Intimidation. There is a certain type of argument which, in fact,is not an argument, but a means of forestalling debate and extorting anopponent’s agreement with one’s undiscussed notions. It is a method of bypassinglogic by means of psychological pressure.... [It] consists of threatening toimpeach an opponent’s character by means of his argument, thus impeaching theargument without debate. Example: “Only the immoral can fail to see thatCandidate X’s argument is false.” ... The falsehood of his argument is assertedarhitrarily and offered as proof of his immorality.In today’s epistemological jungle, that second method is used more frequentlythan any other type of irrational argument. It should be classified as a logicalfallacy and may be designated as “The Argument from Intimidation.”The essential characteristic of the Argument from Intimidation is its appeal tomoral self-doubt and its reliance on the fear, guilt or ignorance of the victim.It is used in the form of an ultimatum demanding that the victim renounce agiven idea without discussion, under threat of being considered morallyunworthy. The pattern is always: “Only those who are evil (dishonest, heartless,insensitive, ignorant, etc.) can hold such an idea.”[“The Argument from Intimidation,” VOS,191: pb 139.] The Argument from Intimidation dominates today’s discussions in two forms. Inpublic speeches and print, it flourishes in the form of long, involved,elaborate structures of unintelligible verbiage, which convey nothing clearlyexcept a moral threat. (“Only the primitive-minded can fail to realize thatclarity is oversimplification.”) But in private, day-by-day experience, it comesup wordlessly, between the lines, in the form of inarticulate sounds conveyingunstated implica-. tions. It relies, not on what is said, but on how it issaid—not on content, but on tone of voice.The tone is usually one of scornful or belligerent incredulity. “Surely you arenot an advocate of capitalism, are you?” And if this does not intimidate theprospective victim—who answers, properly: “I am,”—the ensuing dialogue goessomething like this: “Oh, you couldn’t be! Not really!” “Really.” “But everybodyknows that capitalism is outdated!” “I don’t.” “Oh, come now!” “Since I don’tknow it, will you please tell me the reasons for thinking that capitalism isoutdated?” “Oh. don’t be ridiculous!” “Will you tell me the reasons?” “Well,really, if you don’t know, I couldn’t possibly tell you!”All this is accompanied by raised eyebrows, wide-eyed stares, shrugs, grunts,snickers and the entire arsenal of nonverbal signals communicating ominousinnuendoes and emotional vibrations of a single kind: disapproval.If those vibrations fail, if such debaters are challenged, one finds that theyhave no arguments, no evidence, no proof, no reasons, no ground to stand on—thattheir noisy aggressiveness serves to hide a vacuum—that the Argument fromIntimidation is a confession of intellectual impotence.[Ibid., 193; pb 140.] Let me emphasize that the Argument from Intimidation does not consist ofintroducing moral judgment into intellectual issues, but of substituting moraljudgment for intellectual argument. Moral evaluations are implicit in mostintellectual issues; it is not merely permissible. but mandatory to pass moraljudgment when and where appropriate: to suppress such judgment is an act ofmoral cowardice. But a moral judgment must always follow, not precede (orsupersede), the reasons on which it is based.[Ibid.. 197: pb 143.] How does one resist that Argument? There is only one weapon against it: moralcertainty.When one enters any intellectual battle, big or small, public or private, onecannot seek, desire or expect the enemy’s sanction. Truth or falsehood must beone’s sole concern and sole criterion of judgment—not anyone’s approval ordisapproval; and, above all, not the approval of those whose standards are theopposite of one’s own.[Ibid.]The most illustrious example of the proper answer to the Argument fromIntimidation was given in American history by the man who, rejecting the enemy’smoral standards and with full certainty of his own rectitude, said:“If this be treason, make the most of it.”[Ibid., 198; pb 144.]See also CERTAINTY; LOGIC; MORAL COWARDICE; “PSYCHOLOGIZING. ” Aristotle. If there is a philosophical Atlas who carries the whole of Westerncivilization on his shoulders, it is Aristotle. He has been opposed,misinterpreted, misrepresented, and—iike an axiom—used by his enemies in thevery act of denying him. Whatever intellectual progress men have achieved restson his achievements.Aristotle may be regarded as the cultural barometer of Western history. Wheneverhis influence dominated the scene, it paved the way for one of history’sbrilliant eras; whenever it fell, so did mankind. The Aristotelian revival ofthe thirteenth century brought men to the Renaissance. The intellectualcounter-revolution turned them back toward the cave of his antipode: Plato.There is only one fundamental issue in philosophy: the cognitive efficacy ofman’s mind. The conflict of Aristotle versus Plato is the conflict of reasonversus mysticism. It was Plato who formulated most of philosophy’s basicquestions-and doubts. It was Aristotle who laid the foundation for most of theanswers. Thereafter, the record of their duel is the record of man’s longstruggle to deny and surrender or to uphold and assert the validity of hisparticular mode of consciousness.[Review of J.H. Randall’s Aristotle, TON, May 1963, 18.] Aristotle’s philosophy was the intellect’s Declaration of Independence.Aristotle, the father of logic, should be given the title of the world’s firstintellectual, in the purest and noblest sense of that word. No matter whatremnants of Platonism did exist in Aristotle’s system, his incomparableachievement lay in the fact that he defined the basic principles of a rationalview of existence and of man’s consciousness: that there is only one reality,the one which man perceives—that it exists as an objective absolute (whichmeans: independently of the consciousness, the wishes or the feelings of anyperceiver)—that the task of man’s consciousness is to perceive0, not to create,reality—that abstractions are man’s method of integrating his sensorymateria)—that man’s mind is his only tool of knowledge—that A is A.If we consider the fact that to this day everything that makes us civilizedbeings, every rational value that we possess—inctuding the birth of science, theindustrial revolution, the creation of the United States, even the structure ofour language—is the result of Aristotle’s influence, of the degree to which,explicitly or implicitly, mert accepted his epistemological principles, we wouldhave to say: never have so many owed so much to one man.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 20; pb 22.] Aristotle is the champion of this world, the champion of nature, as against thesupernaturalism of Plato. Denying Plato’s World of Forms, Aristotle maintainsthat there is only one reality: the world of particulars in which we live, theworld men perceive by means of their physical senses. Universals, he holds, aremerely aspects of existing entities, isolated in thought by a process ofselective attention; they have no existence apart from particulars. Reality iscomprised, not of Platonic abstractions, but of concrete, individual entities,each with a definite nature, each obeying the laws inherent in its nature.Aristotle’s universe is the universe of science. The physical world, in hisview, is not a shadowy projection controlled by a divine dimension, but anautonomous, self-sufficient realm. It is an orderly, intelligible, naturalrealm, open to the mind of man.In such a universe, knowledge cannot be acquired by special revelations fromanother dimension; there is no place for ineffable intuitions of the beyond.Repudiating the mystical elements in Plato’s epistemology, Aristotle is thefather of logic and the champion of reason as man’s only means of knowledge.Knowledge, he holds, must be based on and derived from the data of senseexperience; it must be formulated in terms of objectively defined concepts; itmust be validated by a process of logic.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 21; pb 19.] Indicating that the early scientists had discarded Aristotle in rebellionagainst his religious interpreters, Professor Randall points out that theirscientific achievements had, in fact, an unacknowledged Aristotelian base andwere carrying out the implications of Aristotle’s theories.[Review of J.H. Randall’s Aristotle, TON, May 1963, 18.] Let us note ... the radical difference between Aristotle’s view of concepts andthe Objectivist view, particularly in regard to tire issue of essentialcharacteristics.It is Aristotle who first formulated the principles of correct definition. It isAristotle who identified the fact that only concretes exist. But Aristotle heldthat definitions refer to metaphysical essences, which exist in concretes as aspecial element or formative power, and he held that the process ofconcept-formation depends on a kind of direct intuition by which man’s mindgrasps these essences and forms concepts accordingly.Aristotle regarded “essence” as metaphysical; Objectivism regards it asepistemological.[ITOE, 68.] For Aristotle, the good life is one of personal selE-fulfillment. Man shouldenjoy the values of this world. Using his mind to the fullest, each man shouldwork to achieve his own happiness here on earth. And in the process he should beconscious of his own value. Pride, writes Aristotle—a rational pride in oneselfand in one’s moral character—is, when it is earned, the “crown of the virtues.”A proud man does not negate his own identity. He does not sink selflessly intothe community. He is not a promising subject for the Platonic state.Although Aristotle’s writings do include a polemic against the more extremefeatures of Plato’s collectivism, Aristotle himself is not a consistent advocateof political individualism. His own politics is a mixture of statist andantistatist elements. But the primary significance of Aristotle, or of anyphilosopher, does not lie in his politics. It lies in the fundamentals of hissystem: his metaphysics and epistemology.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 21; pb 30.] Throughout history the influence of Aristotle’s philosophy (particularly of hisepistemology) has led in the direction of individual freedom, of man’sliberation from the power of the state ... Aristotle (via John Locke) was thephilosophical father of the Constitution of the United States and thus ofcapitalism ... it is Plato and Hegel, not Aristotle, who have been thephilosophical ancestors of all totalitarian and welfare states, whetherBismarck’s, Lenin’s or Hitler’s.[Review of J.H. Randall’s Aristotle, TON, May 1963, 19.] There is no future for the world except through a rebirth of the Aristotelianapproach to philosophy. This would require an Aristotelian affirmation of thereality of existence, of the sovereignty of reason, of life on earth—and of thesplendor of man.Aristotle and ()bjectivism agree on fundamentals and, as a result, on this lastpoint, also. Both hold that man can deal with reality, can achieve values, canlive non-tragically. Neither believes in man the worm or man the monster; eachupholds man the thinker and therefore man the hero. Aristotle calls him “thegreat-souled man.” Ayn Rand calls him Howard Roark, or John Gait.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 337; pb 311.]See also ANCIENT GREECE; DEFINITIONS; IDENTITY; LOGIC; OBJECTIVISM; PRIDE;RENAISSANCE; ROMANTICISM; SCIENCE; TABULA RASA. Art. Art is a selective re-creation of reality according to an artist’smetaphysical value-judgments. Man’s profound need of art lies in the fact thathis cognitive faculty is conceptual, i.e., that he acquires knowledge by meansof abstractions, and needs the power to bring his widest metaphysicalabstractions into his immediate, perceptual awareness. Art fulfills this need:by means of a selective re-creation, it concretizes man’s fundamental view ofhimself and of existence. It tells man, in effect, which aspects of hisexperience are to be regarded as essential, significant, important. In thissense, art teaches man how to use his consciousness. It conditions or stylizesman’s consciousness by conveying to him a certain way of looking at existence.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 45.] By a selective re-creatiott, art isolates and integrates those aspects ofreality which represent man’s fundamental view of himself and of existence. Outof the countless number of concretes—of single, disorganized and (seemingly)contradictory attributes, actions and entities—an artist isolates the thingswhich he regards as metaphysically essential and integrates them into a singlenew concrete that represents an embodied abstraction.For instance, consider two statues of man: one as a Greek god, the other as adeformed medieval monstrosity. Both are metaphysical estimates of man; both areprojections of the artist’s view of man’s nature; both are concretizedrepresentations of the philosophy of their respective cultures.Art is a concretization of metaphysics. Art brings man’s concepts to theperceptual level of his consciousness and allows him to grasp them directly, asif they were percepts.This is the psycho-epistemological function of art and the reason of itsimportance in man’s life (and the crux of the Objectivist esthetics).[“The Psycho-Epistemology of Art,” RM, 23; pb 19.] Is the universe intelligible to man, or unintelligible and unknowable? Can manfind happiness on earth, or is he doomed to frustration and despair? Does manhave the power of choice, the power to choose his goals and to achieve them, thepower to direct the course of his life—or is he the helpless plaything of forcesbeyond his control, which determine his fate? Is man, by nature, to be valued asgood, or to be despised as evil? These are metaphysical questions, but theanswers to them determine the kind of ethics men will accept and practice; theanswers are the link between metaphysics and ethics. And although metaphysics assuch is not a normative science, the answers to this category of questionsassume, in man’s mind, the function of metaphysical value-judgments, since theyform the foundation of all of his moral values.Consciously or subconsciously, explicitly or implicitly, man knows that he needsa comprehensive view of existence to integrate his values, to choose his goals,to plan his future, to maintain the unity and coherence of his life—and that hismetaphysical value-judgments are involved in every moment of his life, in hisevery choice, decision and action.Metaphysics—the science that deals with the fundamental nature ofreality-involves man’s widest abstractions. It includes every concrete he hasever perceived, it involves such a vast sum of knowledge and such a long chainof concepts that no man could hold it all in the focus of his immediateconscious awareness. Yet he needs that sum and that awareness to guide him—heneeds the power to summon them into full, conscious focus.That power is given to him by art.[Ibid., 21; pb 19.] It is not journalistic information or scientific education or moral guidancethat man seeks from a work of art (though these may be involved as secondaryconsequences), but the fulfillment of a more profound need: a confirmation ofhis view of existence—a confirmation, not in the sense of resolving cognitivedoubts, but in the sense of permitting him to contemplate his abstractionsoutside his own mind, in the form of existential concretes.[“Art and Sense of Life,” RM, 48; pb 38.] As to the role of emotions in art and the subconscious mechanism that serves asthe integrating factor both in artistic creation and in man’s response to art,they involve a psychological phenomenon which we call a sense of life. A senseof life is a pre-conceptual equivalent of metaphysics, an emotional,subconsciously integrated appraisal of man and of existence.[“The Psycho-Epistemology of Art,” RM, 28; pb 24.1 The emotion involved in art is not an emotion in the ordinary meaning of theterm. It is experienced more as a “sense” or a “feel,” but it has twocharacteristics pertaining to emotions: it is automatically immediate and it hasan intense, profoundly personal (yet undefined) value-meaning to the individualexperiencing it. The value involved is life, and the words naming the emotionare: “This is what life means to me.”[“Art and Sense of Life,” RM, 44; pb 35.] Since man lives by reshaping his physical background to serve his purpose, sincehe must first define and then create his values—a rational man needs aconcretized projection of these values, an image in whose likeness he willre-shape the world and himself. Art gives him that image; it gives him theexperience of seeing the full, immediate, concrete reality of his distant goals.Since a rational man’s ambition is unlimited, since his pursuit and achievementof values is a lifelong process—and the higher the values, the harder thestruggte—he needs a moment, an hour or some period of time in which he canexperience the sense of his completed task, the sense of living in a universewhere his values have been successfully achieved. It is like a moment of rest, amoment to gain fuel to move farther. Art gives him that fuel; the pleasure ofcontemplating the objectified reality of one’s own sense of life is the pleasureof feeling what it would be like to live in one’s ideal world.[Ibid., 48; pb 38.] The importance of that experience is not in what he learns from it, but in thathe experiences it. The fuel is not a theoretical principle, not a didactic“message,” but the life-giving fact of experiencing a moment of metaphysicaljoy—moment of love for existence.[“The Goal of My Writing,” RM, 171; pb 170.] Art is man’s metaphysical mirror; what a rational man seeks to see in thatmirror is a salute; what an irrational man seeks to see is a justification—evenif only a justification of his depravity, as a last convulsion of his betrayedself-esteem.Between these two extremes, there lies the immense continuum of men of mixedpremises—whose sense of life holds unresolved, precariously balanced or openlycontradictory elements of reason and unreason—and works of art that reflectthese mixtures. Since art is the product of philosophy (and mankind’s philosophyis tragically mixed), most of the world’s art, including some of its greatestexamples, falls into this category.[“Art and Sense of Life,” RM, 49; pb 39.] Art is the indispensable medium for the communication of a moral ideal.... Thisdoes not mean that art is a substitute for philosophical thought: without aconceptual theory of ethics, an artist would not be able successfully toconcretize an image of the ideal. But without the assistance of art, ethicsremains in the position of theoretical engineering: art is the model-builder....It is important to stress, however, that even though moral values areinextricably involved in art, they are involved only as a consequence, not as acausal determinant: the primary focus of art is metaphysical, not ethical. Artis not the “handmaiden” of morality, its basic purpose is not to educate, toreform or to advocate anything. The concretization of a moral ideal is not atextbook on how to become one. The basic purpose of art is not to teach, but toshow—to hold up to man a concretized image of his nature and his place in theuniverse.Any metaphysical issue will necessarily have an enormous influence on man’sconduct and, therefore, on his ethics; and, since every art work has a theme, itwill necessarily convey some conclusion, some “message,” to its audience. Butthat influence and that “message” are only secondary consequences. Art is notthe means to any didactic end. This is the difference between a work of art anda morality play or a propaganda poster. The greater a work of art, the moreprofoundly universal its theme. Art is not the means of literal transcription.This is the difference between a work of art and a news story or a photograph.[“The Psycho-Epistetnology of Art,” RM, 25; ph 21.] As a re-creation of reality, a work of art has to be representational; itsfreedom of stylization is limited by the requirement of intelligibility; if itdoes not present an intelligible subject, it ceases to be art.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 75.] What are the valid forms of art—and why these? ... The proper forms of artpresent a selective re-creation of reality in terms needed by man’s cognitivefaculty, which includes his entity-perceiving senses, and thus assist theintegration of the various elements of a conceptual consciousness. Literaturedeals with concepts, the visual arts with sight and touch, music with hearing.Each art fulfills the function of bringing man’s concepts to the perceptuallevel of his consciousness and allowing him to grasp them directly, as if theywere percepts. (The performing arts are a means of further concretization.) Thedifferent branches of art serve to unify man’s consciousness and offer him acoherent view of existence. Whether that view is true or false is not anesthetic matter. The crucially esthetic matter is psycho-epistemological: theintegration of a conceptual consciousness.[Ibid., 73.]Art (including literature) is the barometer of a culture. It reflects the sum ofa society’s deepest philosophical values: not its professed notions and slogans,but its actual view of man and of existence.[“Bootleg Romanticism,” RM, 121; pb 129.1See Conceptual Index: Esthetics. Artistic Creation. As to the role of emotions in art and the subconsciousmechanism that serves as the integrating factor both in artistic creation and inman’s response to art, they involve a psychological phenomenon which we call asense of lifr. A sense of life is a pre-conceptual equivalent of metaphysics, anemotional, subconsciously integrated appraisal of man and of existence.[“The Psycho-Epistemology of Art,” RM, 28; pb 24.] It is the artist’s sense of life that controls and integrates his work,directing the innumerable choices he has to make, from the choice of subject tothe subtlest details of style. It is the viewer’s or reader’s sense of life thatresponds to a work of art by a complex, yet automatic reaction of acceptance andapproval, or rejection and condemnation.[“Art and Sense of Life,” RM, 43; pb 34.] The psycho-epistemological process of communication between an artist and aviewer or reader goes as follows: the artist starts with a broad abstractionwhich he has to concretize, to bring into reality by means of the appropriateparticulars; the viewer perceives the particulars, integrates them and graspsthe abstraction from which they came, thus completing the circle. Speakingmetaphorically, the creative process resembles a process of deduction; theviewing process resembles a process of induction.This does not mean that communication is the primary purpose of an artist: hisprimary purpose is to bring his view of man and of existence into reality; butto be brought into reality, it has to be translated into objective (therefore,communicable) terms.I Ibid., 44; pb 35.] An artist does not fake reality—he .stylize.s it. He selects those aspects ofexistence which he regards as metaphysically significant—and by isolating andstressing them, by omitting the insignificant and accidental, he presents hisview of existence. His concepts are not divorced from the facts of reality-theyare concepts which integrate the facts and his metaphysical evaluation of thefacts. His selection constitutes his evaluation: everything included in a workof art—from theme to subject to brushstroke or adjective—acquires metaphysicalsignificance by the mere fact of being included, of being important enough toinclude.An artist (as, for instance, the sculptors of Ancient Greece) who presents manas a god-like figure is aware of the fact that men may be crippled or diseasedor helpless; but he regards these conditions as accidental, as irrelevant to theessential nature of man-and he presents a figure embodying strength, beauty,intelligence, self-confidence, as man’s proper, natural state.[Ibid., 46; pb 36.] See also ART; CREATION ; EMOTIONS; PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY; SENSE of LIFE;STYLIZATION. Associations. See Cooperation. Atheism. Every argument for God and every attribute ascribed to Him rests on afalse metaphysical premise. None can survive for a moment on a correctmetaphysics....Existence exists, and only existence exists. Existence is a primary: it isuncreated, indestructible, eternal. So if you are to postulate something beyondexistence-some supernatural realm—you must do it by openly denying reason,dispensing with definitions, proofs, arguments, and saying flatly, “To Hell withargument, I have faith.” That, of course, is a willful rejection of reason.Objectivism advocates reason as man’s sole means of knowledge, and therefore,for the reasons I have already given, it is atheist. It denies any supernaturaldimension presented as a contradiction of nature, of existence. This applies notonly to God, but also to every variant of the supernatural ever advocated or tobe advocated. In other words, we accept reality, and that’s all.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture2.] See also AGNOSTICISM; EXISTENCE; GOD; MIRACLES; NATURE; RELIGION;SUPERNATURALISM. Automatization. All learning involves a process of automatizing, i.e., of firstacquiring knowledge by fully conscious, focused attention and observation, thenof establishing mental connections which make that knowledge automatic(instantly available as a context), thus freeing man’s mind to pursue further,more complex knowledge.[ITOE, 86.]The function of psychological integrations is to make certain connectionsautomatic, so that they work as a unit and do not require a conscious process ofthought every time they are evoked.[“Art and Sense of Life,” RM, 45; pb 36.1 A mind’s cognitive development involves a continual process of automatization.For example, you cannot perceive a table as an infant perceives it—as amysterious object with four legs. You perceive it as a table, i.e., a man-madepiece of furniture, serving a certain purpose belonging to a human habitation,etc.; you cannot separate these attributes from your sight of the table, youexperience it as a single, indivisible percept—yet all you see is a four-leggedobject; the rest is an automatized integration of a vast amount of conceptualknowledge which, at one time, you had to learn bit by bit. The same is true ofeverything you perceive or experience; as an adult, you cannot perceive orexperience in a vacuum, you do it in a certain automatized context—and theefficiency of your mental operations depends on the kind of context yoursubconscious has automatized.[“The Comprachicos,” NL, 192.] The status of automatized knowledge in his mind is experienced by man as if ithad the direct, effortless, self-evident quality (and certainty) of perceptualawareness. But it is conceptual knowtedge—and its validity depends on theprecision of his concepts, which require as strict a precision of meaning (i.e.,as strict a knowledge of what specific referents they subsume) as thedefinitions of mathematical terms. (It is obvious what disasters will follow ifone automatizes errors, contradictions and undefined approximations.)[ITOE, 86.) See also INTEGRATION (MENTAL); LEARNING; PSYCHO-EPISTF. MOLOGY; SUBCONSCIOUS. Awareness. See Consciousness. Axiomatic Concepts. Axioms are usually considered to be propositions identifyinga fundamental, self-evident truth. But explicit propositions as such are notprimaries: they are made of concepts. The base of man’s knowledge-of all otherconcepts, all axioms, propositions and thought—consists of axiomatic concepts.An axiomatic concept is the identification of a primary fact of reality, whichcannot be analyzed, i.e., reduced to other facts or broken into component parts.It is implicit in all facts and in all knowledge. It is the fundamentally givenand directly perceived or experienced, which requires no proof or explanation,but on which all proofs and explanations rest.The first and primary axiomatic concepts are “existence,” “identity” (which is acorollary of “existence”) and “consciousness.” One can study what exists and howconsciousness functions; but one cannot analyze (or “prove”) existence as such,or consciousness as such. These are irreducible primaries. (An attempt to“prove” them is self-contradictory: it is an attempt to “prove” existence bymeans of non-existence, and consciousness by means of unconsciousness.)[ITOE, 73.1 [The] underscoring of primary facts is one of the crucial epistemologicalfunctions of axiomatic concepts. It is also the reason why they can betranslated into a statement only in the form of a repetition (as a base and areminder): Existence exists—Consciousness is conscious—A is A. (This convertsaxiomatic concepts into formal axioms.)[Ibid., 78.] Epistemologically, the formation of axiomatic concepts is an act of abstraction,a selective focusing on and mental isolation of metaphysical fundamentals; butmetaphysically, it is an act of integration—the widest integration possible toman: it unites and embraces the total of his experience.The units of the concepts “existence” and “identity” are every entity,attribute, action, event or phenomenon (including consciousness) that exists,has ever existed or will ever exist. The units of the concept “consciousness”are every state or process of awareness that one experiences, has everexperienced or will ever experience (as well as similar units, a similarfaculty, which one infers in other living entities).[Ibid., 74.] Since axiomatic concepts refer to facts of reality and are not a matter of“faith” or of man’s arbitrary choice, there is a way to ascertain whether agiven concept is axiomatic or not: one ascertains it by observing the fact thatan axiomatic concept cannot be escaped, that it is implicit in all knowledge,that it has to be accepted and used even in the process of any attempt to denyit.For instance, when modern philosophers declare that axioms are a matter ofarbitrary choice, and proceed to choose complex, derivative concepts as thealleged axioms of their alleged reasoning, one can observe that their statementsimply and depend on “existence,” “consciousness,” “identity,” which they professto negate, but which are smuggled into their arguments in the form ofunacknowledged, “stolen” concepts.It is worth noting, at this point, that what the enemies of reason seem to know,but its alleged defenders have not discovered, is the fact that axiomaticconcepts are the guardians of man’s mind and the foundation of reason —thekeystone, touchstone and hallmark of reason—and if reason is to be destroyed, itis axiomatic concepts that have to be destroyed.[Ibid., 79.J It is only conceptual awareness that can grasp and hold the total of itsexperience—extrospectivety, the continuity of existence; introspectively, thecontinuity of consciousness—and thus enable its possessor to project his courselong-range. It is by means of axiomatic concepts that man grasps and holds thiscontinuity, bringing it into his conscious awareness and knowledge. It isaxiomatic concepts that identify the precondition of knowledge: the distinctionbetween existence and consciousness, between reality and the awareness ofreality, between the object and the subject of cognition. Axiomatic concepts arethe foundation of objectivity.[Ibid., 75.] It is only man’s consciousness, a consciousness capable of conceptual errors,that needs a special identification of the directly given, to embrace anddelimit the entire field of its awareness—to delimit it from the void ofunreality to which conceptual errors can lead. Axiomatic concepts areepistemological guidelines. They sum up the essence of all human cognition:something exists of which I am conscious; I must discover its identitv.| Ibid., 78.] Since axiomatic concepts are identifications of irreducible primaries, the onlyway to define one is by means of an ostensive definition—e.g., to define“existence,” one would have to sweep one’s arm around and say: “I mean this.”[Ibid., 53.] See also AXIOMS; CONCEPTS; CONSCIOUSNESS; COROLLARIES; EXISTENCE ; HIERARCHY ofKNOWLEDGE; IDENTITY; IMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE; IRREDUCIBLE PRIMARIES; OBJECTIVITY;PRIMACY of EXISTENCE vs. PRIMACY nf CONSCIOUSNESS; “STOLEN CONCEPT,” FALLACY of. Axioms. An axiom is a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of anyfurther statement pertaining to that knowledge, a statement necessarilycontained in all others, whether any particular speaker chooses to identify itor not. An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact thatthey have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it.[GS, FNI, 193; pb 155.] Existence exists—and the act of grasping that statement implies two corollaryaxioms: that something exists which one perceives and that one exists possessingconsciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that which exists.If nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with nothingto be conscious of is a contradiction in terms. A consciousness conscious ofnothing but itself is a contradiction in terms: before it could identify itselfas consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. If that which you claimto perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness.Whatever the degree of your knowledge, these two—existence and consciousness—areaxioms you cannot escape, these two are the irreducible primaries implied in anyaction you undertake, in any part of your knowledge and in its sum, from thefirst ray of light you perceive at the start of your life to the widesterudition you might acquire at its end. Whether you know the shape of a pebbleor the structure of a solar system, the axioms remain the same: that it existsand that you know it.To exist is to be something, as distinguished from the nothing of nonexistence,it is to be an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes.Centuries ago, the man who was—no matter what his errors —the greatest of yourphilosophers, has stated the formula defining the concept of existence and therule of all knowledge: A is A. A thing is itself. You have never grasped themeaning of his statement. I am here to complete it: Existence is Identity,Consciousness is Identification.[Ibid., 152; pb 124.] “You cannot prove that you exist or that you’re conscious,” they chatter,blanking out the fact that proof presupposes existence, consciousness and acomplex chain of knowledge: the existence of something to know, of aconsciousness able to know it, and of a knowledge that has learned todistinguish between such concepts as the proved and the unproved.When a savage who has not learned to speak declares that existence must beproved, he is asking you to prove it by means of non-existence —when he declaresthat your consciousness must be proved, he is asking you to prove it by means ofunconsciousness—he is asking you to step into a void outside of existence andconsciousness to give him proof of both—he is asking you to become a zerogaining knowledge about a zero.When he declares that an axiom is a matter of arbitrary choice and he doesn’tchoose to accept the axiom that he exists, he blanks out the fact that he hasaccepted it by uttering that sentence, that the only way to reject it is to shutone’s mouth, expound no theories and die.[Ibid., 192; pb 154.]See also AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS; CONSCIOUSNESS; COROLLARIES; EXISTENCE; HIERARCHY ofKNOWLEDGE; IDENTITY; IMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE; OBJECTIVITY ; PRIMACY of EXISTENCE vs.PRIMACY of CONSCIOUSNESS; SELF-EVIDENT; “STOLEN CONCEPT,” FALLACY of."},{"pageContent":"BBallet. The keynote of the stylization achieved in ballet is: weightlessness.Paradoxically, ballet presents man as almost disembodied: it does not distortman’s body, it selects the kinds of movements that are normally possible to man(such as walking on tiptoe) and exaggerates them, stressing their beauty—anddefying the law of gravitation. A gracefully effortless floating, flowing andflying are the essentials of the ballet’s image of man. It projects a fragilekind of strength and a certain inflexible precision, but it is man with a finesteel skeleton and without flesh, man the spirit, not controlling, buttranscending this earth....Strong passions or negative emotions cannot be projected in ballet, regardlessof its librettos; it cannot express tragedy or fear—or sexuality ; it is aperfect medium for the expression of spiritual love.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 68.]See also ART; CHOREOGRAPHER; DANCE; MUSIC; PERFORMING ARTS. Beauty. Beauty is a sense of harmony. Whether it’s an image, a human face, abody, or a sunset, take the object which you call beautiful, as a unit [and askyourself]: what parts is it made up of, what are its constituent elements, andare they all harmonious? If they are, the result is beautiful. If there arecontradictions and clashes, the result is marred or positively ugly.For instance, the simplest example would be a human face. You know what featuresbelong in a human face. Well, if the face is lopsided, [with a] very indefinitejawline, very small eyes, beautiful mouth, and a long nose, you would have tosay that’s not a beautiful face. But if all these features are harmoniouslyintegrated, if they all fit your view of the importance of all these features ona human face, then that face is beautiful.In this respect, a good example would be the beauty of different races ofpeople. For instance, the black face, or an Oriental face, is built on adifferent standard, and therefore what would be beautiful on a white face willnot be beautiful for them (or vice-versa), because there is a certain racialstandard of features by which you judge which features, which face, in thatclassification is harmonious or distorted.That’s in regard to human beauty. In regard to a sunset, for instance, or alandscape, you will regard it as beautiful if all the colors complement eachother, or go well together, or are dramatic together. And you will call it uglyif it is a bad rainy afternoon, and the sky isn’t exactly pink nor exactly gray,but sort of “modern.”Now since this is an objective definition of beauty, there of course can beuniversal standards of beauty—provided you define the terms of what objects youare going to classify as beautiful and what you take as the ideal harmoniousrelationship of the elements of that particular object. To say, “It’s in theeyes of the beholder”—that, of course, would be pure subjectivism, if takenliterally. It isn’t [a matter of] what you, for unknown reasons, decide toregard as beautiful. It is true, of course, that if there were no valuers, thennothing could be valued as beautiful or ugly, because values are created by theobserving consciousness-but they are created by a standard based on reality. Sohere the issue is: values, including beauty, have to be judged as objective, notsubjective or intrinsic.[Ayn Rand, question period following Lecture 11 of Leonard Peikoft’s series “ThePhilosophy of Objectivism” (1976).] See also ART; ESTHETICS; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); OBJECTIVITY. Behaviorism. Many psychologists are envious of the prestige—and theachievements—of the physical sciences, which they try not to emulate, but toimitate. [B.F.] Skinner is archetypical in this respect: he is passionatelyintent on being accepted as a “scientist” and complains that only [the conceptof] “Autonomous Man” stands in the way of such acceptance (which, I am sure, istrue). Mr. Skinner points out scornfully that primitive men, who were unable tosee the difference between living beings and inanimate objects, ascribed theobjects’ motions to conscious gods or demons, and that science could not beginuntil this belief was discarded. In the name of science, Mr. Skinner switchesdefiantly to the other side of the same basic coin: accepting the belief thatconsciousness is supernatural, he refuses to accept the existence of man’s mind.[“The Stimulus and the Response,” PWNI, 169; pb 140.] Apparently to appease man’s defenders, Mr. Skinner offers the fullowing: “Inshifting control from autonomous man to the observable environment we do notleave an empty organism. A great deal goes on inside the skin, and physiologywill eventually tell us more about it” [Beyond Freedom and Dignity, p. 195].This means: No, man is not empty, he is a solid piece of meat.[Ibid., 175; pb 144.]Behaviorists define psychology as the study of “observable behavior” (their termfor action) and claim that man’s behavior is controlled by the environment. InBeyond Freedom and Dignity, Skinner states that “a person does not act upon theworld, the world acts upon him.” Thoughts do not cause actions, according toSkinner, but are simply another type of behavior: “covert behavior.” Learning isnot defined cognitively (as the acquisition of knowledge) but as a change inbehavior, caused by the environment. Behaviorism dispenses with such concepts asthe self or personality, emotion, and mental illness, and replaces them withbehaviorally defined notions such as response repertoire, bodily reaction, andabnormal behavior.[Edwin A. Locke, “Behaviorism and Psychoanalysis,” TOF, Feb. 1980, 10.] Behaviorism’s substitute for the mind is certain entities in the environmentcalled “reinforcers.” A “reinforcer,” say the Behaviorists, is an event whichfollows a response and makes subsequent responses of the same type more likely.“What type of events change the probability of responding?” we ask. “Reinforcingevents,” we are told. “What is a reinforcing event?” we inquire. “One whichmodifies response probability,” they reply. “Why does a reinforcer reinforce?”we ask. “‘That’s not a relevant question,” they answer.... To understand why a“reinforcer” reinforces, Behaviorists would have to make reference to theindividual’s mental contents and processes—i.e., they would have to abandonBehaviorism.[Ibid., 14.] See also CONSCIOUSNESS; DETERMINISM; FREE WILL; FREUD; MAN; PSYCHOLOGY. Benevolent Universe Premise. There is a fundamental conviction which some peoplenever acquire, some hold only in their youth, and a few hold to the end of theirdays—the conviction that ideas matter.... That ideas matter means that knowledgematters, that truth matters, that one’s mind matters....Its consequence is the inability to believe in the power or the triumph of evil.No matter what corruption one observes in one’s immediate background, one isunable to accept it as normal, permanent or metaphysically right. One feels:“This injustice (or terror or falsehood or frustration or pain or agony) is theexception in life, not the rule.” One feels certain that somewhere on earth-evenif not anywhere in one’s surroundings or within one’s reach—proper, human way oflife is possible to human beings, and justice matters.[“The Inexplicable Personal Alchemy,” NL, 118.]Although accidents and failures are possible, they are not, according toObjectivism, the essence of human life. On the contrary, the achievement ofvalues is the norm—speaking now for the moral man, moral by the Objectivistdefinition. Success and happiness are the metaphysically to-be-expected. Inother words, Objectivism rejects the view that human fulfillment is impossible,that man is doomed to misery, that the universe is malevolent. We advocate the“benevolent universe” premise.The “benevolent universe” does not mean that the universe feels kindly to man orthat it is out to help him achieve his goals. No, the universe is neutral; itsimply is; it is indifferent to you. You must care about and adapt to it, notthe other way around. But reality is “benevolent” in the sense that if you doadapt to it-i.e., if you do think, value, and act rationally, then you can (andbarring accidents you will) achieve your values. You will, because those valuesare based on reality.Pain, suffering, failure do not have metaphysical significance-they do notreveal the nature of reality. Ayn Rand’s heroes, accordingly, refuse to takepain seriously, i.e., metaphysically. You remember when Dagny asks Ragnar in thevalley how his wife can live through the months he is away at sea, and heanswers (I quote just part of this passage):“We do not think that tragedy is our natura) state. We do not live in chronicdread of disaster. We do not expect disaster until we have specific reason toexpect it, and when we encounter it, we are free to fight it. It is nothappiness, but suffering, that we consider unnatural. It is not success butcalamity that we regard as the abnormal exception in human life.”This is why Ayn Rand’s heroes respond to disaster, when it does strike, with asingle instantaneous response: action-what can they do? If there’s any chance atall, they refuse to accept defeat. They do what they can to counter the danger,because they are on the premise that success, not failure, is theto-be-expected.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture8.J See also EVIL; MALEVOLENT UNIVERSE PREMISE; METAPHYSICAL VALUE-JUDGMENTS; SENSEof LIFE; SUFFERING. Birth Control. The capacity to procreate is rnerely a potential which man is notobligated to actualize. The choice to have children or not is morally optional.Nature endows man with a variety of potentials —and it is his mind that mustdecide which capacities he chooses to exercise, according to his own hierarchyof rational goals and values. The mere fact that man has the capacity to kill,does not mean that it is his duty to become a murderer; in the same way, themere fact that man has the capacity to procreate, does not mean that it is hisduty to commit spiritual suicide by making procreation his primary goal andturning himself into a stud-farm animal....To an animal, the rearing of its young is a matter of temporary cycles. To man,it is a lifelong responsibitity—a grave responsibility that must not beundertaken causelessly, thoughtlessly or accidentally.In regard to the moral aspects of birth control, the primary right involved isnot the “right” of an unborn child, nor of the family, nor of society, nor ofGod. The primary right is one which—in today’s public clamor on the subject—few,if any, voices have had the courage to uphold: the right of man and woman totheir own life and happiness—the right not to be regarded as the means to anyend.[“Of Living Death,” TO, Oct. 1968, 3.]See also ABORTION; LIFE; MAN; RELIGION; SEX. Blanking Out. See Evasion. Businessmen. The professional businessman is the field agent of the army whoselieutenant-commander-in-chief is the scientist. The businessman carriesscientific discoveries from the laboratory of the inventor to industrial plants,and transforms them into material products that fill men’s physical needs andexpand the comfort of men’s existence. By creating a mass market, he makes theseproducts available to every income level of society. By using machines, heincreases the productivity of human labor, thus raising labor’s economicrewards. By ot ganizing human effort into productive enterprises, he createsemployment for men of countless professions. He is the great liberator who, inthe short span of a century and a half, has released men from bondage to theirphysical needs, has released them from the terrible drudgery of an eighteen-hourworkday of manual labor for their barest subsistence, has released them fromfamines, from pestilences, from the stagnant hopelessness and terror in whichmost of mankind had lived in all the precapitalist centuries—and in which mostof it still lives, in non-capitalist countries.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 26; pb 27.1 America’s industrial progress, in the short span of a century and a half, hasacquired the character of a legend: it has never been equaled anywhere on earth,in any period of history. The American businessmen, as a class, havedemonstrated the greatest productive genius and the most spectacularachievements ever recorded in the economic history of mankind. What reward didthey receive from our culture and its intellectuals? The position of a hated,persecuted minority. The position of a scapegoat for the evils of thebureaucrats.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 48.] If a small group of men were always regarded as guilty, in any dash with anyother group, regardless of the issues or circumstances involved, would you callit persecution? If this group were always made to pay for the sins, errors, orfailures of any other group, would you call that persecution? If this group hadto live under a silent reign of terror, under special laws, from which all otherpeople were immune, laws which the accused could not grasp or define in advanceand which the accuser could interpret in any way he pleased-would you call thatpersecution? If this group were penalized, not for its faults, but for itsvirtues, not for its incompetence, but for its ability, not for its failures,but for its achievements, and the greater the achievement, the greater thepenalty—would you call that persecution?If your answer is “yes”—then ask yourself what sort of monstrous injustice youare condoning, supporting, or perpetrating. That group is the Americanbusinessmen....Every ugly, brutal aspect of injustice toward racial or religious minorities isbeing practiced toward businessmen.... Every movement that seeks to enslave acountry, every dictatorship or potential dictatorship, needs some minority groupas a scapegoat which it can blame for the nation’s troubles and use as ajustification of its own demands for dictatorial powers. In Soviet Russia, thescapegoat was the bourgeoisie; in Nazi Germany, it was the Jewish people; inAmerica, it is the businessmen. [Ibid., 44.] The legal treatment accorded to actual criminals is much superior to thataccorded to businessmen. The criminal’s rights are protected by objective laws,objective procedures, objective rules of evidence. A criminal is presumed to beinnocent until he is proved guilty. Only businessmen —the producers, theproviders, the supporters, the Atlases who carry our whole economy on theirshoulders—are regarded as guilty by nature and are required to prove theirinnocence, without any definable criteria of innocence or proof, and are left atthe mercy of the whim, the favor, or the malice of any publicity-seekingpolitician, any scheming statist, any envious mediocrity who might chance towork his way into a bureaucratic job and who feels a yen to do sometrust-busting.[Ibid., 51.]All the evils, abuses, and iniquities, popularly ascribed to businessmen and tocapitalism, were not caused by an unregulated economy or by a free market, butby government intervention into the economy. The giants of Americanindustry—such as James Jerome Hill or Commodore Vanderbilt or Andrew Carnegie orJ. P. Morgan—were self-made men who earned their fortunes by personal ability,by free trade on a free market. But there existed another kind of businessmen,the products of a mixed economy, the men with political pull, who made fortunesby means of special privileges granted to them by the government, such men asthe Big Four of the Central Pacific Railroad. It was the political power behindtheir activities—the power of forced, unearned, economically unjustifiedprivileges—that caused dislocations in the country’s economy, hardships,depressions, and mounting public protests. But it was the free market and thefree businessmen that took the blame.[Ibid., 48.] As a group, businessmen have been withdrawing for decades from the ideologicalbattlefield, disarmed by the deadly combination of altruism and Pragmatism.Their public policy has consisted in appeasing, compromising and apologizing:appeasing their crudest, loudest antagonists ; compromising with any attack, anylie, any insult; apologizing for their own existence. Abandoning the field ofideas to their enemies, they have been relying on lobbying, i.e., on privaternanipulations, on pull, on seeking momentary favors from government officials.Today, the last group one can expect to fight for capitalism is the capitalists.[‘°1’he Moratorium on Brains,” ARL, I, 3, 2.] Businessmen are the one group that distinguishes capitalism and the American wayof life from the totalitarian statism that is swallowing the rest of the world.All the other social groups-workers, farmers, professional men, scientists,soldiers-exist under dictatorships, even though they exist in chains, in terror,in misery, and in progressive self-destruction. But there is no such group asbusinessmen under a dictalorship. Their place is taken by armed thugs: bybureaucrats and commissars. Businessmen are the symbol of a free society—thesymbol of America. If and when they perish, civilization will perish. But if youwish to fight for freedom, you must begin by fighting for its unrewarded,unrecognized, unacknowledged, yet best representatives-the American businessmen.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 62.JSee also ANTITRUST LAWS; BUSINESSMEN v,s.

A businessman’s success depends on hisintelligence, his knowledge, his productive ability, his economic judgment-andon the voluntary agreement of all those he deals with: his customers, hissuppliers, his employees, his creditors or investors. A bureaucrat’s successdepends on his political pull. A businessman cannot force you to buy hisproduct; if he makes a mistake, he suffers the consequences; if he fails, hetakes the loss. A bureaucrat forces you to obey his decisions, whether you agreewith him or not—and the more advanced the stage of a country’s statism, thewider and more discretionary the powers wielded by a bureaucrat. If he makes amistake, you suffer the consequences; if he fails, he passes the loss on to you,in the form of heavier taxes.A businessman cannot force you to work for him or to accept the wages he offers;you are free to seek employment elsewhere and to accept a better offer, if youcan find it. (Remember, in this context, that jobs do not exist “in nature,”that they do not grow on trees, that someone has to create the job you need, andthat that someone, the businessman, will go out of business if he pays you morethan the market permits him to pay you.) A bureaucrat can force you to work forhim, when he achieves the totalitarian power he seeks; he can force you toaccept any payment he offers-or none, as witness the forced labor camps in thecountries of full statism.[“From My ‘Future File,’ ” ARL, III, 26. 5.] 1 he businessman’s tool is values; the bureaucrat’s tool is fear.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 48.]See also BUSINESSMEN ; CAPITALISM; ECONOMIC POWER vs. POLITICAL POWER; PHYSICALFORCE. Byronic View of Existence. There are Romanticists whose hasic premise, ineffect, is that man possesses volition in regard to consciousness, but not toexistence, i.e., in regard to his own character and choice of values, but not inregard to the possibility of achieving his goals in the physical world. Thedistinguishing characteristics of such writers are grand-scale themes andcharacters, no plots and an overwhelming sense of tragedy, the sense of a“malevolent universe.” The chief exponents of this category were poets. Theleading one is Byron, whose name has been attached to this particular,“Byronic,” view of existence: its essence is the belief that man must lead aheroic life and fight for his values even though he is doomed to defeat by amalevolent fate over which he has no control.[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 94; pb 109.]See also ART; FREE WILL; MALEVOLENT UNIVERSE PREMISE; ROMANTICISM ; SENSE ofLIFE."},{"pageContent":"CCapitalism. TheoryCapitalism is a social system based on the recognition of individual rights,including property rights, in which all property is privatelv owned.The recognition of individual rights entails the banishment of physical forcefrom human relationships: basically, rights can be violated only by means offorce. In a capitalist society, no man or group may initiate the use of physicalforce against others. The only function of the government, in such a society, isthe task of protecting man’s rights, i.e., the task of protecting him fromphysical force; the government acts as the agent of man’s right of self-defense,and may use force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate itsuse; thus the government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of forceunder objective control.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 19.] When I say “capitalism,” I mean a full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulatedlaissez-faire capitalism—with a separation of state and economics, in the sameway and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 32; pb 33.] The moral justification of capitalism does not lie in the altruist claim that itrepresents the best way to achieve “the common good.” It is true that capitalismdoes—if that catch-phrase has any meaning—but this is merely a secondaryconsequence. The moral justification of capitalism lies in the fact that it isthe only system consonant with man’s rational nature, that it protects man’ssurvival qua man, and that its ruling principle is: justice.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 20.] The action required to sustain human life is primarily intellectual: everythingman needs has to be discovered by his mind and produced by his effort.Production is the application of reason to the problem of survival....Since knowledge, thinking, and rational action are properties of the individual,since the choice to exercise his rational faculty or not depends on theindividual, man’s survival requires that those who think be free of theinterference of those who don’t. Since men are neither omniscient norinfallible, they must be free to agree or disagree, to cooperate or to pursuetheir own independent course, each according to his own rational judgment.Freedom is the fundamental requirement of man’s mind.[Ibid., 17.] It is the basic, metaphysical fact of man’s nature—the connection between hissurvival and his use of reason—that capitalism recognizes and protects.In a capitalist society, all human relationships are voluntary. Men are free tocooperate or not, to deal with one another or not, as their own individualjudgments, convictions, and interests dictate. They can deal with one anotheronly in terms of and by means of reason, i.e., by means of discussion,persuasion, and contractual agreement, by voluntary choice to mutual benefit.The right to agree with others is not a problem in any society; it is the rightto disagree that is crucial. It is the institution of private property thatprotects and implements the right to disagree—and thus keeps the road open toman’s most valuable attribute (valuable personally, socially, and objectively):the creative mind.[Ibid., 19.] It is ... by reference to philosophy that the character of a social system hasto be defined and evaluated. Corresponding to the four branches of philosophy,the four keystones of capitalism are: metaphysically, the requirements of man’snature and survival—epistemotogically, reason—ethicaUy, individual rights,politically, freedom.[Ibid., 20.] Capitalism demands the best of every man-his rationatity—and rewards himaccordingly. It leaves every man free to choose the work he likes, to specializein it, to trade his product for the products of others, and to go as far on theroad of achievement as his ability and ambition will carry him. His successdepends on the objective value of his work and on the rationality of those whorecognize that value. When men are free to trade, with reason and reality astheir only arbiter, when no man may use physical force to extort the consent ofanother, it is the best product and the best judgment that win in every field ofhuman endeavor, and raise the standard of living—and of thought—ever higher forall those who take part in mankind’s productive activity.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 24; pb 25.]The economic value of a man’s work is determined, on a free market, by a singleprinciple: by the voluntary consent of those who are willing to trade him theirwork or products in return. This is the moral meaning of the law of supply anddemand.[“What Is Capitalism” CUI, 26.] The essence of capitalism’s foreign policy is free trade—i.e., the abolition oftrade barriers, of protective tariffs, of special privileges—the opening of theworld’s trade routes to free international exchange and competition among theprivate citizens of all countries dealing directly with one another.[“The Roots of War,” CUI, 39.] Laissez-faire capitalism is the only social system based on the recognition ofindividual rights and, therefore, the only system that bans force from socialrelationships. By the nature of its basic principles and interests, it is theonly system fundamentally opposed to war.[Ibid., 38.] HistoryThe flood of misinformation, misrepresentation, distortion, and outrightfalsehood about capitalism is such that the young people of today have no idea(and virtually no way of discovering any idea) of its actual nature. Whilearcheologists are rummaging through the ruins of millennia for scraps of potteryand bits of bones, from which to reconstruct some information aboutprehistorical existence—the events of less than a century ago are hidden under amound more impenetrable than the geological debris of winds, floods, andearthquakes: a mound of silence.[“Introduction,” CUI, vii.J The nineteenth century was the ultimate product and expression of theintellectual trend of the Renaissance and the Age of Reason, which means: of apredominantly Aristotelian philosophy. And, for the first time in history, itcreated a new economic system, the necessary corollary of political freedom, asystem of free trade on a free market: capitalism.No, it was not a full, perfect, unregulated, totally laissez-faire capitalism—asit should have been. Various degrees of government interference and controlstill remained, even in America—and this is what led to the eventual destructionof capitalism. But the extent to which certain countries were free was the exactextent of their economic progress. America, the freest, achieved the most.Never mind the low wages and the harsh living conditions of the early years ofcapitalism. They were all that the national economies of the time could afford.Capitalism did not create poverty—it inherited it. Compared to the centuries ofprecapitalist starvation, the living conditions of the poor in the early yearsof capitalism were the first chance the poor had ever had to survive. Asproof—the enormous growth of the European population during the nineteenthcentury, a growth of over 300 per cent, as compared to the previous growth ofsomething like 3 per cent per century.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 80; pb 66.] Capitalism has created the highest standard of living ever known on earth. Theevidence is incontrovertible. The contrast between West and East Berlin is thelatest demonstration, like a laboratory experiment for all to see. Yet those whoare loudest in proclaiming their desire to eliminate poverty are loudest indenouncing capitalism. Man’s well-being is not their goal.[“Theory and Practice,” CUI, 136.] If a detailed, factual study were made of all those instances in the history ofAmerican industry which have been used by the statists as an indictment of freeenterprise and as an argument in favor of a government-controlled economy, itwould be found that the actions blamed on businessmen were caused, necessitated,and made possible only by government intervention in business. The evils,popularly ascribed to big industrialists, were not the result of an unregulatedindustry, but of government power over industry. The villain in the picture wasnot the businessman, but the legislator, not free enterprise, but governmentcontrols.[“Notes on the History of American Free Enterprise,” CUI, 102.] Capitalism cannot work with slave labor. It was the agrarian, feudal South thatmaintained slavery. It was the industrial, capitalistic North that wiped itout—as capitalism wiped out slavery and serfdom in the whole civilized world ofthe nineteenth century.What greater virtue can one ascribe to a social system than the fact that itleaves no possibility for any man to serve his own interests by enslaving othermen? What nobler system could be desired by anyone whose goal is man’swell-being?[“Theory and Practice,” CUI, 136.] Let those who are actually concerned with peace observe that capitalism gavemankind the longest period of peace in history—a period during which there wereno wars involving the entire civilized orld—from the end of the Napoleonic warsin 1815 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914.It must be remembered that the political systems of the nineteenth century werenot pure capitalism, but mixed economies. The element of freedom, however, wasdominant; it was as close to a century of capitalism as mankind has come. Butthe element of statism kept growing throughout the nineteenth century, and bythe time it blasted the world in 1914, the governments involved were dominatedby statist policies.Just as, in domestic affairs, all the evils caused by statism and governmentcontrols were blamed on capitalism and the free market—so, in foreign affairs,all the evils of statist policies were blamed on and ascribed to capitalism.Such myths as “capitalistic imperialism,” “war-profiteering,” or the notion thatcapitalism has to win “markets” by military conquest are examples of thesuperficiality or the unscrupulousness of statist commentators and historians.[“The Roots of War,” CUI, 38.] Observe the paradoxes built up about capitalism. It has been called a system ofselfishness (which, in my sense of the term, it is)—yet it is the only systemthat drew men to unite on a large scale into great countries, and peacefully tocooperate across national boundaries, while all the collectivist,internationalist, One-World systems are splitting the world into Balkanizedtribes.Capitalism has been called a system of greed—yet it is the system that raisedthe standard of living of its poorest citizens to heights no collectivist systemhas ever begun to equal, and no tribal gang can conceive of.Capitalism has been called nationalistic—yet it is the only system that banishedethnicity, and made it possible, in the United States, for men of various,formerly antagonistic nationalities to live together in peace.Capitalism has been called cruel—yet it brought such hope, progress and generalgood will that the young people of today, who have not seen it, find it hard tobelieve.As to pride, dignity, self-confidence, self-esteem—these are characteristicsthat mark a man for martyrdom in a tribal society and under any social systemexcept capitalism.[“Global Balkanization,” pamphlet, 15.] It is often asked: Why was capitalism destroyed in spite of its incomparablybeneficent record? The answer lies in the fact that the lifeline feeding anysocial system is a culture’s dominant philosophy and that capitalism never had aphilosophical base. It was the last and (theoretically) incomplete product of anAristotelian influence. As a resurgent tide of mysticism engulfed philosophy inthe nineteenth century, capitalism was left in an intellectual vacuum, itslifeline cut. Neither its moral nature nor even its political principles hadever been fully understood or defined. Its alleged defenders regarded it ascompatible with government controls (i.e., government interference into theeconomy), ignoring the meaning and implications of the concept of laissez-faire.Thus, what existed in practice, in the nineteenth century, was not purecapitalism, but variously mixed economies. Since controls necessitate and breedfurther controls, it was the statist element of the mixtures that wrecked them;it was the free, capitalist element that took the blame.Capitalism could not survive in a culture dominated by mysticism and altruism,by the soul-body dichotomy and the tribal premise. No social system (and nohuman institution or activity of any kind) can survive without a moral base. Onthe basis of the altruist morality, capitalism had to be—and was—damned from thestart.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 30.] If the good, the virtuous, the morally ideal is suffering and selfsacrince—then,by that standard, capitalism had to be damned as evil. Capitalism does not tellmen to suffer, but to pursue enjoyment and achievement, here, on earth—capitaHsmdoes not tell men to serve and sacrifice, but to produce and profit -capitalismdoes not preach passivity, humility, resignation, but independence,self-confidence, self-reliance—and, above all, capitalism does not permit anyoneto expect or demand, to give or to take the unearned. In all humanrelationships-private or public, spiritual or material, social or political oreconomic or moral—capitalism requires that men be guided by a principle which isthe antithesis of altruism: the principle of justice.[“The Intellectual Bankruptcy of Our Age,” pamphlet, 9.] See also AMERICA; “CONSERVATIVES”; FREE MARKET; FREEDOM; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS;INDIVIDUALISM; INTERVENTIONISM (ECONOMIC); JUSTICE; MIXED ECONOMY; NINETEENTHCENTURY; PHYSICAL FORCE; POLITICS; PROPERTY RIGHTS; TRADER PRINCIPLE; TRIBAI,PREMISE (in ECONOMICS); STATISM; TAXATION; WELFARE STATE. Career. In order to be in control of your life, you have to have a purpose—aproductive purpose.... A central purpose serves to integrate all the otherconcerns of a man’s life. It establishes the hierarchy, the relative importance,of his values, it saves him from pointless inner conflicts, it permits him toenjoy life on a wide scale and to carry that enjoyment into any area open to hismind; whereas a man without a purpose is lost in chaos. He does not know whathis values are. He does not know how to judge. He cannot tell what is or is notimportant to him, and, therefore, he drifts helplessly at the mercy of anychance stimulus or any whim of the moment. He can enjoy nothing. He spends hislife searching for some value which he will never find.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” March 1964, pamphlet, 6.] “Productive work” does not mean the blind performance of the motions of somejob. It means the conscious, rational pursuit of productive career. In popularusage, the term “career” is applied only to the more ambitious types of work;but, in fact, it applies to all work: it denotes a man’s attitude toward hiswork.The difference between a career-man and a job-holder is as follows: a career-manregards his work as constant progress, as a constant upward motion from oneachievement to another, higher one, driven by the constant expansion of hismind, his knowledge, his ability, his creative ingenuity, never stopping tostagnate on any level. A job-holder regards his work as a punishment imposed onhim by the incomprehensible malevolence of reality or of society, which,somehow, does not let him exist without effort; so his policy is to go throughthe least amount of motions demanded of him by somebody and to stay put in anyjob or drift off to another, wherever chance, circumstances or relatives mighthappen to push him.In this sense, a man of limited ability who rises by his own purposeful effortfrom unskilled laborer to shop-foreman, is a career-man in the proper, ethicalmeaning of the word—whi!e an intelligent man who stagnates in the role of acompany president, using one-tenth of his potential ability, is a merejob-holder. And so is a parasite posturing in a job too big for his ability. Itis not the degree of a man’s ability that is ethically relevant in this issue,but the full, purposeful use of his ability.[“From My ‘Future File,’ ” ARL, III, 26, 3.] A career requires the ability to sustain a purpose over a long period of time,through many separate steps, choices, decisions, adding up to a steadyprogression toward a goal.... In the course of a career, every achievement is anend in itself and, simultaneously, a step toward further achievements.... In acareer, there is no such thing as achieving too much: the more one does, themore one loves one’s work.[“Why I Like Stamp Collecting,” Minkus Stamp Journal, v. 6 (1971), no. 2, 2.]PLAYBOY: Do you believe that women as well as men should organize their livesaround work—and if so, what kind of work?RAND: Of course. I believe that women are human beings. What is proper for a manis proper for a woman. The basic principles are the same. I would not attempt toprescribe what kind of work a man should do, and I would not attempt it inregard to women. There is no particular work which is specifically feminine.Women can choose their work according to their own purpose and premises in thesame manner as men do.PLAYBOY: In your opinion, is a woman immoral who chooses to devote herself tohome and family instead of a career?RAND: Not immoral—I would say she is impractical, because a home cannot be afull-time occupation, except when her children are young. However, if she wantsa family and wants to make that her career, at least for a while, it would beproper—if she approaches it as a career, that is, if she studies the subject, ifshe defines the rules and principles by which she wants to bring up herchildren, if she approaches her task in an intellectual manner. It is a veryresponsible task and a very important one, but only when treated as a science,not as a mere emotional indulgence.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 7.]See also AMBITION ; PRODUCTIVENESS ; PURPOSE. Causality. The law of causality is the law of identity applied to action. Allactions are caused by entities. The nature of an action is caused and determinedby the nature of the entities that act; a thing cannot act in contradiction toits nature.... The law of identity does not permit you to have your cake and eatit, too. The law of causality does not permit you to eat your cake before youhave it.[GS, FNI, 188; pb 151.] To grasp the axiom that existence exists, means to grasp the fact that nature,i.e., the universe as a whole, cannot be created or annihilated, that it cannotcome into or go out of existence. Whether its basic constituent elements areatoms, or subatomic particles, or some yet undiscovered forms of energy, it isnot ruled by a consciousness or by will or by chance, but by the law ofidentity. All the countless forms, motions, combinations and dissolutions ofelements within the universe—from a floating speck of dust to the formation of agalaxy to the emergence of tife—are caused and determined by the identities ofthe elements involved.[“The Metaphysical vs. the Man-Made,” PWNI, 30; pb 25.]Since things are what they are, since everything that exists possesses aspecific identity, nothing in reality can occur causelessly or by chance.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” IT‘OE, 147.1 Choice ... is not chance.

Censorship. “Censorship” is a term pertaining only to governmental action. Noprivate action is censorship. No private individual or agency can silence a manor suppress a publication; only the government can do so. The freedom of speechof private individuals includes the right not to agree, not to listen and not tofinance one’s own antagonists.[“Man’s Rights,” VO.S, 132; pb 98.] Censorship, in its old-fashioned meaning, is a government edict that forbids thediscussion of some specific subjects or ideas—such, for instance, as sex,religion or criticism of government officials—an edict enforced by thegovernment’s scrutiny of all forms of communication prior to their publicrelease. But for stifling the freedom of men’s minds the modern method is muchmore potent; it rests on the power of non-objective law; it neither forbids norpermits anything; it never defines or specifies; it merely delivers men’s lives,fortunes, careers, ambitions into the arbitrary power of a bureaucrat who canreward or punish at whim. It spares the bureaucrat the troublesome necessity ofcommitting himself to rigid rules—and it places upon the victims the burden ofdiscovering how to please him, with a fluid unknowable as their only guide.No, a federal commissioner may never utter a single word for or against anyprogram. But what do you suppose will happen if and when, with or without hisknowledge, a third-assistant or a second cousin or just a nameless friend fromWashington whispers to a television executive that the commissioner does notlike producer X or does not approve of writer Y or takes a great interest in thecareer of starlet Z or is anxious to advance the cause of the United Nations?[“Have Gun, Will Nudge,” TON, March 1962, 9.) For years, the collectivists have been propagating the notion that a privateindividual’s refusal to finance an opponent is a violation of the opponent’sright of free speech and an act of “censorship.”It is “censorship,” they claim, if a newspaper refuses to employ or publishwriters whose ideas are diametrically opposed to its policy.It is “censorship,” they claim, if businessmen refuse to advertise in a magazinethat denounces, insults and smears them....And then there is Newton N. Minow [then chairman of the Federal CommunicationsCommission] who declares: “There is censorship by ratings, by advertisers, bynetworks, by affiliates which reject programming offered to their areas.” It isthe same Mr. Minow who threatens to revoke the license of any station that doesnot comply with his views on programming-and who claims that that is notcensorship....[This collectivist notion] means that the ability to provide the material toolsfor the expression of ideas deprives a man of the right to hold any ideas. Itmeans that a publisher has to publish books he considers worthless, false orevil-that a TV sponsor has to finance commentators who choose to affront hisconvictions—that the owner of a newspaper must turn his editorial pages over toany young hooligan who clamors for the enslavement of the press. It means thatone group of men acquires the “right” to unlimited license—while another groupis reduced to helpless irresponsibility.[“Man’s Rights,” VOS, I 31; pb 98.] See also “CONSERVATIVES” vs. “LIBERALS”; DICTATORSHIP; FREE SPEECH; GOVERNMENT;GOVERNMENT GRANTS and SCHOLARSHIPS; PROPERTY RIGHTS. Certainty. “Certain” represents an assessment of the evidence for a conclusion;it is usually contrasted with two other broad types of assessment : “possible”and “probable.” ...Idea X is “certain” if, in a given context of knowledge, the evidence for X isconclusive. In such a context, all the evidence supports X and there is noevidence to support any alternative....You cannot challenge a claim to certainty by means of an arbitrary declarationof a counter-possibility, ... you cannot manufacture possibilities withoutevidence....All the main attacks on certainty depend on evading its contextual character....The alternative is not to feign omniscience, erecting every discovery into anout-of-context absolute, or to embrace skepticism and claim that knowledge isimpossible. Both these policies accept omniscience as the standard: thedogmatists pretend to have it, the skeptics bemoan their lack of it. Therational policy is to discard the very notion of omniscience. Knowledge iscontextuat—it is knowledge, it is valid, contextually.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture6.] Infallibility is not a precondition of knowing what one does know, of firmnessin one’s convictions, and of loyalty to one’s values.[“The Shanghai Gesture.” ARL, 1, 14, 3.] “Don’t be so sure—nobody can be certain of anything.” Bertrand Russell’sgibberish to the contrary notwithstanding, that pronouncement includes itself;therefore, one cannot be sure that one cannot be sure of anything. Thepronouncement means that no knowledge of any kind is possible to man, i.e., thatman is not conscious. Furthermore, if one tried to accept that catch phrase, onewould find that its second part contradicts its first: if nobody can be certainof anything, then everybody can be certain of everything he pteases—since itcannot be refuted, and he can claim he is not certain he is certain (which isthe purpose of that notion).[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 17; pb 14.]See also ABSOLUTES ; AGNOSTICISM; ARBITRARY; AXIOMS; CONTEXT;KNOWLEDGE; “OPENMIND” and “CLOSED MIND”; POSSIBLE; REASON. Chance. Since things are what they are, since everything that exists possesses aspecific identity, nothing in reality can occur causelessly or by chance.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ILOF, 147.] Choice, however, is not chance. Volition is not an exception to the I.aw ofCausality: it is a type of causation.[Ibid., 149.] See also CAUSALITY; FREE WILL; IDENTITY; POSSIBLE. Change. They proclaim that there is no law of identity, that nothing exists butchange, and blank out the fact that change presupposes the concepts of whatchanges, from what and to what, that without the law of identity no such conceptas “change” is possible.[GS, FNI, 192; pb 154.]See also CAUSALITY; ENTITY; IDENTITY; MOTION; “STOLEN CONCEPT,” .. FALLACY ofCharacter. “Character” means a man’s nature or identity insofar as this isshaped by the moral values he accepts and automatizes. By “moral values” I meanvalues which are volitionally chosen, and which are fundamental, i.e., shape thewhole course of a man’s action, not merely a specialized, delimited area of hislife.... So a man’s character is, in effect, his moral essence—his self-madeidentity as expressed in the principles he lives by.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976),question period, Lecture 2.] We have only two sources of information about the character of the people aroundus: we judge them by what they do and by what they say (particularly the first).[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 66; pb 87.] As’man is a being of self-made wealth, so he is a being of self-made soul.[GS,FNI, 160; pb 131.] Just as man’s physical survival depends on his own effort, so does hispsychological survival. Man faces two corollary, interdependent fields of actionin which a constant exercise of choice and a constant creative process aredemanded of him: the world around him and his own soul (by “soul,” I mean hisconsciousness). Just as he has to produce the material values he needs tosustain his life, so he has to acquire the values of character that enable himto sustain it and that make his life worth living. He is born without theknowledge of either. He has to discover both—and translate them into reatity—andsurvive by shaping the world and himself in the image of his values.[“The Goal of My Writing,” RM, 169; pb 169.]See also AUTOMATIZATION; FREE WILL; IDENTITY; MORALITY; VALUES. Characterization. Characterization is the portrayal of those essential traitswhich form the unique, distinctive personality of an individual human being.Characterization requires an extreme degree of selectivity. A human being is themost complex entity on earth; a writer’s task is to select the essentials out ofthat enormous complexity, then proceed to create an individual figure, endowingit with all the appropriate details down to the telling small touches needed togive it full reality. That figure has to be an abstraction, yet look like aconcrete; it has to have the universality of an abstraction and, simultaneously,the unrepeatable uniqueness of a person.In real life, we have only two sources of information about the character of thepeople around us: we judge them by what they do and by what they say(particularly the first). Similarly, characterization in a novel can be achievedonly by two major means: action and dialogue. Descriptive passages dealing witha character’s appearance, manner, etc. can contribute to a characterization; socan introspective passages dealing with a character’s thoughts and feelings; socan the comments of other characters. But all these are merely auxiliary means,which are of no value without the two pillars: action and dialogue. to re-createthe reality of a character, one must show what he does and what he says.[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 66; pb 87.]See also CHARACTER; LITERATURE; MOTIVATION. Charity. My views on charity are very simple. I do not consider it a majorvirtue and, above all, I do not consider it a moral duty. There is nothing wrongin helping other people, if and when they are worthy of the help and you canafford to help them. I regard charity as a marginal issue. What I am fighting isthe idea that charity is a moral duty and a primary virtue.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 10.] The fact that a man has no claim on others (i.e., that it is not their moralduty to help him and that he cannot demand their help as his right) does notpreclude or prohibit good will among men and does not make it immoral to offeror to accept voluntary, non-sacrificial assistance.It is altruism that has corrupted and perverted human benevolence by regardingthe giver as an object of immolation, and the receiver as a helplessly miserableobject of pity who holds a mortgage on the lives of others—a doctrine which isextremely offensive to both parties, leaving men no choice but the roles ofsacrificial victim or moral cannibal....To view the question in its proper perspective, one must begin by rejectingaltruism’s terms and all of its ugly emotional aftertaste—then take a fresh lookat human relationships. It is morally proper to accept help, when it is offered,not as a moral duty, but as an act of good will and generosity, when the givercan afford it (i.e., when it does not involve self-sacrifice on his part), andwhen it is offered in response to the receiver’s vir-tues, not in response tohis flaws, weaknesses or moral failures, and not on the ground of his need assuch.[“The Question of Scholarships.” TO, June 1966, 11.]The proper method of judging when or whether one should help another person isby reference to one’s own rational self-interest and one’s own hierarchy ofvalues: the time, money or effort one gives or the risk one takes should beproportionate to the value of the person in relation to one’s own happiness.To illustrate this on the altruists’ favorite example: the issue of saving adrowning person. If the person to be saved is a stranger, it is morally properto save him only when the danger to one’s own life is minimal; when the dangeris great, it would be immoral to attempt it: only a lack of self-esteem couldpermit one to value one’s life no higher than that of any random stranger. (And,conversely, if one is drowning, one cannot expect a stranger to risk his lifefor one’s sake, remembering that one’s life cannot be as valuable to him as hisown.)If the person to be saved is not a stranger, then the risk one should be willingto take is greater in proportion to the greatness of that person’s value tooneself. If it is the man or woman one loves, then one can be willing to giveone’s own life to save him or her—for the selfish reason that life without theloved person could be unbearable.[“The Ethics of Emergencies,” VOS, 50; pb 45.] The small minority of adults who are unable rather than unwilling to work, haveto rely on voluntary charity; misfortune is not a claim to slave labor; there isno such thing as the right to consume, control, and destroy those without whomone would be unable to survive.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 26.]See also ALTRUISM; “DUTY”; EMERGENCIES; POVERTY; SACRIFICE ; SELFISHNESS;VIRTUE; WELFARE STATE. Choreographer. Dancers are performing artists; music is the primary work theyperform—with the help of an important intermediary: the choreographer. Hiscreative task is similar to that of a stage director, but carries a moredemanding responsibility: a stage director translates a primary work, a play,into physical action—a choreographer has to translate a primary work, acomposition of sounds, into another medium, into a composition of movements, andcreate a structured, integrated work: a dance.This task is so difficult and its esthetically qualified practitioners so rarethat the dance has always been slow in its development and extremely vulnerable.Today, it is all but extinct.[Art and Cognition,“ RM, pb 70.]See also ART; BALLET; DANCE ; DIRECTOR; PERFORMING ARTS.Christmas. [In answer to the question of whether it is appropriate for anatheist to celebrate Christmas:]Yes, of course. A national holiday, in this country, cannot have an exclusivelyreligious meaning. The secular meaning of the Christmas holiday is wider thanthe tenets of any particular religion: it is good will toward men—a frame ofmind which is not the exclusive property (though it is supposed to be part, butis a largely unobserved part) of the Christian religion.The charming aspect of Christmas is the fact that it expresses good will in acheerful, happy, benevolent, non-sacrificial way. One says: “MerryChristmas”—not “Weep and Repent.” And the good will is expressed in a material,earthly form—by giving presents to one’s friends, or by sending them cards intoken of remembrance....The best aspect of Christmas is the aspect usually decried by the mystics: thefact that Christmas has been commercialized. The gift-buying ... stimulates anenormous outpouring of ingenuity in the creation of products devoted to a singlepurpose: to give men pleasure. And the street decorations put up by departmentstores and other institutions—the Christmas trees, the winking lights, theglittering colors—provide the city with a spectacular display, which only“commercial greed” could afford to give us. One would have to be terriblydepressed to resist the wonderful gaiety of that spectacle.[The Objectivist Calendar, Dec. 1976.]See also AMERICA; ATHEISM; MYSTICISM; RELIGION; THANKSGIVING. Civil Disobedience. Civil disobedience may be justifiable, in some cases, whenand if an individual disobeys a law in order to bring an issue to court, as atest case. Such an action involves respect for legality and a protest directedonly at a particular law which the individual seeks an opportunity to prove tobe unjust. The same is true of a group of individuals when and if the risksinvolved are their own.But there is no justification, in a civilized society, for the kind of masscivil disobedience that involves the violation of the rights ofothers—regardless of whether the demonstrators’ goal is good or evil. The enddoes not justify the means. No one’s rights can be secured by the violation ofthe rights of others. Mass disobedience is an assault on the concept of rights:it is a mob’s defiance of legality as such.The forcible occupation of another man’s property or the obstruction of a publicthoroughfare is so blatant a violation of rights that an attempt to justify itbecomes an abrogation of morality. An individual has no right to do a “sit-in”in the home or office of a person he disagrees with—and he does not acquire sucha right by joining a gang. Rights are not a matter of numbers—and there can beno such thing, in law or in morality, as actions forbidden to an individual, butpermitted to a mob.The only power of a mob, as against an individual, is greater muscularstrength—i.e., plain, brute physical force. The attempt to solve social problemsby means of physical force is what a civilized society is established toprevent. The advocates of mass civil disobedience admit that their purpose isintimidation. A society that tolerates intimidation as a means of settlingdisputes—the physical intimidation of some men or groups by others—)oses itsmoral right to exist as a social system, and its collapse does not take long tofollow.Politically, mass civil disobedience is appropriate only as a prelude to civilwar—as the declaration of a total break with a country’s political institutions.[“The Cashing-In: The Student ‘Rebellion,’ ” CUI, 256.]See also INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; LAW, OBJECTIVE and NON-OBJECTIVE; NEW LEFT; PHYSICALFORCE. Civilization. Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. Thesavage’s whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilizationis the process of setting man free from men.[“The Soul of an Individualist,” FNI, 98; pb 84.] The precondition of a civiliced society is the barring of physical force fromsocial relationships—thus establishing the principle that if men wish to dealwith one another, they may do so only by means of reason: by discussion,persuasion and voluntary, uncoerced agreement.The necessary consequence of man’s right to life is his right to self-defense.In a civilized society, force may be used only in retaliation and only againstthose who initiate its use.[“The Nature of Government,” VOS, 146; pb 108.]See also CULTURE; FREEDOM; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; PHYSICAL FORCE. Classicism. Classicism... was a school that had devised a set of arbitrary,concretely detailed rules purporting to represent the final and absolutecriteria of esthetic value, In literature, these rules consisted of specificedicts, loosely derived from the Greek (and French) tragedies, which prescribedevery formal aspect of a play (such as the unity of time, place and action) downto the number of acts and the number of verses permitted to a character in everyact. Some of that stuff was based on Aristotle’s esthetics and can serve as anexample of what happens when concrete-bound mentalities, seeking to by-pass theresponsibility of thought, attempt to transform abstract principles intoconcrete prescriptions and to replace creation with imitation. (For an exampleof Classicism that survived well into the twentieth century, I refer you to thearchitectural dogmas represented by Howard Roark’s antagonists in TheFountainhead.)Even though the Classicists had no answer to why their rules were to be acceptedas valid (except the usual appeal to tradition, to scholarship and to theprestige of antiquity), this school was regarded as the representative ofreason.(!)[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 87; pb 104.JSee also ABSTRACTIONS and CONCRETES; ART; NATURALISM; PRINCIPLES; ROMANTICISM. Coercion. See Physical Force. “Collective Rights.” Since only an individual man can possess rights, theexpression “individual rights” is a redundancy (which one has to use forpurposes of clarification in today’s intellectual chaos). But the expression“collective rights” is a contradiction in terms.Any group or “collective,” large or small, is only a number of individuals. Agroup can have no rights other than the rights of its individual members.[“Collectivized ‘Rights,’ ” VOS, 136; pb 101.1 A group, as such, has no rights. A man can neither acquire new rights by joininga group nor lose the rights which he does possess. The principle of individualrights is the only moral base of all groups or associations.Any group that does not recognize this principle is not an association, but agang or a mob....The notion of “collective rights” (the notion that rights belong to groups, notto individuals) means that “rights” belong to some men, but not to others—thatsome men have the “right” to dispose of others in any manner they please—andthat the criterion of such privileged position consists of numericalsuperiority.[Ibid., 137; pb 102.] The notion that “Anything society does is right because society chose to do it,”is not a moral principle, but a negation of moral principles and the banishmentof morality from social issues.[Ibid., 136; pb 101.]See also COLLECTIVISM; FOREIGN POLICY; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; MORALITY; NATIONALRIGHTS; SELF-DETERMINATION of NATIONS. Collectivism. Collectivism means the subjugation of the individual to agroup—whether to a race, class or state does not matter. Collectivism holds thatman must be chained to collective action and collective thought for the sake ofwhat is called “the common good.”[“The Only Path to Tomorrow,” Reader’s Digest, Jan. 1944, 8.] Collectivism holds that, in human affairs, the collective—society, thecommunity, the nation, the proletariat, the race, etc.—is the unit of realityand the standard of value. On this view, the individual has reality only as partof the group, and value only insofar as he serves it.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 7; pb 17.] Collectivism holds that the individual has no rights, that his life and workbelong to the group ... and that the group may sacrifice him at its own whim toits own interests. The only way to implement a doctrine of that kind is by meansof brute force—and statism has always been the political corollary ofcollectivism.[“Racism,” VUS, 175; pb 128.] Fascism and communism are not two opposites, but two rival gangs fighting overthe same territory ... both are variants of statism, based on the collectivistprinciple that man is the rightless slave of the state.[“ ‘Extremism,’ or the Art of Smearing,” CUI, 180.] Modern collectivists ... see society as a super-organism, as some supernaturalentity apart from and superior to the sum of its individual members.[“Collectivized ‘Rights,’ ” VOS, 138; pb 103. J The philosophy of collectivism upholds the existence of a mystic (andunperceivable) social organism, while denying the reality of perceivedindividuals—a view which implies that man’s senses are not a valid instrumentfor perceiving reality. Collectivism maintains that an elite endowed withspecial mystic insight should rule men—which implies the existence of an elitesource of knowledge, a fund of revelations inaccessible to logic andtranscending the mind. Collectivism denies that men should deal with one anotherby voluntary means, settling their disputes by a process of rational persuasion;it declares that men should live under the reign of physical force (as wieldedby the dictator of the omnipotent state)—a position which jettisons reason asthe guide and arbiter of human relationships.From every aspect, the theory of collectivism points to the same conclusion:collectivism and the advocacy of reason are philosophically antithetical ; it isone or the other.[Leonard Peikoff, “Nazism vs. Reason,” TO, Oct. 1969, 1.] The political philosophy of collectivism is based on a view of man as acongenital incompetent, a helpless, mindless creature who must be fuoled andruled by a special elite with some unspecified claim to superior wisdom and alust for power.[“Who Will Protect Us from Our Protectors?” TON, May 1962, 17.] What subjectivism is in the realm of ethics, collectivism is in the realm ofpolitics. Just as the notion that “Anything I do is right because I chose to doit,” is not a moral principle, but a negation of morality—so the notion that“Anything society does is right because society chose to do it,” is not a moralprinciple, but a negation of moral principles and the banishment of moralityfrom social issues.[“Collectivized ‘Rights,’ ” VOS, 135; pb 101.] As a cultural-intellectual power and a moral ideal, collectivism died in WorldWar II. If we are still rolling in its direction, it is only by the inertia of avoid and the momentum of disintegration. A social movement that began with theponderous, brain-cracking, dialectical constructs of Hegel and Marx, and ends upwith a horde of morally unwashed children stamping their foot and shrieking: “Iwant it now!” —is through.[“The Cashing-In : The Student ‘Rebellion,’ ” CUI, 266.] Collectivism has lost the two crucial weapons that raised it to world power andmade all of its victories possible: intellectuality and idealism, or reason andmorality. It had to lose them precisely at the height of its success, since itsclaim to buth was a fraud: the full, actual reality ofsocialist-cornnrunist-fascist states has demonstrated the brute irrationality ofcollectivist systems and the inhumanity of altruism as a moral code.[Ibid., 269.] Collectivism does not preach sacrifice as a temporary means to some desirableend. Sacrifice is its end—sacrifice as a way of life. It is man’s independence,success, prosperity, and happiness that collectivists wish to destroy.Observe the snarling, hysterical hatred with which they greet any suggestionthat sacrifice is not necessary, that a non-sacrificial society is possible tomen, that it is the only society able to achieve man’s well-being.[“Theory and Practice,” CUI, 137.] The advocates of collectivism are motivated not by a desire for men’s happiness,but by hatred for man ... hatred of the good for being the good; ... the focusof that hatred, the target of its passionate fury, is the man of ability.[“An Untitled Letter,” PWNI, 123; pb 102.)See also ALTRUISM; “COLLECTIVE RIGHTS”; “COMMON GOOD”; DICTATORSHIP; INDIVIDUALRIGHTS; INDIVIDUALISM; SELFISHNESS; SOCIAL SYSTEM; SOCIETY; STATISM; TRIBALISM;TRIBAL PREMISE (in ECONOMICS). “Common Good.” The tribal notion of “the common good” has served as the moraljustification of most social systems-and of all tyrannies—in history. The degreeof a society’s enslavement or freedom corresponded to the degree to which thattribal slogan was invoked or ignored.“The common good” (or “the public interest”) is an undefined and undefinableconcept: there is no such entity as “the tribe” or “the public” ; the tribe (orthe public or society) is only a number of individual men. Nothing can be goodfor the tribe as such; “good” and “value” pertain only to a living organism—toan individual living organism-not to a disembodied aggregate of relationships.“The common good” is a meaningless concept, unless taken literally, in whichcase its only possible meaning is: the sum of the good of all the individual meninvolved. But in that case, the concept is meaningless as a moral criterion: itleaves open the question of what is the good of individual men and how does onedetermine it?It is not, however, in its literal meaning that that concept is generally used.It is accepted precisely for its elastic, undefinable, mystical character whichserves, not as a moral guide, but as an escape from morality. Since the good isnot applicable to the disembodied, it becomes a moral blank check for those whoattempt to embody it.When “the common good” of a society is regarded as something apart from andsuperior to the individual good of its members, it means that the good of somemen takes precedence over the good of others, with those others consigned to thestatus of sacrificial animals. It is tacitly assumed, in such cases, that “thecommon good” means “the good of the majority” as against the minority or theindividual. Observe the significant fact that that assumption is tacit: even themost collectivized mentalities seem to sense the impossibility of justifying itmorally. But “the good of the majority,” too, is only a pretense and a delusion:since, in fact, the violation of an individual’s rights means the abrogation ofall rights, it delivers the helpless majority into the power of any gang thatproclaims itself to be “the voice of society” and proceeds to rule by means ofphysical force, until deposed by another gang employing the same means.If one begins by defining the good of individual men, one will accept as properonly a society in which that good is achieved and achievable. But if one beginsby accepting “the common good” as an axiom and regarding individual good as itspossible but not necessary consequence (not necessary in any particular case),one ends up with such a gruesome absurdity as Soviet Russia, a countryprofessedly dedicated to “the common good,” where, with the exception of aminuscule clique of rulers, the entire population has existed in subhuman miseryfor over two generations.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 20.] Only on the basis of individual rights can any good—private or public —bedefined and achieved. Only when each man is free to exist for his ownsake—neither sacrificing others to himself nor being sacrificed to others—ontythen is every man free to work for the greatest good he can achieve for himselfby his own choice and by his own effort. And the sum total of such individualefforts is the only kind of general, social good possible.[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet. 1 1.]See also ALTRUISM; COLLECTIVISM; DEMOCRACY; lNDIVIDUAL RIGHTS: MINORITY RIGHTS;“PUBLIC INTEREST,” the; SOVIET RUSSIA; TRIBALISM. Common Sense. Common sense is a simple and non-self-conscious use of logic.[Ayn Rand, question period following Lecture I 1 of Leonard Peikoff’s series“The Philosophy of Objectivism” (1976).] That which today is called “common sense” is the remnant of an Aristotelianinfluence.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 45; pb 41.] Americans are the most reality-oriented people on earth. Their outstandingcharacteristic is the childhood form of reasoning: common sense. It is theironly protection. But common sense is not enough where theoretical knowledge isrequired: it can make simple, concrete-bound connections—it cannot integratecomplex issues, or deal with wide abstractions, or forecast the future.[“Don’t Let It Go,” PWNI, 257; pb 211.]See also AMERICA; ARISTOTLE; LOGIC. Communication. Reason is the only means of communication among men, and anobjectively perceivable reality is their only common frame of reference; whenthese are invalidated (i.e., held to be irrelevant) in the field of morality,force becomes men’s only way of dealing with one another.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 22.] Concepts and, therefore, language are primarily a tool of cognition—not ofcommunication, as is usually assumed. Communication is merely the consequence,not the cause nor the primary purpose of concept-formation—a crucialconsequence, of invaluable importance to men, but still only a consequence.Cognition precedes communication; the necessary precondition of communication isthat one have something to communicate. (This is true even of communicationamong animals, or of communication by grunts and growls among inarticulate men,let alone of communication by means of so complex and exacting a tool aslanguage.)[ITOE, 92.] See also CONCEPTS; LANGUAGE; PHYSICAL FORCE; REASON. Communism. When, at the age of twelve, at the time of the Russian revolution, Ifirst heard the Communist principle that Man must exist for the sake of theState, I perceived that this was the essential issue, that this principle wasevil, and that it could lead to nothing but evil, regardless of any methods,details, decrees, policies, promises and pious platitudes. This was the reasonfor my opposition to Communism then —and it is my reason now. I am still alittle astonished, at times, that too many adult Americans do not understand thenature of the fight against Communism as clearly as I understood it at the ageof twelve: they continue to believe that only Communist methods are evil, whileCommunist ideals are noble. All the victories of Communism since the year 1917are due to that particular belief among the men who are still free.[“Foreword,” WTL, vii.]Communists, like all materialists, are neo-mystics: it does not matter whetherone rejects the mind in favor of revelations or in favor of conditionedreflexes. The basic premise and the results are the same.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 85; pb 70.] The Communists’ chief-purpose is to destroy every form ofindependence—independent work, independent action, independent property,independent thought, an independent mind, or an independent man. Conformity,alikeness, servility, submission and obedience are necessary to establish aCommunist slave-state.[“Screen Guide for Americans,” Plain Talk, Nov. 1947, 41.] It is the Communists’ intention to make people think that personal success issomehow achieved at the expense of others and that every successful man has hurtsomebody by becoming successful. It is the Communists’ aim to discourage allpersonal effort and to drive men into a hopeless, dispirited, gray herd ofrobots who have lost all personal ambition, who are easy to rule, willing toobey and willing to exist in selfless servitude to the State.[Ibid., 39.] If America perishes, it will perish by intellectual default. There is nodiabolical conspiracy to destroy it: no conspiracy could be big enough andstrong enough.... As to the communist conspirators in the service of SovietRussia, they are the best illustration of victory by default: their successesare handed to them by the concessions of their victims.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 52; pb 46.] When men share the same basic premise, it is the most consistent ones who win.So long as men accept the altruist morality, they will not be able to stop theadvance of communism. The altruist morality is Soviet Russia’s best and onlyweapon.[“Conservatism: An Obituary,” CUI, 196.] See also COLLECTIVISM; DICTATORSHIP; EGALITARIANISM; FASCISM andCOMMUNISM/SOCIALISM; HUMAN RIGHTS and PROPERTY RIGHTS; “McCARTHYISM”;POLYLOGISM; PROPERTY RIGHTS; SOCIALISM; SOVIET RUSSIA; STATISM. Compassion. I regard compassion as proper only toward those who are innocentvictims, but not toward those who are morally guilty. If one feels compassionfor the victims of a concentration camp, one cannot feel it for the torturers.If one does feel compassion for the torturers, it is an act of moral treasontoward the victims.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 10.] See also ALTRUISM; JUSTICE; MERCY; PITY. Competition. Competition is a by-product of productive work, not its goal. Acreative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beatothers.[“The Moratorium on Brains,” ARI., 1,2,4.] A competition presupposes some basic principles held in common by all thecompetitors, such as the rules of the game in athletics, or the functions of thefree market in business.[“Apollo 11,” TO, Sept. 1969, 9.] The only actual factor required for the existence of free competition is: theunhampered, unobstructed operation of the mechanism of a free market. The onlyaction which a government can take to protect free competition is:Laissez-faire!—which, in free translation, means: Hands off! But the antitrustlaws established exactly opposite conditions—and achieved the exact opposite ofthe results they had been intended to achieve.There is no way to legislate competition; there are no standards by which onecould define who should compete with whom, how many competitors should exist inany given field, what should be their relative strength or their so-called“relevant markets,” what prices they should charge, what methods of competitionare “fair” or “unfair.” None of these can be answered, because these preciselyare the questions that can be answered only by the mechanism of a free market.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 54.] The concept of free competition enforced by law is a grotesque contradiction interms. It means: forcing people to be free at the point of a gun. It means:protecting people’s freedom by the arbitrary rule of unanswerable bureaucraticedicts.[Ibid., 52.] Competition, properly so-called, rests on the activity of separate, independentindividuals owning and exchanging private property in the pursuit of theirself-interest. It arises when two or more such individuals become rivals for thesame trade.[George Reisman, “Platonic Competition,” TO, Aug. 1968, 9.]The competition which takes place under capitalism acts to regulate pricessimply in accordance with the full costs of production and with the requirementsof earning a rate of profit. It does not act to drive prices to the level of“marginal costs” or to the point where they reflect a “scarcity” of capacity.[Ibid., 11.] The competitor who cuts his price is fully aware of the impact on othercompetitors and that they will try to match his price. He acts in the knowledgethat some of them will not he able to afford the cut, while he is, and that hewill eventually pick up their business. He is able to afford the cut when and ifhis productive efficiency is greater than theirs, which lowers his costs to alevel they cannot match.... Thus price competition, under capitalism, is theresult of a contest of efficiency, competence, ability.[Ibid., Sept. 1968, 9.] “Competition” is an active, not a passive, noun. It applies to the entite sphereof economic activity, not merely to production, but also to trade; it impliesthe necessity of taking action to affect the conditions of the market in one’sown favor.The error of the nineteenth-century observers was that they restricted a wideabstraction—competition—to a narrow set of particulars, to the “passive”competition projected by their own interpretation of classical economics. As aresult, they concluded that the alleged “failure” of this fictitious “passivecompetition” negated the entire theoretical structure of classical economics,including the demonstration of the fact that laissez-faire is the most efficientand productive of all possible economic systems. They concluded that a freemarket, by its nature, leads to its own destruction—and they came to thegrotesque contradiction of attempting to preserve the freedom of the market bygovernment controls, i.e., to preserve the benefits of laissez-faire byabrogating it.[Alan Greenspan, “Antitrust,” CUI, 67.]See also ANTITRUST LAWS; CAPITALISM; COMPROMISE; FREE MARKET; FREEDOM; MONOPOLY;PRODUCTlVENESS. Compromise. A compromise is an adjustment of conflicting claims by mutualconcessions. This means that both parties to a compromise have some valid claimand some value to offer each other. And this means that both parties agree uponsome fundamental principle which serves as a base for their deal.[“Doesn’t Life Require Compromise?” VOS, 85; pb 68.]There can be no compromise on basic principles. There can be no compromise onmoral issues. There can be no compromise on matters of knowledge, of truth, ofrational conviction.[“ ‘Extremism,’ or The Art of Smearing,” CUI, 182.] It is only in regard to concretes or particulars, implementing a mutuallyaccepted basic principle, that one may compromise. For instance, one may bargainwith a buyer over the price one wants to receive for one’s product, and agree ona sum somewhere between one’s demand and his offer. The mutually accepted basicprinciple, in such case, is the principle of trade, namely: that the buyer mustpay the seller for his product. But if one wanted to be paid and the allegedbuyer wanted to obtain one’s product for nothing, no compromise, agreement ordiscussion would be possible, only the total surrender of one or the other.There can be no compromise between a property owner and a burglar; offering theburglar a single teaspoon of one’s silverware would not be a compromise, but atotal surrender—the recognition of his right to one’s property.[“Doesn’t Life Require Compromise?” VOS, 85; pb 68.] Contrary to the fanatical belief of its advocates, compromise [on basicprinciples] does not satisfy, but dissatisfies everybody; it does not lead togeneral fulfillment, but to general frustration; those who try to be all thingsto all men, end up by not being anything to anyone. And more: the partialvictory of an unjust claim, encourages the claimant to try further; the partialdefeat of a just claim, discourages and paralyzes the victim. [“The Cashing-In: The Student ‘Rebellion,’ ” CUI, 255.] There are two sides to every issue: one side is right and the other is wrong,but the middle is always evil. The man who is wrong still retains some respectfor truth, if only by accepting the responsibility of choice. But the man in themiddle is the knave who blanks out the truth in order to pretend that no choiceor values exist, who is willing to sit out the course of any battle, willing tocash in on the blood of the innocent or to crawl on his belly to the guilty, whodispenses justice by condemning both the robber and the robbed to jail, whosolves conflicts by ordering the thinker and the fool to meet each otherhalfway. In any compromise between food and poison, it is only death that canwin. In any compromise between good and evil, it is only evil that can profit.In that transfusion of blood which drains the good to feed the evil, thecompromiser is the transmitting rubber tube....When men reduce their virtues to the approximate, then evil acquires the forceof an absolute, when loyalty to an unyielding purpose is dropped by thevirtuous, it’s picked up by scoundrels—and you get the indecent spectacle of acringing, bargaining, traitorous good and a self-righteously uncompromisingevil.[GS, FNI, 217; pb 173.] The three rules listed below are by no means exhaustive; they are merely thefirst leads to the understanding of a vast subject.1. In any conflict between two men (or two groups) who hold the same basicprinciples, it is the more consistent one who wins.2. In any collaboration between two men (or two groups) who hold different basicprinciples, it is the more evil or irrational one who wins.3. When opposite basic principles are clearly and openly defined, it works tothe advantage of the rational side; when they are not clearly defined, but arehidden or evaded, it works to the advantage of the irrational side.(“The Anatomy of Compromise,” CUI, 145.]See also ABSOLUTES; APPEASEMENT; COOPERATION; INTEGRITY; JUSTICE; MORALCOWARDICE; MORAL JUDGMENT; PRAGMATISM; PRINCIPLES. Concept-Formation. According to Objectivism, concepts “represent classificationsof observed existents according to their relationships to other observedexistents.” (Ayn Rand, Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology; all furtherquotations in this section, unless otherwise identified, are from this work.) Toform a concept, one mentally isolates a group of concretes (of distinctperceptual units), on the basis of observed similarities which distinguish themfrom all other known concretes (similarity is “the relationship between two ormore existents which possess the same characteristic(s), but in differentmeasure or degree”); then, by a process of omitting the particular measurementsof these concretes, one integrates them into a single new mental unit: theconcept, which subsumes all concretes of this kind (a potentially unlimitednumber). The integration is completed and retained by the selection of aperceptual symbol (a word) to designate it. “A concept is a mental integrationof two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s), withtheir particular measurements omitted.”[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 131.] Bear firmly in mind that the term “measurements omitted” does not mean, in thiscontext, that measurements are regarded as non-existent; it means thatmeasurements exist, but are not specified. That measurements must exist is anessential part of the process. The principle is: the relevant measurements mustexist in some quantity, but may exist in any quantity.[ITOE, 14.] Let us now examine the process of forming the simplest concept, the concept of asingle attribute (chronologically, this is not the first concept that a childwould grasp; but it is the simplest one epistemologically)—for instance, theconcept “length.” If a child considers a match, a pencil and a stick, heobserves that length is the attribute they have in common, but their specificlengths differ. The difference is one of measurement. In order to form theconcept “length,” the child’s mind retains the attribute and omits itsparticular measurements. Or, more precisely, if the process were identified inwords, it would consist of the following: “Length must exist in some quantity,but may exist in any quantity. I shall identify as ‘length’ that attribute ofany existent possessing it which can be quantitatively related to a unit oflength, without specifying the quantity.”The child does not think in such words (he has, as yet, no knowledge of words),but that is the nature of the process which his mind performs wordlessly. Andthat is the principle which his mind follows, when, having grasped the concept“length” by observing the three objects, he uses it to identify the attribute oflength in a piece of string, a ribbon, a belt, a corridor or a street.The same principle directs the process of forming concepts of entities —forinstance, the concept “table.” The child’s mind isolates two or more tables fromother objects, by focusing on their distinctive characteristic: their shape. Heobserves that their shapes vary, but have one characteristic in common: a Hat,level surface and support(s). He forms the concept “table” by retaining thatcharacteristic and omitting all particular measurements, not only themeasurements of the shape, but of all the other characteristics of tables (manyof which he is not aware of at the time).[Ibid., 12.] Observe the multiple role of measurements in the process of concept-formation,in both of its two essential parts: differentiation and integration. Conceptscannot be formed at random. All concepts are formed by first differentiating twoor more existents from other existents. All conceptual differentiations are madein terms of commensurable characteristics (i.e., characteristics possessing acommon unit of measurement). No concept could be formed, for instance, byattempting to distinguish long objects from green objects. Incommensurablecharacteristics cannot be integrated into one unit.Tables, for instance, are first differentiated from chairs, beds and otherobjects by means of the characteristic of shape, which is an attribute possessedby all the objects involved. Then, their particular kind of shape is set as thedistinguishing characteristic of tables—i.e., a certain category of geometricalmeasurements of shape is specified. Then, within that category, the particularmeasurements of individual table-shapes are omitted.Please note the fact that a given shape represents a certain category or set ofgeometrical measurements. Shape is an attribute; differences of shape—whethercubes, spheres, cones or any complex combinations —are a matter of differingmeasurements; any shape can be reduced to or expressed by a set of figures interms of linear measurement. When, in the process of concept-formation, manobserves that shape is a commensurable characteristic of certain objects, hedoes not have to measure all the shapes involved nor even to know how to measurethem; he merely has to observe the element of similarity.Similarity is grasped perceptually; in observing it, man is not and does nothave to be aware of the fact that it involves a matter of measurement. It is thetask of philosophy and of science to identify that fact.[Ibid., 16.] A commensurable characteristic (such as shape in the case of tables, or hue inthe case of colors) is an essential element in the process of concept-formation.I shall designate it as the “Conceptual Common Denominator” and define it as“The characteristic(s) reducible to a unit of measurement, by means of which mandifferentiates two or more existents from other existents possessing it.”The distinguishing characteristic(s) of a concept represents a specitiedcategory of measurements within the “Conceptual Common Denominator” involved. New concepts can be formed by integrating earlier-formed concepts into widercategories, or by subdividing them into narrower categories (a process which weshall discuss later). But all concepts are ultimately reducible to their base inperceptual entities, which are the base (the given) of man’s cognitivedevelopment.[Ibid., 18.]When concepts are integrated into a wider one, the new concept includes all thecharacteristics of its constituent units; but their distinguishingcharacteristics are regarded as omitted measurements, and one of their commoncharacteristics determines the distinguishing characteristic of the new concept:the one representing their “Conceptual Common Denominator” with the existentsfrom which they are being differentiated.When a concept is subdivided into narrower ones, its distinguishingcharacteristic is taken as their “Conceptual Common Denominator”—and is given anarrower range of specified measurements or is combined with an additionalcharacteristic(s), to form the individual distinguishing characteristics of thenew concepts.[Ibid., 30.] The formation of introspective concepts follows the same principles as theformation of extrospective concepts. A concept pertaining to consciousness is amental integration of two or more instances of a psychological processpossessing the same distinguishing characteristics, with the particular contentsand the measurements of the action’s intensity omitted—on the principle thatthese omitted measurements must exist in some quantity, but may exist in anyquantity (i.e., a given psychological process must possess some content and somedegree of intensity, but may possess any content or degree of the appropriatecategory).[Ibid., 40.] Concepts are not and cannot be formed in a vacuum; they are formed in a context;the process of conceptualization consists of observing the differences andsimilarities of the existents within the field of one’s awareness (andorganizing them into concepts accordingly). From a child’s grasp of the simplestconcept integrating a group of perceptually given concretes, to a scientist’sgrasp of the most complex abstractions integrating long conceptual chains—altconceptualization is a contextual process; the context is the entire field of amind’s awareness or knowledge at any level of its cognitive development.This does not mean that conceptualization is a subjective process or that thecontent of concepts depends on an individual’s subjective (i.e., arbitrary)choice. The only issue open to an individual’s choice in this matter is how muchknowledge he will seek to acquire and, consequently, what conceptual complexityhe will be able to reach. But so long as and to the extent that his mind dealswith concepts (as distinguished from memorized sounds and floatingabstractions), the content of his concepts is determined and dictated by thecognitive content of his mind, i.e., by his grasp of the facts of reality.[Ibid., 55.] Objectivity begins with the realization that man (including his every attributeand faculty, including his consciousness) is an entity of a specific nature whomust act accordingly; that there is no escape from the law of identity, neitherin the universe with which he deals nor in the working of his own consciousness,and if he is to acquire knowledge of the first, he must discover the propermethod of using the second; that there is no room for the arbitrary in anyactivity of man, least of all in his method of cognition—and just as he haslearned to be guided by objective criteria in making his physical tools, so hemust be guided by objective criteria in forming his tools of cognition: hisconcepts.Just as man’s physical existence was liberated when he grasped the principlethat “nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed,” so his consciousness will beliberated when he grasps that nature, to be apprehended, must be obeyed—that therules of cognition must be derived from the nature of existence and the nature,the identity, of his cognitive faculty.[Ibid., 110.] Man’s sense organs function automatically; man’s brain integrates his sense datainto percepts automatically; but the process of integrating percepts intoconcepts—the process of abstraction and of concept-formation—is not automatic.The process of concept-formation does not consist merely of grasping a fewsimple abstractions, such as “chair,” “table,” “hot,” “cold,” and of learning tospeak. It consists of a method of using one’s consciousness, best designated bythe term “conceptualizing.” It is not a passive state of registering randomimpressions. It is an actively sustained process of identifying one’simpressions in conceptual terms, of integrating every event and everyobservation into a conceptual context, of grasping relationships, differences,similarities in one’s perceptual material and of abstracting them into newconcepts, of drawing inferences, of making deductions, of reaching conclusions,of asking new questions and discovering new answers and expanding one’sknowledge into an ever-growing sum. The faculty that directs this process, thefaculty that works by means of concepts, is: reason. The process is thinking.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 12; pb 20.] See also ABSTRACTION (PROCESS of); ABSTRACTIONS and CONCRETES; CONCEPTUAL COMMONDENOMINATOR; CONCEPTS; DEFINITIONS; GENUS and SPECIES; INTEGRATlON (MENTAL);LANGUAGE; MEASUREMENT; UNIT; WORDS. Concepts. A concept is a mental integration of two or more units which areisolated by a process of abstraction and united by a specific definition. Byorganizing his perceptual material into concepts, and his concepts into widerand still wider concepts, man is able to grasp and retain, to identify andintegrate an unlimited amount of knowledge, a knowledge extending beyond theimmediate concretes of any given, immediate moment.In any given moment, concepts enable man to hold in the focus of his consciousawareness much more than his purely perceptual capacity would permit. The rangeof man’s perceptual awareness—the number of percepts he can deal with at any onetime—is limited. He may be able to visualize four or five units—as, forinstance, five trees. He cannot visualize a hundred trees or a distance of tenlight-years. It is only his conceptual faculty that makes it possible for him todeal with knowledge of that kind.Man retains his concepts by means of language. With the exception of propernames, every word we use is a concept that stands for an unlimited number ofconcretes of a certain kind. A concept is like a mathematical series ofspecifically defined units, going off in both directions, open at both ends andincluding all units of that particular kind. For instance, the concept “man”includes all men who live at present, who have ever lived or will ever live—anumber of men so great that one would not be able to perceive them all visually,let alone to study them or discover anything about them.[“The Psycho-Epistemology of Art,” RM, 19; pb 17.] To what precisely do we refer when we designate three persons as “men”? We referto the fact that they are living beings who possess the same characteristicdistinguishing them from all other living species: a rational faculty—though thespecific measurements of their distinguishing characteristic qua men, as well asof all their other characteristics qua living beings, are different. (As livingbeings of a certain kind, they possess innumerable characteristics in common:the same shape, the same range of size, the same facial features, the same vitalorgans, the same fingerprints, etc., and all these characteristics differ onlyin their measurements.)[ITOE, 21.] A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessing the samedistinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurements omitted.[Ibid., 15.] The basic principle of concept-formation (which states that the omittedmeasurements must exist in some quantity, but may exist in any quantity) is theequivalent of the basic principle of algebra, which states that algebraicsymbols must be given some numerical value, but may be given any value. In thissense and respect, perceptual awareness is the arithmetic, but conceptualawareness is the algebra of cognition.[Ibid., 22.]None of [the traditional theories of concepts] regards concepts as objective,i.e., as neither revealed nor invented, but as produced by man’s consciousnessin accordance with the facts of reality, as mental integrations of factual datacomputed by man—as the products of a cognitive method of classification whoseprocesses must be performed by man, but whose content is dictated by reality.[Ibid., 71.] Concepts represent condensations of knowledge, which make further study and thedivision of cognitive labor possible.[Ibid., 87.] Conceptualization is a method of expanding man’s consciousness by reducing thenumber of its content’s units—a systematic means to an unlimited integration ofcognitive data.[Ibid., 85.] It is crucially important to grasp the fact that a concept is an “open-end”classification which includes the yet-to-be-discovered characteristics of agiven group of existents. All of man’s knowledge rests on that fact.[Ibid., 87.] Concepts and, therefore, language are primarily a tool of cognition—not ofcommunication, as is usually assumed. Communication is merely the consequence,not the cause nor the primary purpose of concept-formation—a crucialconsequence, of invaluable importance to men, but still only a consequence.Cognition precedes communication; the necessary precondition of communication isthat one have something to communicate.... The primary purpose of concepts and of language is to provide man with a systemof cognitive classification and organization, which enables him to acquireknowledge on an unlimited scale; this means: to keep order in man’s mind andenable him to think.[Ibid., 92.] Abstract ideas are conceptual integrations which subsume an incalculable numberof concretes—and ... without abstract ideas you would not be able to deal withconcrete, particular, real-life problems. You would be in the position of anewborn infant, to whom every object is a unique, unprecedented phenomenon. Thedifference between his mental state and yours lies in the number of conceptualintegrations your mind has performed.[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 6; pb 5.]Conceptual awareness is the only type of awareness capable of integrating past,present and future. Sensations are merely an awareness of the present and cannotbe retained beyond the immediate moment; percepts are retained and, throughautomatic memory, provide a certain rudimentary link to the past, but cannotproject the future. It is only conceptual awareness that can grasp and hold thetotal of its experience—extrospectivety, the continuity of existence;introspectively, the continuity of consciousness—and thus enable its possessorto project his course long-range.[ITOE, 75.] There are many special or “cross-filed” chains of abstractions (ofinterconnected concepts) in man’s mind. Cognitive abstractions are thefundamental chain, on which all the others depend. Such chains are mentalintegrations, serving a special purpose and formed accordingly by a specialcriterion.Cognitive abstractions are formed by the criterion of: what is essential?(epistemologically essential to distinguish one class of existents from allothers). Normative abstractions are formed by the criterion of: what is good?Esthetic abstractions are formed by the criterion of: what is important?

Conceptual Common Denominator. A commensurable characteristic (such as shape inthe case of tables, or hue in the case of colors) is an essential element in theprocess of concept-formation. I shall designate it as the “Conceptual CommonDenominator” and define it as “The characteristic(s) reducible to a unit ofmeasurement, by means of which man differentiates two or more existents fromother existents possessing it.”The distinguishing characteristic(s) of a concept represents a specifiedcategory of measurements within the “Conceptual Common Denominator” involved.[ITOE, 18.]Two fundamental attributes are involved in every state, aspect or function ofman’s consciousness: content and action—the content of awareness, and the actionof consciousness in regard to that content. These two attributes are thefundamental Conceptual Common Denominator of all concepts pertaining toconsciousness.[Ibid., 38.] When concepts are integrated into a wider one, the new concept includes all thecharacteristics of its constituent units; but their distinguishingcharacteristics are regarded as omitted measurements, and one of their commoncharacteristics determines the distinguishing characteristic of the new concept:the one representing their “Conceptual Common Denominator” with the existentsfrom which they are being differentiated.When a concept is subdivided into narrower ones, its distinguishingcharacteristic is taken as their “Conceptual Common Denominator”—and is given anarrower range of specified measurements or is combined with an additionalcharacteristic(s), to form the individual distinguishing characteristics of thenew concepts.[Ibid., 30.] The rules of correct definition are derived from the process ofconcept-formation. The units of a concept were differentiated—by means of adistinguishing characteristic(s)—from other existents possessing a commensurablecharacteristic, a Conceptual Common Denominator. A definition follows the sameprinciple: it specifies the distinguishing characteristic (s) of the units, andindicates the category of existents from which they were differentiated.The distinguishing characteristic(s) of the units becomes the differentia of theconcept’s definition; the existents possessing a Conceptual Common Denominatorbecome the genus.[Ibid., 53.] Since axiomatic concepts are not formed by differentiating one group ofexistents from others, but represent an integration of all existents, they haveno Conceptual Common Denominator with anything else. They have no contraries, noalternatives.[Ibid., 77.] See also AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS; CONCEPT-FORMATION; DEFINITIONS ; GENUS and SPECIES;MEASUREMENT; UNIT. Concretes. See Abstractions and Concretes.Confidence. See Courage and Confidence; Self-Esteem.Consciousness. Existence exists—and the act of grasping that statement impliestwo corollary axioms: that something exists which one perceives and that oneexists possessing consciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceivingthat which exists.If nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with nothingto be conscious of is a contradiction in terms. A consciousness conscious ofnothing but itself is a contradiction in terms: before it could identify itselfas consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. If that which you claimto perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness.Whatever the degree of your knowledge, these two—existence and consciousness—areaxioms you cannot escape, these two are the irreducible primaries implied in anyaction you undertake, in any part of your knowledge and in its sum, from thefirst ray of light you perceive at the start of your life to the widesterudition you might acquire at its end. Whether you know the shape of a pebbleor the structure of a solar system, the axioms remain the same: that it existsand that you know it.... Existence is Identity, Consciousness is Identification.[GS, FNI, 152; pb 124.] Consciousness is the faculty of awareness—the faculty of perceiving that whichexists.Awareness is not a passive state, but an active process. On the lower levels ofawareness, a complex neurological process is required to enable man toexperience a sensation and to integrate sensations into percepts; that processis automatic and non-volitional: man is aware of its results, but not of theprocess itself. On the higher, conceptual level, the process is psychological,conscious and volitional. In either case, awareness is achieved and maintainedby continuous action.Directly or indirectly, every phenomenon of consciousness is derived from one’sawareness of the external world. Some object, i.e., some content, is involved inevery state of awareness. Extrospection is a process of cognition directedoutward—a process of apprehending some existent (s) of the external world.Introspection is a process of cognition directed inward—a process ofapprehending one’s own psychological actions in regard to some existent(s) ofthe external world, such actions as thinking, feeling, reminiscing, etc. It isonly in relation to the external world that the various actions of aconsciousness can be experienced, grasped, defined or communicated. Awareness isawareness of something. A content-less state of consciousness is a contradictionin terms.[ITOE, 37.1The first and primary axiomatic concepts are “existence,” “identity” (which is acorollary of “existence”) and “consciousness.” One can study what exists and howconsciousness functions; but one cannot analyze (or “prove”) existence as such,or consciousness as such. These are irreducible primaries. (An attempt to“prove” them is self-contradictory: it is an attempt to “prove” existence bymeans of non-existence, and consciousness by means of unconsciousness.)[Ibid., 73.] Consciousness—for those living organisms which possess it—is the basic means ofsurvival.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 9: pb 18.] Man’s consciousness is his least known and most abused vital organ. Most peoplebelieve that consciousness as such is some sort of indeterminate faculty whichhas no nature, no specific identity and, therefore, no requirements, no needs,no rules for being properly or improperly used. The simplest example of thisbelief is people’s willingness to lie or cheat, to fake reality on the premisethat “I’m the only one who’ll know” or “It’s only in my mind”—without anyconcern for what this does to one’s mind, what complex, untraceable, disastrousimpairments it produces, what crippling damage may result.The loss of control over one’s consciousness is the most terrifying of humanexperiences: a consciousness that doubts its own efficacy is in a monstrouslyintolerable state. Yet men abuse, subvert and starve their consciousness in amanner they would not dream of applying to their hair, toenails or stomachs.They know that these things have a specific identity and specific requirements,and, if one wishes to preserve them, one must comb one’s hair, trim one’stoenails and refrain from swallowing rat poison. But one’s mind? Aw, it needsnothing and can swallow anything. Or so most people believe. And they go onbelieving it while they toss in agony on a psychologist’s couch, screaming thattheir mind keeps them in a state of chronic terror for no reason whatever....The fact [is] that man’s consciousness possesses a specific nature with specificcognitive needs, that it is not infinitely malleable and cannot be twisted, likea piece of putty, to fit any private evasions or any public “conditioning.”[“Our Cultural Value-Deprivation,” TO, April 1966, 1.] Just as man’s physical existence was liberated when he grasped the principlethat “nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed,” so his consciousness will beliberated when he grasps that nature, to be apprehended, must be obeyed—that therules of cognition must be derived from the nature of existence and the nature,the identity, of his cognitive faculty.[ITOE, 110.] The hallmark of a mystic is the savagely stubborn refusal to accept the factthat consciousness, like any other existent, possesses identity, that it is afaculty of a specific nature, functioning through specific means. While theadvance of civilization has been eliminating one area of magic after another,the last stand of the believers in the miraculous consists of their franticattempts to regard identity as the disqualifying element of consciousness.The implicit, but unadmitted premise of the neo-mystics of modern philosophy, isthe notion that only an ineffable consciousness can acquire a valid knowledge ofreality, that “true” knowledge has to be causeless, i.e., acquired without anymeans of cognition.[Ibid., 106.] Two fundamental attributes are involved in every state, aspect or function ofman’s consciousness: content and action—the content of awareness, and the actionof consciousness in regard to that content.These two attributes are the fundamental Conceptual Common Denominator of allconcepts pertaining to consciousness....To form concepts of consciousness, one must isolate the action from the contentof a given state of consciousness, by a process of abstraction. Just as,extrospectively, man can abstract attributes from entities—so, introspectively,he can abstract the actions of his consciousness from its contents, and observethe differences among these various actions.For instance (on the adult level), when a man sees a woman walking down thestreet, the action of his consciousness is perception; when he notes that she isbeautiful, the action of his consciousness is evaluation; when he experiences aninner state of pleasure and approval, of admiration, the action of hisconsciousness is emotion; when he stops to watch her and draws conclusions, fromthe evidence, about her character, age, social position, etc., the action of hisconsciousness is thought; when, later, he recalls the incident, the action ofhis consciousness is reminiscence; when he projects that her appearance would beimproved if her hair were blond rather than brown, and her dress were bluerather than red, the action of his consciousness is imagination.[Ibid., 38.] In the realm of introspection, the concretes, the units which are integratedinto a single concept, are the specific instances of a given psychologicalprocess. The measurable attributes of a psychological process are its object orcontent and its intensity.The content is some aspect of the external world (or is derived from some aspectof the external world) and is measurable by the various methods of measurementapplicable to the external world. The intensity of a psychological process isthe automatically summed up result of many factors: of its scope, its clarity,its cognitive and motivational context, the degree of mental energy or effortrequired, etc.There is no exact method of measuring the intensity of all psychotogicalprocesses, but—as in the case of forming concepts of colors—conceptualizationdoes not require the knowledge of exact measurements. Degrees of intensity canbe and are measured approxitnately, on a comparative scale. For instance, theintensity of the emotion of joy in response to certain facts varies according tothe importance of these facts in one’s hierarchy of values; it varies in suchcases as buying a new suit, or getting a raise in pay, or marrying the personone loves. The intensity of a process of thought and of the intellectual effortrequired varies according to the scope of its content; it varies when one graspsthe concept “table” or the concept “justice,” when one grasps that 2 + 2 = 4 orthat e = mc2.[Ibid., 39.] See also AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS; EMOTIONS; FOCUS; FREE WILL; INTROSPECTION;PERCEPTION; PRIMACY of EXISTENCE us.

It is only on such a base that one can formulate a consistentpolitical theory and achieve it in practice. When, however, men attempt to rushinto politics without such a base, the result is that embarrassingconglomeration of impotence, futility, inconsistendy y and superficiality whichis loosely designated today as “conservatism.” ...Today’s culture is dominated by the philosophy of mysticism (irrationalism)—altruism—collectivism, the base from which only statism can be derived; thestatists (of any brand: communist, fascist or welfare) are merely cashing in onit—white the “conservatives” are scurrying to ride on the enemy’s premises and,somehow, to achieve political freedom by stealth. It can’t be done.[“Choose Your Issues,” TON, Jan. 1962, 1.] What are the “conservatives”? What is it that they are seeking to “conserve”?It is generally understood that those who support the “conservatives,” expectthem to uphold the system which has been camouflaged by the loose term of “theAmerican way of life.” The moral treason of the “conservative” leaders lies inthe fact that they are hiding behind that camouflage: they do not have thecourage to admit that the American way of life was capitalism, that that was thepolitico-economic system born and established in the United States, the systemwhich, in one brief century, achieved a level of freedom, of progress, ofprosperity, of human happiness, unmatched in all the other systems and centuriescombined—and that that is the system which they are now allowing to perish bysilent default.If the “conservatives” do not stand for capitalism, they stand for and arenothing; they have no goal, no direction, no political principles, no socialideals, no intellectual values, no leadership to offer anyone.Yet capitalism is what the “conservatives” dare not advocate or defend. They areparalyzed by the profound conflict between capitalism and the moral code whichdominates our culture: the morality of altruism.... Capitalism and altruism areincompatible; they are philosophical opposites; they cannot co-exist in the sameman or in the same society.[“Conservatism: An Obituary,” CUI, 194.] What is the moral stature of those who are afraid to proclaim that they are thechampions of freedom? What is the integrity of those who outdo their enemies insmearing, misrepresenting, spitting at, and apologizing for their own ideal?What is the rationality of those who expect to trick people into freedom, cheatthem into justice, fool them into progress, con them into preserving theirrights, and, while indoctrinating them with statism, put one over on them andlet them wake up in a perfect capitalist society some morning?These are the “conservatives”—or most of their intellectual spokesmen. [Ibid.] There are three interrelated arguments used by today’s “conservatives” tojustify capitalism, which can best be designated as: the argument from faith—theargument from tradition—the argument from depravity.Sensing their need of a moral base, many “conservatives” decided to choosereligion as their moral justification; they claim that America and capitalismare based on faith in God. Politically, such a claim contradicts the fundamentalprinciples of the United States: in America, religion is a private matter whichcannot and must not be brought into political issues.Intellectually, to rest one’s case on faith means to concede that reason is onthe side of one’s enemies—that one has no rational arguments to offer. The“conservatives’ ” claim that their case rests on faith, means that there are norational arguments to support the American system, no rational justification forfreedom, justice, property, individual rights, that these rest on a mysticrevelation and can be accepted only on faith —that in reason and logic the enemyis right, but men must hold faith as superior to reason.Consider the implications of that theory. While the communists claim that theyare the representatives of reason and science, the “conservatives” concede itand retreat into the realm of mysticism, of faith, of the supernatural, intoanother world, surrendering this world to communism. It is the kind of victorythat the communists’ irrational ideology could never have won on its ownmerits....Now consider the second argument: the attempt to justify capitalism on theground of tradition. Certain groups are trying to switch the word “conservative”into the exact opposite of its modern American usage, to switch it back to itsnineteenth-century meaning, and to put this over on the public. These groupsdeclare that to be a “conservative” means to uphold the status quo, the given,the established, regardless of what it might be, regardless of whether it isgood or bad, right or wrong, defensible or indefensible. They declare that wemust defend the American political system not because it is right, but becauseour ancestors chose it, not because it is good, but because it is old....The argument that we must respect “tradition” as such, respect it merely becauseit is a “tradition,” means that we must accept the values other men have chosen,merely because other men have chosen them—with the necessary implication of: whoare we to change them? The affront to a man’s self-esteem, in such an argument,and the profound contempt for man’s nature are obvious.This leads us to the third—and the worst—argument, used by some “conservatives”:the attempt to defend capitalism on the ground of man’s depravity.This argument runs as follows: since men are weak, fallible, non-omniscient andinnately depraved, no man may be entrusted with the responsibility of being adictator and of ruling everybody else; therefore, a free society is the properway of life for imperfect creatures. Please grasp fully the implications of thisargument: since men are depraved, they are not good enough for a dictatorship;freedom is all that they deserve; if they were perfect, they would be worthy ofa totalitarian state.Dictatorship—this theory asserts—believe it or not, is the result of faith inman and in man’s goodness; if people believed that man is depraved by nature,they would not entrust a dictator with power. This means that a belief in humandepravity protects human freedom—that it is wrong to enslave the depraved, butwould be right to enslave the virtuous. And more: dictatorships—this theorydeclares—and all the other disasters of the modern world are man’s punishmentfor the sin of relying on his intellect and of attempting to improve his life onearth by seeking to devise a perfect political system and to establish arational society. This means that humility, passivity, lethargic resignation anda belief in Original Sin are the bulwarks of capitalism. One could not gofarther than this in historical, political, and psychological ignorance orsubversion. This is truly the voice of the Dark Ages rising again—in the midstof our industrial civilization.The cynical, man-hating advocates of this theory sneer at all ideals, scoff atall human aspirations and deride all attempts to improve men’s existence. “Youcan’t change human nature,” is their stock answer to the socialists. Thus theyconcede that socialism is the ideal, but human nature is unworthy of it; afterwhich, they invite men to crusade for capitalism—a crusade one would have tostart by spitting in one’s own face. Who will fight and die to defend his statusas a miserable sinner? If, as a result of such theories, people becomecontemptuous of “conservatism,” do not wonder and do not ascribe it to thecleverness of the socialists.[Ibid., 196.] Today’s “conservatives” are futile, impotent and, culturally, dead. They havenothing to offer and can achieve nothing. They can only help to destroyintellectual standards, to disintegrate thought, to discredit capitalism, and toaccelerate this country’s uncontested collapse into despair and dictatorship.[Ibid., 199.] The most immoral contradiction—in the chaos of today’s anti-ideologicalgroups—is that of the so-called “conservatives,” who posture as defenders ofindividual rights, particularly property rights, but uphold and advocate thedraft. By what infernal evasion can they hope to justify the proposition thatcreatures who have no right to life, have the right to a bank account? [“The Wreckage of the Consensus,” CUI, 227.] The Antitrust laws—an unenforceable, uncompliable, unjudicable mess ofcontradictions—have for decades kept American businessmen under a silent,growing reign of terror. Yet these laws were created and, to this day, areupheld by the “conservatives,” as a grim monument to their lack of politicalphilosophy, of economic knowledge and of any concern with principles.[“Choose Your Issues,” TON, Jan. 1962, 1.] It was the so-called “conservatives” ... who ran to the government forregulations and controls [over the broadcasting industry], and who cheered thenotion of “public property” and service to the “public interest.”[“The Property Status of the Airwaves,” CUI, 126.] Escalation of controls has been the policy of conservatives in regard toantitrust laws, labor legislation, the military draft, taxation, the “negativeincome tax,” etc.[“Ideas v. Men,” ARL, III, 15, 4.] If the religionist wing of conservatism is futile, the secular one is, perhaps,worse. The religionists preach the morality of altruism, knowing that theliberals and the extreme left are its much more consistent practitioners, buthoping—since consistency is a requirement of reason, not of faith—that a miraclewill wipe out that fact. The secular conservatives solve the contradiction bydiscarding morality altogether, by surrendering it to the enemy and declaringthat social-political-economic problems are amoral.[“Moral Inflation,” ARL, III, 12, 2.] Capitalism is not the system of the past; it is the system of the future —ifmankind is to have a future. Those who wish to fight for it, must discard thetitle of “conservatives.” “Conservatism” has always been a misleading name,inappropriate to America. Today, there is nothing left to “conserve”: theestablished political philosophy, the intellectual orthodoxy, and the status quoare collectivism. Those who reject all the basic premises of collectivism areradicals in the proper sense of the word: “radical” means “fundamental.” Today,the fighters for capitalism have to be, not bankrupt “conservatives,” but newradicals, new intellectuals and, above all, new, dedicated moralists.[“Conservatism: An Obituary,” CUI, 201.]See also ALTRUISM; CAPITALISM; COMPROMISE; “CONSERVATIVES ” vs. “LIBERALS”;FAITH; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; “LIBERALS”; “LIBERTARIANS”; ORIGINAL SIN; RELIGION;STATISM; TRADITION. “Conservatives” vs. “Liberals.” Both [conservatives and liberals] hold the samepremise—the mind-body dichotomy—but choose opposite sides of this lethalfallacy.The conservatives want freedom to act in the material realm; they tend to opposegovernment control of production, of industry, of trade, of business, ofphysical goods, of material wealth. But they advocate government control ofman’s spirit, i.e., man’s consciousness; they advocate the State’s right toimpose censorship, to determine moral values, to create and enforce agovernmental establishment of morality, to rule the intellect. The liberals wantfreedom to act in the spiritual realm; they oppose censorship, they opposegovernment control of ideas, of the arts, of the press, of education (note theirconcern with “academic freedom”). But they advocate government control ofmaterial production, of business, of employment, of wages, of profits, of allphysical property—they advocate it all the way down to total expropriation.The conservatives see man as a body freely roaming the earth, building sandpiles or factories—with an electronic computer inside his skull, controlled fromWashington. The liberals see man as a soul freewheeling to the farthest reachesof the universe—but wearing chains from nose to toes when he crosses the streetto buy a loaf of bread.Yet it is the conservatives who are predominantly religionists, who proclaim thesuperiority of the soul over the body, who represent what I call the “mystics ofspirit.” And it is the liberals who are predominantly materialists, who regardman as an aggregate of meat, and who represent what I call the “mystics ofmuscle.”This is merely a paradox, not a contradiction: each camp wants to control therealm it regards as metaphysically important; each grants freedom only to theactivities it despises. Observe that the conservatives insult and demean therich or those who succeed in material production, regarding them as morallyinferior—and that the liberals treat ideas as a cynical con game. “Control,” toboth camps, means the power to rule by physical force. Neither camp holdsfreedom as a value. The conservatives want to rule man’s consciousness; theliberals, his body.[“Censorship: Local and Express,” PWNI, 228; pb 186.]See also CENSORSHIP; “CONSERVATIVES”; FREEDOM; “LIBERALS”; MYSTICS of SPIRIT andMUSCLE; PROPERTY RIGHTS; RELIGION; RIGHTISTS and LEFTISTS; SOUL-BODY DICHOTOMY;“WINDOW-DRESSING. ”Constitution. Today, when a concerted effort is made to obliterate this point,it cannot be repeated too often that the Constitution is a limitation on thegovernment, not on private individuals—that it does not prescribe the conduct ofprivate individuals, only the conduct of the government—that it is not a charterfor government power, but a charter of the citizens’ protection against thegovernment.[“The Nature of Government,” VOS, 154; pb 114.] Ours was the first government based on and strictly limited by a writtendocument—the Constitution—which specifically forbids it to violate individualrights or to act on whim. The history of the atrocities perpetrated by all theother kinds of governments—unrestricted governments acting on unprovableassumptions—demonstrates the value and validity of the original political theoryon which this country was built.[“Censorship: Local and Express,” PWNI, 221; pb 181.] A complex legal system, based on objectively valid principles, is required tomake a society free and to keep it free—a system that does not depend on themotives, the moral character or the intentions of any given official, a systemthat leaves no opportunity, no legal loophole for the development of tyranny.The American system of checks and balances was just such an achievement. Andalthough certain contradictions in the Constitution did leave a loophole for thegrowth of statism, the incomparable achievement was the concept of aconstitution as a means of limiting and restricting the power of the government.[“The Nature of Government,” VOS, 154; pb 113.] The clause giving Congress the power to regulate interstate cornmerce is one ofthe major errors in the Constitution. That clause, more than any other, was thecrack in the Constitution’s foundation, the entering wedge of’ statism, whichpermitted the gradual establishment of the welfare state. But I would venture tosay that the framers of the Constitution could not have conceived of what thatclause has now become. If, in writing it, one of their goals was to facilitatethe flow of trade and prevent the establishment of trade barriers among thestates, that clause has reached the opposite destination.[“Censorship: Local and Express,” PWNI, 225; pb 184.] See also AMERICA; FOUNDING FATHERS; GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; LAW,OBJECTIVE and NON-OBJECTIVE; PHYSICAL FORCE.“Consumerism.” No “anti-concept” launched by the “liberals” goes so far socrudely as the [conservatives’] tag “consumerism.” It implies loudly and clearlythat the status of “consumer” is separate from and superior to the status of“producer”; it suggests a social system dedicated to the service of a newaristocracy which is distinguished by the ability to “consume” and vested with aspecial claim on the caste of serfs marked by the ability to produce.[“The Obliteration of Capitalism,” CUI, 185.] There is no such thing as “consumers’ rights,” just as there can be no “rights”belonging to some special group or race and to no others. There are only therights of man—rights possessed by every individual man and by all men asindividuals. The right to be protected from physical injury or fraud belongs toall men, not merely to “consumers,” and does not require any special protectionother than that provided by the criminal law....If a businessman—or any other citizen—willfully and knowingly cheats or injuresothers (“consumers” or otherwise), it is a matter to be proved and punished in acriminal court. But the precedent which [the “consumer protection” movement] ishere attempting to establish is the legal hallmark of a dictatorship: preventivelaw—the concept that a man is guilty until he is proved innocent by thepermissive rubber stamp of a commissar or a Gauleiter.What protects us from any private citizen who may choose to turn criminal andinjure or defraud us? That, precisely, is the proper duty of a government. Butif the government assumes a totalitarian power and its officials are not subjectto any law, then who will protect us from our protectors? What will be ourrecourse against the dishonesty, vindictiveness, cupidity or stupidity of abureaucrat?If matters such as science are to be placed into the unanswerable power of asingle bureau, what will guarantee the superior wisdom, justice and integrity ofthe bureaucrats? Why, the vote of the people, a statist would answer—of thepeople who choose the ruler who then appoints the bureaucrats—of the same peoplewhom [he] does not consider competent to choose electric toasters, creditcontracts, face lotions, laxative tablets or canned vegetables.[“Who Will Protect Us from Our Protectors?” TON, May 1962, 20.] You propose to establish a social order based on the following tenets: thatyou’re incompetent to run your own life, but competent to run the lives ofothers—that you’re unfit to exist in freedom, but fit to become an omnipotentruler—that you’re unable to earn your living by the use of your ownintelligence, but able to judge politicians and to vote them into jobs of totalpower over arts you have never seen, over sciences you have never studied, overachievements of which you have no knowledge, over the gigantic industries whereyou, by your own definition of your capacity, would be unable successfully tofill the job of assistant greaser.[GS, FNI, 208; pb 167.]See also “ANTI-CONCEPTS”; CONSUMPTION; FRAUD; GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS;PRODUCTION; SERVICE; TRIBAL PREMISE (in ECONOMICS). Consumption. Consumption is the final, not the efficient, cause of production.The efficient cause is savings, which can be said to represent the opposite ofconsumption: they represent unconsumed goods. Consumption is the end ofproduction, and a dead end, as far as the productive process is concerned. Theworker who produces so little that he consumes everything he earns, carries hisown weight economically, but contributes nothing to future production. Theworker who has a modest savings account, and the millionaire who invests afortune (and all the men in between), are those who finance the future. The manwho consumes without producing is a parasite, whether he is a welfare recipientor a rich playboy.[“Egalitarianism and Inflation,” PWNI, 160; pb 132.] Trained in college to believe that to look beyond the immediate moment—to lookfor causes or to foresee consequences—is impossible, modern men have developedcontext-dropping as their normal method of cognition. Observing a bad,small-town shopkeeper, the kind who is doomed to fail, they believe—as hedoes—that lack of customers is his only problem; and that the question of thegoods he sells, or where these goods come from, has nothing to do with it. Thegoods, they believe, are here and will always be here. Therefore, they conclude,the consumer —not the producer—is the motor of an economy. Let us extend credit,i.e., our savings, to the consumers—they advise—in order to expand the marketfor our goods.But, in fact, consumers qua consumers are not part of anyone’s market; quaconsumers, they are irrelevant to economics. Nature does not grant anyone aninnate title of “consumer”; it is a title that has to be earned—by production.Only producers constitute a market—only men who trade products or services forproducts or services. In the role of producers, they represent a market’s“supply”; in the role of consumers, they represent a market’s “demand.” The lawof supply and demand has an implicit subclause: that it involves the same peoplein both capacities.When this subclause is forgotten, ignored or evaded—you get the economicsituation of today.[Ibid., 157; pb 130.]See also “CONSUMERISM”; FINAL CAUSATION; INVESTMENT; PRODUCTION; PURCHASINGPOWER; SAVINGS. Context. Knowledge is contextual.... By “context” we mean the sum of cognitiveelements conditioning the acquisition, validity or application of any item ofhuman knowledge. Knowledge is an organization or integration of interconnectedelements, each relevant to the others.... Knowledge is not a mosaic ofindependent pieces each of which stands apart from the rest....In regard to any concept, idea, proposal, theory, or item of knowledge, neverforget or ignore the context on which it depends and which conditions itsvalidity and use.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture5.1 Concepts are not and cannot be formed in a vacuum; they are formed in a context;the process of conceptualization consists of observing the differences andsimilarities of the existents within the field of one’s awareness (andorganizing them into concepts accordingly). From a child’s grasp of the simplestconcept integrating a group of perceptually given concretes, to a scientist’sgrasp of the most complex abstractions integrating long conceptual chains—allconceptualization is a contextual process; the context is the entire field of amind’s awareness or knowledge at any level of its cognitive development.This does not mean that conceptualization is a subjective process or that thecontent of concepts depends on an individual’s subjective (i.e., arbitrary)choice. The only issue open to an individual’s choice in this matter is how muchknowledge he will seek to acquire and, consequently, what conceptual complexityhe will be able to reach. But so long as and to the extent that his mind dealswith concepts (as distinguished from memorized sounds and floatingabstractions), the content of his concepts is determined and dictated by thecognitive content of his mind, i.e., by his grasp of the facts of reality. Ifhis grasp is noncontradictory, then even if the scope of his knowledge is modestand the content of his concepts is primitive, it will not contradict the contentof the same concepts in the mind of the most advanced scientists.The same is true of definitions. All definitions are contextual, and a primitivedefinition does not contradict a more advanced one: the latter merely expandsthe former.[ITOE, 55. ]No concept man forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction intothe total sum of his knowledge.[GS, FNI, 154; pb 126.] One must never make any decisions, form any convictions or seek any values outof context, i.e., apart from or against the total, integrated sum of one’sknowledge.[“The Ohjectivist Ethics,” VOS, 21; pb 26.]See also CERTAINTY; CONTEXT-DROPPING; CONTRADlCTIONS; DEFINITIONS; HIERARCHY ofKNOWLEDGE; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); KNOWLEDGE; PRINCIPLES. Context-Dropping. Context-dropping is one of the chief psychological tools ofevasion. In regard to one’s desires, there are two major ways ofcontext-dropping: the issues of range and of means.A rational man sees his interests in terms of a lifetime and selects his goalsaccordingly. This does not mean that he has to be omniscient, infallible orclairvoyant. It means that he does not live his life short-range and does notdrift like a bum pushed by the spur of the moment. It means that he does notregard any moment as cut off from the context of the rest of his life, and thathe allows no conflicts or contradictions between his short-range and long-rangeinterests. He does not become his own destroyer by pursuing a desire today whichwipes out all his values tomorrow.A rational man does not indulge in wistful longings for ends divorced frommeans. He does not hold a desire without knowing (or learning) and consideringthe means by which it is to be achieved.[“The ‘Conflicts’ of Men’s Interests,” VOS, 60; pb 51.] Whenever you tear an idea from its context and treat it as though it were aself-sufficient, independent item, you invalidate the thought process involved.If you omit the context, or even a crucial aspect of it, then no matter what yousay it will not be valid....A context-dropper forgets or evades any wider context. He stares at only oneelement, and he thinks, “I can change just this one point, and everything elsewill remain the same.” In fact, everything is interconnected. That one elementinvolves a whole context, and to assess a change in one element, you must seewhat it means in the whole context.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture5.]See also CONTEXT; EVASION; SELF- INTEREST. “Contingent Truth.” See Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy.Contracts. In a free society, men are not forced to deal with one another. Theydo so only by voluntary agreement and, when a time element is involved, bycontract. If a contract is broken by the arbitrary decision of one man, it maycause a disastrous financial injury to the other.... This leads to one of themost important and most complex functions of the government: to the function ofan arbiter who settles disputes among men according to objective laws.[“The Nature of Government,” VOS, 149; pb 110.] A unilateral breach of contract involves an indirect use of physical force: itconsists, in essence, of one man receiving the material values, goods orservices of another, then refusing to pay for them and thus keeping them byforce (by mere physical possession), not by right—i.e., keeping them without theconsent of the owner.[Ibid., 150; pb 111.] In a free society, the “rights” of any group are derived from the rights of itsmembers through their voluntary, individual choice and contractual agreement,and are merely the application of these individual rights to a specificundertaking. Every legitimate group undertaking is based on the participants’right of free association and free trade. (By “legitimate,” I mean: noncriminaland freely formed, that is, a group which no one was forced to join.)For instance, the right of an industrial concern to engage in business isderived from the right of its owners to invest their money in a productiveventure—from their right to hire employees—from the right of the employees tosell their services—from the right of all those involved to produce and to selltheir products—from the right of the customers to buy (or not to buy) thoseproducts. Every link of this complex chain of contractual relationships rests onindividual rights, individual choices, individual agreements. Every agreement isdelimited, specified and subject to certain conditions, that is, dependent upona mutual trade to mutual benefit.[“Collectivized ‘Rights,’ ” VOS, 136; pb 102.] See also COOPERATION; GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; PHYSICAL FORCE; PROPERTYRIGHTS. Contradictions. A contradiction cannot exist. An atom is itself, and so is theuniverse; neither can contradict its own identity; nor can a part contradict thewhole. No concept man forms is valid unless he integrates it withoutcontradiction into the total sum of his knowledge. To arrive at a contradictionis to confess an error in one’s thinking; to maintain a contradiction is toabdicate one’s mind and to evict oneself from the realm of reality.[GS, FNI, 154; pb 126.] [Objectivism agrees with Aristotle’s formulation of the Law ofNon-Contradiction]: These truths hold good for everything that is, and not forsome special genus apart from others. And all men use them, because they aretrue of being qua being.... For a principle which everyone must have whounderstands anything that is, is not a hypothesis.... Evidently then such aprinciple is the most certain of all; which principle this is, let us proceed tosay. It is, that the same attribute cannot at the same time belong and notbelong to the same subject and in the same respect.[Aristotle, Metaphysics, IV, 3 (W. 1). Ross, trans.).] The Law of Identity (A is A) is a rational man’s paramount consideration in theprocess of determining his interests. He knows that the contradictory is theimpossible, that a contradiction cannot be achieved in reality and that theattempt to achieve it can lead only to disaster and destruction. Therefore, hedoes not permit himself to hold contradictory values, to pursue contradictorygoals, or to imagine that the pursuit of a contradiction can ever be to hisinterest.[“The ‘Conflicts’ of Men’s Interests,” VOS, 58; pb 51.]See also ARISTOTLE; AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS; AXIOMS; CAUSALITY; EXISTENCE; IDENTITY;INTEGRATION (MENTAL); LOGIC. Cooperation. Cooperation is the free association of men who work together byvoluntary agreement, each deriving from it his own personal benefit.[“Screen Guide for Americans,” Plain Talk, Nov. 1947, 40.] A proper association is united by ideas, not by men, and its members are loyalto the ideas, not to the group. It is eminently reasonable that men should seekto associate with those who share their convictions and values. It is impossibleto deal or even to communicate with men whose ideas are fundamentally opposed toone’s own (and one should be free not to deal with them). All properassociations are formed or joined by individual choice and on conscious,intellectual grounds (philosophical, political, professional, etc.)—not by thephysiological or geographical accident of birth, and not on the ground oftradition. When men are united by ideas, i.e., by explicit principles, there isno room for favors, whims, or arbitrary power: the principles serve as anobjective criterion for determining actions and for judging men, whether leadersor members.This requires a high degree of conceptual development and independence.... Butthis is the only way men can work together justly, benevolently and safely.[“The Missing Link,” PWNI, 54; pb 45.] The principle of individual rights is the only moral base of all groups orassociations. Any group that does not recognize this principle is not anassociation, but a gang or a mob.[“Collectivized ‘Rights,’ ” VOS, 137; pb 102.]See also INDEPENDENCE; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; INDIVIDUALISM; TRIBALISM. Copyrights. See Patents and Copyrights.Corollaries. A corollary is a self-evident implication of already establishedknowledge.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture2.] Many of the most important truths in philosophy are neither primary axioms northeorems susceptible of discursive proof; rather, they are corollaries—mostoften, corollaries of axioms.[Ibid.]See also AXIOMS; LOGIC; PROOF; SELF-EVIDENT; VALIDATION. Corporations. A corporation is a union of human beings in a voluntary,cooperative endeavor. It exemplifies the principle of free association, which isan expression of the right to freedom. Any attributes which corporations haveare attributes (or rights) which the individuals have—inctuding the right tocombine in a certain way, offer products under certain terms, and deal withothers according to certain rules, for instance, limited liability.An individual can say to a storekeeper, “I would like to have credit, but I putyou on notice that if I can’t pay, you can’t attach my home—take it or leaveit.” The storekeeper is free to accept those terms, or not. A corporation is acooperative productive endeavor which gives a similar warning explicitly. It hasno mystical attributes, no attributes that don’t go back to the rights ofindividuals, including their right of free association.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976),question period, Lecture 9.]See also BUSINESSMEN; CONTRACTS; COOPERATION; FREEDOM; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. Courage and Confidence. Courage and confidence are practical necessities...courage is the practical form of being true to existence, of being true totruth, and confidence is the practical form of being true to one’s ownconsciousness.[GS, FNI, 158; pb 129.]See also INTEGRITY; MORALITY; RATIONALITY; TRUTH; VIRTUE. Creation. The power to rearrange the combinations of natural elements is theonly creative power man possesses. It is an enormous and glorious power—and itis the only meaning of the concept “creative.” “Creation” does not (andmetaphysically cannot) mean the power to bring something into existence out ofnothing. “Creation” means the power to bring into existence an arrangement (orcombination or integration) of natural elements that had not existed before.(This is true of any human product, scientific or esthetic: man’s imagination isnothing more than the ability to rearrange the things he has observed inreality.) The best and briefest identification of man’s power in regard tonature is Francis Bacon’s “Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed.” In thiscontext, “to be commanded” means to be made to serve man’s purposes; “to beobeyed” means that they cannot be served unless man discovers the properties ofnatural elements and uses them accordingly.[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 31; pb 25.]See also ARTISTIC CREATION; EXISTENCE; IMAGINATION; MATTER; METAPHYSlCAL vs.MAN-MADE. Creators. Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down newroads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but theyall had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the visionunborrowed, and the response they received—hatred. The great creators—thethinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors—stood alone against the menof their time. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new inventionwas denounced. The first motor was considered foolish. The airplane wasconsidered impossible. The power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia wasconsidered sinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought,they suffered and they paid. But they won.No creator was prompted by a desire to serve his brothers, for his brothersrejected the gift he offered and that gift destroyed the slothful routine oftheir lives. His truth was his only motive. His own truth, and his own work toachieve it in his own way. A symphony, a book, an engine, a philosophy, anairplane or a building—that was his goal and his life. Not those who heard,read, operated, believed, flew or inhabited the thing he had created. Thecreation, not its users. The creation, not the benefits others derived from it.The creation which gave form to his truth. He held his truth above all thingsand against all men.His vision, his strength, his courage came from his own spirit. A man’s spirit,however, is his self. That entity which is his consciousness. To think, to feel,to judge, to act are functions of the ego.The creators were not selfless. It is the whole secret of their power—that itwas self-sufficient, self-motivated, self-generated. A first cause, a fount ofenergy, a life force, a Prime Mover. The creator served nothing and no one. Helived for himself.And only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are theglory of mankind. Such is the nature of achievement.[“The Soul of an Individualist,” FNl, 90; pb 77.] We inherit the products of the thought of other men. We inherit the wheel. Wemake a cart. The cart becomes an automobile. The automobile becomes an airplane.But all through the process what we receive from others is only the end productof their thinking. The moving force is the creative faculty which takes thisproduct as material, uses it and originates the next step. This creative facultycannot be given or received, shared or borrowed. It belongs to single,individual men. That which it creates is the property of the creator. Men learnfrom one another. But all learning is only the exchange of material. No man cangive another the capacity to think. Yet that capacity is our only means ofsurvival.[Ibid., 92; pb 79.] The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot workunder any form of compulsion. It cannot be curbed, sacrificed or surbordinatedto any consideration whatsoever. It demands total independence in function andin motive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary.[Ibid.] Men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give. Yetone cannot give that which has not been created. Creation comes beforedistribution—or there will be nothing to distribute. The need of the creatorcomes before the need of any possible beneficiary. Yet we are taught to admirethe second-hander who dispenses gifts he has not produced above the man who madethe gifts possible. We praise an act of charity. We shrug at an act ofachievement.[Ibid., 93; pb 80.]Men have been taught that it is a virtue to agree with others. But the creatoris the man who disagrees. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim withthe current. But the creator is the man who goes against the current. Men havebeen taught that it is a virtue to stand together. But the creator is the manwho stands alone.Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness theideal of virtue. But the creator is the egoist in the absolute sense, and theselfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge or act. These arefunctions of the self.[Ibid., 94; pb 80.]See also ALTRUISM; COOPERATION; INDEPENDENCE; INDIVIDUALISM; INTELLIGENCE;PRODUCTIVENESS; PYRAMID of ABILITY; SECOND-HANDERS; SELFISHNESS. Credit. In all its countless variations and applications, “credit” means money,i.e., unconsumed goods, loaned by one productive person (or group) to another,to be repaid out of future production. Even the credit extended for aconsumption purpose, such as the purchase of an automobile, is based on theproductive record and prospects of the borrower. Credit is not... a magic pieceof paper that reverses cause and effect, and transforms consumption into asource of production.[“Egalitarianism and Inflation,” PWNI, 160; pb 132.] All credit transactions are contractual agreements. A credit transaction is anyexchange which involves a passage of time between the payment and the receipt ofgoods or services. This includes the vast majority of economic transactions in acomplex industrial society.[“Government Financing in a Free Society,” VOS, 158; pb 117.]See also CONSUMPTION; DEFICIT FINANCING; INTEREST (on LOANS); INVESTMENT; MONEY;PURCHASING POWER; SAVINGS. Crime. A crime is a violation of the right(s) of other men by force (or fraud).It is only the initiation of physical force against others—i.e., the recourse toviolence—that can be classified as a crime in a free society (as distinguishedfrom a civil wrong). Ideas, in a free society, are not a crime—and neither canthey serve as the justification of a crime.[“ ‘Political’ Crimes,” NL, 99.] There can be no such thing as a political crime under the American system oflaw. Since an individual has the right to hold and to propagate any ideas hechooses (obviously including political ideas), the government may not infringehis right; it may neither penalize nor reward him for his ideas; it may not takeany judicial cognizance whatever of his ideology.By the same principle, the government may not give special leniency to theperpetrator of a crime, on the grounds of the nature of his ideas.[Ibid.] All actions defined as criminal in a free society are actions involvingforce—and only such actions are answered by force.Do not be misled by sloppy expressions such as “A murderer commits a crimeagainst society.” It is not society that a murderer murders, but an individualman. It is not a social right that he breaks, but an individual right. He is notpunished for hurting a collective—he has not hurt a whole collective—he has hurtone man. If a criminal robs ten men—it is still not “society” that he hasrobbed, but ten individuals. There are no “crimes against society”—all crimesare committed against specific men, against individuals. And it is precisely theduty of a proper social system and of a proper government to protect anindividual against criminal attack—against force.[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet, 7.]See also FRAUD; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; PHYSICAL FORCE; RETROACTIVE LAW; RIGHTS ofthe ACCUSED; SOCIETY. “Crow Epistemology.” See Unit-Economy.Culture. Just as there is no such thing as a collective or racial mind, so thereis no such thing as a collective or racial achievement. There are onlyindividual minds and individual achievements—and a culture is not the anonymousproduct of undifferentiated masses, but the sum of the intellectual achievementsof individual men.[“Racism,” VOS, 174; pb 127.] A nation’s culture is the sum of the intellectual achievements of individualmen, which their fellow-citizens have accepted in whole or in part, and whichhave influenced the nation’s way of life. Since a culture is a complexbattleground of different ideas and influences, to speak of a “culture” is tospeak only of the dominant ideas, always allowing for the existence ofdissenters and exceptions.[“Don’t Let It Go,” PWNI, 250; pb 205.] The acceptance of the achievements of an individual by other individuals doesnot represent “ethnicity”: it represents a cultural division of labor in a freemarket; it represents a conscious, individual choice on the part of all the meninvolved; the achievements may be scientific or technological or industrial orintellectual or esthetic—and the sum of such accepted achievements constitutes afree, civilized nation’s culture. Tradition has nothing to do with it; traditionis being challenged and blasted daily in a free, civilized society: its citizensaccept ideas and products because they are true and/or good—not because they areold nor because their ancestors accepted them. In such a society, concreteschange, but what remains immutable—by individual conviction, not bytradition—are those philosophical principles which correspond to reality, i.e.,which are true.[“Global Balkanization,” pamphlet, 6.]See also CIVILIZATION; COLLECTIVISM; “ETHNICITY”; INDIVIDUALISM; TRADITION. Cynicism. There is nothing so naive as cynicism. A cynic is one who believesthat men are innately depraved, that irrationality and cowardice are their basiccharacteristics, that fear is the most potent of human incentives—and.therefore, that the most practical method of dealing with men is to count ontheir stupidity, appeal to their knavery, and keep them in constant terror.In private life, this belief creates a criminal; in politics, it creates astatist. But, contrary to the cynic’s belief, crime and statism do not pay.A criminal might thrive on human vices, but is reduced to impotence when hecomes up against the fact that “you can’t cheat an honest man.” A statist mightride to power by dispensing promises, threats and handouts to the seekers of theunearned—but he finds himself impotent in a national emergency, because thelanguage, methods and policies which were successful with parasites, do not workwhen the country needs producers.[“From My ‘Future File,’ ” ARL, III, 26, 3.] When one discards ideals, the fact that a given policy (such as governmentcontrols) is evil, does not constitute a reason for rejecting it. On thecontrary, such an estimate serves as an incentive to adopt and expand thatpolicy: to a cynic’s mind, that which is evil, is potent and practical.[“Ideas v. Goods,” ARL, III.

Among the performing arts, dancing requires a special discussion. Isthere an abstract meaning in dancing? What does dancing express?The dance is the silent partner of music and participates in a division oflabor: music presents a stylized version of man’s consciousness in action—thedance presents a stylized version of man’s body in action. “Stylized” meanscondensed to essential characteristics, which are chosen according to anartist’s view of man.Music presents an abstraction of man’s emotions in the context of his cognitiveprocesses—the dance presents an abstraction of man’s emotions in the context ofhis physical movements. The task of the dance is not the projection of single,momentary emotions, not a pantomime version of joy or sorrow or fear, etc., buta more profound issue: the projection of metaphysical value-judgments, thestylization of man’s movements by the continuous power of a fundamentalemotional state —and thus the use of man’s body to express his sense of life.Every strong emotion has a kinesthetic element, experienced as an impulse toleap or cringe or stamp one’s foot, etc. Just as a man’s sense of life is partof all his emotions, so it is part of all his movements and determines hismanner of using his body: his posture, his gestures, his way of walking, etc. Wecan observe a different sense of life in a man who characteristically standsstraight, walks fast, gestures decisively—and in a man who characteristicallyslumps, shuffles heavily, gestures limply. This particular etement—the overallmanner of moving—constitutes the material, the special province of the dance.The dance stylizes it into a system of motion expressing a metaphysical view ofman.A system of motion is the essential element, the pre-condition of the dance asan art. An indulgence in random movements, such as those of children romping ina meadow, may be a pleasant game, but it is not art. The creation of aconsistently stylized, metaphysically expressive system is so rare anachievement that there are very few distinctive forms of dancing to qualify asart. Most dance performances are conglomerations of elements from differentsystems and of random contortions, arbitrarily thrown together, signifyingnothing. A male or a female skipping, jumping or rolling over a stage is no moreartistic than the children in the meadow, only more pretentious.[“Art and Cognition.” RM, pb 66.]Within each system, specific emotions may be projected or faintly suggested, butonly as the basic style permits. Strong passions or negative emotions cannot beprojected in ballet, regardless of its librettos; it cannot express tragedy orfear—or sexuality; it is a perfect medium for the expression of spiritual love.The Hindu dance can project passions, but not positive emotions; it cannotexpress joy or triumph, it is eloquent in expressing fear, doom—and aphysicalistic kind of sexuality.[Ibid., 68.] Music is an independent, primary art; the dance is not. In view of theirdivision of labor, the dance is entirely dependent on music. With the emotionalassistance of music, it expresses an abstract meaning; without music, it becomesmeaningless gymnastics. It is music, the voice of man’s consciousness, thatintegrates the dance to man and to art. Music sets the terms; the task of thedance is to follow, as closely, obediently and expressively as possible. Thetighter the integration of a given dance to its music—in rhythm, in mood, instyle, in theme—the greater its esthetic value.A clash between dance and music is worse than a clash between actor and play: itis an obliteration of the entire performance. It permits neither the music northe dance to be integrated into an esthetic entity in the viewer’s mind—and itbecomes a series of jumbled motions superimposed on a series of jumbled sounds.[Ibid., 69.] See also ART; RALLET; CHOREOGRAPHER; MUSIC; PERFORMING ARTS; STYLIZATION. Dark Ages. The infamous times you call the Dark Ages were an era of intelligenceon strike, when men of ability went underground and lived undiscovered, studyingin secret, and died, destroying the works of their mind, when only a few of thebravest martyrs remained to keep the human race alive. Every period ruled bymystics was an era of stagnation and want, when most men were on strike againstexistence, working for less than their barest survival, leaving nothing butscraps for their rulers to loot, refusing to think, to venture, to produce, whenthe ultimate collector of their profits and the final authority on truth orerror was the whim of some gilded degenerate sanctioned as superior to reason bydivine right and by grace of a club.[GS, FNI, 211; pb 169.] In the history of Western civilization, the period known as the Dark Ages, afterthe fall of the Roman Empire, was a period when Western Europe existed withoutany social organization beyond chance local groupings clustered around smallvillages, large castles, and remnants of various traditions—swept periodicallyby massive barbarian invasions, warring robber bands, and sundry local looters.It was as close to a state of pure anarchy as men could come.[“A Nation’s Unity,” ARL, II, 2, 2.]See also HISTORY; MIDDLE AGES; MYSTICISM; PHILOSOPHY; REASON; RENAISSANCE. Decorative Arts. The task of the decorative arts is to ornament utilitarianobjects, such as rugs, textiles, lighting fixtures, etc. This is a valuabletask, often performed by talented artists, but it is not an art in theesthetic-philosophical meaning of the term. The psycho-epistemological base ofthe decorative arts is not conceptual, but purely sensory: their standard ofvalue is appeal to the senses of sight and/or touch. Their material is colorsand shapes in nonrepresentational combinations conveying no meaning other thanvisual harmony; the meaning or purpose is concrete and lies in the specificobject which they decorate.As a re-creation of reality, a work of art has to be representational; itsfreedom of stylization is limited by the requirement of intelligibility; if itdoes not present an intelligible subject, it ceases to be art. On the otherhand, a representational element is a detriment in the decorative arts: it is anirrelevant distraction, a clash of intentions. And although designs of littlehuman figures or landscapes or flowers are often used to decorate textiles orwallpaper, they are artistically inferior to the nonrepresentational designs.When recognizable objects are subordinated to and treated as a mere pattern ofcolors and shapes, they become incongruous.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 74.]See also: ART; BEAUTY; ESTHETICS; PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY; VISUAL ARTS. Deficit Financing. The government has no source of revenue, except the taxespaid by the producers. To free itself—for a while—from the limits set byreality, the government initiates a credit con game on a scale which the privatemanipulator could not dream of. It borrows money from you today, which is to berepaid with money it will borrow from you tomorrow, which is to be repaid withmoney it will borrow from you day after tomorrow, and so on. This is known as“deficit financing.” It is made possible by the fact that the government cutsthe connection between goods and money. It issues paper money, which is used asa claim check on actually existing goods—but that money is not backed by anygoods, it is not backed by gold, it is backed by nothing. It is a promissorynote issued to you in exchange for your goods, to be paid by you (in the form oftaxes) out of your future production.[“Egalitarianism and Inflation,” PWNI, 161; pb 133.]See also CREDIT, GOLD STANDARD; GOVERNMENT; INFLATION; MONEY; TAXATION; WELFARESTATE. Definitions. A definition is a statement that identifies the nature of the unitssubsumed under a concept.It is often said that definitions state the meaning of words. This is true, butit is not exact. A word is merely a visual-auditory symbol used to represent aconcept; a word has no meaning other than that of the concept it symbolizes, andthe meaning of a concept consists of its units. It is not words, but conceptsthat man defines—by specifying their referents.The purpose of a definition is to distinguish a concept from all other conceptsand thus to keep its units differentiated from all other existents.Since the definition of a concept is formulated in terms of other concepts, itenables man, not only to identify and retain a concept, but also to establishthe relationships, the hierarchy, the integration of all his concepts and thusthe integration of his knowledge. Definitions preserve, not the chronologicalorder in which a given man may have learned concepts, but the logical order oftheir hierarchical interdependence.With certain significant exceptions, every concept can be defined andcommunicated in terms of other concepts. The exceptions are concepts referringto sensations, and metaphysical axioms. [ITOE, 52.] The rules of correct definition are derived from the process ofconcept-formation. The units of a concept were differentiated—by means of adistinguishing characteristic(s)—from other existents possessing a commensurablecharacteristic, a Conceptual Common Denominator. A definition follows the sameprinciple: it specifies the distinguishing characteristic (s) of the units, andindicates the category of existents from which they were differentiated.The distinguishing characteristic(s) of the units becomes the differentia of theconcept’s definition; the existents possessing a Conceptual Common Denominatorbecome the genus.Thus a definition complies with the two essential functions of consciousness:differentiation and integration. The differentia isolates the units of a conceptfrom all other existents; the genus indicates their connection to a wider groupof existents.For instance, in the definition of table (“An item of furniture, consisting of aflat, level surface and supports, intended to support other, smaller objects”),the specified shape is the differentia, which distinguishes tables from theother entities belonging to the same genus: furniture. In the definition of man(“A rational animal”), “rational” is the differentia, “animal” is the genus.[Ibid., 53.] A definition must identify the nature of the units, i.e., the essentialcharacteristics without which the units would not be the kind of existents theyare.[Ibid., 55.] It is the principle of unit-economy that necessitates the definition of conceptsin terms of essential characteristics. If, when in doubt, a man recalls aconcept’s definition, the essential characteristic(s) will give him aninstantaneous grasp of the concept’s meaning, i.e., of the nature of itsreferents. For example, if he is considering some social theory and recalls that“man is a rational animal,” he will evaluate the validity of the theoryaccordingly; but if, instead, he recalls that “man is an animal possessing athumb,” his evaluation and conclusion will be quite different.[Ibid., 86.] Now observe... the process of determining an essential characteristic: the ruleof fundamentality. When a given group of existents has more than onecharacteristic distinguishing it from other existents, man must observe therelationships among these various characteristics and discover the one on whichall the others (or the greatest number of others) depend, i.e., the fundamentalcharacteristic without which the others would not be possible. This fundamentalcharacteristic is the essential distinguishing characteristic of the existentsinvolved. and the proper defining characteristic of the concept.Metaphysically, a fundamental characteristic is that distinctive characteristicwhich makes the greatest number of others possible; epistemologically, it is theone that explains the greatest number of others.[Ibid., 59.] All definitions are contextual, and a primitive definition does not contradict amore advanced one: the latter merely expands the former.[Ibid., 56.]Since man is not omniscient, a definition cannot be changelessly absolute,because it cannot establish the relationship of a given group of existents toeverything else in the universe, including the undiscovered and unknown. And forthe very same reasons, a definition is false and worthless if it is notcontextually absolute—if it does not specify the known relationships amongexistents (in terms of the known essential characteristics) or if it contradictsthe known (by omission or evasion).[Ibid., 62.] An objective definition, valid for all men, is one that designates the essentialdistinguishing characteristic(s) and genus of the existents subsumed under agiven concept—according to all the relevant knowledge available at that stage ofmankind’s development.[Ibid., 61.] Truth is the product of the recognition (i.e., identification) of the facts ofreality. Man identifies and integrates the facts of reality by means ofconcepts. He retains concepts in his mind by means of definitions. He organizesconcepts into propositions—and the truth or falsehood of his propositions rests,not only on their relation to the facts he asserts, but also on the truth orfalsehood of the definitions of the concepts he uses to assert them, which restson the truth or falsehood of his designations of essential characteristics.[Ibid., 63.] The truth or falsehood of all of man’s conclusions, inferences, thought andknowledge rests on the truth or falsehood of his definitions.[Ibid., 65.] Definitions are the guardians of rationality, the first line of defense againstthe chaos of mental disintegration.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 77.] To know the exact meaning of the concepts one is using, one must know theircorrect definitions, one must be able to retrace the specific (logical, notchronological) steps by which they were formed, and one must be able todemonstrate their connection to their base in perceptual reality.When in doubt about the meaning or the definition of a concept, the best methodof clarification is to look for its referents—i.e., to ask oneself : What factor facts of reality gave rise to this concept? What distinguishes it from allother concepts?[ITOE, 67.]Let us note, at this point, the radical difference between Aristotle’s view ofconcepts and the Objectivist view, particularly in regard to the issue ofessential characteristics.It is Aristotle who first formulated the principles of correct definition. It isAristotle who identified the fact that only concretes exist. But Aristotle heldthat definitions refer to metaphysical essences, which exist in concretes as aspecial element or formative power, and he held that the process ofconcept-formation depends on a kind of direct intuition by which man’s mindgrasps these essences and forms concepts accordingly.Aristotle regarded “essence” as metaphysical; Objectivism regards it asepistemological.Objectivism holds that the essence of a concept is that fundamentalcharacteristic(s) of its units on which the greatest number of othercharacteristics depend, and which distinguishes these units from all otherexistents within the field of a man’s knowledge. Thus the essence of a conceptis determined contextually and may be altered with the growth of man’sknowledge. The metaphysical referent of man’s concepts is not a special,separate metaphysical essence, but the total of the facts of reality he hasobserved, and this total determines which characteristics of a given group ofexistents he designates as essential. An essential characteristic is factual, inthe sense that it does exist, does determine other characteristics and doesdistinguish a group of existents from all others; it is epistemological in thesense that the classification of “essential characteristic” is a device of man’smethod of cognition—a means of classifying, condensing and integrating anever-growing body of knowledge.[Ibid., 68.] It is important to remember that a definition implies all the characteristics ofthe units, since it identifies their essential, not their exhaustive,characteristics; since it designates existents, not their isolated aspects; andsince it is a condensation of, not a substitute for, a wider knowledge of theexistents involved.[Ibid., 55.] When “rational animal” is selected as the definition of “man,” this does notmean that the concept “man” becomes a shorthand tag for “anything whatever thathas rationality and animality.” It does not mean that the concept “man” isinterchangeable with the phrase “rational animal,” and that all of man’s othercharacteristics are excluded from the concept. It means: A certain type ofentity, including all its characteristics, is, in the present context ofknowledge, most fundamentally distinguished from all other entities by the factthat it is a rational animal. All the presently available knowledge of man’sother characteristics is required to validate this definition, and is implied byit. All these other characteristics remain part of the content of the concept“man.”[Leonard Peikoff, ‘“The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 139.]See also ANALYTIC-SYNTHETIC DICHOTOMY; ARISTOTLE; COMMUNICATION; CONCEPTS;CONCEPTUAL COMMON DENOMINATOR; CONTEXT; GENUS and SPECIES; HIERARCHY ofKNOWLEDGE; LANGUAGE; OSTENSIVE DEFINITION; SENSATIONS; UNIT; UNIT-ECONOMY;WORDS. Democracy. “Democratic” in its original meaning [refers to] unlimited majorityrule ... a social system in which one’s work, one’s property, one’s mind, andone’s life are at the mercy of any gang that may muster the vote of a majorityat any moment for any purpose.[“How to Read (and Not to Write),” ARL, I, 26, 4.] If we discard morality and substitute for it the Collectivist doctrine ofunlimited majority rule, if we accept the idea that a majority may do anythingit pleases, and that anything done by a majority is right because it’s done by amajority (this being the only standard of right and wrong) —how are men to applythis in practice to their actual lives? Who is the majority? In relation to eachparticular man, all other men are potential members of that majority which maydestroy him at its pleasure at any moment. Then each man and all men becomeenemies; each has to fear and suspect all; each must try to rob and murderfirst, before he is robbed and murdered.[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet, 9.] The American system is not a democracy. It is a constitutional republic. Ademocracy, if you attach meaning to terms, is a system of unlimited majorityrule; the classic example is ancient Athens. And the symbol of it is the fate ofSocrates, who was put to death legally, because the majority didn’t like what hewas saying, although he had initiated no force and had violated no one’s rights.Democracy, in short, is a form of collectivism, which denies individual rights:the majority can do whatever it wants with no restrictions. In principle, thedemocratic government is all-powerful. Democracy is a totalitarianmanifestation; it is not a form of freedom....The American system is a constitutionally limited republic, restricted to theprotection of individual rights. In such a system, majority rule is applicableonly to lesser details, such as the selection of certain personnel. But themajority has no say over the basic principles governing the government. It hasno power to ask for or gain the infringement of individual rights.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture9.]See also COLLECTIVISM; DICTATORSHIP; FREEDOM; GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS;MINORITY RIGHTS; REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT; REPUBLIC; SOCIALISM; STATISM;TYRANNY; VOTING. Deontological Theory of Ethics. See “Duty.”Determinism. Determinism is the theory that everything that happens in theuniverse—including every thought, feeling, and action of man—is necessitated byprevious factors, so that nothing could ever have happened differently from theway it did, and everything in the future is already pre-set and inevitable.Every aspect of man’s life and character, on this view, is merely a product offactors that are ultimately outside his control. Objectivism rejects thistheory.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series, Lecture 1.] Dictatorship and determinism are reciprocally reinforcing corollaries. if oneseeks to enslave men, one has to destroy their reliance on the validity of theirown judgments and choices—if one believes that reason and volition are impotent,one has to accept the rule of force.[“Representation Without Authorization,” ARL, I, 21, I.] See also AXIOMS; CAUSALITY; DICTATORSHIP; EMOTIONS; FREE WILL; METAPHYSICAL vs.MAN-MADE; NATURALISM; NECESSITY. Dictator. A mystic is driven by the urge to impress, to cheat, to flatter, todeceive, to force that omnipotent consciousness of others. “They” are his onlykey to reality, he feels that he cannot exist save by harnessing theirmysterious power and extorting their unaccountable consent. “They” are his onlymeans of perception and, like a blind man who depends on the sight of a dog, hefeels he must leash them in order to live. To control the consciousness ofothers becomes his only passion; power-lust is a weed that grows only in thevacant lots of an abandoned mind.Every dictator is a mystic, and every mystic is a potential dictator. A mysticcraves obedience from men, not their agreement. He wants them to surrender theirconsciousness to his assertions, his edicts, his wishes, his whims—as hisconsciousness is surrendered to theirs. He wants to deal with men by means offaith and force—he finds no satisfaction in their consent if he must earn it bymeans of facts and reason. Reason is the enemy he dreads and, simultaneously,considers precarious; reason, to him, is a means of deception; he feels that menpossess some power more potent than reason—and only their causeless belief ortheir forced obedience can give him a sense of security, a proof that he hasgained control of the mystic endowment he lacked. His lust is to command, not toconvince: conviction requires an act of independence and rests on the absoluteof an objective reality. What he seeks is power over reality and over men’smeans of perceiving it, their mind, the power to interpose his will betweenexistence and consciousness, as if, by agreeing to fake the reality he ordersthem to fake, men would, in fact, create it.[GS, FNI, 201; pb 161.] Destruction is the only end that the mystics’ creed has ever achieved, as it isthe only end that you see them achieving today, and if the ravages wrought bytheir acts have not made them question their doctrines, if they profess to bemoved by love, yet are not deterred by piles of human corpses, it is because thetruth about their souls is worse than the obscene excuse you have allowed them,the excuse that the end justifies the means and that the horrors they practiceare means to nobler ends. The truth is that those horrors are their ends.You who’re depraved enough to believe that you could adjust yourself to amystic’s dictatorship and could please him by obeying his orders—there is no wayto please him; when you obey, he will reverse his orders; he seeks obedience forthe sake of obedience and destruction for the sake of destruction. You who arecraven enough to believe that you can make terms with a mystic by giving in tohis extortions—there is no way to buy him off, the bribe he wants is your life,as slowly or as fast as you are willing to give it in—and the monster he seeksto bribe is the hidden blank-out in his mind, which drives him to kill in ordernot to learn that the death he desires is his own.[Ibid., 203; pb 162.] Perhaps the most craven attitude of all is the one expressed by the injunction“don’t be certain.” As stated explicitly by many intellectuals, it is thesuggestion that if nobody is certain of anything, if nobody holds any firmconvictions, if everybody is willing to give in to everybody else, no dictatorwill rise among us and we will escape the destruction sweeping the rest of theworld. This is the secret voice of the Witch Doctor confessing that he sees adictator, an Attila, as a man of confident strength and uncompromisingconviction. Nothing but a psycho-epistemological panic can blind suchintellectuals to the fact that a dictator, like any thug, runs from the firstsign of confident resistance; that he can rise only in a society of preciselysuch uncertain, compliant, shaking compromisers as they advocate, a society thatinvites a thug to take over; and that the task of resisting an Attila can beaccomplished only by men of intransigent conviction and moral certainty.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 51; pb 45.]See also COMPROMISE; DICTATORSHIP; MYSTICISM; PHYSICAL. FORCE; SECOND-HANDERS;STATISM; TYRANNY. Dictatorship. A dictatorship is a country that does not recognize individualrights, whose government holds total, unlimited power over men. [“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 15.] There are four characteristics which brand a country unmistakably as adictatorship: one-party rule—executions without trial or with a mock trial, forpolitical offenses—the nationalization or expropriation of private property—andcensorship. A country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moral prerogatives,any claim to national rights or sovereignty, and becomes an outlaw.[“Collectivized ‘Rights,’ ” VOS, 141; pb 105.] Volumes can be and have been written about the issue of freedom versusdictatorship, but, in essence, it comes down to a single question: do youconsider it moral to treat men as sacrificial animals and to rule them byphysical force?[“Foreword,” WTL, viii.] The right of a nation to determine its own form of government does not includethe right to establish a slave society (that is, to legalize the enslavement ofsome men by others). There is no such thing as “the right to enslave.” A nationcan do it, just as a man can become a criminal—but neither can do it by right.It does not matter, in this context, whether a nation was enslaved by force,like Soviet Russia, or by vote, like Nazi Germany. Individual rights are notsubject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of aminority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minoritiesfrom oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is theindividual). Whether a slave society was conquered or chose to be enslaved, itcan claim no national rights and no recognition of such “rights” by civilizedcountries....Dictatorship nations are outlaws. Any free nation had the right to invade NaziGermany and, today, has the right to invade Soviet Russia, Cuba or any otherslave pen. Whether a free nation chooses to do so or not is a matter of its ownself-interest, not of respect for the non-existent “rights” of gang rulers. Itis not a free nation’s duty to liberate other nations at the price ofself-sacrifice, but a free nation has the right to do it, when and if it sochooses.This right, however, is conditional. Just as the suppression of crimes does notgive a policeman the right to engage in criminal activities, so the invasion anddestruction of a dictatorship does not give the invader the right to establishanother variant of a slave society in the conquered country. [“Collectivized ‘Rights,’ ” VOS, 139; pb 104.] Dictatorship and determinism are reciprocally reinforcing corollaries: if oneseeks to enslave men, one has to destroy their reliance on the validity of theirown judgments and choices—if one believes that reason and volition are impotent,one has to accept the rule of force.[“Representation Without Authorization,” ARL, I, 21, 1.] It is a grave error to suppose that a dictatorship rules a nation by means ofstrict, rigid laws which are obeyed and enforced with rigorous, militaryprecision. Such a rule would be evil, but almost bearable; men could endure theharshest edicts, provided these edicts were known, specific and stable; it isnot the known that breaks men’s spirits, but the unpredictable. A dictatorshiphas to be capricious; it has to rule by means of the unexpected, theincomprehensible, the wantonly irrational; it has to deal not in death, but insudden death; a state of chronic uncertainty is what men are psychologicallyunable to bear.[“Antitrust: The Rule of Unreason,” TON, Feb. 1962. 5.] The legal hallmark of a dictatorship [is] preventive law—the concept that a manis guilty until he is proved innocent by the permissive rubber stamp of acommissar or a Gauleiter.[“Who Will Protect Us from Our Protectors?” TON, May 1962, 20.] A dictatorship has to promulgate some sort of distant goals and moral ideals inorder to justify its rule and the people’s immolation; the extent to which itsucceeds in convincing its victims, is the extent of its own danger; sooner orlater, its contradictions are thrown in its face by the best of its subjects:the ablest, the most intelligent, the most honest. Thus a dictatorship is forcedto destroy and to keep on destroying the best of its “human resources.” And beit fifty years or five centuries later, ambitious thugs and lethargic drones areall a dictatorship will have left to exploit and rule; the rest will die young,physically or spiritually.[“The ‘Inexplicable Personal Alchemy,”’ NL, 119.] Every movement that seeks to enslave a country, every dictatorship or potentialdictatorship, needs some minority group as a scapegoat which it can blame forthe nation’s troubles and use as a justification of its own demands fordictatorial powers. In Soviet Russia, the scapegoat was the bourgeoisie; in NaziGermany, it was the Jewish people; in America, it is the businessmen.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 45.] It makes no difference whether government controls allegedly favor the interestsof labor or business, of the poor or the rich, of a special class or a specialrace: the results are the same. The notion that a dictatorship can benefit anyone social group at the expense of others is a worn remnant of the Marxistmythology of class warfare, refuted by half a century of factual evidence. Allmen are victims and losers under a dictatorship; nobody wins—except the rulingclique.[“The Fascist New Frontier,” pamphlet, 13.]See also COLLECTIVISM; COMMUNISM; DETERMINISM; DICTATOR; FASCISM/NAZISM; FASCISMand COMMUNISM/SOCIALISM; FOREIGN POLICY; FREEDOM; GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS;SOVIET RUSSIA; SELF-DETERMINATION of NATIONS; STATISM; TYRANNY. Director. In all the arts that involve more than one performer, a cruciallyimportant artist is the director. (In music, his counterpart is the conductor.)The director is the link between the performing and the primary arts. He is aperformer in relation to the primary work, in the sense that his task is themeans to the end set by the work—he is a primary artist in relation to the cast,the set designer, the cameraman, etc., in the sense that they are the means tohis end, which is the translation of the work into physical action as ameaningful, stylized, integrated whole. In the dramatic arts, the director isthe esthetic integrator.This task requires a first-hand understanding of all the arts, combined with anunusual power of abstract thought and of creative imagination. Great directorsare extremely rare. An average director alternates between the twin pitfalls ofabdication and usurpation. Either he rides on the talents of others and merelyputs the actors through random motions signifying nothing, which results in ahodgepodge of clashing intentions—or he hogs the show, putting everyone throughsenseless tricks unrelated to or obliterating the play (if any), on the invertedpremise that the play is the means to the end of exhibiting his skill, thusplacing himself in the category of circus acrobats, except that he is much lessskillful and much less entertaining.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 71.]See also ART; CHOREOGRAPHER; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); MOTION PICTURES: PERFORMINGARTS.

[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 9.] PLAYBOY: If widely accepted, couldn’t Objectivism harden into a dogma?RAND: No. I have found that Objectivism is its own protection against people whomight attempt to use it as a dogma. Since Objectivism requires the use of one’smind, those who attempt to take broad principles and apply them unthinkingly andindiscriminately to the concretes of their own existence find that it cannot bedone. They are then compelled either to reject Objectivism or to apply it. WhenI say apply, I mean that they have to use their own mind, their own thinking, inorder to know how to apply Objectivist principles to the specific problems oftheir own lives.[Ibid.]See also FAITH; LOGIC; MYSTICISM; OBJECTIVISM; PROOF; REASON; RF.I,IGION. Draft. Of all the statist violations of individual rights in a mixed economy,the military draft is the worst. It is an abrogation of rights. It negates man’sfundamental right—the right to life—and establishes the fundamental principle ofstatism: that a man’s life belongs to the state, and the state may claim it bycompelling him to sacrifice it in battle. Once that principle is accepted, therest is only a matter of time.If the state may force a man to risk death or hideous maiming and crippling, ina war declared at the state’s discretion, for a cause he may neither approve ofnor even understand, if his consent is not required to send him into unspeakablemartyrdom—then, in principle, all rights are negated in that state, and itsgovernment is not man’s protector any longer. What else is there left toprotect?The most immoral contradiction—in the chaos of today’s anti-ideologicalgroups—is that of the so-called “conservatives,” who posture as defenders ofindividual rights, particularly property rights, but uphold and advocate thedraft. By what infernal evasion can they hope to justify the proposition thatcreatures who have no right to life, have the right to a bank account? Aslightly higher—though not much higher—rung of hell should be reserved for those“liberals” who claim that man has the “right” to economic security, publichousing, medical care, education, recreation, but no right to life, or: that manhas the right to livelihood, but not to life.One of the notions used by all sides to justify the draft, is that “rightsimpose obligations.” Obligations, to whom?—and imposed, by whom? Ideologically,that notion is worse than the evil it attempts to justify: it implies thatrights are a gift from the state, and that a man has to buy them by offeringsomething (his life) in return. Logically, that notion is a contradiction: sincethe only proper function of a government is to protect man’s rights, it cannotclaim title to his life in exchange for that protection.The only “obligation” involved in individual rights is an obligation imposed,not by the state, but by the nature of reality (i.e., by the law of identity):consistency, which, in this case, means the obligation to respect the rights ofothers, if one wishes one’s own rights to be recognized and protected.Politically, the draft is clearly unconstitutional. No amount ofrationalization, neither by the Supreme Court nor by private individuals, canalter the fact that it represents “involuntary servitude.”A volunteer army is the only proper, morat—and practical—way to defend a freecountry. Should a man volunteer to fight, if his country is attacked? Yes—if hevalues his own rights and freedom. A free (or even semi-free) country has neverlacked volunteers in the face of foreign aggression. Many military authoritieshave testified that a volunteer army—an army of men who know what they arefighting for and why —is the best, most effective army, and that a drafted oneis the least effective.It is often asked: “But what if a country cannot find a sufficient number ofvolunteers?” Even so, this would not give the rest of the population a right tothe lives of the country’s young men. But, in fact, the lack of volunteersoccurs for one of two reasons: (1) If a country is demoralized by a corrupt,authoritarian government, its citizens will not volunteer to defend it. Butneither will they fight for long, if drafted. For example, observe the literaldisintegration of the Czarist Russian army in World War I. (2) If a country’sgovernment undertakes to fight a war for some reason other than self-defense,for a purpose which the citizens neither share nor understand, it will not findmany volunteers. Thus a volunteer army is one of the best protectors of peace,not only against foreign aggression, but also against any warlike ideologies orprojects on the part of a country’s own government.Not many men would volunteer for such wars as Korea or Vietnam. Without thepower to draft, the makers of our foreign policy would not be able to embark onadventures of that kind. This is one of the best practical reasons for theabolition of the draft.[“The Wreckage of the Consensus,” CUI, 226.] The years from about fifteen to twenty-five are the crucial formative years of aman’s life. This is the time when he confirms his impressions of the world, ofother men, of the society in which he is to live, when he acquires consciousconvictions, defines his moral values, chooses his goals, and plans his future,developing or renouncing ambition. These are the years that mark him for life.And it is these years that an allegedly humanitarian society forces him to spendin terror—the terror of knowing that he can plan nothing and count on nothing,that any road he takes can be blocked at any moment by an unpredictable power,that, barring his vision of the future, there stands the gray shape of thebarracks, and, perhaps, beyond it, death for some unknown reason in some alienjungle.[Ibid., 229.] Once in a while, I receive letters from young men asking me for personal adviceon problems connected with the draft. Morally, no one can give advice in anyissue where choices and decisions are not voluntary: “Morality ends where a gunbegins.” As to the practical alternatives available, the best thing to do is toconsult a good lawyer.There is, however, one moral aspect of the issue that needs clarification. Someyoung men seem to labor under the misapprehension that since the draft is aviolation of their rights, compliance with the draft law would constitute amoral sanction of that violation. This is a serious error. A forced complianceis not a sanction. All of us are forced to comply with many laws that violateour rights, but so long as we advocate the repeal of such laws, our compliancedoes not constitute a sanction. Unjust laws have to be fought ideologically;they cannot be fought or corrected by means of mere disobedience and futilemartyrdom. To quote from an editorial on this subject in the April 1967 issue ofPersuasion: “One does not stop the juggernaut by throwing oneself in front ofit....”[Ibid., 235.] See also COLLECTIVISM; “DUTY”; FREEDOM; INDIVIDUAI. RIGHTS; LIFE, RIGHT to;RESPONSIBILITY/OBLIGATION; WAR. “Duty.” One of the most destructive anti-concepts in the history of moralphilosophy is the term “duty.”An anti-concept is an artificial, unnecessary and rationally unusable termdesigned to replace and obliterate some legitimate concept. The term “duty”obliterates more than single concepts; it is a metaphysical and psychologicalkiller: it negates all the essentials of a rational view of life and makes theminapplicable to man’s actions....The meaning of the term “duty” is: the moral necessity to perform certainactions for no reason other than obedience to some higher authority, withoutregard to any personal goal, motive, desire or interest.It is obvious that that anti-concept is a product of mysticism, not anabstraction derived from reality. In a mystic theory of ethics, “duty” standsfor the notion that man must obey the dictates of a supernatural authority. Eventhough the anti-concept has been secularized, and the authority of God’s willhas been ascribed to earthly entities, such as parents, country, State, mankind,etc., their alleged supremacy still rests on nothing but a mystic edict. Who inhell can have the right to claim that sort of submission or obedience? This isthe only proper form—and locality—for the question, because nothing and no onecan have such a right or claim here on earth.The arch-advocate of “duty” is Immanuel Kant; he went so much farther than othertheorists that they seem innocently benevolent by comparison. “Duty,” he holds,is the only standard of virtue; but virtue is not its own reward: if a reward isinvolved, it is no longer virtue. The only moral motivation, he holds, isdevotion to duty for duty’s sake; only an action motivated exclusively by suchdevotion is a moral action....If one were to accept it, the anti-concept “duty” destroys the concept ofreality: an unaccountable, supernatural power takes precedence over facts anddictates one’s actions regardless of context or consequences.“Duty” destroys reason: it supersedes one’s knowledge and judgment, making theprocess of thinking and judging irrelevant to one’s actions.“Duty” destroys values: it demands that one betray or sacrifice one’s highestvalues for the sake of an inexplicable command—and it transforms values into athreat to one’s moral worth, since the experience of pleasure or desire castsdoubt on the moral purity of one’s motives.“Duty” destroys love: who could want to be loved not from “inclination,” butfrom “duty”?“Duty” destroys self-esteem: it leaves no self to be esteemed.If one accepts that nightmare in the name of morality, the infernal irony isthat “duty” destroys morality. A deontological (duty-centered) theory of ethicsconfines moral principles to a list of prescribed “duties” and leaves the restof man’s life without any moral guidance, cutting morality off from anyapplication to the actual problems and concerns of man’s existence. Such mattersas work, career, ambition, love, friendship, pleasure, happiness, values(insofar as they are not pursued as duties) are regarded by these theories asamoral, i.e., outside the province of morality. If so, then by what standard isa man to make his daily choices, or direct the course of his life?In a deontological theory, all personal desires are banished from the realm ofmorality; a personal desire has no moral significance, be it a desire to createor a desire to kill. For example, if a man is not supporting his life from duty,such a morality makes no distinction between supporting it by honest labor or byrobbery. If a man wants to be honest, he deserves no moral credit; as Kant wouldput it, such honesty is “praiseworthy,” but without “moral import.” Only avicious represser, who feels a profound desire to lie, cheat and steal, butforces himself to act honestly for the sake of “duty,” would receive arecognition of moral worth from Kant and his ilk.This is the sort of theory that gives morality a bad name.[“Causality Versus Duty,” PWNI, 114; pb 95.] In reality and in the Objectivist ethics, there is no such thing as “duty.”There is only choice and the full, clear recognition of a principle obscured bythe notion of “duty”: the law of causality....In order to make the choices required to achieve his goals, a man needs theconstant, automatized awareness of the principle which the anti-concept “duty”has all but obliterated in his mind: the principle of causality—specifically, ofAristotelian final causation (which, in fact, applies only to a consciousbeing), i.e., the process by which an end determines the means, i.e., theprocess of choosing a goal and taking the actions necessary to achieve it.In a rational ethics, it is causality—not “duty”—that serves as the guidingprinciple in considering, evaluating and choosing one’s actions, particularlythose necessary to achieve a long-range goal. Following this principle, a mandoes not act without knowing the purpose of his action. In choosing a goal, heconsiders the means required to achieve it, he weighs the value of the goalagainst the difficulties of the means and against the full, hierarchical contextof all his other values and goals. He does not demand the impossible of himself,and he does not decide too easily which things are impossible. He never dropsthe context of the knowledge available to him, and never evades reality,realizing fully that his goal will not be granted to him by any power other thanhis own action, and, should he evade, it is not some Kantian authority that hewould be cheating, but himself.[Ibid., 118; pb 98.] A Kantian or even a semi-Kantian cannot permit himself to value anythingprofoundly, since an inexplicable “duty” may demand the sacrifice of his valuesat any moment, wiping out any long-range plan or struggle he might haveundertaken to achieve them....The notion of “duty” is intrinsically anti-causal. In its origin, a “duty”defies the principle of efficient causation—since it is causeless (orsupernatural); in its effects, it defies the principle of final causation—sinceit must be performed regardless of consequences.[Ibid., 120; pb 100.] The acceptance of full responsibility for one’s own choices and actions (andtheir consequences) is such a demanding moral discipline that many men seek toescape it by surrendering to what they believe is the easy, automatic,unthinking safety of a morality of “duty.” They learn better, often when it istoo late.The disciple of causation faces life without inexplicable chains, unchosenburdens, impossible demands or supernatural threats. His metaphysical attitudeand guiding moral principle can best be summed up by an old Spanish proverb:“God said: ‘Take what you want and pay for it.’ ” But to know one’s own desires,their meaning and their costs requires the highest human virtue: rationality.[Ibid., 121; pb 101.]See also ALTRUISM; “ANTI-CONCEPTS”; FREE WILL; KANT, IMMANUEL; MORALITY;MYSTICAL ETHICS; RATIONALITY; RELIGION; RESPONSIBILITY/OBLIGATION; SACRIFICE;SELF-ESTEEM; SELF-INTEREST; SELFISHNESS; SELFLESSNESS."},{"pageContent":"EEcology/Environmental Movement.

[“The Left: Old and New,” NL, 88.] In Western Europe, in the preindustrial Middle Ages, man’s life expectancy was30 years. In the nineteenth century, Europe’s population grew by 300percent—which is the best proof of the fact that for the first time in humanhistory, industry gave the great masses of people a chance to survive.If it were true that a heavy concentration of industry is destructive to humanlife, one would find life expectancy declining in the more advanced countries.But it has been rising steadily.

But this did not end life on earth.Contrary to the ecologists, nature does not stand still and does not maintainthe kind of “equilibrium” that guarantees the survival of any particularspecies—teast of all the survival of her greatest and most fragile product: man.[Ibid., 134.] Now observe that in all the propaganda of the ecologists—amidst all theirappeals to nature and pleas for “harmony with nature”—there is no discussion ofman’s needs and the requirements of his survival. Man is treated as if he werean unnatural phenomenon. Man cannot survive in the kind of state of nature thatthe ecologists envision—i.e., on the level of sea urchins or polar bears....In order to survive, man has to discover and produce everything he needs, whichmeans that he has to alter his background and adapt it to his needs. Nature hasnot equipped him for adapting himself to his background in the manner ofanimals. From the most primitive cultures to the most advanced civilizations,man has had to manufacture things; his well-being depends on his success atproduction. The lowest human tribe cannot survive without that alleged source ofpollution: fire. It is not merely symbolic that fire was the property of thegods which Prometheus brought to man. The ecologists are the new vulturesswarming to extinguish that fire.[Ibid., 136.] Without machines and technology, the task of mere survival is a terrible,mind-and-body-wrecking ordeal. In “nature,” the struggle for food, clothing andshelter consumes all of a man’s energy and spirit; it is a losing struggte—thewinner is any flood, earthquake or swarm of locusts. (Consider the 500,000bodies left in the wake of a single flood in Pakistan; they had been men wholived without technology.) To work only for bare necessities is a luxury thatmankind cannot afford.[Ibid., 149.] It has been reported in the press many times that the issue of pollution is tobe the next big crusade of the New Left activists, after the war in Vietnampeters out. And just as peace was not their goal or motive in that crusade, soclean air is not their goal or motive in this one.[“The Left: Old and New,” NL, 89.] The immediate goal is obvious: the destruction of the remnants of capitalism intoday’s mixed economy, and the establishment of a global dictatorship. This goaldoes not have to be inferred—many speeches and books on the subject stateexplicitly that the ecological crusade is a means to that end.[“The Anti-Industrial Revolution,” NL, 140.] If, after the failure of such accusations as “Capitalism leads you to thepoorhouse” and “Capitalism leads you to war,” the New Left is left with nothingbetter than: “Capitalism defiles the beauty of your countryside,” one mayjustifiably conclude that, as an intellectual power, the collectivist movementis through.[“The Left: Old and New,” NL., 93.] City smog and filthy rivers are not good for men (though they are not the kindof danger that the ecological panic-mongers proclaim them to be).

Economic Good. In order for a thing to become a good, three conditions must befulfilled.

Economic Growth. “Economic growth” means the rise of an economy’s productivity,due to the discovery of new products, new techniques, which means: due to theachievements of men’s productive ability.[“Promises to Parasites Fail to Bring Results,” Los Angeles Times, June 24,1962.] Nothing can raise a country’s productivity except technology, and technology isthe final product of a complex of sciences (including philosophy), each of themkept alive and moving by the achievements of a few independent minds.[“The Moratorium on Brains,” ARL, 1, 3, 5.]See also CAPITALISM; ECOLOGY/ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT; NEW LEFT; PRODUCTION;TECHNOLOGY. Economic Power vs. Political Power. A disastrous intellectual package-deal, putover on us by the theoreticians of statism, is the equation of economic powerwith political power. You have heard it expressed in such bromides as: “A hungryman is not free,” or “It makes no difference to a worker whether he takes ordersfrom a businessman or from a bureaucrat.” Most people accept theseequivocations—and yet they know that the poorest laborer in America is freer andmore secure than the richest commissar in Soviet Russia. What is the basic, theessential, the crucial principle that differentiates freedom from slavery? It isthe principle of voluntary action versus physical coercion or compulsion.The difference between political power and any other kind of social “power,”between a government and any private organization, is the fact that a governmentholds a legal monopoly on the use of physical force.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 46.] What is economic power? It is the power to produce and to trade what one hasproduced. In a free economy, where no man or group of men can use physicalcoercion against anyone, economic power can be achieved only by voluntary means:by the voluntary choice and agreement of all those who participate in theprocess of production and trade. In a free market, all prices, wages, andprofits are determined—not by the arbitrary whim of the rich or of the poor, notby anyone’s “greed” or by anyone’s need—but by the law of supply and demand. Themechanism of a free market reflects and sums up all the economic choices anddecisions made by all the participants. Men trade their goods or services bymutual consent to mutual advantage, according to their own independent,uncoerced judgment. A man can grow rich only if he is able to offer bettervalues——better products or services, at a lower price —than others are able tooffer.Wealth, in a free market, is achieved by a free, general, “democratic” vote—bythe sales and the purchases of every individual who takes part in the economiclife of the country. Whenever you buy one product rather than another, you arevoting for the success of some manufacturer. And, in this type of voting, everyman votes only on those matters which he is qualified to judge: on his ownpreferences, interests, and needs. No one has the power to decide for others orto substitute his judgment for theirs; no one has the power to appoint himself“the voice of the public” and to leave the public voiceless and disfranchised.Now let me define the difference between economic power and political power:economic power is exercised by means of a positive, by offering men a reward, anincentive, a payment, a value; political power is exercised by means of anegative, by the threat of punishment, injury. imprisonment, destruction. Thebusinessman’s tool is values; the bureaucrat’s tool is fear.[ibid., 47.] Evading the difference between production and looting, they called thebusinessman a robber. Evading the difference between freedom and compulsion,they called him a slave driver. Evading the difference between reward andterror, they called him an exploiter. Evading the difference between pay checksand guns, they called him an autocrat. Evading the difference between trade andforce, they called him a tyrant. The most crucial issue they had to evade wasthe difference between the earned and the unearned. [“For the New Intellectual,” , 44; pb 40.] You had said that you saw no difference between economic and political power,between the power of money and the power of guns—no difference between rewardand punishment, no difference between purchase and plunder, no differencebetween pleasure and fear, no difference between life and death.

Education. The only purpose of education is to teach a student how to live hislife—by developing his mind and equipping him to deal with reality.

Itappears, however, that the “progressive” rich will be the first victims of theirown social theories: it is the children of the well-to-do who emerge fromexpensive nursery schools and colleges as hippies, and destroy the remnants oftheir paralyzed brains by means of drugs.The middle class has created an antidote which is perhaps the most helpfulmovement of recent years: the spontaneous, unorganized, grass-roots revival ofthe Montessori system of education—a system aimed at the development of achild’s cognitive, i.e., rational, faculty.[“Don’t Let It Go,” PWNI, 261; pb 214.1 See also CONCEPTS; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); LEARNING; UNDERSTANDING. Egalitlriarilsm. Egalitarianism means the belief in the equality of all men. Ifthe word “equality” is to be taken in any serious or rational sense, the crusadefor this belief is dated by about a century or more: the United States ofAmerica has made it an anachronism—by establishing a system based on theprinciple of individual rights. “Equality,” in a human context, is a politicalterm: it means equality before the law, the equality of fundamental, inalienablerights which every man possesses by virtue of his birth as a human being, andwhich may not be infringed or abrogated by man-made institutions, such as titlesof nobility or the division of men into castes established by law, with specialprivileges granted to some and denied to others. The rise of capitalism sweptaway all castes, including the institutions of aristocracy and of slavery orserfdom.But this is not the meaning that the altruists ascribe to the word “equality.”They turn the word into an anti-concept: they use it to mean, not political, butmetaphysical equality—the equality of personal attributes and virtues,regardless of natural endowment or individual choice, performance and character.It is not man-made institutions, but nature, i.e., reality, that they propose tofight—by means of man-made institutions.Since nature does not endow all men with equal beauty or equal intelligence, andthe faculty of volition leads men to make different choices, the egalitarianspropose to abolish the “unfairness” of nature and of volition, and to establishuniversal equality in fact—in defiance of facts. Since the Law of Identity isimpervious to human manipulation, it is the Law of Causality that they struggleto abrogate. Since personal attributes or virtues cannot be “redistributed,”they seek to deprive men of their consequences—of the rewards, the benefits, theachievements created by personal attributes and virtues.It is not equality before the law that they seek, but inequality: theestablishment of an inverted social pyramid, with a new aristocracy on top—thearistocracy of non-value.[“The Age of Envy,” NL, 164.] To understand the meaning and motives of egalitarianism, project it into thefield of medicine. Suppose a doctor is called to help a man with a broken legand, instead of setting it, proceeds to break the legs of ten other men,explaining that this would make the patient feel better; when all these menbecome crippled for life, the doctor advocates the passage of a law compellingeveryone to walk on crutches—in order to make the cripples feel better andequalize the “unfairness” of nature.If this is unspeakable, how does it acquire an aura of morality—or even thebenefit of a moral doubt—when practiced in regard to man’s mind?[Ibid., 170.] Of special significance to the present discussion is the egalitarians’ defianceof the Law of Causality: their demand for equal results from unequal causes—orequal rewards for unequal performance.[“Egalitarianism and Inflation.” PWNI, 146; pb 121.] The new “theory of justice” [of John Rawls] demands that men counteract the“injustice” of nature by instituting the most obscenely unthinkable injusticeamong men: deprive “those favored by nature” (i.e., the talented, theintelligent, the creative) of the right to the rewards they produce (i.e., theright to life)—and grant to the incompetent, the stupid, the slothful a right tothe effortless enjoyment of the rewards they could not produce, could notimagine, and would not know what to do with. [“An Untitled Letter,” PWNI, 132; pb 110.] Observe that ... the egalitarians’ view of man is literally the view of achildren’s fairy tale—the notion that man, before birth, is some sort ofindeterminate thing, an entity without identity, something like a shapelesschunk of human clay, and that fairy godmothers proceed to grant or deny himvarious attributes (“favors”): intelligence, talent, beauty, rich parents, etc.These attributes are handed out “arbitrarily” (this word is preposterouslyinapplicable to the processes of nature), it is a “lottery” among pre-embryonicnon-entities, and—the supposedly adult mentalities conclude—since a winner couldnot possibly have “deserved” his “good fortune,” a man does not deserve or earnanything after birth, as a human being, because he acts by means of“undeserved,” “unmerited,” “unearned” attributes. Implication: to earn somethingmeans to choose and earn your personal attributes before you exist.[Ibid., 133; pb 111.] If there were such a thing as a passion for equality (not equality de jure, butde facto), it would be obvious to its exponents that there are only two ways toachieve it: either by raising all men to the mountaintop—or by razing themountains. The first method is impossible because it is the faculty of volitionthat determines a man’s stature and actions; but the nearest approach to it wasdemonstrated by the United States and capitalism, which protected the freedom,the rewards and the incentives for every individual’s achievement, each to theextent of his ability and ambition, thus raising the intellectual, moral andeconomic state of the whole society. The second method is impossible because, ifmankind were leveled down to the common denominator of its least competentmembers, it would not be able to survive (and its best would not choose tosurvive on such terms). Yet it is the second method that thealtruist-egalitarians are pursuing. The greater the evidence of their policy’sconsequences, i.e., the greater the spread of misery, of injustice, of viciousinequality throughout the world, the more frantic their pursuit —which is onedemonstration of the fact that there is no such thing as a benevolent passionfor equality and that the claim to it is only a rationalization to cover apassionate hatred of the good for being the good.[“The Age of Envy,” NL, 169.]See also ALTRUISM; ENVY/HATRED of the GOOD for BEING the GOOD; FREE WILL;JUSTICE; METAPHYSICAL vs. MAN-MADE; STATISM. Egoism. See Selfishness. Emergencies. It is important to differentiate between the rules of conduct in anemergency situation and the rules of conduct in the normal conditions of humanexistence. This does not mean a double standard of morality: the standard andthe basic principles remain the same, but their application to either caserequires precise definitions.An emergency is an unchosen, unexpected event, limited in time, that createsconditions under which human survival is impossible—such as a flood, anearthquake, a fire, a shipwreck. In an emergency situation, men’s primary goalis to combat the disaster, escape the danger and restore normal conditions (toreach dry land, to put out the fire. etc.).By “normal” conditions I mean metaphysically normal, normal in the nature ofthings, and appropriate to human existence. Men can live on land, but not inwater or in a raging fire. Since men are not omnipotent, it is metaphysicallypossible for unforeseeable disasters to strike them, in which case their onlytask is to return to those conditions under which their lives can continue. Byits nature, an emergency situation is temporary; if it were to last, men wouldperish.It is only in emergency situations that one should volunteer to help strangers,if it is in one’s power. For instance, a man who values human life and is caughtin a shipwreck, should help to save his fellow passengers (though not at theexpense of his own life). But this does not mean that after they all reachshore, he should devote his efforts to saving his fellow passengers frompoverty, ignorance, neurosis or whatever other troubles they might have. Nordoes it mean that he should spend his life sailing the seven seas in search ofshipwreck victims to save....The principle that one should help men in an emergency cannot be extended toregard all human suffering as an emergency and to turn the misfortune of someinto a first mortgage on the lives of others.[“The Ethics of Emergencies.” VOS, 53; pb 47.]See also BENEVOLENT UNIVERSE PREMISE; CHARITY: POVERTY; SELFISHNESS; SUFFERING. Emotions. Just as the pleasure-pain mechanism of man’s body is an automaticindicator of his body’s welfare or injury, a barometer of its basic alternative,life or death—so the emotional mechanism of man’s consciousness is geared toperform the same function, as a barometer that registers the same alternative bymeans of two basic emotions: joy or suffering. Emotions are the automaticresults of man’s value judgments integrated by his subconscious; emotions areestimates of that which furthers man’s values or threatens them, that which isfor him or against him—lightning calculators giving him the sum of his profit orloss.But while the standard of value operating the physical pleasure-pain mechanismof man’s body is automatic and innate, determined by the nature of his body—thestandard of value operating his emotional mechanism, is not. Since man has noautomatic knowledge, he can have no automatic values; since he has no innateideas, he can have no innate value judgments.Man is born with an emotional mechanism, just as he is born with a cognitivemechanism; but, at birth, both are “tabula rasa.” It is man’s cognitive faculty,his mind, that determines the content of both. Man’s emotional mechanism is likean electronic computer, which his mind has to program—and the programmingconsists of the values his mind chooses.But since the work of man’s mind is not automatic, his values, like all hispremises, are the product either of his thinking or of his evasions: man chooseshis values by a conscious process of thought—or accepts them by default, bysubconscious associations, on faith, on someone’s authority, by some form ofsocial osmosis or blind imitation. Emotions are produced by man’s premises, heldconsciously or subconsciously, explicitly or implicitly.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 23; pb 27.] Your subconscious is like a computer—more complex a computer than men canbuild—and its main function is the integration of your ideas. Who programs it?Your conscious mind. If you default, if you don’t reach any firm convictions,your subconscious is programmed by chance—and you deliver yourself into thepower of ideas you do not know you have accepted. But one way or the other, yourcomputer gives you print-outs, daily and hourly, in the form of emotions-whichare lightning-like estimates of the things around you, calculated according toyour values.[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 7; pb 5.] An emotion is an automatic response, an automatic effect of man’s valuepremises. An effect, not a cause. There is no necessary clash, no dichotomybetween man’s reason and his emotions—provided he observes their properrelationship. A rational man knows—or makes it a point to discover—the source ofhis emotions, the basic premises from which they come; if his premises arewrong, he corrects them. He never acts on emotions for which he cannot account,the meaning of which he does not understand. In appraising a situation, he knowswhy he reacts as he does and whether he is right. He has no inner conflicts, hismind and his emotions are integrated, his consciousness is in perfect harmony.His emotions are not his enemies, they are his means of enjoying life. But theyare not his guide; the guide is his mind. This relationship cannot be reversed,however. If a man takes his emotions as the cause and his mind as their passiveeffect, if he is guided by his emotions and uses his mind only to rationalize orjustify them somehow—then he is acting immorally, he is condemning himself tomisery, failure, defeat, and he will achieve nothing but destruction—his own andthat of others.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 6.] An emotion as such tells you nothing about reality, beyond the fact thatsomething makes you feel something. Without a ruthlessly honest commitment tointrospection—to the conceptual identification of your inner states—you will notdiscover what you feel, what arouses the feeling, and whether your feeling is anappropriate response to the facts of reality, or a mistaken response, or avicious illusion produced by years of self-deception....In the field of introspection, the two guiding questions are: “What do I feel?”and “Why do I feel it?”[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 20; pb 17.] There can be no causeless love or any sort of causeless emotion. An emotion is aresponse to a fact of reality, an estimate dictated by your standards.[GS, FNI, 182; pb 147.] Man has no choice about his capacity to feel that something is good for him orevil, but what he will consider good or evil, what will give him joy or pain,what he will love or hate, desire or fear, depends on his standard of value. Ifhe chooses irrational values, he switches his emotional mechanism from the roleof his guardian to the role of his destroyer. The irrational is the impossible;it is that which contradicts the facts of reality; facts cannot be altered by awish, but they can destroy the wisher. If a man desires and pursuescontradictions—if he wants to have his cake and eat it, too—he disintegrates hisconsciousness; he turns his inner life into a civil war of blind forces engagedin dark, incoherent, pointless, meaningless conflicts (which, incidentally, isthe inner state of most people today).[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 24; pb 28.] An emotion that clashes with your reason, an emotion that you cannot explain orcontrol, is only the carcass of that stale thinking which you forbade your mindto revise.[GS, FNI, 187; pb 151.] The quality of a computer’s output is determined by the quality of its input. Ifyour subconscious is programmed by chance, its output will have a correspondingcharacter. You have probably heard the computer operators’ eloquent term“gigo”—which means: “Garbage in, garbage out.” The same formula applies to therelationship between a man’s thinking and his emotions.A man who is run by emotions is like a man who is run by a computer whoseprint-outs he cannot read. He does not know whether its programming is true orfalse, right or wrong, whether it’s set to lead him to success or destruction,whether it serves his goals or those of some evil, unknowable power. He is blindon two fronts: blind to the world around him and to his own inner world, unableto grasp reality or his own motives, and he is in chronic terror of both.[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 7; pb 6.]Emotions are not tools of cognition... one must differentiate between one’sthoughts and one’s emotions with full clarity and precision. One does not haveto be omniscient in order to possess knowledge; one merely has to know thatwhich one does know, and distinguish it from that which one feels. Nor does oneneed a full system of philosophical epistemology in order to distinguish one’sown considered judgment from one’s feelings, wishes, hopes or fears.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 64; pb 55.] The concept “emotion” is formed by retaining the distinguishing characteristicsof the psychological action (an automatic response proceeding from an evaluationof an existent) and by omitting the particular contents (the existents) as wellas the degree of emotional intensity.[ITOE, 41.] See also AUTOMATIZATION; ENVY/HATRED of the GOOD for BEING the GOOD; FREUD;HAPPINESS; HOSTILITY; INTROSPECTION; LONELINESS; I.OVE; MOTIVATION; MOTIVATIONby LOVE vs. by FEAR; PLEASURE and PAIN; PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY; RATIONALITY;RATIONALIZATION; REASON; SENSE of LIFE; SOUL-BODY DICHOTOMY; SUBCONSClOUS;VALUES; WHIMS/WHIM-WORSHIP. End in Itself. See Ultimate Value. Enlightenment, Age of. The development from Aquinas through Locke and Newtonrepresents more than four hundred years of stumbling, tortuous, prodigiouseffort to secularize the Western mind, i.e., to liberate man from the medievalshackles. It was the buildup toward a climax: the eighteenth century, the Age ofEnlightenment. For the first time in modern history, an authentic respect forreason became the mark of an entire culture; the trend that had been implicit inthe centuries-long crusade of a handful of innovators now swept the Westexplicitly, reaching and inspiring educated men in every field. Reason, for solong the wave of the future, had become the animating force of the present.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 102; pb 101.] Confidence in the power of man replaced dependence on the grace of God—and thatrare intellectual orientation emerged, the key to the Enlightenment approach inevery branch of philosophy: secularism without skepticism.In metaphysics, this meant a fundamental change in emphasis: from God to thisworld, the world of particulars in which men live, the realm of nature.... Men’soperative conviction was that nature is an autonomous realm—solid, eternal, realin its own right. For centuries, nature had been regarded as a realm of miraclesmanipulated by a personal deity, a realm whose significance lay in the clues itoffered to the purposes of its author. Now the operative conviction was thatnature is a realm governed by scientific laws, which permit no miracles andwhich are intelligible without reference to the supernatural.[Ibid., 107; pb 106.] Just as there are no limits to man’s knowledge, many [Enlightenment era]thinkers held, so there are no limits to man’s moral improvement. If man is notyet perfect, they held, he is at least perfectible. Just as there are objective,natural laws in science, so there are objective, natural laws in ethics; and manis capable of discovering such laws and of acting in accordance with them. He iscapable not only of developing his intellect, but also of living by itsguidance. (This, at least, was the Enlightenment’s ethical program and promise.)Whatever the vacillations or doubts of particular thinkers, the dominant trendrepresented a new vision and estimate of man: man as a self-sufficient, rationalbeing and, therefore, as basically good, as potentially noble, as a value.[Ibid., 109; pb 107.] The father of this new world was a single philosopher: Aristotle. On countlessissues, Aristotle’s views differ from those of the Enlightenment. But, in termsof broad fundamentals, the philosophy of Aristotle is the philosophy of theEnlightenment.[Ibid., Ill; pb 109.] In epistemology, the European champions of the intellect had been unable toformulate a tenable view of the nature of reason or, therefore, to validatetheir proclaimed confidence in its power. As a result, from the beginning of theeighteenth century (and even earlier), the philosophy advocating reason was inthe process of gradual, but accelerating, disintegration.[Ibid., 115; pb 113.]See also AMERICA; ARISTOTLE; DARK AGES; FOUNDING FATHERS; HISTORY; MIDDLE AGES;NATURE; REASON; RELIGION; RENAISSANCE; SKEPTICISM. Entity. To exist is to be something, as distinguished from the nothing ofnon-existence, it is to be an entity of a specific nature made of specificattributes.[GS, FNI, 152; pb 125.]The development of human cognition starts with the ability to perceive things,i.e., entities. Of man’s five cognitive senses, only two provide him with adirect awareness of entities: sight and touch. The other three senses—hearing,taste and smell—give him an awareness of some of an entity’s attributes (or ofthe consequences produced by an entity): they tell him that something makessounds, or something tastes sweet, or something smells fresh; but in order toperceive this something, he needs sight and/or touch.The concept “entity” is (implicitly) the start of man’s conceptual developmentand the building-block of his entire conceptual structure. It is by perceivingentities that man perceives the universe.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 46.] The first concepts man forms are concepts of entities—since entities are theonly primary existents. (Attributes cannot exist by themselves, they are merelythe characteristics of entities; motions are motions of entities; relationshipsare relationships among entities.)[ITOE, 18.] This term [entity] may be used in several senses. If you speak in the primarysense, “entity” has to be defined ostensively- that is to say, by pointing. Ican, however, give you three descriptive characteristics essential to theprimary, philosophic use of the term, according to Objectivism. This is not adefinition, because I’d have to rely ultimately on pointing to make these pointsclear, but it will give you certain criteria for the application of the term inthe primary sense....1. An entity means a self-sufficient form of existence—as against a quality, anaction, a relationship, etc., which are simply aspects of an entity that weseparate out by specialized focus. An entity is a thing.2. An entity, in the primary sense, is a solid thing with a definite boundary—asagainst a fluid, such as air. In the literal sense, air is not an entity. Thereare contexts, such as when the wind moves as one mass, when you can call itthat, by analogy, but in the primary sense, fluids are not entities.3. An entity is perceptual in scale, in size. In other words it is a “this”which you can point to and grasp by human perception. In an extended sense youcan call molecules—or the universe as a whole—“entities,” because they areself-sufficient things. But in the primary sense when we say that entities arewhat is given in sense perception, we mean solid things which we can directlyperceive.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976),question period, Lecture 3.]An entity is a solid thing open to human perception and capable of independentaction.[Ibid., question period, Lecture 2.]See also CAUSALITY; CHANGE; EXISTENCE; EXISTENT; IDENTITY; MOTION; UNIVERSE. Environmentalism. See Ecology/Environmental Movement. Envy/Hatred of the Good for Being the Good. Today, we live in the Age of Envy.“Envy” is not the emotion I have in mind, but it is the clearest manifestationof an emotion that has remained nameless; it is the only element of a complexemotional sum that men have permitted themselves to identify.Envy is regarded by most people as a petty, superficial emotion and, therefore,it serves as a semihuman cover for so inhuman an emotion that those who feel itseldom dare admit it even to themselves.... That emotion is: hatred of the goodfor being the good.This hatred is not resentment against some prescribed view of the good withwhich one does not agree.... Hatred of the good for being the good means hatredof that which one regards as good by one’s own (conscious or subconscious)judgment. It means hatred of a person for possessing a value or virtue oneregards as desirable.If a child wants to get good grades in school, but is unable or unwilling toachieve them and begins to hate the children who do, that is hatred of the good.If a man regards intelligence as a value, but is troubled by self-doubt andbegins to hate the men he judges to be intelligent, that is hatred of the good.The nature of the particular values a man chooses to hold is not the primaryfactor in this issue (although irrational values may contribute a great deal tothe formation of that emotion). The primary factor and distinguishingcharacteristic is an emotional mechanism set in reverse: a response of hatred,not toward human vices, but toward human virtues.To be exact, the emotional mechanism is not set in reverse, but is set one way:its exponents do not experience love for evil men; their emotional range islimited to hatred or indifference. It is impossible to experience love, which isa response to values, when one’s automatized response to values is hatred.[“The Age of Envy,” NL, 152.] Consider the full meaning of this attitude. Values are that which one acts togain and/or keep. Values are a necessity of man’s survival, and wider: of anyliving organism’s survival. Life is a process of sen-sustain ing andself-generated action, and the successful pursuit of values is a precondition ofremaining alive. Since nature does not provide man with an automatic knowledgeof the code of values he requires, there are differences in the codes which menaccept and the goals they pursue. But consider the abstraction “value,” apartfrom the particular content of any given code, and ask yourself: What is thenature of a creature in which the sight of a value arouses hatred and the desireto destroy? In the most profound sense of the term, such a creature is a killer,not a physical, but a metaphysical one—it is not an enemy of your values, but ofall values, it is an enemy of anything that enables men to survive, it is anenemy of life as such and of everything living.[Ibid., 157.] They do not want to own your fortune, they want you to lose it; they do not wantto succeed, they want you to fail; they do not want to live, they want you todie; they desire nothing, they hate existence, and they keep running, eachtrying not to learn that the object of his hatred is himself.... They are theessence of evil, they, those anti-living objects who seek, by devouring theworld, to fill the selfless zero of their soul. It is not your wealth thatthey’re after. Theirs is a conspiracy against the mind, which means: againstlife and man.[GS, FNI, 203; pb 163.]See also AMORALISM; ANTI-CONCEPTUAL MENTALITY; APPEASE MENT; EMOTIONS; EVIL;GOOD, the; HOSTILITY; VALUES. Epistemology. Epistemology is a science devoted to the discovery of the propermethods of acquiring and validating knowledge.[ITOE, 47.] Since man is not omniscient or infallible, you have to discover what you canclaim as knowledge and how to prove the validity of your conclusions. Does manacquire knowledge by a process of reason—or by sudden revelation from asupernatural power? Is reason a faculty that identifies and integrates thematerial provided by man’s senses—or is it fed by innate ideas, implanted inman’s mind before he was born? Is reason competent to perceive reality—or doesman possess some other cognitive faculty which is superior to reason? Can manachieve certainty —or is he doomed to perpetual doubt? The extent of yourself-confidence—and of your success—will be different, according to which set ofanswers you accept.[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 3; pb 3.]Man is neither infallible nor omniscient; if he were, a discipline such asepistemoiogy—the theory of knowledge—would not be necessary nor possible: hisknowledge would be automatic, unquestionable and total. But such is not man’snature. Man is a being of volitional consciousness: beyond the level ofpercepts—a level inadequate to the cognitive requirements of his survival—manhas to acquire knowledge by his own effort, which he may exercise or not, and bya process of reason, which he may apply correctly or not. Nature gives him noautomatic guarantee of his mental efficacy; he is capable of error, of evasion,of psychological distortion. He needs a method of cognition, which he himselfhas to discover: he must discover how to use his rational faculty, how tovalidate his conclusions, how to distinguish truth from falsehood, how to setthe criteria of what he may accept as knowledge. Two questions are involved inhis every conclusion, conviction, decision, choice or claim: What do Iknow?—and: How do I know it?It is the task of epistemology to provide the answer to the “How?”—which thenenables the special sciences to provide the answers to the “What?”In the history of philosophy—with some very rare exceptions—epistemologicaltheories have consisted of attempts to escape one or the other of the twofundamental questions which cannot be escaped. Men have been taught either thatknowledge is impossible (skepticism) or that it is available without effort(mysticism). These two positions appear to be antagonists, but are, in fact, twovariants on the same theme, two sides of the same fraudulent coin: the attemptto escape the responsibility of rational cognition and the absolutism ofreatity—the attempt to assert the primacy of consciousness over existence.[ITOE, 104.] See Conceptual Index: Epistemology. Equality (Social-Political). See Egalitarianism. Errors of Knowledge vs. Breaches of Morality. Learn to distinguish thedifference between errors of knowledge and breaches of morality. An error ofknowledge is not a moral flaw, provided you are willing to correct it; only amystic would judge human beings by the standard of an impossible, automaticomniscience. But a breach of morality is the conscious choice of an action youknow to be evil, or a willful evasion of knowledge, a suspension of sight and ofthought. That which you do not know, is not a moral charge against you; but thatwhich you refuse to know, is an account of infamy growing in your soul. Makeevery allowance for errors of knowledge; do not forgive or accept any breach ofmorality. Give the benefit of the doubt to those who seek to know; but treat aspotential killers those specimens of insolent depravity who make demands uponyou, announcing that they have and seek no reasons, proclaiming, as a license,that they “just feel it”—or those who reject an irrefutable argument by saying:“It’s only logic,” which means: “It’s only reality.” The only realm opposed toreality is the realm and premise of death.[GS, FNI, 224; pb 179.]See also EVASION; EVIL; FREE WILL; GOOD, the; IRRATIONALITY; KNOWLEDGE;MORALITY; STANDARD of VALUE. Essence/Essential Characteristic. See Definitions. Esthetic Abstractions. There are many special or “cross-filed” chains ofabstractions (of interconnected concepts) in man’s mind. Cognitive abstractionsare the fundamental chain, on which all the others depend. Such chains aremental integrations, serving a special purpose and formed accordingly by aspecial criterion.Cognitive abstractions are formed by the criterion of: what is essential?(epistemologically essential to distinguish one class of existents from allothers). Normative abstractions are formed by the criterion of: what is good?Esthetic abstractions are formed by the criterion of: what is important?An artist does not fake reatity—he stylizes it. He selects those aspects ofexistence which he regards as metaphysically signihcant—and by isolating andstressing them, by omitting the insignificant and accidental, he presents hisview of existence. His concepts are not divorced from the facts of reality—theyare concepts which integrate the facts and his metaphysical evaluation of thefacts. His selection constitutes his evaluation: everything included in a workof art—from theme to subject to brushstroke or adjective—acquires metaphysicalsignificance by the mere fact of being included, of being important enough toinclude.An artist (as, for instance, the sculptors of Ancient Greece) who presents manas a god-like figure is aware of the fact that men may be crippled or diseasedor helpless; but he regards these conditions as accidental, as irrelevant to theessential nature of man—and he presents a figure embodying strength, beauty,intelligence, self-confidence, as man’s proper, natural state.An artist (as, for instance, the sculptors of the Middle Ages) who presents manas a deformed monstrosity is aware of the fact that there are men who arehealthy, happy or confident; but he regards these conditions as accidental orillusory, as irrelevant to man’s essential nature—and he presents a torturedfigure embodying pain, ugliness, terror, as man’s proper, natural state.[“Art and Sense of Life,” RM, 45; pb 36.]See also ABSTRACTIONS and CONCRETES; ART; CONCEPTS; ESTHETICS ; METAPHYSICALVALUE-JUDGMENTS; NORMATIVE ABSTRACTIONS; SENSE of LIFE. Esthetic Judgment. Now a word of warning about the criteria of estheticjudgment. A sense of life is the source of art, but it is not the solequalification of an artist or of an esthetician, and it is not a criterion ofesthetic judgment. Emotions are not tools of cognition. Esthetics is a branch ofphiiosophy—and just as a philosopher does not approach any other branch of hisscience with his feelings or emotions as his criterion of judgment, so he cannotdo it in the field of esthetics. A sense of life is not sufficient professionalequipment. An esthetician—as well as any man who attempts to evaluate artworks—must be guided by more than an emotion.The fact that one agrees or disagrees with an artist’s philosophy is irrelevantto an esthetic appraisal of his work qua art. One does not have to agree with anartist (nor even to enjoy him) in order to evaluate his work. In essence, anobjective evaluation requires that one identify the artist’s theme, the abstractmeaning of his work (exclusively by identifying the evidence contained in thework and allowing no other, outside considerations), then evaluate the means bywhich he conveys it—i.e., taking his theme as criterion, evaluate the purelyesthetic elements of the work, the technical mastery (or lack of it) with whichhe projects for fails to project) his view of life....Since art is a philosophical composite, it is not a contradiction to say: “Thisis a great work of art, but I don’t like it,” provided one defines the exactmeaning of that statement: the first part refers to a purely esthetic appraisal,the second to a deeper philosophical level which includes more than estheticvalues.[“Art and Sense of Life,” RM, 53; pb 42.]See also ART; ESTHETICS; MORAL JUDGMENT; SENSE of LIFE. Esthetics. The fifth and last branch of philosophy is esthetics, the study ofart, which is based on metaphysics, epistemology and ethics.[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 4; pb 4.] The esthetic principles which apply to all art, regardless of an individualartist’s philosophy, and which must guide an objective evaluation ... aredefined by the science of esthetics—a task at which modern philosophy has faileddismally.[“Art and Sense of Life,” RM, 54: pb 42.] The position of art in the scale of human knowledge is, perhaps, the mosteloquent symptom of the gulf between man’s progress in the physical sciences andhis stagnation (or, today, his retrogression) in the humanities....While, in other fields of knowledge, men have outgrown the practice of seekingthe guidance of mystic oracles whose qualification for the job wasunintelligibility, in the field of esthetics this practice has remained in fullforce and is becoming more crudely obvious today. Just as savages took thephenomena of nature for granted, as an irreducible primary not to be questionedor analyzed, as the exclusive domain of unknowable demons—so today’sepistemological savages take art for granted, as an irreducible primary not tobe questioned or analyzed, as the exclusive domain of a special kind ofunknowable demons: their emotions. The only difference is that the prehistoricalsavages’ error was innocent.[“The Psycho-Epistemology of Art,” RM, 17; pb 15.]See Conceptual Index: Esthetics Ethics. See Morality. “Ethnicity.” “Ethnicity” is an anti-concept, used as a disguise for the word“racism”—and it has no clearly definable meaning.... The term “ethnicity”stresses the traditional, rather than the physiological characteristics of agroup, such as language—but physiology, i.e., race, is involved.... So theadvocacy of “ethnicity,” means racism plus tradition —i.e., racism plusconformity—i.e., racism plus staleness.[“Global Balkanization,” pamphlet, 6.] Ethnicity is not a valid consideration, morally or politically, and does notendow anyone with any special rights.[Ibid., 14.]See also “ANTI-CONCEPTS”; COLLECTIVISM; CULTURE; RACISM; TRADITION; TRIBALISM. Evasion. Thinking is man’s only basic virtue, from which all the others proceed.And his basic vice, the source of all his evils, is that nameless act which allof you practice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, thewillful suspension of one’s consciousness, the refusal to think—not blindness,but the refusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act ofunfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility ofjudgment—on the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuseto identify it, that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict“It is.” Non-thinking is an act of annihilation, a wish to negate existence, anattempt to wipe out reality. But existence exists; reality is not to be wipedout, it will merely wipe out the wiper. By refusing to say “It is,” you arerefusing to say “I am.” By suspending your judgment, you are negating yourperson. When a man declares: “Who am I to know? he is declaring: ”Who am I tolive?”[GS, FNI, 155, pb 127.] Dropping below the level of a savage, who believes that the magic-words heutters have the power to alter reality, they believe that reality can be alteredby the power of the words they do not utter—and their magic tool is theblank-out, the pretense that nothing can come into existence past the voodoo oftheir refusal to identify it.[Ibid., 191; pb 154.] It is not any crime you have ever committed that infects your soul withpermanent guilt, it is none of your failures, errors or Haws, but the blank-outby which you attempt to evade them—it is not any sort of Original Sin or unknownprenatal deficiency, but the knowledge and fact of your basic default, ofsuspending your mind, of refusing to think. Fear and guilt are your chronicemotions, they are real and you do deserve them, but they don’t come from thesuperficial reasons you invent to disguise their cause, not from your“selfishness,” weakness or ignorance, but from a real and basic threat to yourexistence: fear, because you have abandoned your weapon of survival, guilt,because you know you have done it volitionally.[Ibid..22) ; pb 176.]See also CONTEXT-DROPPING; EVIL; FOCUS; FREE WILL; IRRATIONALITY; PRIMACY ofEXISTENCE vs. PRIMACY of CONSCIOUSNESS; RATIONALITY; RATIONALIZATION;SUBJECTIVISM. Evil. The standard of value of the Objectivist ethics—the standard by which onejudges what is good or evil—is man’s life, or: that which is required for man’ssurvival qua man.Since reason is man’s basic means of survival, that which is proper to the lifeof a rational being is the good; that which negates, opposes or destroys it isthe evil.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS. 16; pb 23.Thinking is man’s only basic virtue, from which all the others proceed. And hisbasic vice, the source of all his evils, is that nameless act which all of youpractice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, the willfulsuspension of one’s consciousness, the refusal to think—not blindness, but therefusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act ofunfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility ofjudgment—on the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuseto identify it, that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict“It is.”[GS, FNI, 155; pb 127.] Evil, not value, is an absence and a negation, evil is impotent and has no powerbut that which we let it extort from us.[Ibid., 167; pb 135.] I saw that evil was impotent—that evil was the irrational, the blind, theanti-real—and that the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of thegood to serve it.[Ibid.. 206; pb 165.] The spread of evil is the symptom of a vacuum. Whenever evil wins, it is only bydefault: by the moral failure of those who evade the fact that there can be nocompromise on basic principles.[“The Anatomy of Compromise,” CUI, 149.] In any compromise between food and poison, it is only death that can win. In anycompromise between good and evil, it is only evil that can profit.[GS, FNl. 217; pb 173.] The truly and deliberately evil men are a very small minority; it is theappeaser who unleashes them on mankind; it is the appeaser’s intellectualabdication that invites them to take over. When a culture’s dominant trend isgeared to irrationality, the thugs win over the appeasers. When intellectualleaders fail to foster the best in the mixed, unformed, vacillating character ofpeople at large, the thugs are sure to bring out the worst. When the ablest menturn into cowards, the average men turn into brutes.[“Altruism as Appeasement,” TO, Jan. 1966, 6.] When men reduce their virtues to the approximate, then evil acquires the forceof an absolute, when loyalty to an unyielding purpose is dropped by thevirtuous, it’s picked up by scoundrels—and you get the indecent spectacle of acringing, bargaining, traitorous good and a self-righteously uncompromisingevil.[GS, FNI, 217; pb 173.] As a being of volitional consciousness, [man] knows that he must know his ownvalue in order to maintain his own life. He knows that he has to be right; to bewrong in action means danger to his life; to be wrong in person, to be evil,means to be unfit for existence.... No man can survive the moment of pronouncinghimself irredeemably evil; should he do it, his next moment is insanity orsuicide.[lbid., 221; pb 176.]See also ABSOLUTES; AMORALISM; APPEASEMENT; COMPROMISE; CYNICISM; ENVY/HATRED ofthe GOOD for BEING the GOOD; ERRORS of KNOWLEDGE vs. BREACHES of MORALITY;EVASION; FREE WILL; GOOD, the; IRRATIONALITY; MORAL COWARDICE; MORAL JUDGMENT;MORALITY; ORIGINAL SIN; STANDARD of VALUE; VIRTUE. Existence. Existence exists—and the act of grasping that statement implies twocorollary axioms: that something exists which one perceives and that one existspossessing consciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving thatwhich exists.If nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with nothingto be conscious of is a contradiction in terms. A consciousness conscious ofnothing but itself is a contradiction in terms: before it could identify itselfas consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. If that which you claimto perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness.Whatever the degree of your knowledge, these two—existence and consciousness—areaxioms you cannot escape, these two are the irreducible primaries implied in anyaction you undertake, in any part of your knowledge and in its sum, from thefirst ray of light you perceive at the start of your life to the widesterudition you might acquire at its end. Whether you know the shape of a pebbleor the structure of a solar system, the axioms remain the same: that it existsand that you know it.To exist is to be something, as distinguished from the nothing of nonexistence,it is to be an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes.Centuries ago, the man who was—no matter what his errors —the greatest of yourphilosophers, has stated the formula defining the concept of existence and therule of all knowledge: A is A. A thing is itself. You have never grasped themeaning of his statement. I am here to complete it: Existence is Identity,Consciousness is Identification.[GS, FNI, 152; pb 124.]Reality is that which exists; the unreal does not exist; the unreal is merelythat negation of existence which is the content of a human consciousness when itattempts to abandon reason.[Ibid., 154; pb 126.] Existence is a self-sufficient primary. It is not a product of a supernaturaldimension, or of anything else. There is nothing antecedent to existence,nothing apart from it—and no alternative to it. Existence exists—and onlyexistence exists. Its existence and its nature are irreducible and unalterable.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 148.] The first and primary axiomatic concepts are “existence,” “identity” (which is acorollary of “existence”) and “consciousness.”[ITOE, 73.] An axomatic concept is the identification of a primary fact of reality, whichcannot be analyzed, i.e., reduced to other facts or broken into component parts.It is implicit in all facts and in all knowledge. It is the fundamentally givenand directly perceived or experienced, which requires no proof or explanation,but on which all proofs and explanations rest.[Ibid.] One can study what exists and how consciousness functions; but one cannotanalyze (or “prove”) existence as such, or consciousness as such. These areirreducible primaries. (An attempt to “prove” them is self-contradictory : it isan attempt to “prove” existence by means of nonexistence, and consciousness bymeans of unconsciousness.)[Ibid.] Existence and identity are not attributes of existents, they are theexistents.... The units of the concepts “existence” and “identity” are everyentity, attribute, action, event or phenomenon (including consciousness) thatexists, has ever existed or will ever exist.[Ibid., 74.] See also ABSOLUTES; ABSTRACTIONS and CONCRETES; ATHEISM; AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS;AXIOMS; EXISTENT; IDENTITY; INFINITY; METAPHYSICS; METAPHYSICAL; NATURE; PRIMACYof EXISTENCE vs. PRIMACY of CONSCIOUSNESS; SPACE; TIME; UNIVERSE; ZERO,REIFICATION of.Existent. The building-block of man’s knowledge is the concept of an“existent”—of something that exists, be it a thing, an attribute or an action.Since it is a concept, man cannot grasp it explicitly until he has reached theconceptual stage. But it is implicit in every percept (to perceive a thing is toperceive that it exists) and man grasps it implicitly on the perceptuallevel—i.e., he grasps the constituents of the concept “existent,” the data whichare later to be integrated by that concept. It is this implicit knowledge thatpermits his consciousness to develop further.(It may be supposed that the concept “existent” is implicit even on the level ofsensations—if and to the extent that a consciousness is able to discriminate onthat level. A sensation is a sensation of something, as distinguished from thenothing of the preceding and succeeding moments. A sensation does not tell manwhat exists, but only that it exists.)The (implicit) concept “existent” undergoes three stages of development in man’smind. The first stage is a child’s awareness of objects, of things—whichrepresents the (implicit) concept “entity.” The second and closely allied stageis the awareness of specific, particular things which he can recognize anddistinguish from the rest of his perceptual fiefd—which represents the(implicit) concept “identity.”The third stage consists of grasping relationships among these entities bygrasping the similarities and differences of their identities. This requires thetransformation of the (implicit) concept “entity” into the (implicit) concept“unit.”[ITOE, 6.]See also CONCEPT-FORMATION; ENTITY; EXISTENCE; IDENTITY; IMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE;SENSATIONS; UNIT."},{"pageContent":"FFaith “Faith” designates blind acceptance of a certain ideational content,acceptance induced by feeling in the absence of evidence or proof.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 48; pb 54.] Do not say that you’re afraid to trust your mind because you know so little.

Falsehood. “True” and “false” are assessments within the field of humancognition: they designate a relationship [of] correspondence or contradictionbetween an idea and reality.... The false is established as false by referenceto a body of evidence and within a context, and is pronounced false because itcontradicts the evidence.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture6.]All falsehoods are self-contradictions.When making a statement about an existent, one has, ultimately, only twoalternatives: “X (which means X, the existent, including all itscharacteristics) is what it is”—or: “X is not what it is.” The choice betweentruth and falsehood is the choice between “tautology” (in the sense explained)and self-contradiction.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 136.]See also ANALYTIC-SYNTHETIC DICHOTOMY; ARBITRARY; CONTRADICTIONS; IDENTITY;TRUTH. Fascism/Nazism. The difference between [socialism and fascism] is superficialand purely formal, but it is significant psychologically: it brings theauthoritarian nature of a planned economy crudely into the open.The main characteristic of socialism (and of communism) is public ownership ofthe means of production, and, therefore, the abolition of private property. Theright to property is the right of use and disposal. Under fascism, men retainthe semblance or pretense of private property, but the government holds totalpower over its use and disposal.The dictionary definition of fascism is: “a governmental system with strongcentralized power, permitting no opposition or criticism, controlling allaffairs of the nation (industrial, commercial, etc.), emphasizing an aggressivenationalism ...” [The American College Dictionary, New York: Random House,1957.]Under fascism, citizens retain the responsibilities of owning property, withoutfreedom to act and without any of the advantages of ownership. Under socialism,government officials acquire all the advantages of ownership, without any of theresponsibilities, since they do not hold title to the property, but merely theright to use it—at least until the next purge. In either case, the governmentofficials hold the economic, political and legal power of life or death over thecitizens.Needless to say, under either system, the inequalities of income and standard ofliving are greater than anything possible under a free economy—and a man’sposition is determined, not by his productive ability and achievement, but bypolitical pull and force.Under both systems, sacrifice is invoked as a magic, omnipotent solution in anycrisis--and “the public good” is the altar on which victims are immolated. Butthere are stylistic differences of emphasis. The socialist-communist axis keepspromising to achieve abundance, material comfort and security for its victims,in some indeterminate future. The fascist-Nazi axis scorns material comfort andsecurity, and keeps extolling some undefined sort of spiritual duty, service andconquest. The socialist-communist axis offers its victims an alleged socialideal. The fascist-Nazi axis offers nothing but loose talk about someunspecified form of racial or national “greatness.” The socialist-communist axisproclaims some grandiose economic plan, which keeps receding year by year. Thefascist-Nazi axis merely extols leadership—teadership without purpose, programor direction—and power for power’s sake.[“The Fascist New Frontier,” pamphlet, 5] If the term “statism” designates concentration of power in the state at theexpense of individual liberty, then Nazism in politics was a form of statism. Inprinciple, it did not represent a new approach to government; it was acontinuation of the political absolutism—the absolute monarchies, theoligarchies, the theocracies, the random tyrannies—which has characterized mostof human history.In degree, however, the total state does differ from its predecessors: itrepresents statism pressed to its limits, in theory and in practice, devouringthe last remnants of the individual. Although previous dictators (and manytoday, e.g., in Latin America) often preached the unlimited power of the state,they were on the whole unable to enforce such power. As a rule, citizens of suchcountries had a kind of partial “freedom,” not a freedom-on-principle, but atleast a freedom-by-default.Even the latter was effectively absent in Nazi Germany. The efficiency of thegovernment in dominating its subjects, the all-encompassing character of itscoercion, the complete mass regimentation on a scale involving millions ofmen—and, one might add, the enormity of the slaughter, the planned, systematicmass slaughter, in peacetinte, initiated by a government against its owncitizens—these are the insignia of twentieth-century totalitarianism (Nazi andcommunist), which are without parallel in recorded history. In the totalitarianregimes, as the Germans found out after only a few months of Hitler’s rule,every detail of life is prescribed, or proscribed. There is no longer anydistinction between private matters and public matters. “There are to be no moreprivate Germans,” said Friedrich Sieburg, a Nazi writer; “each is to attainsignificance only by his service to the state, and to find completeself-fulfillment in this service.” “The only person who is still a privateindividual in Germany,” boasted Robert Ley, a member of the Nazi hierarchy,after several years of Nazi rule, “is somebody who is asleep.”In place of the despised “private individuals,” the Germans heard daily orhourly about a different kind of entity, a supreme entity, whose will, it wassaid, is what determines the course and actions of the state: the nation, thewhole, the group. Over and over, the Germans heard the idea that underlies theadvocacy of omnipotent government, the idea that totalitarians of every kindstress as the justification of their total states: collectivism.Collectivism is the theory that the group (the collective) has primacy over theindividual. Collectivism holds that, in human affairs, the collective—society,the community, the nation, the proletariat, the race, etc. —is the unit ofreality and the standard of value. On this view, the individual has reality onlyas part of the group, and value only insofar as he serves it; on his own he hasno political rights; he is to be sacrificed for the group whenever it—or itsrepresentative, the state—deems this desirable.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 6; pb 16.] Contrary to the Marxists, the Nazis did not advocate public ownership of themeans of production. They did demand that the government oversee and run thenation’s economy. The issue of legal ownership, they explained, is secondary;what counts is the issue of control. Private citizens, therefore, may continueto hold titles to property—so long as the state reserves to itself theunqualified right to regulate the use of their property.If “ownership” means the right to determine the use and disposal of materialgoods, then Nazism endowed the state with every real prerogative of ownership.What the individual retained was merely a formal deed, a contentless deed, whichconferred no rights on its holder. Under communism, there is collectiveownership of property de jure. Under Nazism, there is the same collectiveownership de facto.[Ibid., 9; pb 18.] It took centuries and a brain-stopping chain of falsehoods to bring a wholepeople to the state of Hitler-worship. Modern German culture, including its Naziclimax, is the result of a complex development in the history of philosophy,involving dozens of figures stretching back to the beginnings of Westernthought. The same figures helped to shape every Western nation; but in othercountries, to varying extents, the results were mixed, because there was also anopposite influence or antidote at work. In Germany, by the turn of our century,the cultural atmosphere was unmixed : the traces of the antidote had long sincedisappeared, and the intellectual establishment was monolithic.If we view the West’s philosophic development in terms of essentials, threefateful turning points stand out, three major philosophers who, above allothers, are responsible for generating the disease of collectivism andtransmitting it to the dictators of our century.The three are: Plato—Kant—Hegel. (The antidote to them is: Aristotle.)[Ibid., 17; pb 26.] No weird cultural aberration produced Nazism. No intellectual lunatic fringemiraculously overwhelmed a civilized country. It is modern phitosophy—not someperipheral aspect of it, but the most central of its mainstreams—which turnedthe Germans into a nation of killers.The land of poets and philosophers was brought down by its poets andphilosophers.Twice in our century Germany fought to rule and impose its culture on the restof the world. It lost both wars. But on a deeper level it is achieving its goalnevertheless. It is on the verge of winning the philosophical war against theWest, with everything this implies.[Ibid., 98; pb 98.] I have stated repeatedly that the trend in this country is toward a fascistsystem with communist slogans. But what all of today’s pressure groups are busyevading is the fact that neither business nor labor nor anyone else, except theruling clique, gains anything under fascism or communism or any form ofstatism—that all become victims of an impartial, egalitarian destruction.[“The Moratorium on Brains,” ARL, I, 3, 3.] See also ALTRUISM; CAPITALISM; COLLECTIVISM; DICTATORSHIP; FASCISM andCOMMUNISM/SOCIALISM; HUMAN RIGHTS and PROPERTY RIGHTS; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS;INDIVIDUALISM; PROPERTY RIGHTS; RACISM; RIGHTISTS vs. LEFTISTS; STATISM;TYRANNY; WAR. Fascism and Communism/Socialism. For many decades, the leftists have beenpropagating the false dichotomy that the choice confronting the world is only:communism or fascism—a dictatorship of the left or of an alleged right—with thepossibility of a free society, of capitalism, dismissed and obliterated, as ifit had never existed.[“The Presidential Candidates 1968,” TO, June 1968, 5.] [Some “moderates” are trying to] revive that old saw of pre—\\Vor)d War IIvintage, the notion that the two political opposites confronting us, the two“extremes,” are: fascism versus communism.The political origin of that notion is more shameful than the “moderates” wouldcare publicly to admit. Mussolini came to power by claiming that that was theonly choice confronting Italy. Hitler came to power by claiming that that wasthe only choice confronting Germany. It is a matter of record that in the Germanelection of 1933, the Communist Party was ordered by its leaders to vote for theNazis—with the explanation that they could later fight the Nazis for power, butfirst they had to help destroy their common enemy: capitalism and itsparliamentary form of government.It is obvious what the fraudulent issue of fascism versus communismaccomplishes: it sets up, as opposites, two variants of the same politicalsystem; it eliminates the possibility of considering capitalism; it switches thechoice of “Freedom or dictatorship?” into “Which kind of dictatorship?” —thusestablishing dictatorship as an inevitable fact and offering only a choice ofrulers. The choice—according to the proponents of that fraud—is: a dictatorshipof the rich (fascism) or a dictatorship of the poor (communism).That fraud collapsed in the 1940’s, in the aftermath of World War II. It is tooobvious, too easily demonstrable that fascism and communism are not twoopposites, but two rival gangs fighting over the same territory—that both arevariants of statism, based on the collectivist principle that man is therightless slave of the state—that both are socialistic, in theory, in practice,and in the explicit statements of their leaders—that under both systems, thepoor are enslaved and the rich are expropriated in favor of a ruling clique—thatfascism is not the product of the political “right,” but of the “left”—that thebasic issue is not “rich versus poor,” but man versus the state, or: individualrights versus totalitarian government—which means: capitalism versus socialism.[“ ‘Extremism,’ or The Art of Smearing,” CUI, 180.] The main characteristic of socialism (and of communism) is public ownership ofthe means of production, and, therefore, the abolition of private property. Theright to property is the right of use and disposal. Under fascism, men retainthe semblance or pretense of private property, but the government holds totalpower over its use and disposal....Under fascism, citizens retain the responsibilities of owning property, withoutfreedom to act and without any of the advantages of ownership.

Can’t you see past the guff and recognize the essence? Onecountry is dedicated to the proposition that man has no rights, that thecollective is all. The individual held as evil, the mass—as God. No motive andno virtue permitted—except that of service to the proletariat. That’s oneversion [communism]. Here’s another. A country dedicated to the proposition thatman has no rights, that the State is all. The individual held as evil, therace—as God. No motive and no virtue permitted—except that of service to therace [fascism]. Am I raving or is this the cold reality of two continentsalready? Watch the pincer movement.

My technique.... Offer poison as food and poison as antidote.[“The Soul of a Collectivist,” FNI, 88; pb 76.] [Adolf Hitler on Nazism and socialism:] “Each activity and each need of theindividual will thereby be regulated by the party as the representative of thegeneral good. There will be no license, no free space, in which the individualbelongs to himself. This is Sociatism—not such trifles as the private possessionof the means of production. Of what importance is that if I range men firmlywithin a discipline they cannot escape? Let them then own land or factories asmuch as they please. The decisive factor is that the State, through the party,is supreme over them, regardless whether they are owners or workers. All that,you see, is unessential. Our Socialism goes far deeper....“[T]he people about us are unaware of what is really happening to them. Theygaze fascinated at one or two familiar superficialities, such as possessions andincome and rank and other outworn conceptions. As long as these are kept intact,they are quite satisfied. But in the meantime they have entered a new relation;a powerful social force has caught them up. They themselves are changed. Whatare ownership and income to that? Why need we trouble to socialize banks andfactories ? We socialize human beings.”[Adolf Hitler to Hermann Rauschning, quoted in Leonard Peikoff, OP, 248; pb231.] Through the agency of three new guilds (the Food Estate, the Estate of Trade andIndustry, and the Labor Front), the government assumed control of every group ofproducers and consumers in the country. In accordance with the method of “Germansocialism,” the facade of a market economy was retained. All prices, wages, andinterest rates, however, were “fixed by the central authority. They [were]prices, wages, and interest rates in appearance only; in reality they [were]merely determinations of quantity relations in the government’s orders.... Thisis socialism in the outward guise of capitalism.”The nation’s businessmen retained the responsibility to produce and suffered thelosses attendant on failure. The state determined the purpose and conditions oftheir production, and reaped the benefits; directly or indirectly, itexpropriated all profits. “The time is past,” explained the Nazi Minister ofEconomics, “when the notion of economic self-seeking and unrestricted use ofprofits made can be allowed to dominate.... The economic system must serve thenation.”“What a dummkopf I was!” cried steel baron Fritz Thyssen, an early Nazisupporter, who fled the country....As to Hitler’s pledges to the poorer groups: the Republic’s social insurancebudgets were greatly increased, and a variety of welfare funds, programs,agencies, and policies were introduced or expanded, including special provisionsfor such items as unemployment relief, workmen’s compensation, health insurance,pensions, Winter Help campaigns for the destitute, the Reich Mothers’ Servicefor indigent mothers and children, and the National Socialist People’s Welfareorganization.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 246; pb 230.] During the Hitler years—in order to finance the party’s programs, including thewar expenditures—every social group in Germany was mercilessly exploited anddrained. White-collar salaries and the earnings of small businessmen weredeliberately held down by government controls, freezes, taxes. Big business wasbled by taxes and “special contributions” of every kind, and strangled by thebureaucracy.... At the same time the income of the farmers was held down, andthere was a desperate flight to the cities—where the middle class, especiallythe small tradesmen, were soon in desperate straits, and where the workers wereforced to labor at low wages for increasingly longer hours (up to 60 or more perweek).But the Nazis defended their policies, and the country did not rebel; itaccepted the Nazi argument. Selfish individuals may be unhappy, the Nazis said,but what we have established in Germany is the ideal system, socialism. In itsNazi usage this term is not restricted to a theory of economics; it is to beunderstood in a fundamental sense. “Socialism” for the Nazis denotes theprinciple of collectivism as such and its corollary, statism—in every field ofhuman action, including but not limited to economics.“To be a socialist,” says Goebbels, “is to submit the I to the thou; socialismis sacrificing the individual to the whole.”By this definition, the Nazis practiced what they preached. They practiced it athome and then abroad. No one can claim that they did not sacrifice enoughindividuals.[Ibid., 9; pb 19.]See also ALTRUISM; CAPITALISM; COLLECTIVISM; COMMUNISM; DICTATORSHIP;FASCISM/NAZISM; MYSTICS OF SPIRIT and of MUSCLE; POLYLOGISM; RIGHTISTS vs.LEFTISTS; SOCIALISM; SOVIET RUSSIA; STATISM. Femininity. For a woman qua woman, the essence of femininity is hero-worship—thedesire to look up to man. “To look up” does not mean dependence, obedience oranything implying inferiority. It means an intense kind of admiration; andadmiration is an emotion that can be experienced only by a person of strongcharacter and independent value-judgments. A “clinging vine” type of woman isnot an admirer, but an exploiter of men. Hero-worship is a demanding virtue: awoman has to be worthy of it and of the hero she worships. Intellectually andmorally, i.e., as a human being, she has to be his equal; then the object of herworship is specifically his masculinity, not any human virtue she might lack.This does not mean that a feminine woman feels or projects hero-worship for anyand every individual man; as human beings, many of them may, in fact, he herinferiors. Her worship is an abstract emotion for the metaphysical concept ofmasculinity as such—which she experiences fully and concretely only for the manshe loves, but which colors her attitude toward all men. This does not mean thatthere is a romantic or sexual intention in her attitude toward all men; quitethe contrary: the higher her view of masculinity, the more severely demandingher standards. It means that she never loses the awareness of her own sexualidentity and theirs. It means that a properly feminine woman does not treat menas if she were their pal, sister, mother-or leader.[“An Answer to Readers (About a Woman President),” TO, Dec. 1968, 1.] See also CAREER; INDEPENDENCE; LOVE; SEX; VIRTUE. Final Causation. In order to make the choices required to achieve his goals, aman needs the constant, automatized awareness of the principle which theanti-concept “duty” has all but obliterated in his mind: the principle ofcausality—specincaity, of Aristotelian final causation (which, in fact, appliesonly to a conscious being), i.e., the process by which an end determines themeans, i.e., the process of choosing a goal and taking the actions necessary toachieve it.In a rational ethics, it is causality—not “duty”—that serves as the guidingprinciple in considering, evaluating and choosing one’s actions, particularlythose necessary to achieve a long-range goal. Following this principle, a mandoes not act without knowing the purpose of his action. In choosing a goal, heconsiders the means required to achieve it, he weighs the value of the goalagainst the difficulties of the means and against the full, hierarchical contextof all his other values and goals. He does not demand the impossible of himself,and he does not decide too easily which things are impossible. He never dropsthe context of the knowledge available to him, and never evades reality,realizing fully that his goal will not be granted to him by any power other thanhis own action, and, should he evade, it is not some Kantian authority that hewould be cheating, but himself.[“Causality Versus Duty,” PWNI, 119; pb 99.] Only a process of final causation—i.e., the process of choosing a goal, thentaking the steps to achieve it—can give logical continuity, coherence andmeaning to a man’s actions.[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 60; pb 82.]See also “ANTI-CONCEPTS”; CONTEXT-DROPPlNG; “DUTY”; GOAL-DIRECTED ACTION; KANT,IMMANUEL; PURPOSE; STANDARD of VALUE; TELEOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT. Focus. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free to think or to evade thateffort. Thinking requires a state of full, focused awareness. The act offocusing one’s consciousness is volitional. Man can focus his mind to a full,active, purposefully directed awareness of reality—or he can unfocus it and lethimself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to any chance stimulus ofthe immediate moment, at the mercy of his undirected sensory-perceptualmechanism and of any random, associational connections it might happen to make.When man unfocuses his mind, he may be said to be conscious in a subhuman senseof the word, since he experiences sensations and perceptions. But in the senseof the word applicable to man—in the sense of a consciousness which is aware ofreality and able to deal with it, a consciousness able to direct the actions andprovide for the survival of a human being—an unfocused mind is not conscious.Psychologically, the choice “to think or not” is the choice “to focus or not.”Existentially, the choice “to focus or not” is the choice “to be conscious ornot.” Metaphysically, the choice “to be conscious or not” is the choice of lifeor death.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 13; pb 20.] “Focus” designates a quality of one’s mental state, a quality of activealertness. “Focus” means the state of a goal-directed mind committed toattaining full awareness of reality. It’s the state of a mind committed toseeing, to grasping, to understanding, to knowing.“Full awareness” does not mean omniscience. It means: commitment to grasp allthe facts relevant to one’s concern and activity at any given time ... asagainst a splintered grasp, a grasp of some facts while others which you know tobe relevant are left in fog. By “full” I include also the commitment to graspthe relevant facts clearly, with the fullest clarity and precision one iscapable of.“Focus” is not synonymous with “thinking,” in the sense of step-by-stepproblem-solving or the drawing of new conclusions. You may be walking down thestreet, merely contemplating the sights, but you can do it in focus or out offocus. “In focus” would mean you have some purpose directing your mentalactivity—in this case, a simple one: to observe the sights. But this is still apurpose, and it implies that you know what you are doing mentally, that you haveset yourself a goal and are carrying it out, that you have assumed theresponsibility of taking control of your consciousness and directing it....The process of focus is not the same as the process of thought; it is theprecondition of thought.... Just as you must first focus your eyes, and then, ifyou choose, you can turn your gaze systematically to the objects on the table infront of you and inventory them, so first you must focus your mind, and then,when you choose, you can direct that focus to the step-by-step resolution of aspecific problem—which latter is thinking.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture3.][In answer to the question “What is the difference between concentration andfocus?”]Briefly: concentration means undivided attention on some particular task orobject.... It is an attention, an activity, devoted to a particular subject.Now, focus is more fundamental than that. You need to be in focus in order toconcentrate, but focus is the particular “set” of your consciousness which isnot delimited by the particular task, object, or action that you areconcentrating on. You do have to focus on something, but focus is not [limitedto] the continuing task that you are performing. The concept “focus” isn’t tiedto the concrete ... it remains the same no matter what you are focused on. It isthe “set” of your mind.[Ayn Rand, question period following Lecture 6 of Leonard Peikoff’s series “ThePhilosophy of Objectivism” (1976).]See also CONSCIOUSNESS; EVASION; FREE WILL; MORALITY; RATIONALITY;THOUGHT/THINKING. Foreign Policy. We do need a policy based on long-range principles, i.e., anideology. But a revision of our foreign policy, from its basic premises on up,is what today’s anti-ideologists dare not contemplate. The worse its results,the louder our public leaders proclaim that our foreign policy is bipartisan.A proper solution would be to elect statesmen—if such appeared—with a radicallydifferent foreign policy, a policy explicitly and proudly dedicated to thedefense of America’s rights and national self-interests, repudiating foreign aidand all forms of international self-immolation.[“The Wreckage of the Consensus,” CUI, 226.] The essence of capitalism’s foreign policy is free trade—i.e., the abolition oftrade barriers, of protective tariffs, of special privileges—the opening of theworld’s trade routes to free international exchange and competition among theprivate citizens of all countries dealing directly with one another. During thenineteenth century, it was free trade that liberated the world, undercutting andwrecking the remnants of feudalism and the statist tyranny of absolutemonarchies.[“The Roots of War,” CUI, 39.] PLAYBOY: What about force in foreign policy? You have said that any free nationhad the right to invade Nazi Germany during World WarII... RAND: Certainly.PLAYBOY: ... And that any free nation today has the moral right—though not theduty—to invade Soviet Russia, Cuba, or any other “slave pen.” Correct?RAND: Correct. A dictatorship—a country that violates the rights of its owncitizens—is an outlaw and can claim no rights.PLAYBOY: Would you actively advocate that the United States invade Cuba or theSoviet Union?RAND: Not at present. I don’t think it’s necessary. I would advocate that whichthe Soviet Union fears above all else: economic boycott, I would advocate ablockade of Cuba and an economic boycott of Soviet Russia; and you would seeboth of those regimes collapse without the loss of a single American life.PLAYBOY: Would you favor U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations?RAND: Yes. I do not sanction the grotesque pretense of an organization allegedlydevoted to world peace and human rights, which includes Soviet Russia, the worstaggressor and bloodiest butcher in history, as one of its members. The notion ofprotecting rights, with Soviet Russia among the protectors, is an insult to theconcept of rights and to the intelligence of any man who is asked to endorse orsanction such an organization. I do not believe that an individual shouldcooperate with criminals, and, for all the same reasons, I do not believe thatfree countries should cooperate with dictatorships.PLAYBOY: Would you advocate severing diplomatic relations with Russia ?RAND: Yes.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 11.] Russia, like Nazi Germany, like any bully, feeds on appeasement and will retreatplacatingly at the first sound of firm opposition.[“U.S. Position on Cuba Endangered by U.N.,” Los Angeles Times, Nov. 11, 1962.] When certain statist groups, counting, apparently, on a total collapse ofAmerican self-esteem, dare go so far as to urge America’s surrender into slaverywithout a fight, under the slogan “Better Red Than Dead”— the “conservatives”rush to proclaim that they prefer to be dead, thus helping to spread the ideathat our only alternative is communism or destruction, forgetting that the onlyproper answer to an ultimatum of that kind is: “Better See The Reds Dead.”[“Choose Your Issues,” TON,jan. 1962, 1.]See also “COLLECTIVE RIGHTS”; COMMUNISM; DICTATORSHIP; DRAFT; FREEDOM;GOVERNMENT; IDEOLOGY; “ISOLATIONISM”; NATIONAL RIGHTS; PACIFISM; PEACEMOVEMENTS; SELF-DEFENSE; SELF-DETERMINATION of NATIONS; SOVIET RUSSlA; UNITEDNATIONS; WAR.Founding Fathers. The basic premise of the Founding Fathers was man’s right tohis own life, to his own liberty, to the pursuit of his own happiness—whichmeans: man’s right to exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself toothers nor sacrificing others to himself; and that the political implementationof this right is a society where men deal with one another as traders, byvoluntary exchange to mutual benefit.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 62; pb 53.] The Founding Fathers were neither passive, death-worshipping mystics normindless, power-seeking looters; as a political group, they were a phenomenonunprecedented in history: they were thinkers who were also men of action. Theyhad rejected the soul-body dichotomy, with its two corollaries: the impotence ofman’s mind and the damnation of this earth; they had rejected the doctrine ofsuffering as man’s metaphysical fate, they proclaimed man’s right to the pursuitof happiness and were determined to establish on earth the conditions requiredfor man’s proper existence, by the “unaided” power of their intellect.[Ibid., 23; pb 25.] In the modern world, under the influence of the pervasive new climate, asuccession of thinkers developed a new conception of the nature of government.The most important of these men and the one with the greatest influence onAmerica was John Locke. The political philosophy Locke bequeathed to theFounding Fathers is what gave rise to the new nation’s distinctive institutions.That political philosophy is the social implementation of the Aristotelianspirit.Throughout history the state had been regarded, implicitly or explicitly, as theruler of the individual—as a sovereign authority (with or without supernaturalmandate), an authority logically antecedent to the citizen and to which he mustsubmit. The Founding Fathers challenged this primordial notion. They startedwith the premise of the primacy and sovereignty of the individual. Theindividual, they held, logically precedes the group or the institution ofgovernment. Whether or not any social organization exists, each man possessescertain indinidual rights. And “among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit ofHappiness”—or, in the words of a New Hampshire state document, “among which arethe enjoying and defending life and liberty; acquiring, possessing, andprotecting property; and in a word, of seeking and obtaining happiness.”[Leonard Peikoff, OP, III; pb 109.] The genius of the Founding Fathers was their ability not only to grasp therevolutionary ideas of the period, but to devise a means of implementing thoseideas in practice, a means of translating them from the realm of philosophicabstraction into that of sociopolitical reality. By defining in detail thedivision of powers within the government and the ruling procedures, includingthe brilliant mechanism of checks and balances, they established a system whoseoperation and integrity were independent, so far as possible, of the moralcharacter of any of its temporary officials—a system impervious, so far aspossible, to subversion by an aspiring dictator or by the public mood of themoment.The heroism of the Founding Fathers was that they recognized an unprecedentedopportunity, the chance to create a country of individual liberty for the firsttime in history—and that they staked everything on their judgment: the newnation and their own “lives, fortunes, and sacred honor.” [Ibid., 114; pb 112.] “I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form oftyranny over the mind of man.”Jefferson—and the other Founding Fathers—meant it. They did not confine theirefforts to the battle against theocracy and monarchy; they fought, on the samegrounds, invoking the same principle of individual rights—against democracy,i.e., the system of unlimited majority rule. They recognized that the cause offreedom is not advanced by the multiplication of despots, and they did notpropose to substitute the tyranny of a mob for that of a handful ofautocrats....When the framers of the American republic spoke of “the people,” they did notmean a collectivist organism one part of which was authorized to consume therest. They meant a sum of individuals, each of whom—whether strong or weak, richor poor—retains his inviolate guarantee of individual rights.[Ibid., 113; pb III.) The political philosophy of America’s Founding Fathers is so thoroughly buriedunder decades of statist misrepresentations on one side and empty lip-service onthe other, that it has to be re-discovered, not ritualistically repeated. It hasto be rescued from the shameful barnacles of platitudes now hiding it. It has tobe expanded—because it was only a magnificent beginning, not a completed job, itwas only a pulitical philosophy without a full philosophical and moralfoundation, which the “conservatives” cannot provide.[“It Is Earlier Than You Think,” TON, Dec. 1964, 52.]See also AMERICA; ARISTOTLE; CONSTITUTION; ENLIGHTENMENT, AGE of; FREEDOM;INDIVIDUALISM; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; LIFE, RIGHT to; PURSUIT of HAPPINESS, RIGHTto; RELIGION; REPUBLIC; SOUL-BODY DICHOTOMY. Fraud. A unilateral breach of contract involves an indirect use of physicalforce: it consists, in essence, of one man receiving the material values, goodsor services of another, then refusing to pay for them and thus keeping them byforce (by mere physical possession), not by right —i.e., keeping them withoutthe consent of their owner. Fraud involves a similarly indirect use of force: itconsists of obtaining material values without then owner’s consent, under falsepretenses or false promises.[“The Nature of Government.” VOS, 150; ph III.]See also CONTRACTS: PHYSICAL FORCE. Free Market. In a free economy, where no man or group of men can use physicalcoercion against anyone, economic power can be achieved only by voluntarymeans:by the voluntary choice and agreement of all those who participate in theprocess of production and trade. In a free market, all prices, wages, andprofits are determined—not by the arbitrary whim of the rich or of the poor, notby anyone’s “greed” or by anyone’s need—but by the law of supply and demand. Themechanism of a free market reflects and sums up all the economic choices anddecisions made by all the participants. Men trade their goods or services bymutual consent to mutual advantage, according to their own independent,uncoerced judgment. A man can grow rich only if he is able to offer bettervalues—better products or services, at a lower price - than others are able tooffer.Wealth, in a free market, is achieved by a free, general, “democratic” vote—bythe sales and the purchases of every individual who takes part in the economiclife of the country. Whenever you buy one product rather than another, you arevoting for the success of some manufacturer. And, in this type of voting, everyman votes only on those matters which he is qualified to judge: on his ownpreferences, interests, and needs. No one has the power to decide for others orto substitute his judgment for theirs; no one has the power to appoint himself“the voice of the public” and to leave the public voiceless and disfranchised.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 47.] Intellectual freedom cannot exist without political freedom; political freedomcannot exist without economic freedom; a free mind and a free market arecorollaries.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 23; pb 25.]The free market represents the social application of an objective theory ofvalues. Since values are to be discovered by man’s mind, men must be free todiscover them—to think, to study, to translate their knowledge into physicalform, to offer their products for trade, to judge them, and to choose, be itmaterial goods or ideas, a loaf of bread or a philosophical treatise. Sincevalues are established contextually, every man must judge for himself, in thecontext of his own knowledge, goals, and interests. Since values are determinedby the nature of reality, it is reality that serves as men’s ultimate arbiter:if a man’s judgment is right, the rewards are his; if it is wrong, he is hisonly victim.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 24.] Now observe that a free market does not level men down to some commondenominator—that the intellectual criteria of the majority do not rule a freemarket or a free society—and that the exceptional men, the innovators, theintellectual giants, are not held down by the majority. In fact, it is themembers of this exceptional minority who lift the whole of a free society to thelevel of their own achievements, while rising further and ever further.A free market is a rontinuous process that cannot be held still, an upwardprocess that demands the best (the most rational) of every man and rewards himaccordingly. While the majority have barely assimilated the value of theautomobile, the creative minority introduces the airplane. The majority learn bydemonstration, the minority is free to demonstrate. The “philosophicallyobjective” value of a new product serves as the teacher for those who arewilling to exercise their rational faculty, each to the extent of his ability.those who are unwilling remain unrewarded—as well as those who aspire to morethan their ability produces. The stagnant, the irrational, the subjectivist haveno power to stop their betters....The mental parasites—the imitators who attempt to cater to what they think isthe public’s known taste—are constantly being beaten by the innovators whoseproducts raise the public’s knowledge and taste to ever higher levels. It is inthis sense that the free market is ruled, not by the consumers, but by theproducers. The most successful ones are those who discover new fields ofproduction, fields which had not been known to exist.A given product may not be appreciated at once, particularly if it is tooradical an innovation; but, barring irrelevant accidents, it wins in the longrun. It is in this sense that the free market is not ruled by the intellectualcriteria of the majority, which prevail only at and for any given moment; thefree market is ruled by those who are able to see and plan tong-range—and thebetter the mind, the longer the range.[Ibid., 25.]All the evils, abuses, and iniquities, popularly ascribed to businessmen and tocapitalism, were not caused by an unregulated economy or by a free market, butby government intervention into the economy.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 48.]See also CAPITALISM; INTERVENTIONISM (ECONOMIC); MARKET VALUE. Free Speech. Freedom of speech means freedom from interference, suppression orpunitive action by the government—and nothing else. It does not mean the rightto demand the financial support or the material means to express your views atthe expense of other men who may not wish to support you. Freedom of speechincludes the freedom not to agree, not to listen and not to support one’s ownantagonists. A “right” does not include the material implementation of thatright by other men; it includes only the freedom to earn that implementation byone’s own effort. Private citizens cannot use physical force or coercion; theycannot censor or suppress anyone’s views or publications. Only the governmentcan do so. And censorship is a concept that pertains only to governmentalaction.[“The Fascist New Frontier,” pamphlet, 10.] While people are clamoring about “economic rights,” the concept of politicalrights is vanishing. It is forgotten that the right of free speech means thefreedom to advocate one’s views and to bear the possible consequences, includingdisagreement with others, opposition, unpopularity and lack of support. Thepolitical function of “the right of free speech” is to protect dissenters andunpopular minorities from forcible suppression—not to guarantee them thesupport, advantages and rewards of a popularity they have not gained.The Bill of Rights reads: “Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedomof speech, or of the press ...” It does not demand that private citizens providea microphone for the man who advocates their destruction, or a passkey for theburglar who seeks to rob them, or a knife for the murderer who wants to cuttheir throats. [“Man’s Rights,” VOS, 133; pb 99.] The communists and the Nazis are merely two variants of the same evil notion:collectivism. But both should be free to speak—evil ideas are dangerous only bydefault of men advocating better ideas.[The Objectivist Calendar, June 1978.] The difference between an exchange of ideas and an exchange of blows isself-evident. The line of demarcation between freedom of speech and freedom ofaction is established by the ban on the initiation of physical force.[“The Cashing-In: The Student ‘Rebellion,’ ”CUI, 258.] [In regard to the lawsuit to prevent a Nazi group from marching in Skokie,Illinois:]What I challenge (and not only because of that particular case) is theinterpretation of demonstrations and of other actions as so-called “symbolicspeech.” When you lose the distinction between action and speech, you lose,eventually, the freedom of both. The Skokie case is a good illustration of thatprinciple. There is no such thing as “symbolic speech.” You do not have theright to parade through the public streets or to obstruct public thoroughfares.You have the right of assembly, yes, on your own property, and on the propertyof your adherents or your friends. But nobody has the “right” to clog thestreets. The streets are only for passage. The hippies, in the 60s, should havebeen forbidden to lie down on city pavements. (They used to lie down across astreet and cause dreadful traffic snarls, in order to display their views, toattract attention, to register a protest.) If they were permitted to do it, theNazis should be permitted as well. Properly, both should have been forbidden.They may speak, yes. They may not take action at whim on public property.[The Objectivist Calendar, June 1978.] I want to state, for the record, my own view of what is called “hardcore”pornography. I regard it as unspeakably disgusting. I have not read any of thebooks or seen any of the current movies belonging to that category, and I do notintend ever to read or see them. The descriptions provided in legal cases, aswell as the “modern” touches in “soft-core” productions, are sufficient groundson which to form an opinion. The reason of my opinion is the opposite of theusual one: I do not regard sex as evil—I regard it as good, as one of the mostimportant aspects of human life, too important to be made the subject of publicanatomical display. But the issue here is not one’s view of sex. The issue isfreedom of speech and of the press—i.e., the right to hold any view and toexpress it.It is not very inspiring to fight for the freedom of the purveyors ofpornography or their customers. But in the transition to statism, everyinfringement of human rights has begun with the suppression of a given right’sleast attractive practitioners. In this case, the disgusting nature of theoffenders makes it a good test of one’s loyalty to a principle.[“Censorship: Local and Express,” PWNI, 211; pb 173.]Only one aspect of sex is a legitimate field for legislation: the protection ofminors and of unconsenting adults. Apart from criminal actions (such as rape),this aspect includes the need to ‘protect people from being confronted withsights they regard as loathsome. (A corollary of the freedom to see and hear, isthe freedom not to look or listen.) Legal restraints on certain types of publicdisplays, such as posters or window displays, are proper—but this is an issue ofprocedure, of etiquette, not of morality....The rights of those who seek pornography would not be infringed by rulesprotecting the rights of those who find pornography offensive—e.g., sexuallyexplicit posters may properly be forbidden in public places; warning signs, suchas “For Adults Only.” may properly be required of private places which are opento the public. This protects the unconsenting, and has nothing to do withcensorship, i.e., with prohibiting thought or speech.[“Thought Control,” ARL, III, 2. 2.JSee also CENSORSHIP; HUMAN RIGHTS and PROPERTYRIGHTS; INDIVIDUAL, RIGHTS,-PROPERTY RIGHTS. Free Will. That which you call your soul or spirit is your consciousness, andthat which you call “free will” is your mind’s freedom to think or not, the onlywill you have, your only freedom, the choice that controls all the choices youmake and determines your life and your character. [GS, FNI, 155; pb 127.] To think is an act of choice. The key to what you so recklessly call “humannature,” the open secret you live with, yet dread to name. is the fact that manis a being of volitional consciousness. Reason does not work automatically;thinking is not a mechanical process; the connections of logic are not made byinstinct. The function of your stomach, lungs or heart is automatic; thefunction of your mind is not. In any hour and issue of your life, you are freeto think or to evade that effort. But you are not free to escape from yournature, from the fact that reason is your means of survival—so that for you, whoare a human being, the question “to be or not to be” is the question “to thinkor not to think.” “A being of volitional consciousness has no automatic courseof behavior. He needs a code of values to guide his actions.(Ibid.. 146; pb 120.] Man’s consciousness shares with animals the first two stages of its development:sensations and perceptions; but it is the third state, conceptions, that makeshim man. Sensations are integrated into perceptions automatically, by the brainof a man or of an animal. But to integrate perceptions into conceptions by aprocess of abstraction, is a feat that man alone has the power to perform—and hehas to perform it by choice. The process of abstraction, and ofconcept-formation is a process of reason, of thought; it is not automatic norinstinctive nor involuntary nor infallible. Man has to initiate it, to sustainit and to bear responsibility for its results. The pre-conceptual level ofconsciousness is nonvolitional ; volition begins with the first syllogism. Manhas the choice to think or to evade—to maintain a state of full awareness or todrift from moment to moment, in a semi-conscious daze, at the mercy of whateverassociational whims the unfocused mechanism of his consciousness produces.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 9; pb 14.] Reason is the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided byman’s senses. It is a faculty that man has to exercise by choice. Thinking isnot an automatic function. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free tothink or to evade that effort. Thinking requires a state of full, focusedawareness. The act of focusing one’s consciousness is volitional. Man can focushis mind to a full, active, purposefully directed awareness of reality—or he canunfocus it and let himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to anychance stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his undirectedsensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random, associational connections itmight happen to make.When man unfocuses his mind, he may be said to be conscious in a subhuman senseof the word, since he experiences sensations and perceptions. But in the senseof the word applicable to man—in the sense of a consciousness which is aware ofreality and able to deal with it, a consciousness able to direct the actions andprovide for the survival of a human being—an unfocused mind is not conscious.Psychologically, the choice “to think or not” is the choice “to focus or not.”Existentially, the choice “to focus or not” is the choice “to be conscious ornot.” Metaphysically, the choice “to be conscious or not” is the choice of lifeor death....A process of thought is not automatic nor “instinctive” nor involuntary—norinfallible. Man has to initiate it, to sustain it and to bear responsibility forits results. He has to discover how to tell what is true or false and how tocorrect his own errors; he has to discover how to validate his concepts, hisconclusions, his knowledge; he has to discover the rules of thought, the laws oflogic, to direct his thinking. Nature gives him no automatic guarantee of theefficacy of his mental effort.Nothing is given to man on earth except a potential and the material on which toactualize it. The potential is a superlative machine: his consciousness; but itis a machine without a spark plug, a machine of which his own will has to be thespark plug, the self-starter and the driver; he has to discover how to use itand he has to keep it in constant action. The material is the whole of theuniverse, with no limits set to the knowledge he can acquire and to theenjoyment of life he can achieve. But everything he needs or desires has to belearned, discovered and produced by him—by his own choice, by his own effort, byhis own mind....That which [man’s] survival requires is set by his nature and is not open to hischoice. What is open to his choice is only whether he will discover it or not,whether he will choose the right goals and values or not. He is free to make thewrong choice, but not free to succeed with it. He is free to evade reality, heis free to unfocus his mind and stumble blindly down any road he pleases, butnot free to avoid the abyss he refuses to see. Knowledge, for any consciousorganism, is the means of survival; to a living consciousness, every “is”implies an “ought.” Man is free to choose not to be conscious, but not free toescape the penalty of unconsciousness: destruction. Man is the only livingspecies that has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way hehas acted through most of his history.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 13; pb 21.] The faculty of volition operates in regard to the two fundamental aspects ofman’s life: consciousness and existence, i.e., his psychological action and hisexistential action, i.e., the formation of his own character and the course ofaction he pursues in the physical world.[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 82; pb 100.] A social environment can neither force a man to think nor prevent him fromthinking. But a social environment can offer incentives or impediments; it canmake the exercise of one’s rational faculty easier or harder; it can encouragethinking and penalize evasion or vice versa. [“Our Cultural Value-Deprivation,” TO, April 1966, 2.] A man’s volition is outside the power of other men. What the unalterable basicconstituents are to nature, the attribute of a volitional consciousness is tothe entity “man.” Nothing can force a man to think. Others may offer himincentives or impediments, rewards or punishments, they may destroy his brain bydrugs or by the blow of a club, but they cannot order his mind to function: thisis in his exclusive, sovereign power. Man is neither to be obeyed nor to becommanded.[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 38; pb 31.] Because man has free will, no human choice—and no phenomenon which is a productof human choice—is metaphysically necessary. In regard to any man-made fact, itis valid to claim that man has chosen thus, but it was not inherent in thenature of existence for him to have done so: he could have chosen otherwise.Choice, however, is not chance. Volition is not an exception to the Law ofCausality; it is a type of causation.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 149.] Man exists and his mind exists. Both are part of nature, both possess a specificidentity. The attribute of volition does not contradict the fact of identity,just as the existence of living organisms does not contradict the existence ofinanimate matter. Living organisms possess the power of self-initiated motion,which inanimate matter does not possess; man’s consciousness possesses the powerof self-initiated motion in the realm of cognition (thinking), which theconsciousnesses of other living species do not possess. But just as animals areable to move only in accordance with the nature of their bodies, so man is ableto initiate and direct his mental action only in accordance with the nature (theidentity) of his consciousness. His volition is limited to his cognitiveprocesses; he has the power to identify (and to conceive of rearranging) theelements of reality, but not the power to alter them. He has the power to usehis cognitive faculty as its nature requires, but not the power to alter it norto escape the consequences of its misuse. He has the power to suspend, evade,corrupt or subvert his perception of reality, but not the power to escape theexistential and psychological disasters that follow. (The use or misuse of hiscognitive faculty deterrnines a man’s choice of values, which determine hisemotions and his character. It is in this sense that man is a being of self-madesoul.)[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 32; pb 26. |See also CAUSALITY; CONSCIOUSNESS; DETERMINISM; EVASION; FOCUS; METAPHYSICAL us.MAN-MADE; MORALITY; PERCEPTION; ROMANTICISM; REASON; THOUGHT/THINKING;SENSATIONS; STANDARD of VALUE; VOLITIONAL. Freedom. What is the basic, the essential, the crucial principle thatdifferentiates freedom from slavery? It is the principle of voluntary actionversus physical coercion or compulsion.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 46.]Freedom, in a political context, has only one meaning: the absence of pltYlicalcoercion.[Ibid.] Since knowledge, thinking, and rational action are properties of the individual,since the choice to exercise his rational faculty or not depends on theindividual, man’s survival requires that those who think be free of theinterference of those who don’t. Since men are neither omniscient norinfallible, they must be free to agree or disagree, to cooperate or to pursuetheir own independent course, each according to his own rational judgment.Freedom is the fundamental requirement of man’s mind.A rational mind does not work under compulsion; it does not subordinate itsgrasp of reality to anyone’s orders, directives, or controls; it does notsacrifice its knowledge, its view of the truth, to anyone’s opinions, threats,wishes, plans, or “welfare.” Such a mind may be hampered by others, it may besilenced, proscribed, imprisoned, or destroyed; it cannot be forced; a gun isnot an argument. (An example and symbol of this attitude is Galileo.)It is from the work and the inviolate integrity of such minds—from theintransigent innovators—that all of mankind’s knowledge and achievements havecome. (See The Fountainhead.) It is to such minds that mankind owes itssurvival. (See Atlas Shrugged.)[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 17.] Foggy metaphors, sloppy images, unfocused poetry, and equivocations—such as “Ahungry man is not free”—do not alter the fact that only political power is thepower of physical coercion.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 46.] Freedom, in a political context, means freedom from government coercion. It doesnot mean freedom from the landlord, or freedom from the employer, or freedomfrom the laws of nature which do not provide men with automatic prosperity. Itmeans freedom from the coercive power of the state—and nothing else.[“Conservatism: An Obituary,” CUI, 192.] The issue is not slavery for a “good” cause versus slavery for a “bad” cause;the issue is not dictatorship by a “good” gang versus dictatorship by a “bad”gang. The issue is freedom versus dictatorship.[Ibid., 193.]A “right” is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom ofaction in a social context.[“Man’s Rights,” VOS, 124; pb 93.) If one upholds freedom, one must uphold man’s individual rights; it one upholdsman’s individual rights, one must uphold his right to his own life, to his ownliberty, to the pursuit of his own happiness—which means: one must uphold apolitical system that guarantees and protects these rights—which means: thepotitico-economic system of capitalism.[“Conservatism: An Obituary,” CUI, 193.] During the nineteenth century, mankind came close to economic freedom, for thefirst and only time in history. Observe the results. Observe also that thedegree of a country’s freedom from government control, was the degree of itsprogress. America was the freest and achieved the most. [“‘The Intellectual Bankruptcy of Our Age,” pamphlet, 7.] Intellectual freedom cannot exist without political freedom; political freedomcannot exist without ecoraomic freedom; a free mind and a free nearket arecorollaries.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 23; pb 25.] These two—reason and freedom—are corollaries, and their relationship isreciprocal: when men are rational, freedom wins; when men are free, reason wins.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 80; pb 66.] Do not be misled ... by an old collectivist trick which goes like this: there isno absolute freedom anyway, since you are not free to murder; society limitsyour freedom when it does not permit you to kill; therefore, society holds theright to limit your freedom in any manner it sees fit; therefore, drop thedelusion of freedom—freedom is whatever society decides it is.It is not society, nor any social right, that forbids you to kill—but theinalienable individual right of another man to live. This is not a “compromise”between two rights—but a line of division that preserves both rights untouched.The division is not derived from an edict of society—but from your owninalienable individual right. The definition of this limit is not setarbitrarily by society—but is implicit in the definition of your own right.Within the sphere of your own rights, your freedom is absolute.[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet, 6.]See also CAPITALISM; DICTATORSHIP; ECONOMIC POWER us. PO-LlTICAL POWER; FREEMARKET; GOVERNMENT; MIXED ECONOMY; PHYSICAL FORCE; RETALIATORY FORCE; STATISM. Freud. According to [Freud’s] theory, the prime mover in human nature is anunperceivable entity with a will and purpose of its own, the unconscious—whichis basically an “id,” i.e., a contradictory, amoral “it” seething with innate,bestial, primevally inherited, imperiously insistent cravings or “instincts.” Indeadly combat with this element is man’s conscience or “superego,” whichconsists essentially, not of reasoned moral convictions, but of primitive,illogical, largely unconscious taboos or categorical imperatives, representingthe mores of the child’s parents (and ultimately of society), whose randominjunctions every individual unquestioningly “introjects” and cowers before.Caught in the middle between these forces—between a psychopathic hippiescreaming: satisfaction now! and a jungle chieftain intoning: tribalobedience!—sentenced by nature to ineradicable conflict, guilt, anxiety, andneurosis is man, i.e., man’s mind, his reason or “ego,” the faculty which isable to grasp reality, and which exists primarily to mediate between theclashing demands of the psyche’s two irrational masters.As this theory makes eloquently clear, Freud’s view of reason is fundamentallyKantian. Both men hold that human thought is ultimately governed, not by a man’sawareness of external fact, but by inner mental elements independent of suchfact. Both see the basic task of the mind not as perception, but as creation,the creation of a subjective world in compliance with the requirements of innate(or “introjected”) mental structures....The real root of the outrage his own doctrines provoked, Freud says with acertain pride, is their assault on “the self-love of humanity.” Whatever the“wounds” that men have suffered from earlier scientific theories, he explains,the “blow” of psychoanalysis “is probably the most wounding.” The blow, hestates, is the idea that man is not “supreme in his own soul,” “that the ego isnot master in its own house.” ...Freud offers to the world not man the dutiful, decorous nonperceiver (as inKant); not man the defeated plaything of grand-scale forces, such as amalevolent reality or God or society or a “tragic flaw” (as in the works ofcountless traditional cynics and pessimists); but man the defeated plaything ofthe gutter; man the smutty pawn shaped by sexual aberrations and toilettraining, itching to rape his mother, castrate his father, hoard his excrement;man the sordid cheat who pursues science because he is a frustrated voyeur,practices surgery because he is a sublimating sadist, and creates the Davidbecause he craves, secretly, to mold his own feces.Man as a loathsomely small, ordure-strewn pervert: such is the sort of “wound”that Freud inflicted on the being who had once been defined, in a radiantlydifferent age, as the “rational animal.”[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 211; pb 198.]See also BEHAVIORISM; EMOTIONS; KANT, IMMANUEL; MAN; PSYCHOLOGY;RATIONALIZATION; SELF; SUBCONSCIOUS. “Frozen Abstraction,” Fallacy of. A fallacy which may be termed “the fallacy ofthe frozen abstraction” ... consists of substituting some one particularconcrete for the wider abstract class to which it belongs—[e.g.,] substituting aspecific ethics (altruism) for the wider abstraction of “ethics.” Thus, a manmay reject the theory of altruism and assert that he has accepted a rationalcode—but, failing to integrate his ideas, he continues unthinkingly to approachethical questions in terms established by altruism.[“Collectivized Ethics,” VOS, 104; pb 81.]See also ABSTRACTIONS and CONCRETES; ALTRUISM; MORALITY; PRINCIPLES. Fundamentality, Rule of. Now observe, on the above example [the definition of“man”], the process of determining an essential characteristic : the rule offuredamentality. When a given group of existents has more than onecharacteristic distinguishing it from other existents, man must observe therelationships among these various characteristics and discover the one on whichall the others (or the greatest number of others) depend, i.e., the fundamentalcharacteristic without which the others would not be possible. This fundamentalcharacteristic is the essential distinguishing characteristic of the existentsinvolved, and the proper defining characteristic of the concept.Metaphysically, a fundamental characteristic is that distinctive characteristicwhich makes the greatest number of others possible; epistemologically, it is theone that explains the greatest number of others.For instance, one could observe that man is the only animal who speaks English,wears wristwatches, flies airplanes, manufactures lipstick, studies geometry,reads newspapers, writes poems, darns socks, etc. None of these is an essentialcharacteristic: none of them explains the others; none of them applies to allmen; omit any or all of them, assume a man who has never done any of thesethings, and he will still be a man. But observe that all these activities (andinnumerable others) require a conceptual grasp of reality, that an animal wouldnot be able to understand them, that they are the expressions and consequencesof man’s rational Faculty, that an organism without that faculty would not be aman—and you will know why man’s rational faculty is his essential distinguishingand defining characteristic.[ITOE, 59.]See also CONCEPTS; DEFINITIONS; IDENTITY."},{"pageContent":"GGenocide. There is no principle by which genocide—a crime against a group ofmen—can be regarded as morally different from (or worse than) a crime against anindividual: the difference is only quantitative, not moral.

Genus and Species. Just as a concept becomes a unit when integrated with othersinto a wider concept, so a genus becomes a single unit, a species, whenintegrated with others into a wider genus. For instance, “table” is a species ofthe genus “furniture,” which is a species of the genus “household goods,” whichis a species of the genus “man-made objects.” “Man” is a species of the genus“animal,” which is a species of the genus “organism,” which is a species of thegenus “entity.”[ITOE, 54.]See also CONCEPT-FORMATION; DEFINITIONS. Goal-Directed Action. Only a living entity can have goals or can originate them.And it is only a living organism that has the capacity for self-generated,goal-directed action. On the physical level. the functions of all livingorganisms, from the simplest to the most complex—from the nutritive function inthe single cell of an amoeba to the blood circulation in the body of a man—areactions generated by the organism itself and directed to a single goal: themaintenance of the organism’s life.When applied to physical phenomena, such as the automatic functions of anorganism, the term “goal-directed” is not to be taken to mean “purposive” (aconcept applicable only to the actions of a consciousness) and is not to implythe existence of any teleological principle operating in insentient nature. Iuse the term “goal-directed,” in this context, to designate the fact that theautomatic functions of living organisms are actions whose nature is such thatthey result in the preservation of an organism’s life.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 6; pb 16.]See also LIFE; ULTIMATE VALUE: VALUES. God. They claim that they perceive a mode of being superior to your existence onthis earth. The mystics of spirit call it “another dimension,” which consists ofdenying dimensions. The mystics of muscle call it “the future,” which consistsof denying the present. To exist is to possess identity. What identity are theyable to give to their superior realm? They keep telling you what it is not, butnever tell you what it is. All their identifications consist of negating: God isthat which no human mind can know, they say—and proceed to demand that youconsider it knowledge—God is non-man, heaven is non-earth, soul is non-body,virtue is non-profit, A is non-A, perception is non-sensory, knowledge isnon-reason. Their definitions are not acts of defining, but of wiping out. [GS, FNI, 184; pb 148.] Every argument for God and every attribute ascribed to Him rests on a falsemetaphysical premise. None can survive for a moment on a correct metaphysics.For instance, God is infinite. Nothing can be infinite, according to the Law ofIdentity. Everything is what it is, and nothing else. It is limited in itsqualities and in its quantity: it is this much, and no more. “Infinite” asapplied to quantity does not mean “very large”: it means “larger than anyspecific quantity.” That means: no specific quantity—i.e.. a quantity withoutidentity. This is prohibited by the Law of Identity.Is God the creator of the universe? There can be no creation of something out ofnothing. There is no nothing.Is God omnipotent? Can he do anything? Entities can act only in accordance withtheir natures; nothing can make them violate their natures....“God” as traditionally defined is a systematic contradiction of every validmetaphysical principle. The point is wider than just the Judeo-Christian conceptof God. No argument will get you from this world to a supernatural world. Noreason will lead you to a world contradicting this one. No method of inferencewill enable you to leap from existence to a “super-existence.”[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture2.] See also AGNOSTICISM; ATHEISM; FAITH; IDENTITY; MYSTICISM; MYSTICS of SPIRIT andof MUSCLE; NATURE; REASON; RELIGION; SUPERNATURALISM; UNIVERSE.Gold Standard. Gold and economic freedom are inseparable, ... the gold standardis an instrument of laissez-faire and ... each implies and requires the other.What medium of exchange will be acceptable to all participants in an economy isnot determined arbitrarily. Where store-of-value considerations are important,as they are in richer, more civilized societies, the medium of exchange must bea durable commodity, usually a metal. A metal is generally chosen because it ishomogeneous and divisible: every y unit is the same as every other and it can beblended or formed in any quantity. Precious jewels, for example, are neitherhomogeneous nor divisible.More important, the commodity chosen as a medium must be a luxury. Human desiresfor luxuries are unlimited and, therefore, luxury goods are always in demand andwill always be acceptable....The term “luxury good” implies scarcity and high unit value. Having a high unitvalue, such a good is easily portable; for instance, an ounce of gold is worth ahalf-ton of pig iron....Under the gold standard, a free banking system stands as the protector of aneconomy’s stability and balanced growth.In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings fromconfiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value. If there were,the government would have to make its holding illegal, as was done in the caseof gold....The financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for theowners of wealth to protect themselves.This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists’ tirades against gold. Deficitspending is simply a scheme for the “hidden” confiscation of wealth. Gold standsin the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of propertyrights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists’antagonism toward the gold standard.[Alan Greenspan, “Gold and Economic Freedom,” CUI, 96.]See also DEFICIT FINANCING; FREEDOM; INFLATION; MONEY; PROPERTY RIGHTS; SAVINGS;WELFARE STATE. Good, the. All that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good;all that which destroys it is the evil.[GS, FNI, 149; pb 122.] For centuries, the battle of morality was fought between those who claimed thatyour life belongs to God and those who claimed that it belongs to yourneighbors—between those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for thesake of ghosts in heaven and those who preached that the good is self-sacrificefor the sake of incompetents on earth. And no one came to say that your lifebelongs to you and that the good is to live it.[Ibid.. 145; pb 120.] There are, in essence, three schools of thought on the nature of the good: theintrinsic, the subjective, and the objective. The intrinsic theory holds thatthe good is inherent in certain things or actions as such, regardless of theircontext and consequences, regardless of any benefit or injury they may cause tothe actors and subjects involved. It is a theory that divorces the concept of“good” from beneficiaries, and the concept of “value” from valuer andpurpose—claiming that the good is good in, by, and of itself.The subjectivist theory holds that the good bears no relation to the facts ofreality, that it is the product of a man’s consciousness, created by hisfeelings, desires, “intuitions,” or whims, and that it is merely an “arbitrarypostulate” or an “emotional commitment.”The intrinsic theory holds that the good resides in some sort of reality,independent of man’s consciousness; the subjectivist theory holds that the goodresides in man’s consciousness, independent of reality.The objective theory holds that the good is neither an attribute of “things inthemselves” nor of man’s emotional states, but an evaluation of the facts ofreality by man’s consciousness according to a rational standard of value.(Rational, in this context, means: derived from the facts of reality andvalidated by a process of reason.) The objective theory holds that the good isan aspect of reality in relation to man—and that it must be discovered, notinvented, by man. Fundamental to an objective theory of values is the question:Of value to whom and for what? An objective theory does not permitcontext-dropping or “concept-stealing”; it does not permit the separation of“value” from “purpose,” of the good from beneficiaries, and of man’s actionsfrom reason.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 21.] See also EVIL; INTRINSIC THEORY of ETHICS; LIFE; MORALITY; MYSTICAL ETHICS;SOCIAL THEORY of ETHICS; STANDARD of VALUE; SUBJECTIVISM. Government. A government is an institution that holds the exclusive power toenforce certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area.[“The Nature of Government,” VOS, 144; pb 107.]If physical force is to be barred from social relationships, men need aninstitution charged with the task of protecting their rights under an objectivecode of rules.This is the task of a government—of a proper government—its basic task, its onlymoral justification and the reason why men do need a government.A government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force underobjertive control—i.e.. under objectively defined laws.[Ibid., 147; pb 109.] The only proper purpose of a government is to protect man’s rights, which means:to protect him from physical violence. A proper government is only a policeman,acting as an agent of man’s self-defense, and, as such, may resort to force onlyagainst those who start the use of force. The only proper functions of agovernment are: the police, to protect you from criminals; the army, to protectyou from foreign invaders; and the courts, to protect your property andcontracts from breach or fraud by others, to settle disputes by rational rules,according to objective law. But a government that initiates the employment offorce against men who had forced no one, the employment of armed compulsionagainst disarmed victims, is a nightmare infernal machine designed to annihilatemorality: such a government reverses its only moral purpose and switches fromthe role of protector to the role of man’s deadliest enemy, from the role ofpoliceman to the role of a criminal vested with the right to the wielding ofviolence against victims deprived of the right of self-defense. Such agovernment substitutes for morality the following rule of social conduct: youmay do whatever you please to your neighbor, provided your gang is bigger thanhis.[GS, FNI, 231; pb 183.] The source of the government’s authority is “the consent of the governed.” Thismeans that the government is not the ruler, but the servant or agent of thecitizens; it means that the government as such has no rights except the rightsdelegated to it by the citizens for a specific purpose.[“The Nature of Government,” VOS, 149; pb 110.] The difference between political power and any other kind of social “power,”between a government and any private organization, is the fact that a governmentholds a legal monopoly on the use of physical force. This distinction is soimportant and so seldom recognized today that I must urge you to keep it inmind. Let me repeat it: a government holds a legal monopoly on the use ofphysical force.No individual or private group or private organization has the legal power toinitiate the use of physical force against other individuals or groups and tocompel them to act against their own voluntary choice. Only a government holdsthat power. The nature of governmental action is: coercive action. The nature ofpolitical power is: the power to force obedience under threat of physicalinjury—the threat of property expropriation, imprisonment, or death.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 46.] The fundamental difference between private action and governmental action—adifference thoroughly ignored and evaded today—lies in the fact that agovernment holds a monopoly on the legal use of physical force. It has to holdsuch a monopoly, since it is the agent of restraining and combating the use offorce; and for that very same reason, its actions have to be rigidly defined,delimited and circumscribed; no touch of whim or caprice should be permitted inits performance; it should be an impersonal robot, with the laws as its onlymotive power. If a society is to be free, its government has to be controlled.Under a proper social system, a private individual is legally free to take anyaction he pleases (so long as he does not violate the rights of others), while agovernment official is bound by law in his every official act. A privateindividual may do anything except that which is legally forbidden; a governmentofficial may do nothing except that which is legally permitted.This is the means of subordinating “might” to “right.” This is the Americanconcept of “a government of laws and not of men.”[“The Nature of Government,” VOS, 148; pb 109.] See also ANARCHISM; CAPITALISM; CUNSTITUTION; DICTATORSHIP; ECONOMIC POWER vs.POLITICAL POWER; FREEDOM; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; LAW, OBJECTIVE and NON-OBJECTIVE;PACIFISM; PHYSICAL FORCE; PROPERTY RIGHTS; RETALIATORY FORCE; SELF-DEFENSE;STATISM; WAR. Government Grants and Scholarships. The fundamental evil of government grants isthe fact that men are forced to pay for the support of ideas diametricallyopposed to their own. This is a profound violation of an individual’s integrityand conscience. It is viciously wrong to take the money of rational men for thesupport of B.F. Skinner—or vice versa. The Constitution forbids a governmentalestablishment of religion, properly regarding it as a violation of individualrights. Since a man’s beliefs are protected from the intrusion of force, thesame principle should protect his reasoned convictions and forbid governmentalestablishments in the field of thought.[“The Establishing of an Establishment,” PWNI, 204; pb 168.] How would Washington bureaucrats—or Congressmen, for that matter—know whichscientist to encourage, particularly in so controversial a field as socialscience? The safest method is to choose men who have achieved some sort ofreputation. Whether their reputation is deserved or not, whether theirachievements are valid or not, whether they rose by merit, pull, publicity oraccident, are questions which the awarders do not and cannot consider. Whenpersonal judgment is inoperative (or forbidden), men’s first concern is not howto choose, but how to justify their choice. This will necessarily promptcommittee members, bureaucrats and politicians to gravitate toward “prestigiousnames.” The result is to help establish those already established—i.e., toentrench the status quo.The worst part of it is the fact that this method of selection is not confinedto the cowardly or the corrupt, that the honest official is obliged to use it.The method is forced on him by the terms of the situation. To pass an informed,independent judgment on the value of every applicant or project in every fieldof science, an official would have to be a universal scholar. If he consults“experts” in the field, the dilemma remains: either he has to be a scholar whoknows which experts to consult—or he has to surrender his judgment to mentrained by the very professors he is supposed to judge. The awarding of grantsto famous “leaders,” therefore, appears to him as the only fair policy—on thepremise that “somebody made them famous, somebody knows, even if I don’t.”(If the officials attempted to by-pass the “leaders” and give grants topromising beginners, the injustice and irrationality of the situation would beso much worse that most of them have the good sense not to attempt it. Ifuniversal scholarship is required to judge the value of the actual in everyfield, nothing short of omniscience would be required to judge the value of thepotentiat—as various privately sponsored contests to discover future talent,even in limited fields, have amply demonstrated.)Furthermore, the terms of the situation actually forbid an honest official touse his own judgment. He is supposed to be “impartial” and “fair”—whiteconsidering awards in the social sciences. An official who does not have someknowledge and some convictions in this field, has no moral right to be a publicofficial. Yet the kind of “fairness” demanded of him means that he must suspend,ignore or evade his own convictions (these would be challenged as “prejudices”or “censorship”) and proceed to dispose of large sums of public money, withincalculable consequences for the future of the country—without judging thenature of the recipients’ ideas, i.e., without using any judgment whatever.The awarders may hide behind the notion that, in choosing recognized “leaders,”they are acting “democratically” and rewarding men chosen by the public. Butthere is no “democracy” in this field. Science and the mind do not work by voteor by consensus. The best-known is not necessarily the best (nor is theleast-known, for that matter). Since no rational standards are applicable, theawarders’ method leads to concern with personalities, not ideas; pull, notmerit; “prestige,” not truth. The result is: rule by press agents.[Ibid., 202; pb 166.] Many students of Objectivism ate troubled by a certain kind of moral dilemmaconfronting them in today’s society. We are frequently asked the questions: “Isit morally proper to accept scholarships, private or public?” and: “Is itmorally proper for an advocate of capitalism to accept a government researchgrant or a government job?”I shall hasten to answer: “Yes”—then proceed to explain and qualify it. Thereare many confusions on these issues, created by the influence and implicationsof the altruist morality.There is nothing wrong in accepting private scholarships. The fact that a manhas no claim on others (i.e., that it is not their moral duty to help him andthat he cannot demand their help as his right) does not preclude or prohibitgood will among men and does not make it immoral to offer or to acceptvoluntary, non-sacrificial assistance.A different principle and different considerations are involved in the case ofpublic (i.e., governmental) scholarships. The right to accept them rests on theright of the victims to the property (or some part of it) which was taken fromthem by force.The recipient of a public scholarship is morally justified only so long as heregards it as restitution and opposes all forms of welfare statism. Those whoadvocate public scholarships, have no right to them; those who oppose them,have. If this sounds like a paradox, the fault lies in the moral contradictionsof welfare statism, not in its victims.Since there is no such thing as the right of some men to vote away the rights ofothers, and no such thing as the right of the government to seize the propertyof some men for the unearned benefit of others—the advocates and supporters ofthe welfare state are morally guilty of robbing their opponents, and the factthat the robbery is legalized makes it morally worse, not better. The victims donot have to add self-inflicted martyrdom to the injury done to them by others;they do not have to let the looters profit doubly, by letting them distributethe money exclusively to the parasites who clamored for it. Whenever thewelfare-state laws offer them some small restitution, the victims should takeit....The same moral principles and considerations apply to the issue of acceptingsocial security, unemployment insurance or other payments of that kind. It isobvious, in such cases, that a man receives his own money which was taken fromhim by force, directly and specifically, without his consent, against his ownchoice. Those who advocated such laws are morally guilty, since they assumed the“right” to force employers and unwilling co-workers. But the victims, whoopposed such laws, have a clear right to any refund of their own money—and theywould not advance the cause of freedom if they left their money, unclaimed, forthe benefit of the welfare-state administration.The same moral principles and considerations apply to the issue of governmentresearch grants.The growth of the welfare state is approaching the stage where virtually theonly money available for scientific research will be government money. (Thedisastrous effects of this situation and the disgraceful state ofgovernment-sponsored science are apparent already, but that is a differentsubject. We are concerned here only with the moral dilemma of scientists.)Taxation is destroying private resources, while government money is flooding andtaking over the field of research.In these conditions, a scientist is morally justified in accepting governmentgrants_so long as he opposes forms of welfare statism.As in case ofscholarship-recipients, a scientist does not have to add self-martyrdom to theinjustices he suffers.[“The Question of Scholarships,” TO, June 1966, II.]See also ALTRUISM; CENSORSHIP; CHARITY; FREE SPEECH; WEL-PARE STATE. Grammar. Grammar is a science dealing with the formulation of the proper methodsof verbal expression and communication, i.e., the methods of organizing words(concepts) into sentences. Grammar pertains to the actions of consciousness, andinvolves a number of special concepts—such as conjunctions, which are conceptsdenoting relationships among thoughts (“and,” “but,” “or,” etc.). These conceptsare formed by retaining the distinguishing characteristics of the relationshipand omitting the particular thoughts involved. [ITOE, 48.][ITOE, 48.] Adverbs are concepts of the characteristics of motion (or action); they areformed by specifying a characteristic and omitting the measurements of themotion and of the entities invoked—e.g., “rapidly,” which may be applied to“walking” or “swimming” or “speaking,” etc., with the measurement of what is“rapid” left open and depending, in any given case, on the type of motioninvolved.Prepositions are concepts of relationships, predominantly of spatial or temporalrelationships, among existents; they are formed by specifying the relationshipand omitting the measurements of the existents and of the space or timeinvolved—e.g., “on,” “in,” “above,” “after,” etc.Adjectives are concepts of attributes or of characteristics. Pronouns belong tothe category of concepts of entities. Conjunctions. are concepts ofrelationships among thoughts, and belong to the category of concepts ofconsciousness.[Ibid.,20.J The purpose of conjunctions is verbal economy: they serve to integrate and/orcondense the content of certain thoughts.For instance, the word “and” serves to integrate a number of facts into onethought. If one says: “Smith, Jones and Brown are walking,” the “and” indicatesthat the observation “are walking” applies to the three individuals named. Isthere an object in reality corresponding to the word “and”? No. Is there a factin reality corresponding to the word “and”? Yes. The fact is that three men arewalking—and that the word “and” integrates into one thought a fact whichotherwise would have to be expressed by: “Smith is walking. Jones is walking.Brown is walking.”The word “but” serves to indicate an exception to or a contradiction of thepossible implications of a given thought. If one says: “She is beautiful, butdumb,” the “but” serves to condense the following thoughts: “This girl isbeautiful. Beauty is a positive attribute, a value. Before you conclude thatthis girl is valuable, you must consider also her negative attribute: she isdumb.” If one says: “I work every day, but not on Sunday,” the “but” indicatesan exception and condenses the following: “I work on Monday. I work on Tuesday.(And so on, four more times.) My activity on Sunday is different: I do not workon Sunday.”(These examples are for the benefit of those victims of modern philosophy whoare taught by Linguistic Analysis that there is no way to derive conjunctionsfrom experience, i.e., from the facts of reality.)[Ibid., 48.]See also COMMUNICATION; CONCEPTS; LANGUAGE; LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS; PROPOSITIONS;WORDS. Greece. See Ancient Greece.Guild Socialism. The particulai form of economic organization, which is becomingmore and more apparent in this country, as an outgrowth of the power of pressuregroups, is one of the worst variants of statism: guild socialism. Guildsocialism robs the talented young of their future—by freezing men intoprofessional castes under rigid rules. It represents an open embodiment of thebasic motive of most statists, though they usually prefer not to confess it: theentrenchment and protection of mediocrity from abler competitors, the shacklingof the men of superior ability down to the mean average of their professions.That theory is not too popular among socialists (though it has its advocates)—but the most famous instance of its large-scale practice was Fascist Italy.In the 1930’s, a few perceptive men said that Roosevelt’s New Deal was a form ofguild socialism and that it was closer to Mussolini’s system than to any other.They were ignored. Today, the evidence is unmistakable.It was also said that if fascism ever came to the United States, it would comedisguised as socialism.[“The New Fascism: Rule by Consensus,” CUI, 218.] The [student] rebels’ notion that universities should be run by students andfaculties was an open, explicit assault on the right attacked implicitly by alltheir other notions: the right of private property. And of all the variousstatist-collectivist systems, the one they chose as their goal is,politico-economically, the least practical; intellectually, the leastdefensible; morally, the most shameful: guild socialism.Guild socialism is a system that abolishes the exercise of individual ability bychaining men into groups according to their line of work, and delivering thework into the group’s power, as its exclusive domain, with the group dictatingthe rules, standards, and practices of how the work is to be done and who shallor shall not do it.Guild socialism is the concrete-bound, routine-bound mentality of a savage,elevated into a social theory. Just as a tribe of savages seizes a piece ofjungle territory and claims it as a monopoly by reason of the fact of beingthere—so guild socialism grants a monopoly, not on a jungle forest or waterhole,but on a factory or a university—not by reason of a man’s ability, achievement,or even “public service,” but by reason of the fact that he is there.Just as savages have no concept of causes or consequences, of past or future,and no concept of efficacy beyond the muscular power of their tribe—so guildsocialists, finding themselves in the midst of an industrial civilization,regard its institutions as phenomena of nature and see no reason why the gangshould not seize them.If there is any one proof of a man’s incompetence, it is the stagnant mentalityof a worker (or of a professor) who, doing some small, routine job in a vastundertaking, does not care to look beyond the lever of a machine (or the lecternof a classroom), does not choose to know how the machine (or the classroom) gotthere or what makes his job possible, and proclaims that the management of theundertaking is parasitical and unnecessary. Managerial work—the organization andintegration of human effort into purposeful, large-scale, long-rangeactivities—is. in the realm of action, what man’s conceptual faculty is in therealm of cognition. It is beyond the grasp and, therefore, is the first targetof the self-arrested, sensory-perceptual mentality.If there is any one way to confess one’s own mediocrity, it is the willingnessto place one’s work in the absolute power of a group, particularly a group ofone’s professional colleagues. Of any forms of tyranny, this is the worst; it isdirected against a single human attribute: the mind —and against a single enemy:the innovator. The innovator, by definition, is the man who challenges theestablished practices of his profession. To grant a professional monopoly to anygroup, is to sacrifice human ability and abolish progress; to advocate such amonopoly, is to confess that one has nothing to sacrifice.Guild socialism is the rule of, by, and for mediocrity. Its cause is a society’sintellectual collapse; its consequence is a quagmire of stagnation ; itshistorical example is the guild system of the Middle Ages (or, in modern times,the fascist system of Italy under Mussolini).[“The Cashing-in: The Student ‘Rebellion,’ ” CUI, 261.] What makes guild socialism cruder than (but not different from) moststatist-collectivist theories is the fact that it represents the other, theusually unmentioned, side of altruism: it is the voice, not of the givers, butof the receivers. While most altruistic theorists proclaim “the common good” astheir justification, advocate self-sacrificial service to the “community.” andkeep silent about the exact nature or identity of the recipients ofsacrifices—guild socialists brazenly declare themselves to he the recipients andpresent their claims to the community, demanding its services. If they want amonopoly on a given profession, they claim, the rest of the community must giveup the right to practice it. If they want a university. they claim, thecommunity must provide it.[Ibid., 263.]See also ALTRUISM; COLLECTIVISM; FASCISMINAZISM; MEDIOCRITY; NEW LEFT;SOCIALISM; STATISM."},{"pageContent":"HHappiness. Happiness is the successful state of life, pain is an agent of death.Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement ofone’s values. A morality that dares to tell you to find happiness in therenunciation of your happiness—to value the failure of your values—is aninsolent negation of morality. A doctrine that gives you, as an ideal, the roleof a sacrificial animal seeking slaughter on the altars of others, is giving youdeath as your standard. By the grace of reality and the nature of life,man—every man—is an end in himself, he exists for his own sake, and theachievement of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose.But neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of irrationalwhims. Just as man is free to attempt to survive in any random manner, but willperish unless he lives as his nature requires, so he is free to seek hishappiness in any mindless fraud, but the torture of frustration is all he willfind, unless he seeks the happiness proper to man. The purpose of morality is toteach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live.[GS, FNI, 150; pb 123.] Happiness is not to be achieved at the command of emotional whims. Happiness isnot the satisfaction of whatever irrational wishes you might blindly attempt toindulge. Happiness is a state of non-contradictory joy —a joy without penalty orguilt, a joy that does not clash with any of your values and does not work foryour own destruction, not the joy of escaping from your mind, but of using yourmind’s fullest power, not the joy of faking reality, but of achieving valuesthat are real, not the joy of a drunkard, but of a producer. Happiness ispossible only to a rational man, the man who desires nothing but rational goals,seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rationalactions.Just as I support my life, neither by robbery nor alms, but by my own effort, soI do not seek to derive my happiness from the injury or the favor of others, butearn it by my own achievement. Just as I do not consider the pleasure of othersas the goal of my life, so I do not consider my pleasure as the goal of thelives of others. Just as there are no contradictions in my values and noconflicts among my desires—so there are no victims and no conflicts of interestamong rational men, men who do not desire the unearned and do not view oneanother with a cannibal’s lust, men who neither make sacrifices nor accept them.[Ibid., 162; pb 132.] In psychological terms, the issue of man’s survival does not confront hisconsciousness as an issue of “life or death,” but as an issue of “happiness orsuffering.” Happiness is the successful state of life, suffering is the warningsignal of failure, of death. Just as the pleasure-pain mechanism of man’s bodyis an automatic indicator of his body’s welfare or injury, a barometer of itsbasic alternative, life or death—so the emotional mechanism of man’sconsciousness is geared to perform the same function, as a barometer thatregisters the same alternative by means of two basic emotions: joy or suffering.Emotions are the automatic results of man’s value judgments integrated by hissubconscious; emotions are estimates of that which furthers man’s values orthreatens them, that which is for him or against him—Hghtning calculators givinghim the sum of his profit or loss.But while the standard of value operating the physical pleasure-pain mechanismof man’s body is automatic and innate, determined by the nature of his body—thestandard of value operating his emotional mechanism, is not. Since man has noautomatic knowledge, he can have no automatic values; since he has no innateideas, he can have no innate value judgments.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS. 23; pb 27.] Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement ofone’s values. If a man values productive work, his happiness is the measure ofhis success in the service of his life. But if a man values destruction, like asadist—or self-torture, like a masochist—or life beyond the grave, like amystic—or mindless “kicks,” like the driver of a hotrod car—his allegedhappiness is the measure of his success in the service of his own destruction.It must be added that the emotional state of all those irrationalists cannot beproperly designated as happiness or even as pleasure: it is merely a moment’srelief from their chronic state of terror.Neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of irrational whims.Just as man is free to attempt to survive by any random means, as a parasite, amoocher or a looter, but not free to succeed at it beyond the range of themoment—so he is free to seek his happiness in any irrational fraud, any whim,any delusion, any mindless escape from reality, but not free to succeed at itbeyond the range of the moment nor to escape the consequences.[Ibid., 24; pb 28.]The maintenance of life and the pursuit of happiness are not two separateissues. To hold one’s own life as one’s ultimate value, and one’s own happinessas one’s highest purpose are two aspects of the same achievement. Existentially,the activity of pursuing rational goals is the activity of maintaining one’slife; psychologically, its result, reward and concomitant is an emotional stateof happiness. It is by experiencing happiness that one lives one’s life, in anyhour, year or the whole of it. And when one experiences the kind of purehappiness that is an end in itself—the kind that makes one think: “This is worthliving for”—what one is greeting and affirming in emotional terms is themetaphysical fact that life is an end in itself.But the relationship of cause to effect cannot be reversed. It is only byaccepting “man’s life” as one’s primary and by pursuing the rational values itrequires that one can achieve happiness—not by taking “happiness” as someundefined, irreducible primary and then attempting to live by its guidance. Ifyou achieve that which is the good by a rational standard of value, it willnecessarily make you happy; but that which makes you happy, by some undefinedemotional standard, is not necessarily the good. To take “whatever makes onehappy” as a guide to action means: to be guided by nothing but one’s emotionalwhims. Emotions are not tools of cognition; to be guided by whims—by desireswhose source, nature and meaning one does not know—is to turn oneself into ablind robot, operated by unknowable demons (by one’s stale evasions), a robotknocking its stagnant brains out against the walls of reality which it refusesto see.[Ibid., 25; pb 29.]See also BENEVOLENT UNIVERSE PREMISE; EMOTIONS; HEDONISM; LIFE; PLEASURE ANDPAIN; SUFFERING; ULTIMATE VALUE; VALUES; WHIMSIWHIM-WORSHIP. Hatred of the Good for Being the Good. See EnvylHatred of the Good for Being theGood.. Hedonism. I am profoundly opposed to the philosophy of hedonism. Hedonism is thedoctrine which holds that the good is whatever gives you pleasure and,therefore, pleasure is the standard of morality. Objectivism holds that the goodmust be defined by a rational standard of value, that,pleasure is not a firstcause, but only a consequence, that only the pleasure which proceeds from arational value judgment can be regarded as moral, that pleasure, as such, is nota guide to action nor a standard of morality. To say that pleasure should be thestandard of morality simply means that whichever values you happen to havechosen, consciously or subconsciously, rationally or irrationally, are right andmoral. This means that you are to be guided by chance feelings, emotions andwhims, not by your mind. My philosophy is the opposite of hedonism. I hold thatone cannot achieve happiness by random, arbitrary or subjective means. One canachieve happiness only on the basis of rational values. By rational values, I donot mean anything that a man may arbitrarily or blindly declare to be rational.It is the province of morality, of the science of ethics, to define for men whatis a national standard and what are the rational values to pursue.[“Playboy’s, Interview with Ayn Rand.” pamphlet. 8.] This is the fallacy inherent in hedonism—in any variant of ethical hedonism,personal or social, individual or collective. “Happiness” can properly be thepurpose of ethics, but not the standard. The task of ethics is to define man’sproper code of values and thus to give him the means of achieving happiness. Todeclare, as the ethical hedonists do, that “the proper value is whatever givesyou pleasure” is to declare that “the proper value is whatever you happen tovalue”—which is an act of intellectual and philosophical abdication, an actwhich merely proclaims the futility of ethics and invites all men to play itdeuces wild.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS. 26; pb 29.] In practice, men have no way of obeying the tenets of hedonism, except by takingtheir already formed feelings—their desires and aversions, their loves andfears—as the given, as irreducible primaries the satisfaction of which is thepurpose of morality, regardless of whether the value judgments that caused thesefeelings are rational or irrational, consistent or contradictory, consonant withreality or in flagrant defiance of it.Objectivism holds that such a policy is suicidal; that if man is to survive, heneeds the guidance of an objective and rational morality, a code of values basedon and derived from man’s nature as a specific type of living organism, and thenature of the universe in which he lives. Objectivism rejects any subjectivistethics that begins, not with facts, but with: “I (we, they) wish...” Whichmeans: it rejects hedonism of any variety.[Leonard Peikoff, “Ethical Hedonism,” TON, Feb. 1962.7.] See also EMOTIONS; HAPPINESS; PLEASURE and PAIN; UTILITARIANISM; STANDARD ofVALUE; SUBJECTIVISM. Hierarchy of Knowledge. Concepts have a hierarchical structure, i.e., ... thehigher, more complex abstractions are derived from the simpler, basic ones(starting with the concepts of perceptually given concretes).[ITOE, 41.] [There is a] long conceptual chain that starts from simple, ostensivedefinitions and rises to higher and still higher concepts, forming ahierarchical structure of knowledge so complex that no electronic computer couldapproach it. It is by means of such chains that man has to acquire and retainhis knowledge of reality.[“The Psycho-Epistemology of Art,” RM. 20; pb 18.] Starting from the base of conceptual deveiopment—from the concepts that identifyperceptual concretes—the process of cognition moves in two interactingdirections: toward more extensive and more intensive knowledge, toward widerintegrations and more precise differentiations. Following the process and inaccordance with cognitive evidence, earlier-formed concepts are integrated intowider ones or subdivided into narrower ones.[ITOE, 24.] Observe that the concept “furniture” is an abstraction one step further removedfrom perceptual reality than any of its constituent concepts. “Table” is anabstraction, since it designates any table, but its meaning can be conveyedsimply by pointing to one or two perceptual objects. There is no such perceptualobject as “furniture”; there are only tables, chairs, beds, etc. The meaning of“furniture” cannot be grasped unless one has first grasped the meaning of itsconstituent concepts; these are its link to reality. (On the lower levels of anunlimited conceptual chain, this is an illustration of the hierarchicalstructure of concepts.)[Ibid., 28.] The first concepts man forms are concepts of entities—since entities are theonly primary existents. (Attributes cannot exist by themselves, they are merelythe characteristics of entities; motions are motions of entities; relationshipsare relationships among entities.)[Ibid., 18.] Since the definition of a concept is formulated in terms of other concepts, itenables man, not only to identify and retain a concept, but also to establishthe relationships, the hierarchy, the integration of all his concepts and thusthe integration of his knowledge. Definitions preserve, not the chronologicalorder in which a given man may have learned concepts, but the logical order oftheir hierarchical interdependence.[Ibid., 52.] To know the exact meaning of the concepts one is using, one must know theircorrect definitions, one must be able to retrace the specific (logical, notchronological) steps by which they were formed, and one must be able todemonstrate their connection to their base in perceptual reality.[Ibid., 67.] See also AXlOMATlC CONCEPTS; AXIOMS; GENUS and SPECIES; IRREDUCIBLE PRIMARIES;KNOWLEDGE; LOGIC; PERCEPTION; “STOLEN CONCEPT,” FALLACY of; TABULA RASA. History. Contrary to the prevalent views of today’s alleged scholars, history isnot an unintelligible chaos ruled by chance and whim—historical trends can bepredicted, and changed—men are not helpless, blind, doomed creatures carried todestruction by incomprehensible forces beyond their control.There is only one power that determines the course of history, just as itdetermines the course of every individual life: the power of man’s rationalfaculty—the power of ideas. If you know a man’s convictions, you can predict hisactions. If you understand the dominant philosophy of a society, you can predictits course. But convictions and philosophy are matters open to man’s choice.There is no fatalistic, predetermined historical necessity. Atlas Shrugged isnot a prophecy of our unavoidable destruction, but a manifesto of our power toavoid it, if we choose to change our course.It is the philosophy of the mysticism-altruism-collectivism axis that hasbrought us to our present state and is carrying us toward a finale such as thatof the society presented in Atlas Shrugged. It is only the philosophy of thereason-individualism-capitalism axis that can save us and carry us, instead,toward the Atlantis projected in the last two pages of my novel.[“Is Atlas Shrugging?” CUI, 165.] Just as a man’s actions are preceded and determined by some form of idea in hismind, so a society’s existential conditions are preceded and determined by theascendancy of a certain philosophy among those whose job is to deal with ideas.The events of any given period of history are the result of the thinking of thepreceding period. The nineteenth century—with its political freedom, science,industry, business, trade, all the necessary conditions of material progress—wasthe result and the last achievement of the intellectual power released by theRenaissance. The men engaged in those activities were still riding on theremnants of an Aristotelian influence in philosophy, particularly on anAristotelian epistemology (more implicitly than explicitly).[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 27; pb 28.] History is made by minorities—or, more precisely, history is made byintellectual movements, which are created by minorities. Who belongs to theseminorities? Anyone who is able and willing actively to concern himself withintellectual issues. Here, it is not quantity, but quality that counts (thequality—and consistency—of the ideas one is advocating).[“What Can One Do?” PWNI, 245; pb 200.] The battle of human history is fought and determined by those who arepredominantly consistent, those who, for good or evil, are committed to andmotivated by their chosen psycho-epistemology and its corollary view ofexistence.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 18; pb 21.]See also ANCIENT GREECE; CIVILIZATION; CULTURE; DARK AGES; ENLIGHTENMENT, AGEof; INTELLECTUALS; MIDDLE AGES; NINETEENTH CENTURY; PHILOSOPHY; RENAISSANCE;TRADITION. Honesty. Honesty is the recognition of the fact that the unreal is unreal andcan have no value, that neither love nor fame nor cash is a value if obtained byfraud—that an attempt to gain a value by deceiving the mind of others is an actof raising your victims to a position higher than reality, where you become apawn of their blindness, a slave of their non-thinking and their evasions, whiletheir intelligence, their rationality, their perceptiveness becomes the enemiesyou have to dread and flee—that you do not care to live as a dependent, least ofall a dependent on the stupidity of others, or as a fool whose source of valuesis the fools he succeeds in footing—that honesty is not a social duty, not asacrifice for the sake of others, but the most profoundly selfish virtue man canpractice: his refusal to sacrifice the reality of his own existence to thedeluded consciousness of others.[GS, FNI, 158; pb 129.] Self-esteem is reliance on one’s power to think. It cannot be replaced by one’spower to deceive. The self-confidence of a scientist and the self-confidence ofa con man are not interchangeable states, and do not come from the samepsychological universe. The success of a man who deals with reality augments hisself-confidence. The success of a con man augments his panic.The intellectual con man has only one defense against panic: the momentaryrelief he finds by succeeding at further and further frauds.[“The Comprachicos,” NL, 181.] The mark of an honest man ... is that he means what he says and knows what hemeans.[‘Textbook of Americanism,“ 12.] Intellectual honesty consists in taking ideas seriously. To take ideas seriouslymeans that you intend to live by, to practice, any idea you accept as true. [“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 19; pb 16.] Intellectual honesty [involves] knowing what one does know, constantly expandingone’s knowledge, and never evading or failing to correct a contradiction. Thismeans: the development of an active mind as a permanent attribute.[“What Can One Do?” PWNI, 247; pb 201.]See also EVASION; INDEPENDENCE; INTEGRITY; MORALITY; RATIONALITY; TRUTH; VIRTUE. Honor.

Caused by a profound self-doubt, self-condemnation and fear,hostility is a type of projection that directs toward other people the hatredwhich the hostile person feels toward himself. Blaming the evil of others forhis own shortcomings, he feels a chronic need to justify himself bydemonstrating their evil, by seeking it, by hunting for it—and by inventing it.[“The Psychology of Psychologizing,” TO, March 1971, 3.]See also AMORALISM; EMOTIONS; ENVYlHATRED of the GOOD for BEING the GOOD;EVASION. Human Rights and Property Rights. The modern mystics of muscle who offer you thefraudulent alternative of “human rights” versus “property rights,” as if onecould exist without the other, are making a last, grotesque attempt to revivethe doctrine of soul versus body. Only a ghost can exist without materialproperty; only a slave can work with no right to the product of his effort. Thedoctrine that “human rights” are superior to “property rights” simply means thatsome human beings have the right to make property out of others; since thecompetent have nothing to gain from the incompetent, it means the right of theincompetent to own their betters and to use them as productive cattle. Whoeverregards this as human and right, has no right to the title of “human.”[GS, FNI, 230; pb 183.] There is no such dichotomy as “human rights” versus “property rights.” No humanrights can exist without property rights. Since material goods are produced bythe mind and effort of individual men, and are needed to sustain their lives, ifthe producer does not own the result of his effort, he does not own his life. Todeny property rights means to turn men into property owned by the state. Whoeverclaims the “right” to “redistribute” the wealth produced by others is claimingthe “right” to treat human beings as chattel.[“The Monument Builders,” VOS, 120; pb 91.]See also FASCISM and COMMUNISM/SOCIALISM; FREEDOM; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; PROPERTYRIGHTS; SOUL-BODY DICHOTOMY. Humility. There is no more despicable coward than the man who deserted thebattle for his joy, fearing to assert his right to existence, lacking thecourage and the loyalty to life of a bird or a flower reaching for the sun.Discard the protective rags of that vice which you call a virtue: humility—learnto value yourself, which means: to fight for your happiness—and when you learnthat pride is the sum of all virtues, you will learn to live like a man. [GS, FNI, 225; pb 179.] Humility and presumptuousness are always two sides of the same premise, andalways share the task of filling the space vacated by self esteem in acollectivized mentality. The man who is willing to serve as the means to theends of others, will necessarily regard others as the means to his ends.[“Collectivized Ethics,” VOS, 105; pb 81.] Self-abasement is the antithesis of morality. If a man has acted immorally, butregrets it and wants to atone for it, it is not self-abasement that prompts him,but some remnant of love for moral values—and it is not self-abasement that heexpresses, but a longing to regain his self-esteem. Humility is not arecognition of one’s failings, but a rejection of morality. “I am no good” is astatement that may be uttered only in the past tense. To say: “I am no good” isto declare: “—and I never intend to be any better.”[“Moral Inflation,” ARL, III, 13, 1.]See also ALTRUISM; MORALITY; PRIDE; SACRIFICE; SELF-ESTEEM. Humor. Humor is the denial of metaphysical importance to that which you laughat. The classic example: you see a very snooty, very well dressed dowagerwalking down the street, and then she slips on a banana peel.... What’s funnyabout it? It’s the contrast of the woman’s pretensions to reality. She actedvery grand, but reality undercut it with a plain banana peel. That’s the denialof the metaphysical validity or importance of the pretensions of that woman.Therefore, humor is a destructive element -which is quite all right, but itsvalue and its morality depend on what it is that you are laughing at. If whatyou are laughing at is the evil in the world (provided that you take itseriously, but occasionally you permit yourself to laugh at it), that’s fine.[To] laugh at that which is good, at heroes, at values, and above all atyourself [is] monstrous.... The worst evil that you can do, psychulogically, isto laugh at yourself. That means spitting in your own face.[Ayn Rand, question period following Lecture 11 of Leonard Peikoff’s series “ThePhilosophy of Objectivism” (1976).] Humor is not an unconditional virtue; its moral character depends on its object.To laugh at the contemptible, is a virtue; to laugh at the good, is a hideousvice. Too often, humor is used as the camouflage of moral cowardice.[“Bootleg Romanticism,” RM, 126; pb 133.]See also METAPHYSICAL; MORAL COWARDICE; SELF-ESTEEM; VIRTUE."},{"pageContent":"IIdentity. To exist is to be something, as distinguished from the nothing ofnon-existence, it is to be an entity of a specific nature made of specificattributes. Centuries ago, the man who was—no matter what his errors—thegreatest of your philosophers, has stated the formula defining the concept ofexistence and the rule of all knowledge: A is A. A thing is itself. You havenever grasped the meaning of his statement. I am here to complete it: Existenceis Identity, Consciousness is Identification.Whatever you choose to consider, be it an object, an attribute or an action, thelaw of identity remains the same. A leaf cannot be a stone at the same time, itcannot be all red and all green at the same time, it cannot freeze and burn atthe same time. A is A. Or, if you wish it stated in simpler language: You cannothave your cake and eat it, too.Are you seeking to know what is wrong with the world? All the disasters thathave wrecked your world, came from your leaders’ attempt to evade the fact thatA is A. All the secret evil you dread to face within you and all the pain youhave ever endured, came from your own attempt to evade the fact that A is A. Thepurpose of those who taught you to evade it, was to make you forget that Man isMan. [GS, FNI, 152; pb 125.] A thing is—what it is; its characteristics constitute its identity. An existentapart from its characteristics, would be an existent apart from its identity,which means: a nothing, a non-existent.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” lTOE, 142.] No matter how eagerly you claim that the goal of your mystic wishing is a highermode of life, the rebellion against identity is the wish for non-existence. Thedesire not to be anything is the desire not to be. [GS, FNl, 187; pb 150.] A characteristic is an aspect of an existent. It is not a disembodied, Platonicuniversal. Just as a concept cannot mean existents apart from their identity, soit cannot mean identities apart from that which exists. Existence is Identity.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 143. ]The concept “identity” does not indicate the particular natures of the existentsit subsumes; it merely underscores the primary fact that they are what they are.[ITOE, 78.] The law of identity does not permit you to have your cake and eat it, too. Thelaw of causality does not permit you to eat your cake before you have it....The law of causality is the law of identity applied to action. All actions arecaused by entities. The nature of an action is caused and determined by thenature of the entities that act; a thing cannot act in contradiction to itsnature.[GS, FNI, 188; pb 152.] The (implicit) concept “existent” undergoes three stages of development in man’smind. The first stage is a child’s awareness of objects, of things—whichrepresents the (implicit) concept “entity.” The second and closely allied stageis the awareness of specific, particular things which he can recognize anddistinguish from the rest of his perceptual field—which represents the(implicit) concept “identity.”[ITOE, 6.] They proclaim that there is no law of identity, that nothing exists but change,and blank out the fact that change presupposes the concepts of what changes,from what and to what, that without the law of identity no such concept as“change” is possible.[GS, FNI, 192; pb 154.]See also ARIST0TLE; AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS; AXIOMS; CAc/.M/./rr: CHARACTER; ENTITY;EXISTENCE; IMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE: INFINITY; LOGIC: SUBJECTIVISM; ZERO, REIFICATIONof. Ideology. A political ideology is a set of principles aimed at establishing ormaintaining a certain social system; it is a program of long-range action, withthe principles serving to unify and integrate particular steps into a consistentcourse. It is only by means of principles that men can project the future andchoose their actions accordingly.Anti-ideology consists of the attempts to shrink men’s minds down to the rangeof the immediate moment, without regard to past or future, without context ormemory—above all, without memory, so that contradictions cannot be detected, anderrors or disasters can be blamed on the victims.In anti-ideological practice, principles are used implicitly and are relied uponto disarm the opposition, but are never acknowledged, and are switched’at will,when it suits the purpose of the moment. Whose purpose? The gang’s. Thus men’smoral criterion becomes, not “my view of the good—or of the right—or of thetruth,” but “my gang, right or wrong.”[“The Wreckage of the Consensus,” CUI, 222.] A majority without an ideology is a helpless mob, to be taken over by anyone....Political freedom requires much more than the people’s wish. It requires anenormously complex knowledge of political theory and of how to implement it inpractice.[“Theory and Practice,” CUI, 138.]See also POLITICS; PHILOSOPHY; PRINCIPLES; REVOLUTION u.s.

Man’s imagination is nothing more than the ability to rearrange thethings he has observed in reality.[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 31; pb 25.] Imagination is not a faculty for escaping reality, but a faculty for rearrangingthe elements of reality to achieve human values; it requires and presupposessome knowledge of the elements one chooses to rearrange. An imagination divorcedfrom knowledge has only one product: a nightmare....

Immorality. See Evil. Implicit Knowledge. Axiomatic concepts identify explicitly what is merelyimplicit in the consciousness of an infant or of an animal. (Implicit knowledgeis passively held material which, to be grasped, requires a special focus andprocess of consciousness—a process which an infant learns to perform eventually,but which an animal’s consciousness is unable to perform.)[ITOE, 76.] Man grasps [the concept of “existent”] implicitly on the perceptual level—i.e.,he grasps the constituents of the concept “existent,” the data which are laterto be integrated by that concept. It is this implicit knowledge that permits hisconsciousness to develop further.[Ibid., 6.] That which is merely implicit is not in men’s conscious control; they can loseit by means of other implications, without knowing what it is that they arelosing or when or why.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 62; pb 53.]See also CONCEPTS; EXISTENT: KNOWLEDGE; PERCEPTION,- UNIT. Important. See Metaphysical Value-Judgments.Inalienability. When we say that we hold individual rights to be inalienable, wemust mean just that. Inalienable means that which we may not take away, suspend,infringe, restrict or violate—not ever, not at any time, not for any purposewhatsoever.You cannot say that “man has inalienable rights except in cold weather and onevery second Tuesday,” just as you cannot say that “man has inalienable rightsexcept in an emergency,” or “man’s rights cannot be violated except for a goodpurpose.”Either man’s rights are inalienable, or they are not. You cannot say a thingsuch as “semi-inalienable” and consider yourself either honest or sane. When youbegin making conditions, reservations and exceptions, you admit that there issomething or someone above man’s rights, who may violate them at his discretion.Who? Why, society—that is, the Collective. For what reason? For the good of theCollective. Who decides when rights should be violated? The Collective. If thisis what you believe, move over to the side where you belong and admit that youare a Collectivist.[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet, 12.]See also ABSOLUTES; COLLECTIVISM; COMPROMISE; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS: PRINCIPLES. Independence. Independence is the recognition of the fact that yours is theresponsibility of judgment and nothing can help you escape it—that no substitutecan do your thinking, as no pinch-hitter can live your life—that the vilest formof self-abasement and self-destruction is the subordination of your mind to themind of another, the acceptance of an authority over your brain, the acceptanceof his assertions as facts, his say-so as truth, his edicts as middle-manbetween your consciousness and your existence.[GS, FNI, 157; pb 128.]No matter how vast your knowledge or how modest, it is your own mind that has toacquire it. It is only with your own knowledge that you can deal. It is onlyyour own knowledge that you can claim to possess or ask others to consider. Yourmind is your only judge of truth—and if others dissent from your verdict,reality is the court of final appeal. Nothing but a man’s mind can perform thatcomplex, delicate, crucial process of identification which is thinking. Nothingcan direct the process but his own judgment. Nothing can direct his judgment buthis moral integrity.[Ibid., 134; pb 126.] Live and act within the limit of your knowledge and keep expanding it to thelimit of your life. Redeem your mind from the hockshops of authority. Accept thefact that you are not omniscient, but playing a zombie will not give youomniscience—that your mind is fallible, but becoming mindless will not make youinfallible—that an error made on your own is safer than ten truths accepted onfaith, because the first leaves you the means to correct it, but the seconddestroys your capacity to distinguish truth from error. In place of your dreamof an omniscient automaton, accept the fact that any knowledge man acquires isacquired by his own will and effort, and that that is his distinction in theuniverse, that is his nature, his morality, his glory.[Ibid., 224; pb 178.] [An] error is committed by the man who declares that since man must be guided byhis own independent judgment, any action he chooses to take is moral if hechooses it. One’s own independent judgment is the means by which one must chooseone’s actions, but it is not a moral criterion nor a moral validation: onlyreference to a demonstrable principle can validate one’s choices.[“Introduction,” VOS xiv; pb x.] See also CREATORS; INTEGRITY; RATIONALITY; SFCOND-HANDERS; SELFISHNESS; VIRTUE. Individual Rights. A “right” is a moral principle defining and sanctioning aman’s freedom of action in a social context. There is only one fundamental right(all the others are its consequences or corollaries): a man’s right to his ownlife. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action; the rightto life means the right to engage in self-sustaining and self-generatedaction—which means: the freedom to take all the actions required by the natureof a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and theenjoyment of his own life. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, libertyand the pursuit of happiness.)The concept of a “right” pertains only to action—specifically, to freedom ofaction. It means freedom from physical compulsion, coercion or interference byother men.Thus, for every individual, a right is the moral sanction of a positive-of hisfreedom to act on his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own voluntary,uncoerced choice. As to his neighbors, his rights impose no obligations on themexcept of a negative kind: to abstain from violating his rights.The right to life is the source of all rights—and the right to property is theironly implementation. Without property rights, no other rights are possible.Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man who has no right tothe product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. The man who produceswhile others dispose of his product, is a slave.Bear in mind that the right to property is a right to action, like all theothers: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequencesof producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earnany property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is theright to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values.[“Man’s Rights,” VOS, 124; pb 93.| “Rights” are a moral concept—the concept that provides a logical transition fromthe principles guiding an individual’s actions to the principles guiding hisrelationship with others—the concept that preserves and protects inetividualmorality in a social context—the link between the moral code of a man and thelegal code of a society, between ethics and politics. Individual rights are themeansof subordinating society to moral law.[Ibid., ) 122; pb 92.] Man holds these rights, not from the Collective nor for the Collective, butagainst the Collective-as a barrier which the Collective cannot cross; ... theserights are man’s protection against all other men.[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet, 5.] The source of man’s rights is not divine law or congressional law, but the lawof identity. A is A—and Man is Man. Rights are conditions of existence requiredby man’s nature for his proper survival. If man is to live on earth, it is rightfor him to use his mind, it is right to act on his own free judgment, it isright to work for his values and to keep the product of his work. If life onearth is his purpose, he has a right to live as a rational being: nature forbidshim the irrational. Any group, any gang, any nation that attempts to negateman’s rights, is wrong, which means: is evil, which means: is anti-life.[GS, FNI, 229; pb 182.] Since knowledge, thinking, and rational action are properties of the individual,since the choice to exercise his rational faculty or not depends on theindividual, man’s survival requires that those who think be free of theinterference of those who don’t. Since men are neither omniscient norinfallible, they must be free to agree or disagree, to cooperate or to pursuetheir own independent course, each according to his own rational judgment.Freedom is the fundamental requirement of man’s mind. [“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 17.] Individual rights is the only proper principle of human coexistence, because itrests on man’s nature, i.e., the nature and requirements of a conceptualconsciousness. Man gains enormous values from dealing with other men; living ina human society is his proper way of life—but only on certain conditions. Man isnot a lone wolf and he is not a social animal. He is a contractual animal. Hehas to plan his life long-range, make his own choices, and deal with other menby voluntary agreement (and he has to be able to rely on their observance of theagreements they entered).[“A Nation’s Unity,” ARL, II, 2, 3.] A right is the sanction of independent action. A right is that which can beexercised without anyone’s permission.If you exist only because society permits you to exist—you have no right to yourown life. A permission can be revoked at any time.If, before undertaking some action, you must obtain the permission ofsociety—you are not free, whether such permission is granted to you or not. Onlya slave acts on permission. A permission is not a right.Do not make the mistake, at this point, of thinking that a worker is a slave andthat he holds his job by his employer’s permission. He does not hold it bypermission—but by contract that is, by a voluntary mutual agreement. A workercan quit his job. A slave cannot.[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet, 5.] The Right to the Pursuit of Happiness means man’s right to live for himself, tochoose what constitutes his own private, personal, individual happiness and towork for its achievement, so long as he respects the same right in others. Itmeans that Man cannot be forced to devote his life to the happiness of anotherman nor of any number of other men. It means that the collective cannot decidewhat is to be the pur pose of a man’s existence nor prescribe his choice ofhappiness.[ lbid.,] Since Man has inalienable individual rights, this means that the same rights areheld, individually, by every man, by all men, at all times. Therefore, therights of one man cannot and must not violate the rights of another.For instance: a man has the right to live, but he has no right to take the lifeof another. He has the right to be free, but no right to enslave another. He hasthe right to choose his own happiness, but no right to decide that his happinesslies in the misery (or murder or robbery or enslavement) of another. The veryright upon which he acts defines the same right of another man, and serves as aguide to tell him what he may or may not do.[Ibid., 6.] It is not society, nor any social right, that forbids you to kill—but theinalienable individual right of another man to live, This is not a “compromise”between two rights—but a line of division that preserves both rights untouched.The division is not derived from an edict of society—but from your owninalienable individual right. The definition of this limit is not setarbitrarily by society—but is implicit in the definition of your own right.Within the sphere of your own rights, your freedom is absolute.[Ibid., 7.] A right cannot be violated except by physical force. One man cannot depriveanother of his life, nor enslave him, nor forbid him to pursue his happiness,except by using force against him. Whenever a man is made to act without his ownfree, personal, individual, voluntary consent —his right has been violated.Therefore, we can draw a clear-cut division between the rights of one man andthose of another. It is an objective division—not subject to differences ofopinion, nor to majority decision, nor to the arbitrary decree of society. Noman has the right to initiate the useof physical force against another man.[ Ibid., 6.] There is no such thing as “a right to a job”—there is only the right of freetrade, that is: a man’s right to take a job if another man chooses to hire him.There is no “right to a home,” only the right of free trade: the right to builda home or to buy it. There are no “rights to a ‘fair’ wage or a ‘fair’ price” ifno one chooses to pay it, to hire a man or to buy his product. There are no“rights of consumers” to milk, shoes, movies or champagne if no producers chooseto manufacture such items (there is only the right to manufacture them oneself).There are no “rights” of special groups, there are no “rights of farmers, ofworkers, of businessmen, of employees, of employers, of the old, of the young,of the unborn.” There are only the Rights of Man—rights possessed by everyindividual man and by all men as individuals.[“Man’s Rights,” VOS, 130; pb 97.] If some men are entitled by right to the products of the work of others, itmeans that those others are deprived of rights and condemned to slave labor.Any alleged “right” of one man, which necessitates the violation of the rightsof another, is not and cannot be a right.No man can have a right to impose an unchosen obligation, an unrewarded duty oran involuntary servitude on another man. There can be no such thing as “theright to enslave.”[Ibid., 129; pb 96.] The end does not justify the means. No one’s rights can be secured by theviolation of the rights of others.[“The Cashing-In: The Student ‘Rebellion,’ ” CUI, 256.] Since only an individual man can possess rights, the expression “individualrights” is a redundancy (which one has to use for purposes of clarification intoday’s intellectual chaos). But the expression “collective rights” is acontradiction in terms.[“Collectivized ‘Rights,’ ” VOS, 136; pb 101.] A group, as such, has no rights. A man can neither acquire new rights by joininga group nor lose the rights which he does possess. The principle of individualrights is the only moral base of all groups or associations. [Ibid., 137; pb 102.] Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right tovote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights isprecisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallestminority on earth is the individual).[Ibid., 140; pb 104.]When individual rights are abrogated, there is no way to determine who isentitled to what; there is no way to determine the justice of anyone’s claims,desires, or interests. The criterion, therefore, reverts to the tribal conceptof: one’s wishes are limited only by the power of one’s gang. In order tosurvive under such a system, men have no choice but to fear, hate, and destroyone another; it is a system of underground plotting, of secret conspiracies, ofdeals, favors, betrayals, and sudden, bloody coups.[“The Roots of War,” CUI, 37.] One of the notions used by all sides to justify the draft, is that “rightsimpose obligations. Obligations, to whom?—and imposed, by whom? Ideologically,that notion is worse than the evil it attempts to justify: it implies thatrights are a gift from the state, and that a man has to buy them by offeringsomething (his life) in return. Logically, that notion is a contradiction: sincethe only proper function of a government is to protect man’s rights, it cannotclaim title to his life in exchange for that protection.The only “obligation” involved in individual rights is an obligation imposed,not by the state, but by the nature of reality (i.e., by the law of identity):consistency, which, in this case, means the obligation to respect the rights ofothers, if one wishes one’s own rights to be recognized and protected.[“The Wreckage of the Consensus,” CUI, 227.] An embryo has no rights. Rights do not pertain to a potential, only to an actualbeing. A child cannot acquire any rights until it is born. The living takeprecedence over the not-yet-living (or the unborn).[“Of Living Death,” TO, Oct. 1968, 6.] The concept of individual rights is so prodigious a feat of political thinkingthat few men grasp it fully—and two hundred years have not been enough for othercountries to understand it. But this is the concept to which we owe ourlives—the concept which made it possible for us to bring into reality everythingof value that any of us did or will achieve or experience.[“A Nation’s Unity,” ARL, II,2,3.]See also AMERICA; CAPITALISM; COLLECTIVISM; DICTATORSHIP; FREEDOM; HUMAN RIGHTSand PROPERTY RIGHTS; INALIENABILITY; INDIVIDUALISM; LIFE, RIGHT to; PERMISSION(vs. RIGHTS); PHYSICAL FORCE; POLITICS; PRINCIPLES; PROPERTY RIGHTS; PURSUIT ofHAPPINESS, RIGHT to; RETALIATORY FORCE; SELF-DEFENSE; STATISM; TYRANNY.Individualism. Individualism regards man—every man—as an independent, sovereignentity who possesses an inalienable right to his own life, a right derived fromhis nature as a rational being. Individualism holds that a civilized society, orany form of association, cooperation or peaceful coexistence among men, can beachieved only on the basis of the recognition of individual rights—and that agroup, as such, has no rights other than the individual rights of its members.[“Racism,” VOS, 176; pb 129.] Do not make the mistake of the ignorant who think that an individualist is a manwho says: “I’ll do as I please at everybody else’s expense.” An individualist isa man who recognizes the inalienable individual rights of man—his own and thoseof others.An individualist is a man who says: “I will not run anyone’s life—nor let anyonerun mine. I will not rule nor be ruled. I will not be a master nor a slave.005[rand_9781101137246_oeb_005_r1.gif]will not sacrifice myself to anyone—norsacrifice anyone to myself.”[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet, 6.] The mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as acollective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. An agreementreached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon manyindividual thoughts. It is a secondary consequence. The primary act—the processof reason—must be performed by each man alone. We can divide a meal among manymen. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use his lungs tobreathe for another man. No man can use his brain to think for another. All thefunctions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared or transferred.We inherit the products of the thought of other men. We inherit the wheel. Wemake a cart. The cart becomes an automobile. The automobile becomes an airplane.But all through the process what we receive from others is only the end productof their thinking. The moving force is the creative faculty which takes thisproduct as material, uses it and originates the next step. This creative facultycannot be given or received, shared or borrowed. It belongs to single,individual men. That which it creates is the property of the creator. Men learnfrom one another. But all learning is only the exchange of material. No man cangive another the capacity to think. Yet that capacity is our only means ofsurvival.[“The Soul of an Individualist,” FNI, 91; pb 78.] Mankind is not an entity, an organism, or a coral bush. The entity involved inproduction and trade is man. It is with the study of man— not of the looseaggregate known as a “community”—that any science of the humanities has tobegin....A great deal may be learned about society by studying man; but this processcannot be reversed: nothing can be learned about man by studying society—bystudying the inter-relationships of entities one has never identified ordefined.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 15.]See also CAPITALISM; COLLECTIVISM; “COMMON GOOD”; COOPERATION; FREE WILL;FREEDOM; INDEPENDENCE; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; NIETZSCHE, FRIEDRICH; REASON;SACRIFICE; SELFISHNESS; SOCIAL SYSTEM; SOCIETY. Induction and Deduction. The process of forming and applying concepts containsthe essential pattern of two fundamental methods of cognition: induction anddeduction.The process of observing the facts of reality and of integrating them intoconcepts is, in essence, a process of induction. The process of subsuming newinstances under a known concept is, in essence, a process of deduction.[ITOE, 36.] See also CONCEPT-FORMATION; LOGIC; PROPOSITIONS; RATIONALISM vs. EMPIRICISM. Infinity. There is a use of [the concept) “infinity” which is valid, asAristotle observed, and that is the mathematical use. It is valid only when usedto indicate a potentiality, never an actuality. Take the number series as anexample. You can say it is infinite in the sense that, no matter how manynumbers you count, there is always another number. You can always keep oncounting; there’s no end. In that sense it is infinite—as a potential. Butnotice that, actually, however many numbers you count, wherever you stop, youonly reached that point, you only got so far.... That’s Aristotle’s point thatthe actual is always finite. Infinity exists only in the form of the ability ofcertain series to be extended indefinitely; but however much they are extended,in actual fact, wherever you stop it is finite.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976),question period, Lecture 3.] An arithmetical sequence extends into infinity, without implying that infinityactually exists; such extension means only that whatever number of units doesexist, it is to be included in the same sequence.[ITOE, 22.]Every unit of length, no matter how small, has some specific extension; everyunit of time,‘ no matter how small, has some specific duration. The idea of aninfinitely small amount of length or temporal duration has validity only as amathematical device useful for making certain calculations, not as a descriptionof components of reality. Reality does not contain either points or instants (inthe mathematical sense). By analogy: the average family has 2.2 children, but noactual family has 2.2 children; the “average family” exists only as amathematical device.[Harry Binswanger, “Q & A Department: Identity and Motion,” TOF, Dec. 1981, 13.]See also IDENTITY; MATHEMATICS; NUMBERS; UNIVERSE. Inflation. “Inflation” is defined in the dictionary as “undue expansion orincrease of the currency of a country, esp. by the issuing of paper money notredeemable in specie” (Random House Dictionary). It is interesting to note thatthe word “inflated” is defined as “distended with air or gas; swollen.”This last is not a coincidence: in regard to social issues, “inflation” does notmean growth, enlargement or expansion, it means an “undue” —or improper orfraudulent—expansion. The expansion of a country’s currency (which,incidentally, cannot be perpetrated by private citizens, only by the government)consists in palming off, as values, a stream of paper backed by nothing butpromises (or hot air) and getting actual values, the citizens’ goods orservices, in return—until the country’s wealth is drained. A similar activity,in private performance, is the passing of checks on a non-existent bank account.But, in private performance, this is regarded as a crime—and most peopleunderstand why such an activity cannot last for long.Today, people are beginning to understand that the government’s account isoverdrawn, that a piece of paper is not the equivalent of a gold coin, or anautomobile, or a loaf of bread—and that if you attempt to falsify monetaryvalues, you do not achieve abundance, you merely debase the currency and gobankrupt.[“Moral Inflation,” ARL, III, 12, 1.] Inflation is not caused by the actions of private citizens, but by thegouvernment: by an artificial expansion of the money supply required to supportdeficit spending. No private embezzlers or bank robbers in history have everplundered people’s savings on a scale comparable to the plunder perpetrated bythe fiscal policies of statist governments.[“Who Will Protect Us from Our Protectors?” TON, May 1962, 18.]The law of supply and demand is not to be conned. As the supply of money (ofclaims) increases relative to the supply of tangible assets in the economy,prices must eventually rise. Thus the earnings saved by the productive membersof the society lose value in terms of goods. When the economy’s books arefinally balanced, one finds that this loss in value represents the goodspurchased by the government for welfare on other purposes with the moneyproceeds of the government bonds financed by bank credit expansion.In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings fromconfiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value. If there were,the government would have to make its holding illegal, as was done in the caseof gold.[Alan Greenspan, “Gold and Economic Freedom,” CUI, 101.] There is only one institution that can arrogate to itself the power legally totrade by means of rubber checks: the government. And it is the only institutionthat can mortgage your future without your knowledge or consent: governmentsecurities (and paper money) are promissory notes on future tax receipts, i.e.,on your future production.[“Egalitarianism and Inflation,” PWNI, 156; pb 128.] The “wage-price spiral,” which is merely a consequence of inflation, is beingblamed as its cause, thus deflecting the blame from the real culprit: thegovernment. But the government’s guilt is hidden by the esoteric intricacies ofthe national budget and of international finance —which the public cannot beexpected to understand—while the disaster of nationwide strikes is directlyperceivable by everyone and gives plausibility to the public’s growingresentment of labor unions.[“The Moratorium on Brains,” ARI., 1, 3, 3.] You have heard economists say that they are puzzled by the nature of today’sproblem: they are unable to understand why inflation is accompanied byrecession—which is contrary to their Keynesian doctrines; and they have coined aridiculous name for it: “stagflation.” Their theories ignore the fact that moneycan function only so long as it represents actual goods—and that at a certainstage of inflating the money supply, the government begins to consume a nation’sinvestment capital, thus making production impossible.[“Egalitarianism and Inflation,” PWNI, 163; pb 134.]See also CAPITALISM; DEFICIT FINANCING; GOLD STANDARD; MONEY; SAVINGS. Innate Ideas. See Tabula Rasa.“Instinct.” An instinct of self-preservation is precisely what man does notpossess. An “instinct” is an unerring and automatic form of knowledge. A desireis not an instinct. A desire to live does not give you the knowledge requiredfor living. And even man’s desire to live is not automatic.... Your fear ofdeath is not a love for life and will not give you the knowledge needed to keepit. Man must obtain his knowledge and choose his actions by a process ofthinking, which nature will not force him to perform. Man has the power to actas his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of hishistory.[GS, FNI, 148; pb 121.] [Man] is born naked and unarmed, without fangs, claws, horns or “instinctual”knowledge.[“The Anti-Industrial Revolution,” NL, 136.] Man has no automatic code of survival. He has no automatic course of action, noautomatic set of values. His senses do not tell him automatically what is goodfor him or evil, what will benefit his life or endanger it, what goals he shouldpursue and what means will achieve them, what values his life depends on, whatcourse of action it requires. His own consciousness has to discover the answersto all these questions—but his consciousness will not function automatically.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS , 11; pb 19.] Since man has no automatic knowledge, he can have no automatic values; since hehas no innate ideas, he can have no innate value judgments.Man is born with an emotional mechanism, just as he is born with a cognitivemechanism; but. at birth, both are “tabula rasa.”[Ibid., 23; pb 27.]See also EMOTIONS; FREE WILL; FREUD; GOAL-DIRECTED ACTION; TABULA RASA. Integration (Mental). Consciousness, as a state of awareness, is not a passivestate, but an active process that consists of two essentials: differentiationand integration.[ITOE, 5.] Integration is a cardinal function of man’s consciousness on all the levels ofhis cognitive development. First, his brain brings order into his sensory chaosby integrating sense data into percepts; this integration is performedautomatically; it requires effort, but no conscious volition.His next step is the integration of percepts into concepts, as he learns tospeak. Thereafter, his cognitive development consists in integrating conceptsinto wider and ever wider concepts, expanding the range of his mind. This stageis fully volitional and demands an unremitting effort.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 57.] A concept is a mental integration of two or more units which are isolatedaccording to a specific characteristic(s) and united by a specificdefinition.... [In concept-formation], the uniting involved is not a mere sum,but an integration, i.e., a blending of the units into a single, new mentalentity which is used thereafter as a single unit of thought (but which can bebroken into its component units whenever required).[ITOE, 11.] [The] enemies of reason seem to know that integration is thepsycho-epistemological key to reason ... and that if reason is to be destroyed,it is man’s integrating capacity that has to be destroyed.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 77.] Integration is the essential part of understanding.[“The Comprachicos,” NL, 208.] See also CONCEPT-FORMATION; CONCEPTS; CONSCIOUSNESS; LEARNING;PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY; SENSATIONS; UNDERSTANDING. Integrity. Integrity is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake yourconsciousness, just as honesty is the recognition of the fact that you cannotfake existence—that man is an indivisible entity, an integrated unit of twoattributes: of matter and consciousness, and that he may permit no breachbetween body and mind, between action and thought, between his life and hisconvictions—that, like a judge impervious to public opinion, he may notsacrifice his convictions to the wishes of others, be it the whole of mankindshouting pleas or threats against him—that courage and confidence are practicalnecessities, that courage is the practical form of being true to existence, ofbeing true to truth, and confidence is the practical form of being true to one’sown consciousness.[GS, FNI, 157; pb 128.] The virtue involved in helping those one loves is not “selflessness” or“sacrifice,” but integrity. Integrity is loyalty to one’s convictions andvalues; it is the policy of acting in accordance with one’s values, ofexpressing, upholding and translating them into practical reality. If a manprofesses to love a woman, yet his actions are indifferent, inimical or damagingto her, it is his lack of integrity that makes him immoral.[“The Ethics of Emergencies,” VOS, 51 ; pb 46.] Integrity does not consist of loyalty to one’s subjective whims, but of loyaltyto rational principles.[“Doesn’t Life Require Compromise?” VOS, 87; pb 69.]See also COMPROMISE; HONESTY; RATIONALITY; SUBJECTIVISM; SACRIFICE; VIRTUE;WHIMS/WHIM-WORSHIP. Intellectuals. The professional intellectual is the field agent of the armywhose commander-in-chief is the philosopher. The intellectual carries theapplication of philosophical principles to every field of human endeavor. Hesets a society’s course by transmitting ideas from the “ivory tower” of thephilosopher to the university professor—to the writer—to the artist—to thenewspaperman—to the politician—to the movie maker—to the night-club singer—tothe man in the street. The intellectual’s specific professions are in the fieldof the sciences that study man, the so-called “humanities,” but for that veryreason his influence extends to all other professions. Those who deal with thesciences studying nature have to rely on the intellectual for philosophicalguidance and information: for moral values, for social theories, for politicalpremises, for psychological tenets and, above all, for the principles ofepistemology, that crucial branch of philosophy which studies man’s means ofknowledge and makes all other sciences possible. The intellectual is the eyes,ears and voice of a free society: it is his job to observe the events of theworld, to evaluate their meaning and to inform the men in all the other fields.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 25: pb 27.] [The intellectuals] are a group that holds a unique prerogative: the potentialof being either the most productive or the most parasitical of all socialgroups.The intellectuals serve as guides, as trend-setters, as the transmission beltsor middlemen between philosophy and the culture. If they adopt a philosophy ofreason—if their goal is the development of man’s rational faculty and thepursuit of knowledge—they are a society’s most productive and most powerfulgroup, because their work provides the base and the integration of all otherhuman activities. If the intellectuals are dominated by a philosophy ofirrationalism, they become a society’s unemployed and unemployable.From the early nineteenth century on, American intellectuals—with very rareexceptions—were the humbly obedient followers of European philosophy, which hadentered its age of decadence. Accepting its fundamentals, they were unable todeal with or even to grasp the nature of this country.[“A Preview,” ARL, 1, 24, 1.] Historically, the professional intellectual is a very recent phenomenon : hedates only from the industrial revolution. There are no professionalintellectuals in primitive, savage societies, there are only witch doctors.There were no professional intellectuals in the Middle Ages, there were onlymonks in monasteries. In the post-Renaissance era, prior to the birth ofcapitalism, the men of the intellect—the philosophers, the teachers, thewriters, the early scientists—were men without a profession, that is: without asocially recognized position, without a market, without a means of earning alivelihood. Intellectual pursuits had to depend on the accident of inheritedwealth or on the favor and financial support of some wealthy protector. Andwealth was not earned on an open market, either; wealth was acquired byconquest, by force, by political power, or by the favor of those who heldpolitical power. Tradesmen were more vulnerably and precariously dependent onfavor than the intellectuals.The professional businessman and the professional intellectual came intoexistence together, as brothers born of the industrial revolution. Both are thesons of capitalism—and if they perish. they will perish together. The tragicirony will be that they will have destroyed each other; and the major share ofthe guilt will belong to the intellectual.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 6; pb 12.]See also BUSINESSMEN; CULTURE; HISTORY; PHILOSOPHY. Intelligence. Intelligence is the ability to deal with a broad range ofabstractions. Whatever a child’s natural endowment, the use of intelligence isan acquired skill. It has to be acquired by a child’s own effort and automatizedby his own mind, but adults can help or hinder him in this crucial process.[“The Comprachicos,” NL. 195.] [Man] survives by means of man-made products, and ... the source of man-madeproducts is man’s intelligence. Intelligence is the ability to grasp the factsof reality and to deal with them long-range (i.e., conceptually). On the axiomof the primacy of existence, intelligence is man’s most precious attribute. Butit has no place in a society ruled by the primacy of consciousness: it is such asociety’s deadliest enemy.Today, intelligence is neither recognized nor rewarded, but is beingsystematically extinguished in a growing flood of brazenly flauntedirrationality.[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWN1, 40; pb 32.] Intelligence is not an exclusive monopoly of genius; it is an attribute of allmen, and the differences are only a matter of degree. If conditions of existenceare destructive to genius, they are destructive to every man, each in proportionto his intelligence. If genius is penalized, so is the faculty of intelligencein every other man. There is only this difference: the average man does notpossess the genius’s power of self-confident resistance, and will break muchfaster; he will give up his mind, in hopeless bewilderment, under the firsttouch of pressure.[“Requiem for Man,” CUI, 306.]See also ABSTRACTIONS and CONCRETES; AUTOMATIZATION; CONCEPTS; INTEGRATION(MENTAL); PRIMACY of EXISTENCE vs. PRIMACY of CONSCIOUSNESS; REASON;UNDERSTANDING. Interest (on loans). If you have wondered how one can start producing, whennature requires time paid in advance, this is the beneficent process thatenables men to do it: a successful man lends his goods to a promising beginner(or to any reputable producer)—in exchange for the payment of interest. Thepayment is for the risk he is taking: nature does not guarantee man’s success,neither on a farm nor in a factory. If the venture fails, it means that thegoods have been consumed without a productive return, so the investor loses hismoney; if the venture succeeds, the producer pays the interest out of the newgoods, the profits, which the investment enabled him to make.[“Egalitarianism and Inflation,” PWNI, 159; pb 131.]See also CREDIT; INVESTMENT; MONEY; SAVINGS. Interventionism (economic). A “mixed economy” is a society in the process ofcommitting suicide.If a nation cannot survive half-slave, half-free, consider the condition of anation in which every social group becomes both the slave and the enslaver ofevery other group. Ask yourself how long such a condition can last and what isits inevitable outcome.When government controls are introduced into a free economy, they createeconomic dislocations, hardships, and problems which, if the controls are notrepealed, necessitate still further controls, which necessitate still furthercontrols, etc. Thus a chain reaction is set up: the victimized groups seekredress by imposing controls on the profiteering groups, who retaliate in thesame manner, on an ever widening scale. [“Statism Is the Only Victor in Cold Civil War,” Los Angeles Times, July 22,1962.] Every government interference in the economy consists of giving an unearnedbenefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By whatcriterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of thevictim’s gang.[“The New Fascism: Rule by Consensus,” CUI, 205.] If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist,a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men toothers, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guidedin practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of moneytaken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes downultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrarypower to some government officials.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, butthat it cannot be used honestly.[“The Pull Peddlers,” CUI, 170.] See also CAPITALISM; FREE MARKET; GOVERNMENT; LOBBYING; MIXED ECONOMY; “PUBLICINTEREST,” the; WELFARE STATE. Intrinsic Theory of Values. There are, in essence, three schools of thought onthe nature of the good: the intrinsic, the subjective, and the objective. Theintrinsic theory holds that the good is inherent in certain things or actions assuch, regardless of their context and consequences, regardless of any benefit orinjury they may cause to the actors and subjects involved. It is a theory thatdivorces the concept of “good” from beneficiaries, and the concept of “value”from valuer and purpose —claiming that the good is good in, by, and of itself.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 21.] The intrinsic theory holds that the good resides in some sort of reality,independent of man’s consciousness.[Ibid., 22.]If a man believes that the good is intrinsic in certain actions, he will nothesitate to force others to perform them. If he believes that the human benefitor injury caused by such actions is of no significance, he will regard a sea ofblood as of no significance. If he believes that the beneficiaries of suchactions are irrelevant (or interchangeable), he will regard wholesale slaughteras his moral duty in the service of a “higher” good. It is the intrinsic theoryof values that produces a Robespierre, a Lenin, a Stalin, or a Hitler. It is notan accident that Eichmann was a Kantian.[Ibid.]See also GOOD, the; MORALITY; MYSTICAL ETHICS; OBJECTIVE THEORY OF VALUES;OBJECTIVITY; PHYSICAL FORCE; SOCIAL THEORY OF ETHICS; SUBJECTIVISM. Introspection. Extrospection is a process of cognition directed outward—aprocess of apprehending some existent(s) of the external world. Introspection isa process of cognition directed inward—a process of apprehending one’s ownpsychological actions in regard to some existent(s) of the external world, suchactions as thinking, feeling, reminiscing, etc. It is only in relation to theexternal world that the various actions of a consciousness can be experienced,grasped, defined or communicated.[ITOE, 37.] A major source of men’s earned guilt in regard to philosophy—as well as inregard to their own minds and lives—is failure of introspection. Specifically,it is the failure to identify the nature and causes of their emotions.An emotion as such tells you nothing about reality, beyond the fact thatsomething makes you feel something. Without a ruthlessly honest commitment tointrospection—to the conceptual identification of your inner states—you will notdiscover what you feel, what arouses the feeling, and whether your feeling is anappropriate response to the facts of reality, or a mistaken response, or avicious illusion produced by years of self-deception. The men who scorn or dreadintrospection take their inner states for granted, as an irreducible andirresistible primary, and let their emotions determine their actions. This meansthat they choose to act without knowing the context (reality), the causes(motives), and the consequences (goals) of their actions.The field of extrospection is based on two cardinal questions: “What do I know?”and “How do I know it?” In the field of introspection, the two guiding questionsare: “What do I feel?” and “Why do I feel it?”[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 20; pb 17.]In regard to one’s own feelings, only a rigorously conscientious habit ofintrospection can enable one to be certain of the nature and causes of one’semotional responses.[“The Age of Envy,” NL, 154.] The formation of introspective concepts follows the same principles as theformation of extrospective concepts. A concept pertaining to consciousness is amental integration of two or more instances of a psychological processpossessing the same distinguishing characteristics, with the particular contentsand the measurements of the action’s intensity omitted—on the principle thatthese omitted measurements must exist in some quantity, but may exist in anyquantity (i.e., a given psychological process must possess some content and somedegree of intensity, but may possess any content or degree of the appropriatecategory).[ITOE, 40.] See also BEHAVIORISM; CONCEPTS; CONSCIOUSNESS; EMOTIONS; PSYCHOLOGY;RATIONALIZATION; VALUES. Invalid Concepts. There are such things as invalid concepts, i.e., words thatrepresent attempts to integrate errors, contradictions or false propositions,such as concepts originating in mysticism—or words without specific definitions,without referents, which can mean anything to anyone, such as modern“anti-concepts.” Invalid concepts appear occasionally in men’s languages, butare usually—though not necessarily—short-lived, since they lead to cognitivedead-ends. An invalid concept invalidates every proposition or process ofthought in which it is used as a cognitive assertion.[ITOE, 65.] No concept man forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction intothe total sum of his knowledge.[GS, FNI, 154; pb 126.]See also “ANTI-CONCEPTS”; CONCEPTS; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); MYSTICISM; “STOLENCONCEPT,” FALLACY of. Investment. If a man does not consume his goods at once, but saves them for thefuture, whether he wants to enlarge his production or to live on his savings(which he holds in the form of money)—in either case, he is counting on the factthat he will be able to exchange his money for the things he needs, when and ashe needs them. This means that he is relying on a continuous process ofproduction—which requires an uninterrupted flow of goods saved to fuel furtherand further production. This How is “investment capital,” the stock seed ofindustry. When a rich man lends money to others, what he lends to them is thegoods which he has not consumed.This is the meaning of the concept “investment.” If you have wondered how onecan start producing, when nature requires time paid in advance, this is thebeneficent process that enables men to do it: a successful man lends his goodsto a promising beginner (or to any reputable producer)—in exchange for thepayment of interest. The payment is for the risk he is taking: nature does notguarantee man’s success, neither on a farm nor in a factory. If the venturefails, it means that the goods have been consumed without a productive return,so the investor loses his money; if the venture succeeds, the producer pays theinterest out of the new goods, the profits, which the investment enabled him tomake.Observe, and bear in mind above all else, that this process applies only tofinancing the needs of production, not of consumption—and that its success restson the investor’s judgment of men’s productive ability, not on his compassionfor their feelings, hopes or dreams.[“Egalitarianism and Inflation,” PWNI, 159; pb 131.]See also CONSUMPTION; CREDIT; PRODUCTION; SAVINGS. Irrationalism. Reason is the faculty that identifies, in conceptual terms, thematerial provided by man’s senses. “Irrationalism” is the doctrine that reasonis not a valid means of knowledge or a proper guide to action.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 41 ; pb 47.]See also IRRATIONALITY; MYSTICISM; REASON; SKEPTICISM. Irrationality. Man’s basic vice, the source of all his evils, is the act ofunfocusing his mind, the suspension of his consciousness, which is notblindness, but the refusal to see, not ignorance, but the refusal to know.Irrationality is the rejection of man’s means of survival and, therefore, acommitment to a course of blind destruction; that which is anti-mind, isanti-life.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 20; pb 25.] To the extent to which a man is rational, life is the premise directing hisactions. To the extent to which he is irrational, the premise directing hisactions is death.[GS, FNl, 156; pb 127.]The irrational is the impossible; it is that which contradicts the facts ofreality; facts cannot be altered by a wish, but they can destroy the wisher.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 24; pb 28.] Irrationality is a state of default, the state of an unachieved human stature.When men do not choose to reach the conceptual level, their consciousness has norecourse but to its automatic, perceptual, semi-animal functions.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 19; pb 21.] See also CONTRADICTIONS; EMOTIONS; EVASION; EVIL; FOCUS; RATIONALITY; REASON;WHIMS/WHIM-WORSHIP. Irreducible Primaries. An irreducible primary is a fact which cannot be analyzed(i.e., broken into components) or derived from antecedent facts.[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 15; pb 13.] See also AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS; AXIOMS; COROLLARIES; HIERARCHY of KNOWLEDGE;OSTENSIVE DEFINITION; SELF-EVIDENT. “Is”-“Ought” Dichotomy. It is only an ultimate goal, and end in itself, thatmakes the existence of values possible. Metaphysically, life is the onlyphenomenon that is an end in itself: a value gained and kept by a constantprocess of action. Epistemologically, the concept of “value” is geneticallydependent upon and derived from the antecedent concept of “life.” To speak of“value” as apart from “life” is worse than a contradiction in terms. “It is onlythe concept of ‘Life’ that makes the concept of ‘Value’ possible.”In answer to those philosophers who claim that no relation can be establishedbetween ultimate ends or values and the facts of reality, let me stress that thefact that living entities exist and function necessitates the existence ofvalues and of an ultimate value which for any given living entity is its ownlife. Thus the validation of value judgments is to be achieved by reference tothe facts of reality. The fact that a living entity is, determines what it oughtto do. So much for the issue of the relation between “is” and “ought.”[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 7; pb 17.] See also GOAL-DIRECTED ACTION; GOOD, the; LIFE; MORALITY; STANDARD of VALUE;ULTIMATE VALUE; VALUES.“Isolationism.” A large-scale instance [of political smear-tactics], in the1930’s, was the introduction of the word “isolationism” into our politicalvocabulary. It was a derogatory term, suggesting something evil, and it had noclear, explicit definition. It was used to convey two meanings: one alleged, theother real—and to damn both.The alleged meaning was defined approximately like this: “Isolationism is theattitude of a person who is interested only in his own country and is notconcerned with the rest of the world.” The real meaning was: “Patriotism andnational self-interest.”What, exactly, is “concern with the rest of the world”? Since nobody did orcould maintain the position that the state of the world is of no concern to thiscountry, the term “isolationism” was a straw man used to misrepresent theposition of those who were concerned with this country’s interests. The conceptof patriotism was replaced by the term “isolationism” and vanished from publicdiscussion.The number of distinguished patriotic leaders smeared, silenced, and eliminatedby that tag would be hard to compute. Then, by a gradual, imperceptible process,the real purpose of the tag took over: the concept of “concern” was switchedinto “selfless concern.” The ultimate result was a view of foreign policy whichis wrecking the United States to this day: the suicidal view that our foreignpolicy must be guided, not by considerations of national self-interest, but byconcern for the interests and welfare of the world, that is, of all countriesexcept our own.[“ ‘Extremism,’ or The Art of Smearing,” CUI, 175.] Observe the double-standard switch of the anti-concept of “isolationism.” Thesame intellectual groups (and even some of the same aging individuals) whocoined that anti-concept in World War II—and used it to denounce any patrioticopponent of America’s self-immolation—the same groups who screamed that it wasour duty to save the world (when the enemy was Germany or Italy or fascism), arenow rabid isolationists who denounce any U.S. concern with countries fightingfor freedom, when the enemy is communism and Soviet Russia.[“The Lessons of Vietnam,” ARL, III, 24, 4.]See also “ANTI-CONCEPTS”; COMMUNISM; FOREIGN POLlCY; SOVIET RUSSIA."},{"pageContent":"JJudgment. See Moral Judgment. Justice. Justice is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake thecharacter of men as you cannot fake the character of nature, that you must judgeall men as conscientiously as you judge inanimate objects, with the same respectfor truth, with the same incorruptible vision, by as pure and as rational aprocess of identification—that every man must be judged for what he is andtreated accordingly, that just as you do not pay a higher price for a rustychunk of scrap than for a piece of shining metal, so you do not value a rotterabove a hero—that your moral appraisal is the coin paying men for their virtuesor vices, and this payment demands of you as scrupulous an honor as you bring tofinancial transactions—that to withhold your contempt from men’s vices is an actof moral counterfeiting, and to withhold your admiration from their virtues isan act of moral embezzlement—that to place any other concern higher than justiceis to devaluate your moral currency and defraud the good in favor of the evil,since only the good can lose by a default of justice and only the evil canprofit—and that the bottom of the pit at the end of that road, the act of moralbankruptcy, is to punish men for their virtues and reward them for their vices,that that is the collapse to full depravity, the Black Mass of the worship ofdeath, the dedication of your consciousness to the destruction of existence.[GS, FNI, 158; pb 129.] What fact of reality gave rise to the concept “justice”? The fact that man mustdraw conclusions about the things, people and events around him, i.e., mustjudge and evaluate them. Is his judgment automatically right? No. What causeshis judgment to be wrong? The lack of sufficient evidence, or his evasion of theevidence, or his inclusion of considerations other than the facts of the case.How, then, is he to arrive at the right judgment? By basing it exclusively onthe factual evidence and by considering all the relevant evidence available. Butisn’t this a description of “objectivity”? Yes, “objective judgment” is one ofthe wider categories to which the concept “justice” belongs. What distinguishes“justice” from other instances of objective judgment? When one evaluates thenature or actions of inanimate objects, the criterion of judgment is determinedby the particular purpose for which one evaluates them. But how does onedetermine a criterion for evaluating the character and actions of men, in viewof the fact that men possess the faculty of volition? What science can providean objective criterion of evaluation in regard to volitional matters? Ethics.Now, do I need a concept to designate the act of judging a man’s characterand/or actions exclusively on the basis of all the factual evidence available,and of evaluating it by means of an objective moral criterion? Yes. That conceptis “justice.”[ITOE, 67.] It is not justice or equal treatment that you grant to men when you abstainequally from praising men’s virtues and from condemning men’s vices. When yourimpartial attitude declares, in effect, that neither the good nor the evil mayexpect anything from you—whom do you betray and whom do you encourage?[“How Does One Lead a Rational Life in an Irrational Society,” VOS, 89; pb 71.] Since men are born tabula rasa, both cognitively and morally, a rational manregards strangers as innocent until proved guilty, and grants them that initialgood will in the name of their human potential. After that, he judges themaccording to the moral character they have actualized. If he finds them guiltyof major evils, his good will is replaced by contempt and moral condemnation.(If one values human life, one cannot value its destroyers.) If he finds them tobe virtuous, he grants them personal, individual value and appreciation, inproportion to their virtues. [“The Ethics of Emergencies,” VOS, 52: pb 47.] The new “theory of justice” [of John Rawls] demands that men counteract the“injustice” of nature by instituting the most obscenely unthinkable injusticeamong men: deprive “those favored by nature” (i.e., the talented, theintelligent, the creative) of the right to the rewards they produce (i.e., theright to life)—and grant to the incompetent, the stupid, the slothful a right tothe effortless enjoyment of the rewards they could not produce, could notimagine, and would not know what to do with.[“An Untitled Letter,” PWNI, 132; pb 110.]See also CAPITALISM; COMPASSION; EGALITARIANISM; HONESTY; MERCY; MORAL JUDGMENT;MORALITY; OBJECTIVITY; RATIONALITY; TRADER PRINCIPLE; VIRTUE."},{"pageContent":"KKant, Immanuel. On every fundamental issue, Kant’s philosophy is the exactopposite of Objectivism.[“Brief Summary,” TO, Sept. 1971, 4.] Metaphysics and EpistemologyThe man who ... closed the door of philosophy to reason, was Immanuel Kant....Kant’s expressly stated purpose was to save the morality of self-abnegation andself-sacrifice. He knew that it could not survive without a mystic base—and whatit had to be saved from was reason.Attila’s share of Kant’s universe includes this earth, physical reality, man’ssenses, perceptions, reason and science, all of it labeled the “phenomenal”world. The Witch Doctor’s share is another, “higher,” reality, labeled the“noumenal” world, and a special manifestation, labeled the “categoricalimperative,” which dictates to man the rules of morality and which makes itselfknown by means of a feeling, as a special sense of duty.The “phenomenal” world, said Kant, is not real: reality, as perceived by man’smind, is a distortion. The distorting mechanism is man’s conceptual faculty:man’s basic concepts (such as time, space, existence) are not derived fromexperience or reality, but come from an automatic system of filters in hisconsciousness (labeled “categories” and “forms of perception”) which imposetheir own design on his perception of the external world and make him incapableof perceiving it in any manner other than the one in which he does perceive it.This proves, said Kant, that man’s concepts are only a delusion, but acollective delusion which no one has the power to escape. Thus reason andscience are “limited,” said Kant; they are valid only so long as they deal withthis world, with a permanent, pre-determined collective delusion (and thus thecriterion of reason’s validity was switched from the objective to thecollective), but they are impotent to deal with the fundamental, metaphysicalissues of existence, which belong to the “noumenal” world. The “noumenal” worldis unknowable; it is the world of “real” reality, “superior” truth and “thingsin themselves” or “things as they are”—which means: things as they are notperceived by man.Even apart from the fact that Kant’s theory of the “categories” as the source ofman’s concepts was a preposterous invention, his argument amounted to anegation, not only of man’s consciousness, but of any consciousness, ofconsciousness as such. His argument, in essence, ran as follows: man is limitedto a consciousness of a specific nature, which perceives by specific means andno others, therefore, his consciousness is not valid; man is blind, because hehas eyes—deaf, because he has ears—deluded, because he has a mind—and the thingshe perceives do not exist, because he perceives them.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 31; pb 30.] The motive of all the attacks on man’s rational faculty—from any quarter, in anyof the endless variations, under the verbal dust of all the murky volumes—is asingle, hidden premise: the desire to exempt consciousness from the law ofidentity. The hallmark of a mystic is the savagely stubborn refusal to acceptthe fact that consciousness, like any other existent, possesses identity, thatit is a faculty of a specific nature, functioning through specific means. Whilethe advance of civilization has been eliminating one area of magic afteranother, the last stand of the believers in the miraculous consists of theirfrantic attempts to regard identity as the disqualifying element ofconsciousness.The implicit, but unadmitted premise of the neo-mystics of modern philosophy, isthe notion that only an ineffable consciousness can acquire a valid knowledge ofreality, that “true” knowledge has to be causeless, i.e., acquired without anymeans of cognition.The entire apparatus of Kant’s system, like a hippopotamus engaged inbelly-dancing, goes through its gyrations while resting on a single point: thatman’s knowledge is not valid because his consciousness possesses identity....This is a negation, not only of man’s consciousness, but of any consciousness,of consciousness as such, whether man’s, insect’s or God’s. (If one supposed theexistence of God, the negation would still apply: either God perceives throughno means whatever, in which case he possesses no identity—or he perceives bysome divine means and no others, in which case his perception is not valid.) AsBerkeley negated existence by claiming that “to be, is to be perceived,” so Kantnegates consciousness by implying that to be perceived, is not to be....From primordial mysticism to this, its climax, the attack on man’s consciousnessand particularly on his conceptual faculty has rested on the unchallengedpremise that any knowledge acquired by a process of consciousness is necessarilysubjective and cannot correspond to the facts of reality, since it is “processedknowledge.”Make no mistake about the actual meaning of that premise: it is a revolt, notonly against being conscious, but against being alive—since in fact, in reality,on earth, every aspect of being alive involves a process of self-sustaining andself-generated action. (This is an example of the fact that the revolt againstidentity is a revolt against existence. “The desire not to be anything, is thedesire not to be.” Atlas Shrugged.)All knowledge is processed knowledge—whether on the sensory. perceptual orconceptual level. An “unprocessed” knowledge would be a knowledge acquiredwithout means of cognition. Consciousness ... is not a passive state, but anactive process. And more: the satisfaction of every need of a living organismrequires an act of processing by that organism, be it the need of air, of foodor of knowledge.[ITOE. 106.] A “straw man” is an odd metaphor to apply to such an enormous, cumbersome,ponderous construction as Kant’s system of epistemology. Nevertheless, a strawman is what it was—and the doubts, the uncertainty, the skepticism thatfollowed, skepticism about man’s ability ever to know anything, were not, infact, applicable to human conscionsness, because it was not a humanconsciousness that Kant’s robot represented. But philosophers accepted it assuch. And while they cried that reason had been invalidated, they did not noticethat reason had been pushed off the philosophical scene altogether and that thefaculty they were arguing about was not reason.No, Kant did not destroy reason; he merely did as thorough a job of undercuttingas anyone could ever do.If you trace the roots of all our current philosophies—such as pragmatism,logical positivism, and all the rest of the neo-mystics who announce happilythat you cannot prove that you exist—you will find that they all grew out ofKant.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the ‘Modern World,” PWNI, 77; pb 64.]One of Kant’s major goals was to save religion (including the essence ofreligious morality) from the onslaughts of science. His system represents amassive effort to raise the principles of Platonism, in a somewhat altered form,once again to a position of commanding authority over Western culture. [Leonard Peikoff, OP, 23; pb 31.] Plato was more than a Platonist; despite his mysticism, he was also a paganGreek. As such he exhibited a certain authentic respect for reason, a respectwhich was implicit in Greek philosophy no matter how explicitly irrational itbecame. The Kantian mysticism, however, suffers from no such pagan restraints.It flows forth triumphantly, sweeping the prostrate human mind before it. Sinceman can never escape the distorting agents inherent in the structure of hisconsciousness, says Kant, “things in themselves” are in principle unknowable.Reason is impotent to discover anything about reality; if it tries, it can onlybog down in impenetrable contradictions. Logic is merely a subjective humandevice, devoid of reference to or basis in reality. Science, while useful as ameans of ordering the data of the world of appearances, is limited to describinga surface world of man’s own creation and says nothing about things as theyreally are.Must men then resign themselves to a total skepticism? No, says Kant, there isone means of piercing the barrier between man and existence. Since reason,logic, and science are denied access to reality, the door is now open for men toapproach reality by a different, nonrational method. The door is now open tofaith. Taking their cue from their needs, men can properly believe (forinstance, in God and in an afterlife), even though they cannot prove the truthof their beliefs.... “I have,” writes Kant, “therefore found it necessary todeny knowledge, in order to make room for faith.”[Ibid., 24; pb 32.] There are two different kinds of subjectivism, distinguished by their answers tothe question: whose consciousness creates reality? Kant rejected the older ofthese two, which was the view that each man’s feelings create a private universefor him. Instead, Kant ushered in the era of social subjectivism—the view thatit is not the consciousness of individuals, but of groups, that creates reality.In Kant’s system, mankind as a whole is the decisive group; what creates thephenomenal world is not the idiosyncrasies of particular individuals, but themental structure common to all men.Later philosophers accepted Kant’s fundamental approach, but carried it a stepfurther. If, many claimed, the mind’s structure is a brute given, which cannotbe explained—as Kant had said—then there is no reason why all men should havethe same mental structure. There is no reason why mankind should not besplintered into competing groups, each defined by its own distinctive type ofconsciousness, each vying with the others to capture and control reality.The first world movement thus to pluralize the Kantian position was Marxism,which propounded a social subjectivism in terms of competing economic classes.On this issue, as on many others, the Nazis follow the Marxists, but substituterace for class.[Ibid., 59; pb 63.] A man’s self, [Kant] maintains, like everything else, is a part of reality —it,too, is something in itself—and if reality is unknowable, then so is a man’sself. A man is able, Kant concludes, to know only his phenomenal ego, his selfas it appears to him (in introspection); he cannot know his noumenal ego, his“ego as it is in itself.”Man is, therefore, a creature in metaphysical conflict. He is so to speak ametaphysical biped, with one (unreal) foot in the phenomenal world and one(unknowable) foot in the noumenal world.[Ibid., 75; pb 77.] Ethics As to Kant’s version of morality, it was appropriate to the kind of zombies thatwould inhabit that kind of [Kantian] universe: it consisted of total, abjectselflessness. An action is moral, said Kant, only if one has no desire toperform it, but performs it out of a sense of duty and derives no benefit fromit of any sort, neither material nor spiritual; a benefit destroys the moralvalue of an action. (Thus, if one has no desire to be evil, one cannot be good;if one has, one can.)Those who accept any part of Kant’s philosophy—metaphysical, epistemological ormoral—deserve it.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 33; pb 32.] The arch-advocate of “duty” is Immanuel Kant; he went so much farther than othertheorists that they seem innocently benevolent by comparison. “Duty,” he holds,is the only standard of virtue; but virtue is not its own reward: if a reward isinvolved, it is no longer virtue. The only moral motivation, he holds, isdevotion to duty for duty’s sake; only an action motivated exclusively by suchdevotion is a moral action (i.e., an action performed without any concern for“inclination” [desire] or self-interest).“It is a duty to preserve one’s life, and moreover everyone has a directinclination to do so. But for that reason the often anxious care which most mentake of it has no intrinsic worth, and the maxim of doing so has no moralimport. They preserve their lives according to duty, but not from duty. But ifadversities and hopeless sorrow completely take away the relish for life, if anunfortunate man, strong in soul, is indignant rather than despondent or dejectedover his fate and wishes for death, and yet preserves his life without loving itand from neither inclination nor fear but from duty—then his maxim has a moralimport” (Immanuel Kant, Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals, ed. R. P.Wolff, New York, Bobbs-Merrill, 1969, pp. 16-17).[“Causality Versus Duty,” PWNI, 115; pb 96.] His view of morality is propagated by men who have never heard of him—he merelygave them a formal, academic status. A Kantian sense of “duty” is inculcated byparents whenever they declare that a child must do something because he must. Achild brought up under the constant battering of causeless, arbitrary,contradictory, inexplicable “musts” loses (or never acquires) the ability tograsp the distinction between realistic necessity and human whims—and spends hislife abjectly, dutifully obeying the second and defying the first. In the fullmeaning of the term, he grows up without a clear grasp of reality.[Ibid., 118; pb 98.] In a deontological [duty-centered] theory, all personal desires are banishedfrom the realm of morality; a personal desire has no moral significance, be it adesire to create or a desire to kill. For example, if a man is not supportinghis life from duty, such a morality makes no distinction between supporting itby honest labor or by robbery. If a man wants to be honest, he deserves no moralcredit; as Kant would put it, such honesty is “praiseworthy,” but without “moralimport.” Only a vicious represser, who feels a profound desire to lie, cheat andsteal, but forces himself to act honestly for the sake of “duty,” would receivea recognition of moral worth from Kant and his ilk.This is the sort of theory that gives morality a bad name.The widespread fear and/or resentment of morality—the feeling that morality isan enemy, a musty realm of suffering and senseless boredom —is not the productof mystic, ascetic or Christian codes as such, but a monument to the ugliestrepository of hatred for life, man and reason: the soul of Immanuel Kant.[Ibid., 117; pb 97.] In theory, Kant states, a man deserves moral credit for an action done fromduty, even if his inclinations also favor it—but only insofar as the latter areincidental and play no role in his motivation. But in practice, Kant maintains,whenever the two coincide no one can know that he has escaped the influence ofinclination. For all practical purposes, therefore, a moral man must have noprivate stake in the outcome of his actions, no personal motive, no expectationof profit or gain of any kind.Even then, however, he cannot be sure that no fragment of desire is “secretly”moving him. The far clearer case, the one case in which a man can at least comeclose to knowing that he is moral, occurs when the man’s desires clash with hisduty and he acts in defiance of his desires.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 73; pb 75.] Kant is the first philosopher of self-sacrifice to advance this ethics as amatter of philosophic principle, explicit, self-conscious,uncompromised-essentially uncontradicted by any remnants of the Greek, pro-selfviewpoint.Thus, although he believed that the dutiful man would be rewarded with happinessafter death (and that this is proper), Kant holds that the man who is motivatedby such a consideration is nonmoral (since he is still acting from inclination,albeit a supernaturally oriented one). Nor will Kant permit the dutiful man tobe motivated even by the desire to feel a sense of moral self-approval.The main line of pre-Kantian moralists had urged man to perform certain actionsin order to reach a goal of some kind. They had urged man to love the objectwhich is the good (however it was conceived) and strive to gain it, even if mosttransferred the quest to the next life. They had asked man to practice a code ofvirtues as a means to the attainment of values. Kant dissociates virtue from thepursuit of any goal. He dissociates it from man’s love of or even interest inany object. Which means: he dissociates morality from values, any values, valuesas such.[Ibid., 76; pb 78.] It is not inner peace that Kant holds out to man, not otherworldly serenity orethereal tranquillity, but war, a bloody, unremitting war against passionate,indomitable temptation. It is the lot of the moral man to struggle againstundutiful feelings inherent in his nature, and the more intensely he feels andthe more desperately he struggles, the greater his claim to virtue. It is thelot of the moral man to burn with desire and then, on principle—the principle ofduty—to thwart it. The hallmark of the moral man is to suffer.[Ibid., 80; pb 82.] If men lived the sort of life Kant demands, who or what would gain from it?Nothing and no one. The concept of “gain” has been expunged from morality. ForKant, it is the dutiful sacrifice as such that constitutes a man’s claim tovirtue; the welfare of any recipient is morally incidental. Virtue, for Kant, isnot the service of an interest—neither of the self nor of God nor of others. (Aman can claim moral credit for service to others in this view, not because theybenefit, but only insofar as he loses.)Here is the essence and climax of the ethics of self-sacrifice, finally, aftertwo thousand years, come to full, philosophic expression in the Western world:your interests—of whatever kind, including the interest in being moral—are amark of moral imperfection because they are interests. Your desires, regardlessof their content, deserve no respect because they are desires. Do your duty,which is yours because you have desires, and which is sublime because,unadulterated by the stigma of any gain, it shines forth unsullied, in loss,pain, conflict, torture. Sacrifice the thing you want, without beneficiaries,supernatural or social; sacrifice your values, your self-interest, yourhappiness, your self, because they are your values, your self-interest, yourhappiness, your self; sacrifice them to morality, i.e., to the noumenaldimension, i.e., to nothing knowable or conceivable to man, i.e., as far as manliving on this earth is concerned, to nothing.The moral commandment is: thou shalt sacrifice, sacrifice everything, sacrificefor the sake of sacrifice, as an end in itself.[Ibid., 82; pb 83.] Sacrifice is the surrender of that which you value in favor of that which youdon’t.... It is not a sacrifice to renounce the unwanted. It is not a sacrificeto give your life to others, if death is your personal desire. To achieve thevirtue of sacrifice, you must want to live, you must love it, you must burn withpassion for this earth and for all the splendor it can give you—you must feelthe twist of every knife as it slashes your desires away from your reach anddrains your love out of your body. It is not mere death that the morality ofsacrifice holds out to you as an ideal, but death by slow torture.[G5, FNI, 172; pb 140.] You may also find it hard to believe that anyone could advocate the things Kantis advocating. If you doubt it, I suggest that you look up the references givenand read the original works. Do not seek to escape the subject by thinking: “Oh,Kant didn’t mean it!” He did....Kant is the most evil man in mankind’s history.[“Brief Summary,” TO, Sept. 1971, 4.] Psychological TechniquesKant originated the technique required to sell irrational notions to the men ofa skeptical, cynical age who have formally rejected mysticism without graspingthe rudiments of rationality. The technique is as follows: if you want topropagate an outrageously evil idea (based on traditionally accepted doctrines),your conclusion must be brazenly clear, but your proof unintelligible. Yourproof must be so tangled a mess that it will paralyze a reader’s criticalfaculty—a mess of evasions, equivocations, obfuscations, circumlocutions, nonsequiturs, endless sentences leading nowhere, irrelevant side issues, clauses,sub-clauses and sub-sub-clauses, a meticulously lengthy proving of the obvious,and big chunks of the arbitrary thrown in as self-evident, erudite references tosciences, to pseudo-sciences, to the never-to-be-sciences, to the untraceableand the unprovable—all of it resting on a zero: the absence of definitions. Ioffer in evidence the Critique of Pure Reason.[“An Untiled Letter,” PWNI, 141; pb 116.] If “genius” denotes extraordinary ability, then Kant may be called a genius inhis capacity to sense, play on and perpetuate human fears, irrationalities and,above all, ignorance. His influence rests not on philosophical but onpsychological factors.[“Causality Versus Duty,” PWNI, 117; ph 98.] The philosophy of Kant is a systematic rationalization of every majorpsychological vice. The metaphysical inferiority of this world (as a“phenomenal” world of mere “appearances”), is a rationalization for the hatredof reality. The notion that reason is unable to perceive reality and deals onlywith “appearances,” is a rationalization for the hatred of reason; it is also arationalization for a profound kind of epistemological egalitarianism whichreduces reason to equality with the futile puttering of “idealistic” dreamers.The metaphysical superiority of the “noumenal” world, is a rationalization forthe supremacy of emotions, which are thus given the power to know the unknowableby ineffable means.The complaint that man can perceive things only through his own consciousness,not through any other kinds of consciousnesses, is a rationalization for themost profound type of second-handedness ever confessed in print: it is the whineof a man tortured by perpetual concern with what others think and by inabilityto decide which others he should conform to. The wish to perceive “things inthemselves” unprocessed by any consciousness, is a rationalization for the wishto escape the effort and responsibility of cognition—by means of the automaticomniscience a whim-worshiper ascribes to his emotions. The moral imperative ofthe duty to sacrifice oneself to duty, a sacrifice without beneficiaries, is agross rationalization for the image (and soul) of an austere, ascetic monk whowinks at you with an obscenely sadistic pleasure—the pleasure of breaking man’sspirit, ambition, success, self-esteem, and enjoyment of life on earth. Etcetera. These are just some of the highlights.[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 22; pb 19.]See also ALTRUISM; CONCEPTS; DUTY“; FAITH; IDENTITY; KNOWLEDGE; LINGUISTICANALYSIS; LOGIC; LOGICAL POSITIVISM; MODERN ART; MYSTICISM; OBJECTIVITY;PRAGMATISM; PRIMACY of EXISTENCE vs. PRIMACY of CONSCIOUSNESS; RATIONALIZATION;REASON; RELIGION; SACRIFICE; SELF; SELFISHNESS; SELFLESSNESS; SUBJECTIVISM.Knowledge. “Knowledge” is ... a mental grasp of a fact(s) of reality, reachedeither by perceptual observation or by a process of reason based on perceptualobservation.[ITOE, 45.]See also CERTAINTY; EPISTEMOLOGY; LOGIC; PERCEPTION; REASON."},{"pageContent":"LLanguage. In order to be used as a single unit, the enormous sum integrated by aconcept has to be given the form of a single, specific, perceptual concrete,which will differentiate it from all other concretes and from all otherconcepts. This is the function performed by language. Language is a code ofvisual-auditory symbols that serves the psycho-epistemological function ofconverting concepts into the mental equivalent of concretes. Language is theexclusive domain and tool of concepts. Every word we use (with the exception ofproper names) is a symbol that denotes a concept, i.e., that stands for anunlimited number of concretes of a certain kind.(Proper names are used in order to identify and include particular entities in aconceptual method of cognition. Observe that even proper names, in advancedcivilizations, follow the definitional principles of genus and differentia:e.g., John Smith, with “Smith” serving as genus and “John” as differentia—or NewYork, U.S.A.)[ITOE, 11.] Concepts represent a system of mental filing and cross-filing, so complex thatthe largest electronic computer is a child’s toy by comparison. This systemserves as the context, the frame-of-reference, by means of which man grasps andclassifies (and studies further) every existent he encounters and every aspectof reality. Language is the physical (visual-audible) implementation of thissystem.Concepts and, therefore, language are primarily a tool of cognition—not ofcommunication, as is usually assumed. Communication is merely the consequence,not the cause nor the primary purpose of concept-formation—a crucialconsequence, of invaluable importance to men, but still only a consequence.Cognition precedes communication; the necessary pre-condition of communicationis that one have something to communicate. (This is true even of communicationamong animals, or of communication by grunts and growls among inarticulate men,let alone of communication by means of so complex and exacting a tool aslanguage.) The primary purpose of concepts and of language is to provide manwith a system of cognitive classification and organization, which enables him toacquire knowledge on an unlimited scale; this means: to keep order in man’s mindand enable him to think.[Ibid., 91.]The first words a child learns are words denoting visual objects, and he retainshis first concepts visually. Observe that the visual form he gives them isreduced to those essentials which distinguish the particular kind of entitiesfrom all others—for instance, the universal type of a child’s drawing of man inthe form of an oval for the torso, a circle for the head, four sticks forextremities, etc. Such drawings are a visual record of the process ofabstraction and concept-formation in a mind’s transition from the perceptuallevel to the full vocabulary of the conceptual level.There is evidence to suppose that written language originated in the form ofdrawings—as the pictographic writing of the Oriental peoples seems to indicate.With the growth of man’s knowledge and of his power of abstraction, a pictorialrepresentation of concepts could no longer be adequate to his conceptual range,and was replaced by a fully symbolic code.[Ibid., 15.] Language is a conceptual tool—a code of visual-auditory symbols that denoteconcepts. To a person who understands the function of language, it makes nodifference what sounds are chosen to name things, provided these sounds refer toclearly defined aspects of reality. But to a tribalist, language is a mysticheritage, a string of sounds handed down from his ancestors and memorized, notunderstood. To him, the importance lies in the perceptual concrete, the sound ofa word, not its meaning....The learning of another language expands one’s abstract capacity and vision.Personally, I speak four—or rather three-and-a-half—languages: English, French,Russian and the half is German, which I can read, but not speak. I found thisknowledge extremely helpful when I began writing: it gave me a wider range andchoice of concepts, it showed me four different styles of expression, it made megrasp the nature of language as such, apart from any set of concretes.(Speaking of concretes, I would say that every civilized language has its owninimitable power and beauty, but the one I love is English—the language of mychoice, not of my birth. English is the most eloquent, the most precise, themost economical and, therefore, the most powerful. English fits me best—but Iwould be able to express my identity in any Western language.)[“Global Balkanization,” pamphlet, 8.] The Miracle Worker by William Gibson ... tells the story of how Annie Sullivanbrought Helen Keller to grasp the nature of language....I suggest that you read The Miracle Worker and study its implications.... thisparticular play is an invaluable lesson in the fundamentals of a rationalepistemology.I suggest that you consider Annie Sullivan’s titanic struggle to arouse achild’s conceptual faculty by means of a single sense, the sense of touch, thenevaluate the meaning, motive and moral status of the notion that man’sconceptual faculty does not require any sensory experience.I suggest that you consider what an enormous intellectual feat Helen Keller hadto perform in order to develop a full conceptual range (including a collegeeducation, which required more in her day than it does now), then judge thosenormal people who learn their first, perceptual-level abstractions without anydifficulty and freeze on that level, and keep the higher ranges of theirconceptual development in a chaotic fog of swimming, indeterminateapproximations, playing a game of signals without referents, as Helen Keller didat first, but without her excuse. Then check on whether you respect and howcarefully you employ your priceless possession: language.And, lastly, I suggest that you try to project what would have happened if,instead of Annie Sullivan, a sadist had taken charge of Helen Keller’seducation. A sadist would spell “water” into Helen’s palm, while making hertouch water, stones, flowers and dogs interchangeably; he would teach her thatwater is called “water” today, but “milk” tomorrow; he would endeavor to conveyto her that there is no necessary connection between names and things, that thesignals in her palm are a game of arbitrary conventions and that she’d betterobey him without trying to understand.If this projection is too monstrous to hold in one’s mind for long, rememberthat this is what today’s academic philosophers are doing to the young—to mindsas confused, as plastic and almost as helpless (on the higher conceptual levels)as Helen Keller’s mind was at her start.[“Kant Versus Sullivan,” PWNI, 109; pb 90.]See also COMMUNICATION; CONCEPT-FORMATION; CONCEPTS; GRAMMAR; LINGUISTICANALYSIS; PERCEPTION; PSYCHO. EPISTEMOLOGY; REASON; WORDS. Law, Objective and Non-Objective. All laws must be objective (and objectivelyjustifiable): men must know clearly, and in advance of taking an action, whatthe law forbids them to do (and why), what constitutes a crime and what penaltythey will incur if they commit it.[“The Nature of Government,” VOS, 149; pb 110.] The retaliatory use of force requires objective rules of evidence to establishthat a crime has been committed and to prove who committed it, as well asobjective rules to define punishments and enforcement procedures. Men whoattempt to prosecute crimes, without such rules, are a lynch mob. If a societyleft the retaliatory use of force in the hands of individual citizens, it woulddegenerate into mob rule, lynch law and an endless series of bloody privatefeuds or vendettas.If physical force is to be barred from social relationships, men need aninstitution charged with the task of protecting their rights under an objectivecode of rules.This is the task of a government—of a proper government—its basic task, its onlymoral justification and the reason why men do need a government.A government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force underobjective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws.[Ibid., 147; pb 109.] When men are caught in the trap of non-objective law, when their work, futureand livelihood are at the mercy of a bureaucrat’s whim, when they have no way ofknowing what unknown “influence” will crack down on them for which unspecifiedoffense, fear becomes their basic motive, if they remain in the industry atall—and compromise, conformity, staleness, dullness, the dismal grayness of themiddle-of-the-road are all that can be expected of them. Independent thinkingdoes not submit to bureaucratic edicts, originality does not follow “publicpolicies,” integrity does not petition for a license, heroism is not fostered byfear, creative genius is not summoned forth at the point of a gun.Non-objective law is the most effective weapon of human enslavement: its victimsbecome its enforcers and enslave themselves.[“Vast Quicksands,” TON, July 1963, 25.] That which cannot be formulated into an objective law, cannot be made thesubject of legislation—not in a free country, not if we are to have “agovernment of laws and not of men.” An undefineable law is not a law, but merelya license for some men to rule others.[Ibid., 28.] It is a grave error to suppose that a dictatorship rules a nation by means ofstrict, rigid laws which are obeyed and enforced with rigorous, militaryprecision. Such a rule would be evil, but almost bearable; men could endure theharshest edicts, provided these edicts were known, specific and stable; it isnot the known that breaks men’s spirits, but the unpredictable. A dictatorshiphas to be capricious; it has to rule by means of the unexpected, theincomprehensible, the wantonly irrational; it has to deal not in death, but insudden death; a state of chronic uncertainty is what men are psychologicallyunable to bear.[“Antitrust: The Rule of Unreason,” TON. Feb. 1962, 5.] An objective law protects a country’s freedom; only a non-objective law can givea statist the chance he seeks: a chance to impose his arbitrary will—hispolicies, his decisions, his interpretations, his enforcement, his punishment orfavor—on disarmed, defenseless victims.[Ibid.. 5.] The threat of sudden destruction, of unpredictable retaliation for unnamedoffenses, is a much more potent means of enslavement than explicit dictatoriallaws. It demands more than mere obedience; it leaves men no policy save one: toplease the authorities; to please—blindly, uncritically, without standards orprinciples; to please—in any issue, matter or circumstance, for fear of anunknowable, unprovable vengeance.[Ibid., 8.] See also ANARCHISM; ANTITRUST LAWS; CONSTITUTION; CRIME; DICTATORSHIP;GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL, RIGHTS; RETALIATORY FORCE; RETROACTIVE I.AW; STATISM. Learning. Men can learn from one another, but learning requires a process ofthought on the part of every individual student. Men can cooperate in thediscovery of new knowledge, but such cooperation requires the independentexercise of his rational faculty by every individual scientist. Man is the onlyliving species that can transmit and expand his store of knowledge fromgeneration to generation; but such transmission requires a process of thought onthe part of the individual recipients.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI. 16.] All learning involves a process of automatizing, i.e., of first acquiringknowledge by fully conscious, focused attention and observation, then ofestablishing mental connections which make that knowledge automatic (instantlyavailable as a context), thus freeing man’s mind to pursue further, more complexknowledge.[ITOE, 86.] There are two different methods of learning: by memorizing and by understanding.The first belongs primarily to the perceptual level of a human consciousness,the second to the conceptual.The first is achieved by means of repetition and concrete-bound association (aprocess in which one sensory concrete leads automatically to another, with noregard to content or meaning). The best illustration of this process is a songwhich was popular some twenty years ago, called “Mairzy Doats.” Try to recallsome poem you had to memorize in grade school; you will find that you can recallit only if you recite the sounds automatically, by the “Mairzy Doats” method; ifyou focus on the meaning, the memory vanishes. This form of learning is sharedwith man by the higher animals: all animal training consists of making theanimal memorize a series of actions by repetition and association.The second method of learning—by a process of understanding—is possible only toman. To understand means to focus on the content of a given subject (as againstthe sensory—visual or auditory—form in which it is communicated), to isolate itsessentials, to establish its relationship to the previously known, and tointegrate it with the appropriate categories of other subjects. Integration isthe essential part of understanding.The predominance of memorizing is proper only in the first few years of achild’s education, while he is observing and gathering perceptual material. Fromthe time he reaches the conceptual level (i.e., from the time he learns tospeak), his education requires a progressively larger scale of understanding andprogressively smaller amounts of memorizing.[“The Comprachicos,” NL, 207.] Learning is a conceptual process; an educational method devised to ignore,by-pass and contradict the requirements of conceptual development, cannot arouseany interest in learning. The “adjusted” are bored because they are unableactively to absorb knowledge. The independent are bored because they seekknowledge, not games of “class projects” or group “discussions.” The first areunable to digest their lessons; the second are starved.[Ibid., 216.] The process of forming, integrating and using concepts is not an automatic, buta volitional process—i.e., a process which uses both new and automatizedmaterial, but which is directed volitionally. It is not an innate, but anacquired skill; it has to be learned—it is the most crucially important part oflearning—and all of man’s other capacities depend on how well or how badly helearns it.This skill does not pertain to the particular content of a man’s knowledge atany given age, but to the method by which he acquires and organizesknowledge—the method by which his mind deals with its content. The methodprograms his subconscious computer, determining how efficiently, lamely ordisastrously his cognitive processes will function.[Ibid., 193.] See also AUTOMATIZATION; CONCEPTS; EDUCATION; INTEGRATION (MENTAL);SUBCONSCIOUS; UNDERSTANDING. Leftists. See Rightists vs. Leftists. “Liberals.” The basic and crucial political issue of our age is: capitalismversus socialism, or freedom versus statism. For decades, this issue has beensilenced, suppressed, evaded, and hidden under the foggy, undefined rubber-termsof “conservatism” and “liberalism” which had lost their original meaning andcould be stretched to mean all things to all men.The goal of the “liberals”—as it emerges from the record of the past decades—wasto smuggle this country into welfare statism by means of single, concrete,specific measures, enlarging the power of the government a step at a time, neverpermitting these steps to be summed up into principles, never permitting theirdirection to be identified or the basic issue to be named. Thus statism was tocome, not by vote or by violence, but by slow rot—by a long process of evasionand epistemological corruption, leading to a fait accompli. (The goal of the“conservatives” was only to retard that process.)[“ ‘Extremism,’ or The Art of Smearing,” CUI, 178.] The most timid, frightened, conservative defenders of the status quo —of theintellectual status quo—are today’s liberals (the leaders of the conservativesnever ventured into the realm of the intellect). What they dread to discover isthe fact that the intellectual status quo they inherited is bankrupt, that theyhave no ideological base to stand on and no capacity to construct one. Broughtup on the philosophy of Pragmatism, they have been taught that principles areunprovable, impractical or non-existent—which has destroyed their ability tointegrate ideas, to deal with abstractions, and to see beyond the range of theimmediate moment. Abstractions, they claim, are “simplistic” (anotheranti-concept); myopia is sophisticated. “Don’t polarize!” and “Don’t rock theboat!” are expressions of the same kind of panic.[“Credibility and Polarization,” ARL, I, 1, 2.] In the 1930’s, the “liberals” had a program of broad social reforms and acrusading spirit, they advocated a planned society, they talked in terms ofabstract principles, they propounded theories of a predominantly socialisticnature—and most of them were touchy about the accusation that they wereenlarging the government’s power; most of them were assuring their opponentsthat government power was only a temporary means to an end—a “noble end,” theliberation of the individual from his bondage to material needs.Today, nobody talks of a planned society in the “liberal” camp; long-rangeprograms, theories, principles, abstractions, and “noble ends” are notfashionable any longer. Modern “liberals” deride any political concern with suchlarge-scale matters as an entire society or an economy as a whole; they concernthemselves with single, concrete-bound, range-of-the-moment projects anddemands, without regard to cost, context, or consequences. “Pragmatic”—not“idealistic”—is their favorite adjective when they are called upon to justifytheir “stance,” as they call it, not “stand.” They are militantly opposed topolitical philosophy; they denounce political concepts as “tags,” “labels,”“myths,” “illusions”—and resist any attempt to “label”—i.e., to identify—theirown views. They are belligerently anti-theoretical and—with a faded mantle ofintellectuality still clinging to their shoulders—they are anti-intellectual.The only remnant of their former “idealism” is a tired, cynical, ritualisticquoting of shopworn “humanitarian” slogans, when the occasion demands it.Cynicism, uncertainty, and fear are the insignia of the culture which they arestill dominating by default. And the only thing that has not rusted in theirideological equipment, but has grown savagely brighter and clearer through theyears, is their lust for power—for an autocratic, statist, totalitariangovernment power. It is not a crusading brightness, it is not the lust of afanatic with a mission—it is more like the glassy-eyed brightness of asomnambulist whose stuporous despair has long since swallowed the memory of hispurpose, but who still clings to his mystic weapon in the stubborn belief that“there ought to be a law,” that everything will be all right if only somebodywill pass a law, that every problem can be solved by the magic power of bruteforce.[“The New Fascism: Rule by Consensus,” CUI, 209.] The majority of those who are loosely identified by the term “liberals” areafraid to let themselves discover that what they advocate is statism. They donot want to accept the full meaning of their goal; they want to keep all theadvantages and effects of capitalism, while destroying the cause, and they wantto establish statism without its necessary effects. They do not want to know orto admit that they are the champions of dictatorship and slavery.[“Conservatism: An Obituary,” CUI, 194.]For more than fifty years, the West’s liberal intellectuals have proclaimedtheir love for mankind, while being bored by the rivers of blood pouring out ofthe Soviet Union. Professing their compassion for human suffering, they havenone for the victims in Russia. Unable or unwilling to give up their faith incollectivism, they evade the existence of Soviet atrocities, of terror, secretpolice and concentration camps—and publish glowing tributes to Soviettechnology, production and art. Posturing as humanitarians, they man thebarricades to fight the “injustice,” “exploitation,” “repression,” and“persecution” they claim to find in America; as to the full reality of suchthings in Russia, they keep silent.[Susan Ludel, review of Anatoly Marchenko’s My Testimony, TO, July 1970, I5.]See also CAPITALISM; COLLECTIVISM; COMPROMISE; “CONSERVATIVES”; “CONSERVATIVES”vs. “LIBERALS”; CYNICISM; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; MIXED ECONOMY; NEW LEFT;PRAGMATISM; SOCIALISM; SOVIET RUSSIA; STATISM; WELFARE STATE. “Libertarians.” For the record, I shall repeat what I have said many timesbefore: I do not join or endorse any political group or movement. Morespecifically, I disapprove of, disagree with, and have no connection with, thelatest aberration of some conservatives, the so-called “hippies of the right,”who attempt to snare the younger or more careless ones of my readers by claimingsimultanteously to be followers of my philosophy and advocates of anarchism.Anyone offering such a combination confesses his inability to understand either.Anarchism is the most irrational, anti-intellectual notion ever spun by theconcrete-bound, context-dropping, whim-worshiping fringe of the collectivistmovement, where it properly belongs.[“Brief Summary,” TO, Sept. 1971, 1.] Above all, do not join the wrong ideological groups or movements, in order to“do something.” By “ideological” (in this context), I mean groups or movementsproclaiming some vaguely generalized, undefined (and, usually, contradictory)political goals. (E.g., the Conservative Party, which subordinates reason tofaith, and substitutes theocracy for capitalism; or the “libertarian” hippies,who subordinate reason to whims, and substitute anarchism for capitalism.) Tojoin such groups means to reverse the philosophical hierarchy and to sell outfundamental principles for the sake of some superficial political action whichis bound to fail. It means that you help the defeat of your ideas and thevictory of your enemies. (For a discussion of the reasons, see “The Anatomy ofCompromise” in my book Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.)[“What Can One Do?” PWNI, 248; pb 202.] The “libertarians” ... plagiarize Ayn Rand’s principle that no man may initiatethe use of physical force, and treat it as a mystically revealed, out-of-contextabsolute....In the philosophical battle for a free society, the one crucial connection to beupheld is that between capitalism and reason. The religious conservatives areseeking to tie capitalism to mysticism; the “libertarians” are tying capitalismto the whim-worshipping subjectivism and chaos of anarchy. To cooperate witheither group is to betray capitalism, reason, and one’s own future.[Harry Binswanger, “Q & A Department: Anarchism,” TOF, Aug. 1981, 12.] See also ANARCHISM; COMPROMISE; CONTEXT-DROPPING; GOVERNMENT; PHYSICAL FORCE;SUBJECTIVISM; WHIMSIWHIM-WORSHIP. Life. There is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence ornon-existence—and it pertains to a single class of entities: to livingorganisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence oflife is not: it depends on a specific course of action. Matter isindestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease to exist. It is only aliving organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death.Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action. If an organismfails in that action, it dies; its chemical elements remain, but its life goesout of existence. It is only the concept of “Life” that makes the concept of“Value” possible. It is only to a living entity that things can be good or evil.[GS, FNI, 147; pb 121.] Only a living entity can have goals or can originate them. And it is only aliving organism that has the capacity for self-generated, goal-directed action.On the physical level, the functions of all living organisms, from the simplestto the most complex—from the nutritive function in the single cell of an amoebato the blood circulation in the body of a man—are actions generated by theorganism itself and directed to a single goal: the maintenance of the organism’slife.An organism’s life depends on two factors: the material or fuel which it needsfrom the outside, from its physical background, and the action of its own body,the action of using that fuel properly. What standard determines what is properin this context? The standard is the organism’s life, or: that which is requiredfor the organism’s survival.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 6; pb 16.] When applied to physical phenomena, such as the automatic functions of anorganism, the term “goal-directed” is not to be taken to mean “purposive” (aconcept applicable only to the actions of a consciousness) and is not to implythe existence of any teleological principle operating in insentient nature. Iuse the term “goal-directed,” in this context, to designate the fact that theautomatic functions of living organisms are actions whose nature is such thatthey result in the preservation of an organism’s life.[Ibid.] In a fundamental sense, stillness is the antithesis of life. Life can be kept inexistence only by a constant process of self-sustaining action. The goal of thataction, the ultimate value which, to be kept, must be gained through its everymoment, is the organism’s life.[Ibid., 7; pb 16.]See also HAPPINESS; LIFE, RIGHT to; MAN; MORALITY; STANDARD of VALUE; ULTIMATEVALUE; VALUES. Life, Right to. A “right” is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’sfreedom of action in a social context. There is only one fundamental right (allthe others are its consequences or corollaries): a man’s right to his own life.Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action; the right tolife means the right to engage in self sustaining and self-generatedaction—which means: the freedom to take all the actions required by the natureof a rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and theenjoyment of his own life. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, libertyand the pursuit of happiness.)[“Man’s Rights,” VOS, 124; pb 93.] The right to life means that a man has the right to support his life by his ownwork (on any economic level, as high as his ability will carry him); it does notmean that others must provide him with the necessities of life.[Ibid., 129; pb 97.] The Right of Life means that Man cannot be deprived of his life for the benefitof another man nor of any number of other men.[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet, 5.]See also INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; LIFE. Linguistic Analysis. There is an element of grim irony in the emergence ofLinguistic Analysis on the philosophical scene. The assault on man’s conceptualfaculty has been accelerating since Kant, widening the breach between man’s mindand reality. The cognitive function of concepts was undercut by a series ofgrotesque devices—such, for instance, as the “analytic-synthetic” dichotomywhich, by a route of tortuous circumlocutions and equivocations, leads to thedogma that a “necessarily” true proposition cannot be factual, and a factualproposition cannot be “necessarily” true. The crass skepticism andepistemological cynicism of Kant’s influence have been seeping from theuniversities to the arts, the sciences, the industries, the legislatures,saturating our culture, decomposing language and thought. If ever there was aneed for a Herculean philosophical effort to clean up the Kantianstables—particularly, to redeem language by establishing objective criteria ofmeaning and definition, which average men could not attempt —the time was now.As if sensing that need, Linguistic Analysis came on the scene for the avowedpurpose of “clarifying” language—and proceeded to declare that the meaning ofconcepts is determined in the minds of average men, and that the job ofphilosophers consists of observing and reporting on how people use words.The reductio ad absurdum of a long line of mini-Kantians, such as pragmatistsand positivists, Linguistic Analysis holds that words are an arbitrary socialproduct immune from any principles or standards, an irreducible primary notsubject to inquiry about its origin or purpose—and that we can “dissolve” allphilosophical problems by “clarifying” the use of these arbitrary, causeless,meaningless sounds which hold ultimate power over reality....Proceeding from the premise that words (concepts) are created by whim,Linguistic Analysis offers us a choice of whims: individual or collective. Itdeclares that there are two kinds of definitions: “stipulative,” which may beanything anyone chooses, and “reportive,” which are ascertained by polls ofpopular use.As reporters, linguistic analysts were accurate: Wittgenstein’s theory that aconcept refers to a conglomeration of things vaguely tied together by a “familyresemblance” is a perfect description of the state of a mind out of focus.[ITOE, 102.] Linguistic Analysis declares that the ultimate reality is not even percepts, butwords, and that words have no specific referents, but mean whatever people wantthem to mean.... Linguistic Analysis is vehemently opposed to ... any kinds ofprinciples or broad generalizations —i.e., to consistency. It is opposed tobasic axioms (as “analytic” and “redundant”)—i.e., to the necessity of anygrounds for one’s assertions. It is opposed to the hierarchical structure ofconcepts (i.e., to the process of abstraction) and regards any word as anisolated primary (i.e., as a perceptually given concrete). It is opposed to“system-building”—i.e., to the integration of knowledge.[“The Comprachicos,” NL, 225.] Through decades of promulgating such doctrines as Pragmatism, LogicalPositivism, Linguistic Analysis, [philosophers] refused to consider the factthat these doctrines would disarm and paralyze the best among men, those whotake philosophy seriously, and that they would unleash the worst, those who,scorning philosophy, reason, justice, morality, would have no trouble brushingthe disarmed out of the way.... To what sort of problems had [today’sphilosophers] been giving priority over the problems of politics? Among thepapers to be read at that [1969 American Philosophical Association (EasternDivision)] convention were: “Pronouns and Proper Names”—“Can Grammar BeThought?”—“Propositions as the Only Realities.”[“The Chickens’ Homecoming,” NL, 112.] It is the claim of Linguistic Analysis that its purpose is not the communicationof any particular philosophic content, but the training of a student’s mind.This is true—in the terrible, butchering sense of a comprachico operation. Thedetailed discussions of inconsequential minutiae—the discourses on trivia pickedat random and in midstream, without base, context or conclusion—the shocks ofself-doubt at the professor’s sudden revelations of some such fact as thestudent’s inability to define the word “but,” which, he claims, proves that theydo not understand their own statements—the countering of the question: “What isthe meaning of philosophy?” with: “Which sense of ‘meaning’ do you mean?”followed by a discourse on twelve possible uses of the word “meaning,” by whichtime the question is lost—and, above all, the necessity to shrink one’s focus tothe range of a flea’s, and to keep it there—will cripple the best of minds, ifit attempts to comply.“Mind-training” pertains to psycho-epistemology; it consists in making a mindautomatize certain processes, turning them into permanent habits. What habitsdoes Linguistic Analysis inculcate? Context-dropping, “concept-stealing,”disintegration, purposelessness, the inability to grasp, retain or deal withabstractions. Linguistic Analysis is not a philosophy, it is a method ofeliminating the capacity for philosophical thought—it is a course inbrain-destruction, a systematic attempt to turn a rational animal into an animalunable to reason.[“The Comprachicos,” NL, 226.] See also ANALYTIC-SYNTHETIC DICHOTOMY; GRAMMAR; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); KANT,IMMANUEL; LANGUAGE; LOGICAL POSITIVISM; MEANING (of CONCEPTS); PHILOSOPHY;PRAGMATISM; PRINCIPLES; “STOLEN CONCEPT,” FALLACY of; WORDS. Literature. Art is a selective re-creation of reality according to an artist’smetaphysical value-judgments. Man’s profound need of art lies in the fact thathis cognitive faculty is conceptual, i.e., that he acquires knowledge by meansof abstractions, and needs the power to bring his widest metaphysicalabstractions into his immediate, perceptual awareness....Literature re-creates reality by means of language.... The relation ofliterature to man’s cognitive faculty is obvious: literature re-creates realityby means of words, i.e., concepts. But in order to re-create reality, it is thesensory-perceptual level of man’s awareness that literature has to conveyconceptually: the reality of concrete, individual men and events, of specificsights, sounds, textures, etc.All these arts are conceptual in essence, all are products of and addressed tothe conceptual level of man’s consciousness, and they differ only in theirmeans. Literature starts with concepts and integrates them to percepts—painting,sculpture and architecture start with percepts and integrate them to concepts.The ultimate psycho-epistemological function is the same: a process thatintegrates man’s forms of cognition, unifies his consciousness and clarifies hisgrasp of reality.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 45.] The most important principle of the esthetics of literature was formulated. byAristotle, who said that fiction is of greater philosophical importance thanhistory, because “history represents things as they are, while fictionrepresents them as they might be and ought to be.”This applies to all forms of literature and most particularly to a form that didnot come into existence until twenty-three centuries later: the novel.A novel is a long, fictional story about human beings and the events of theirlives. The four essential attributes of a novel are: Theme—Plot—Characterization—Style.These are attributes, not separable parts. They can be isolated conceptually forpurposes of study, but one must always remember that they are interrelated andthat a novel is their sum. (If it is a good novel, it is an indivisible sum.)These four attributes pertain to all forms of literature, i.e., of fiction, withone exception. They pertain to novels, plays, scenarios, librettos, shortstories. The single exception is poems. A poem does not have to tell a story;its basic attributes are theme and style.A novel is the major literary form—in respect to its scope, its inexhaustiblepotentiality, its almost unlimited freedom (including the freedom from physicallimitations of the kind that restrict a stage play) and, most importantly, inrespect to the fact that a novel is a purely literary form of art which does notrequire the intermediary of the performing arts to achieve its ultimate effect.[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 57; pb 80.] An artist recreates those aspects of reality which represent his fundamentalview of man and of existence. In forming a view of man’s nature, a fundamentalquestion one must answer is whether man possesses the faculty ofvolition—because one’s conclusions and evaluations in regard to all thecharacteristics, requirements and actions of man depend on the answer.Their opposite answers to this question constitute the respective basic premisesof two broad categories of art: Romanticism, which recognizes the existence ofman’s volition—and Naturalism, which denies it.[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 81; pb 99.] Prior to the nineteenth century, literature presented man as a helpless beingwhose life and actions were determined by forces beyond his control: either byfate and the gods, as in the Greek tragedies, or by an innate weakness, “atragic flaw,” as in the plays of Shakespeare. Writers regarded man asmetaphysically impotent; their basic premise was determinism. On that premise,one could not project what might happen to men; one could only record what didhappen—and chronicles were the appropriate literary form of such recording.Man as a being who possesses the faculty of volition did not appear inliterature until the nineteenth century. The novel was his proper literaryform—and Romanticism was the great new movement in art. Romanticism saw man as abeing able to choose his values, to achieve his goals, to control his ownexistence. The Romantic writers did not record the events that had happened, butprojected the events that should happen; they did not record the choices men hadmade. but projected the choices men ought to make.With the resurgence of mysticism and collectivism, in the later part of thenineteenth century, the Romantic novel and the Romantic movement vanishedgradually from the cultural scene.Man’s new enemy, in art, was Naturalism. Naturalism rejected the concept ofvolition and went back to a view of man as a helpless creature determined byforces beyond his control; only now the new ruler of man’s destiny was held tobe society. The Naturalists proclaimed that values have no power and no place,neither in human life nor in literature, that writers must present men “as theyare,” which meant: must record whatever they happen to see around them—that theymust not pronounce value-judgments nor project abstractions, but must contentthemselves with a faithful transcription, a carbon copy, of any existingconcretes.[“The Esthetic Vacuum of Our Age,” RM, 113; pb 123.] [The] basic premises of Romanticism and Naturalism (the volition oranti-volition premise) affect all the other aspects of a literary work, such asthe choice of theme and the quality of the style, but it is the nature of thestory structure—the attribute of plot or plotlessness—that represents the mostimportant difference between them and serves as the main distinguishingcharacteristic for classifying a given work in one category or the other.[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 83; pb 101.] The theme of a novel can be conveyed only through the events of the plot, theevents of the plot depend on the characterization of the men who enact them—andthe characterization cannot be achieved except through the events of the plot,and the plot cannot be constructed without a theme.This is the kind of integration required by the nature of a novel. And this iswhy a good novel is an indivisible sum: every scene, sequence and passage of agood novel has to involve, contribute to and advance all three of its majorattributes: theme, plot, characterization.[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 74; pb 93.] A cardinal principle of good fiction [is]: the theme and the plot of a novelmust be integrated—as thoroughly integrated as mind and body or thought andaction in a rational view of man.[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 63; pb 85.] In art, and in literature, the end and the means, or the subject and the style,must be worthy of each other.That which is not worth contemplating in life, is not worth re-creating in art.[“The Goal of My Writing,” RM, 166; pb 166.]The writer who develops a beautiful style, but has nothing to say, represents akind of arrested esthetic development; he is like a pianist who acquires abrilliant technique by playing finger-exercises, but never gives a concert.The typical literary product of such writers—and of their imitators, who possessno style—are so-called “mood-studies,” popular among today’s literati, which arelittle pieces conveying nothing but a certain mood. Such pieces are not anart-form, they are merely finger-exercises that never develop into art.[“Basic Principles of Literature.” RM, 78; pb 96.] Now take a look at modern literature.Man—the nature of man, the metaphysically significant, important, essential inman—is now represented by dipsomaniacs, drug addicts, sexual perverts, homicidalmaniacs and psychotics. The subjects of modern literature are such themes as:the hopeless love of a bearded lady for a mongoloid pinhead in a circus sideshow—or: the problem of a married couple whose child was born with six fingerson her left hand —or: the tragedy of a gentle young man who just can’t helpmurdering strangers in the park, for kicks.All this is still presented to us under the Naturalistic heading of “a slice oflife” or “real life”—but the old slogans have worn thin. The obvious question,to which the heirs of statistical Naturalism have no answer, is: if heroes andgeniuses are not to be regarded as representative of mankind, by reason of theirnumerical rarity, why are freaks and monsters to be regarded as representative?Why are the problems of a bearded lady of greater universal significance thanthe problems of a genius? Why is the soul of a murderer worth studying, but notthe soul of a hero?[“The Esthetic Vacuum of Our Age,” RM. 115; pb 125.] If you wonder what is the ultimate destination toward which modern philosophyand modern art are leading you, you may observe its advance symptoms all aroundus. Observe that literature is returning to the art form of the pre-industrialages, to the chronicle—that fictionalized biographies of “real” people, ofpoliticians, baseball players or Chicago gangsters, are given preference overworks of imaginative fiction, in the theater, in the movies, in television—andthat a favored literary form is the doctementary.[“The Esthetic Vacuum of Our Age,” RM, 118; pb 127.] Except for the exceptions, there is no literature (and no art) today—in thesense of a broad, vital cultural movement and influence. There are onlybewildered imitators with nothing to imitate—and charlatans who rise tosplit-second notoriety, as they always did in periods of cultural collapse.Some remnants of Romanticism may still be found in the popular media—but in sucha mangled, disfigured form that they achieve the opposite of Romanticism’soriginal purpose.[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 108; pb 119.]See also ARISTOTLE; ART; CHARACTERIZATI0N; CLASSICISM; CONCEPTS; DETERMINISM;MODERN ART; NATURALISM; NOVEL; PLOT; PLOT-THEME; POPULAR LITERATURE;PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY; ROMANTICISM; SENSE of LIFE; STYLE; THEME (LITERARY );THRILLERS. Lobbying. “Lobbying” is the activity of attempting to influence legislation byprivately influencing the legislators. It is the result and creation of a mixedeconomy—of government by pressure groups. Its methods range from mere socialcourtesies and cocktail-party or luncheon “friendships” to favors, threats,bribes, blackmail.[“The Pull Peddlers,” CUI, 168.] See also INTERVENTIONISM (ECONOMIC); MIXED ECONOMY; WELFARE STATE. Logic. All thinking is a process of identification and integration. Manperceives a blob of color; by integrating the evidence of his sight and histouch, he learns to identify it as a solid object; he learns to identify theobject as a table; he learns that the table is made of wood; he learns that thewood consists of cells, that the cells consist of molecules, that the moleculesconsist of atoms. All through this process, the work of his mind consists ofanswers to a single question: What is it? His means to establish the truth ofhis answers is logic, and logic rests on the axiom that existence exists. Logicis the art of non-contradictory identification. A contradiction cannot exist. Anatom is itself, and so is the universe ; neither can contradict its ownidentity; nor can a part contradict the whole. No concept man forms is validunless he integrates it without contradiction into the total sum of hisknowledge. To arrive at a contradiction is to confess an error in one’sthinking; to maintain a contradiction is to abdicate one’s mind and to evictoneself from the realm of reality.[GS, FNI, 153; pb 125.] The fundamental concept of method, the one on which all the others depend, islogic. The distinguishing characteristic of logic (the art of non-contradictoryidentification) indicates the nature of the actions (actions of consciousnessrequired to achieve a correct identification) and their goal (knowledge)—whiteomitting the length, complexity or specific steps of the process of logicalinference, as well as the nature of the particular cognitive problem involved inany given instance of using logic.[ITOE, 46.] “It’s logical, but logic has nothing to do with reality.” Logic is the art orskill of non-contradictory identification. Logic has a single law, the Law ofIdentity, and its various corollaries. If logic has nothing to do with reality,it means that the Law of Identity is inapplicable to reality. If so, then: a.things are not what they are; b. things can be and not be at the same time, inthe same respect, i.e., reality is made up of contradictions. If so, by whatmeans did anyone discover it? By illogical means. (This last is for sure.) Thepurpose of that notion is crudely obvious. Its actual meaning is not: “Logic hasnothing to do with reality,” but: “I, the speaker, have nothing to do with logic(or with reality).” When people use that catch phrase, they mean either: “It’slogical, but I don’t choose to be logical” or: “It’s logical, but people are notlogical, they don’t think—and I intend to pander to their irrationality.”[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 17; pb 15.J Logic is man’s method of reaching conclusions ubjectively by deriving themwithout contradiction from the facts of reality—ultimately, from the evidenceprovided by man’s senses. If men reject logic, then the tie between their mentalprocesses and reality is severed; all cognitive standards are repudiated, andanything goes; any contradiction, on any subject, may be endorsed (andsimultaneously rejected) by anyone, as and when he feels like it.[Leonard Peikoff, “Nazism and Subjectivism,” TO, Feb. 1971, 12.] Any theory that propounds an opposition between the logical and the empirical,represents a failure to grasp the nature of logic and its role in humancognition. Man’s knowledge is not acquired by logic apart from experience or byexperience apart from logic, but by the application of logic to experience. Alltruths are the product of a logical identification of the facts of experience.Man is born tabula rasa; all his knowledge is based on and derived from theevidence of his senses. To reach the distinctively human level of cognition, manmust conceptualize his perceptual data—and conceptualization is a process whichis neither automatic nor infallible. Man needs to discover a method to guidethis process, if it is to yield conclusions which correspond to the facts ofreality—i.e., which represent knowledge. The principle at the base of the propermethod is the fundamental principle of metaphysics: the Law of Identity. Inreality, contradictions cannot exist; in a cognitive process, a contradiction isthe proof of an error. Hence the method man must follow: to identify the factshe observes, in a non-contradictory manner. This method is logic —“the art ofnon-contradictory identification.” (Atlas Shrugged.) Logic must be employed atevery step of a man’s conceptual development, from the formation of his firstconcepts to the discovery of the most complex scientific laws and theories. Onlywhen a conclusion is based on a non-contradictory identification and integrationof all the evidence available at a given time, can it qualify as knowledge.The failure to recognize that logic is man’s method of cognition, has produced abrood of artificial splits and dichotomies which represent restatements of theanalytic-synthetic dichotomy from various aspects. Three in particular areprevalent today: logical truth vs. factual truth; the logically possible vs. theempirically possible; and the a priori vs. the a posteriori.The logical-factual dichotomy opposes truths which are validated “merely” by theuse of logic (the analytic ones), and truths which describe the facts ofexperience (the synthetic ones). Implicit in this dichotomy is the view thatlogic is a subjective game, a method of manipulating arbitrary symbols, not amethod of acquiring knowledge.It is the use of logic that enables man to determine what is and what is not afact. To introduce an opposition between the “logical” and the “factual” is tocreate a split between consciousness and existence, between truths in accordancewith man’s method of cognition and truths in accordance with the facts ofreality. The result of such a dichotomy is that logic is divorced from reality(“Logical truths are empty and conventional”)—and reality becomes unknowable(“Factual truths are contingent and uncertain”). This amounts to the claim thatman has no method of cognition, i.e., no way of acquiring knowledge.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 151.]See also ANALYTlC-SYNTHETIC DICHOTOMY; ARISTOTLE; AXIOMS; CONTRADICTIONS;EPISTEMOLOGY; IDENTITY; INDUCTION and DEDUCTION; METHOD, CONCEPTS of; MYSTICISM;OBJECTIVITY; PROOF; REASON; VALIDATION. Logical Positivism. As a defense against the Witch-doctory of Hegel, who claimeduniversal omniscience, the scientist was offered the combined neo-mysticWitch-doctory and Attila-ism of the Logical Positivists. They assured him thatsuch concepts as metaphysics or existence or reality or thing or matter or mindare meaningless—let the mystics care whether they exist or not, a scientist doesnot have to know it; the task of theoretical science is the manipulation ofsymbols, and scientists are the special elite whose symbols have the magic powerof making reality conform to their will (“matter is that which fits mathematicalequations”). Knowledge, they said, consists, not of facts, but of words, wordsunrelated to objects, words of an arbitrary social convention, as an irreducibleprimary; thus knowledge is merely a matter of manipulating language. The job ofscientists, they said, is not the study of reality, but the creation ofarbitrary constructs by means of arbitrary sounds, and any construct is as validas another, since the criterion of validity is only “convenience” and thedefinition of science is “that which the scientists do.” But this omnipotentpower, surpassing the dreams of ancient numerologists or of medieval alchemists,was granted to the scientist by philosophical Attila-ism on two conditions: a.that he never claim certainty for his knowledge, since certainty is unknown toman, and that he claim, instead, “percentages of probability,” not troublinghimself with such questions as how one calculates percentages of the unknowable;b. that he claim as absolute knowledge the proposition that all values lieoutside the sphere of science, that reason is impotent to deal with morality,that moral values are a matter of subjective choice, dictated by one’s feelings,not one’s mind.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 36; pb 34.] Ever since Kant divorced reason from reality, his intellectual descendants havebeen diligently widening the breach. In the name of reason, Pragmatismestablished a range-of-the-moment view as an enlightened perspective on life,context-dropping as a rule of epistemology, expediency as a principle ofmorality, and collective subjectivism as a substitute for metaphysics. LogicalPositivism carried it farther and, in the name of reason, elevated theimmemorial psycho-epistemology of shyster-lawyers to the status of a scientificepistemological system—by proclaiming that knowledge consists of linguisticmanipulations.[“The Cashing-in: The Student ‘Rebellion,’ ” CUI, 246.] If [the student “rebels”] “seem unable to formulate or sustain a systematizedpolitical theory of society,” yet shriek with moral righteousness that theypropose to achieve their social goals by physical force—hasn’t LogicalPositivism taught them that ethical propositions have no cognitive meaning andare merely a report on one’s feelings or the equivalent of emotionalejaculations? If they are savagely blind to everything but the immediatemoment—hasn’t Logical Positivism taught them that nothing else can be claimedwith certainty to exist?[tbid.,248.]Logical Positivism declares that “reality,” “identity,” “existence,” “mind” aremeaningless terms, that man can be certain of nothing but the sensoryperceptions of the immediate moment ... it declares that the meaning of theproposition: “Napoleon lost the battle of Waterloo” is your walk to the librarywhere you read it in a book.[“The Comprachicos,” NL, 225.]See also ANALYTIC-SYNTHETIC DICHOTOMY; BEHAVIORISM; CERTAINTY;KANT, IMMANUEL;MEANING (of CONCEPTS); PHILOSOPHY;PRAGMATISM; SCIENCE; SUBJECTIVISM; WORDS. Loneliness. The thinking child is not antisocial (he is, in fact, the only typeof child fit for social relationships). When he develops his first values andconscious convictions, particularly as he approaches adolescence, he feels anintense desire to share them with a friend who would understand him; iffrustrated, he feels an acute sense of loneliness. (Loneliness is specificallythe experience of this type of child—or adult; it is the experience of those whohave something to offer. The emotion that drives conformists to “belong,” is notloneliness, but fear—the fear of intellectual independence and responsibility.The thinking child seeks equals; the conformist seeks protectors.)[“The Comprachicos,” NL, 213.]See also EMOTIONS; INDEPENDENCE; RATIONALITY; SECOND-HANDERS. Love. Love, friendship, respect, admiration are the emotional response of oneman to the virtues of another, the spiritual payment given in exchange for thepersonal, selfish pleasure which one man derives from the virtues of anotherman’s character. Only a brute or an altruist would claim that the appreciationof another person’s virtues is an act of selflessness, that as far as one’s ownselfish interest and pleasure are concerned, it makes no difference whether onedeals with a genius or a fool, whether one meets a hero or a thug, whether onemarries an ideal woman or a slut. [“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 29; pb 31.] Romantic love, in the full sense of the term, is an emotion possible only to theman (or woman) of unbreached self-esteem: it is his response to his own highestvalues in the person of another—an integrated response of mind and body, of loveand sexual desire. Such a man (or woman) is incapable of experiencing a sexualdesire divorced from spiritual values.[“Of Living Death,” TO, Oct. 1968, 2.]Man is an end in himself. Romantic love—the profound, exalted, lifelong passionthat unites his mind and body in the sexual act—is the living testimony to thatprinciple.[Ibid., 3.] There are two aspects of man’s existence which are the special province andexpression of his sense of life: love and art.I am referring here to romantic love, in the serious meaning of that term—asdistinguished from the superficial infatuations of those whose sense of life isdevoid of any consistent values, i.e., of any lasting emotions other than fear.Love is a response to values. It is with a person’s sense of life that one fallsin love—with that essential sum, that fundamental stand or way of facingexistence, which is the essence of a personality. One falls in love with theembodiment of the values that formed a person’s character, which are reflectedin his widest goals or smallest gestures, which create the style of his soul—theindividual style of a unique, unrepeatable, irreplaceable consciousness. It isone’s own sense of life that acts as the selector, and responds to what itrecognizes as one’s own basic values in the person of another. It is not amatter of professed convictions (though these are not irrelevant); it is amatter of much more profound, conscious and subconscious harmony.Many errors and tragic disillusionments are possible in this process ofemotional recognition, since a sense of life, by itself, is not a reliablecognitive guide. And if there are degrees of evil, then one of the most evilconsequences of mysticism—in terms of human suffering—is the belief that love isa matter of’ “the heart,” not the mind, that love is an emotion independent ofreason, that love is blind and impervious to the power of philosophy. Love isthe expression of philosophy—of a subconscious philosophical sum—and, perhaps,no other aspect of human existence needs the conscious power of philosophy quiteso desperately. When that power is called upon to verify and support anemotional appraisal, when love is a conscious integration of reason and emotion,of mind and values, then—and only then—it is the greatest reward of man’s life. [“Philosophy and Sense of Life,” RM, 40; pb 32.] To love is to value. Only a rationally selfish man, a man of self-esteem, iscapable of love—because he is the only man capable of holding firm, consistent,uncompromising, unbetrayed values. The man who does not value himself, cannotvalue anything or anyone.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 29; pb 32.][In The Fountainhead] the hero utters a line that has often been quoted byreaders: “To say ‘I love you’ one must know first how to say the ‘I.’ ”[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 7.] [Selfless love] would have to mean that you derive no personal pleasure orhappiness from the company and the existence of the person you love, and thatyou are motivated only by self-sacrificial pity for that person’s need of you. Idon’t have to point out to you that no one would be flattered by, nor wouldaccept, a concept of that kind. Love is not self-sacrifice, but the mostprofound assertion of your own needs and values. It is for your own happinessthat you need the person you love, and that is the greatest compliment, thegreatest tribute you can pay to that person.[Ibid.] One gains a profoundly personal, selfish joy from the mere existence of theperson one loves. It is one’s own personal, selfish happiness that one seeks,earns and derives from love.A “selfless,” “disinterested” love is a contradiction in terms: it means thatone is indifferent to that which one values.Concern for the welfare of those one loves is a rational part of one’s selfishinterests. If a man who is passionately in love with his wife spends a fortuneto cure her of a dangerous illness, it would be absurd to claim that he does itas a “sacrifice” for her sake, not his own, and that it makes no difference tohim, personally and selfishly, whether she lives or dies.[“The Ethics of Emergencies,” VOS, 48; pb 44.] The practical implementation of friendship, affection and love consists ofincorporating the welfare (the rational welfare) of the person involved intoone’s own hierarchy of values, then acting accordingly.[Ibid., 51; pb 46.] To love is to value. The man who tells you that it is possible to value withoutvalues, to love those whom you appraise as worthless, is the man who tells youthat it is possible to grow rich by consuming without producing and that papermoney is as valuable as gold.... When it comes to love, the highest of emotions,you permit them to shriek at you accusingly that you are a moral delinquent ifyou’re incapable of feeling causeless love. When a man feels fear withoutreason, you call him to the attention of a psychiatrist; you are not so carefulto protect the meaning, the nature and the dignity of love.Love is the expression of one’s values, the greatest reward you can earn for themoral qualities you have achieved in your character and person, the emotionalprice paid by one man for the joy he receives from the virtues of another. Yourmorality demands that you divorce your love from values and hand it down to anyvagrant, not as response to his worth, but as response to his need, not asreward, but as alms, not as a payment for virtues, but as a blank check onvices. Your morality tells you that the purpose of love is to set you free ofthe bonds of morality, that love is superior to moral judgment, that true lovetranscends, forgives and survives every manner of evil in its object, and thegreater the love the greater the depravity it permits to the loved. To love aman for his virtues is paltry and human, it tells you; to love him for his flawsis divine. To love those who are worthy of it is self-interest; to love theunworthy is sacrifice. You owe your love to those who don’t deserve it, and theless they deserve it, the more love you owe them—the more loathsome the object,the nobler your love—the more unfastidious your love, the greater yourvirtue—and if you can bring your soul to the state of a dump heap that welcomesanything on equal terms, if you can cease to value moral values, you haveachieved the state of moral perfection.[GS, FNI, 182; pb 147.] Like any other value, love is not a static quantity to be divided, but anunlimited response to be earned. The love for one friend is not a threat to thelove for another, and neither is the love for the various members of one’sfamily, assuming they have earned it. The most exclusive form —romantic love—isnot an issue of competition. If two men are in love with the same woman, whatshe feels for either of them is not determined by what she feels for the otherand is not taken away from him. If she chooses one of them, the “loser” couldnot have had what the “winner” has earned.It is only among the irrational, emotion-motivated persons, whose love isdivorced from any standards of value, that chance rivalries, accidentalconflicts and blind choices prevail. But then, whoever wins does not win much.Among the emotion-driven, neither love nor any other emotion has any meaning.[“The ‘Conflicts’ of Men’s Interests,” VOS, 65; pb 55.] Let us answer the question: “Can you measure love?”The concept “love” is formed by isolating two or more instances of theappropriate psychological process, then retaining its distinguishingcharacteristics (an emotion proceeding from the evaluation of an existent as apositive value and as a source of pleasure) and omitting the object and themeasurements of the process’s intensity.The object may he a thing, an event, an activity, a condition or a person. Theintensity varies according to one’s evaluation of the object, as, for instance,in such cases as one’s love for ice cream, or for parties, or for reading, orfor freedom, or for the person one marries. The concept “love” subsumes a vastrange of values and, consequently, of intensity: it extends from the lowerlevels (designated by the subcategory “liking”) to the higher level (designatedby the subcategory “affection,” which is applicable only in regard to persons)to the highest level, which includes romantic love.If one wants to measure the intensity of a particular instance of love, one doesso by reference to the hierarchy of values of the person experiencing it. A manmay love a woman, yet may rate the neurotic satisfactions of sexual promiscuityhigher than her value to him. Another man may love a woman, but may give her up,rating his fear of the disapproval of others (of his family, his friends or anyrandom strangers) higher than her value. Still another man may risk his life tosave the woman he loves, because all his other values would lose meaning withouther. The emotions in these examples are not emotions of the same intensity ordimension. Do not let a James Taggart type of mystic tell you that love isimmeasurable.[ITOE, 44.]See also ALTRUISM; CHARACTER; EMOTIONS; FEMININITY; MARRIAGE; PHILOSOPHY;SACRIFICE; SELF-ESTEEM; SELFISHNESS; SELFLESSNESS; SENSE of LIFE; SEX;TELEOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT; VALUES; VIRTUE."},{"pageContent":"MMalevolent Universe Premise. The altruist ethics is based on a “malevolentuniverse” metaphysics, on the theory that man, by his very nature, is helplessand doomed—that success, happiness, achievement are impossible to him—thatemergencies, disasters, catastrophes are the norm of his life and that hisprimary goal is to combat them.As the simplest empirical refutation of that metaphysics—as evidence of the factthat the material universe is not inimical to man and that catastrophes are theexception, not the rule of his existence—observe the fortunes made by insurancecompanies.[“The Ethics of Emergencies,” VOS, 55; pb 48.]If you hold the wrong ideas on any fundamental philosophic issue, that willundercut or destroy the benevolent universe premise.... For example, anydeparture in metaphysics from the view that this world in which we live isreality, the full, final, absolute reality—any such departure will necessarilyundercut a man’s confidence in his ability to deal with the world, and thus willinject the malevolent-universe element. The same applies in epistemology: if youconclude in any form that reason is not valid, then man has no tool of achievingvalues; so defeat and tragedy are unavoidable.This is true also of ethics. If men hold values incompatible with life—such asself-sacrifice and altruism-obviously they can’t achieve such values; they willsoon come to feel that evil is potent, whereas they are doomed to misery,suffering, failure. It is irrational codes of ethics above all else that feedthe malevolent-universe attitude in people and lead to the syndrome eloquentlyexpressed by the philosopher Schopenhauer: “Whatever one may say, the happiestmoment of the happy man is the moment of his falling asleep, and the unhappiestmoment of the unhappy that of his waking. Human life must be some kind ofmistake.”Now there is certainly “some kind of mistake” here. But it’s not life. It’s thekind of philosophies used to wreck man—to make him incapable ofliving—philosophies, I may say, which are perfectly exemplified by the ideas ofSchopenhauer.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture8.]See also ALTRUISM; BENEVOLENT UNIVERSE PREMISE; EVIL; HAPPINESS; MAN;METAPHYSICAL VALUE-JUDGMENTS; SENSE of LIFE; SUFFERING.Man. Man’s distinctive characteristic is his type of consciousness—aconsciousness able to abstract, to form concepts, to apprehend reality by aprocess of reason ... [The] valid definition of man, within the context of hisknowledge and of all of mankind’s knowledge to-date [is]: “A rational animal.”(“Rational,” in this context, does not mean “acting invariably in accordancewith reason”; it means “possessing the faculty of reason.” A full biologicaldefinition of man would include many subcategories of “animal,” but the generalcategory and the ultimate definition remain the same.)[ITOE, 58.] Man’s life, as required by his nature, is not the life of a mindless brute, of alooting thug or a mooching mystic, but the life of a thinking being—not life bymeans of force or fraud, but life by means of achievement—not survival at anyprice, since there’s only one price that pays for man’s survival: reason.[GS, FNI, 149; pb 122.] Man has been called a rational being, but rationality is a matter of choice—andthe alternative his nature offers him is: rational being or suicidal animal. Manhas to be man—by choice; he has to hold his life as a value—by choice; he has tolearn to sustain it—by choice; he has to discover the values it requires andpractice his virtues—by choice.[Ihid.] The key to what you so recklessly call “human nature,” the open secret you livewith, yet dread to name, is the fact that man is a being of volitionalconsciousness.[Ibid., 146; pb 120.] Man has no automatic code of survival. His particular distinction from all otherliving species is the necessity to act in the face of alternatives by means ofvolitional choice. He has no automatic knowledge of what is good for him orevil, what values his life depends on, what course of action it requires. Areyou prattling about an instinct of self-preservation? An instinct ofself-preservation is precisely what man does not possess. An “instinct” is anunerring and automatic form of knowledge. A desire is not an instinct. A desireto live does not give you the knowledge required for living. And even man’sdesire to live is not automatic: your secret evil today is that that is thedesire you do not hold. Your fear of death is not a love for life and will notgive you the knowledge needed to keep it.[Ibid., 148; pb 121.]Man cannot survive on the perceptual level of his consciousness; his senses donot provide him with an automatic guidance, they do not give him the knowledgehe needs, only the material of knowledge, which his mind has to integrate. Manis the only living species who has to perceive reality—which means: to beconscious—by choice. But he shares with other species the penalty ofunconsciousness: destruction. For an animal, the question of survival isprimarily physical: for man, primarily epistemological.Man’s unique reward, however, is that while animals survive by adjustingthemselves to their background, man survives by adjusting his background tohimself. If a drought strikes them, animals perish—man builds irrigation canals;if a flood strikes them, animals perish—man builds dams; if a carnivorous packattacks them animals perish—man writes the Constitution of the United States.But one does not obtain food, safety or freedom—by instinct.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 10; pb 15.] Consciousness—for those living organisms which possess it——is the basic means ofsurvival. For man, the basic means of survival is reason. Man cannot survive, asanimals do, by the guidance of mere percepts. A sensation of hunger will tellhim that he needs food (if he has learned to identify it as “hunger”), but itwill not tell him how to obtain his food and it will not tell him what food isgood for him or poisonous. He cannot provide for his simplest physical needswithout a process of thought. He needs a process of thought to discover how toplant and grow his food or how to make weapons for hunting. His percepts mightlead him to a cave, if one is available—but to build the simplest shelter. heneeds a process of thought. No percepts and no “instincts” will tell him how tolight a fire, how to weave cloth, how to forge tools, how to make a wheel, howto make an airplane, how to perform an appendectomy, how to produce an electriclight bulb or an electronic tube or a cyclotron or a box of matches. Yet hislife depends on such knowledge —and only a volitional act of his consciousness,a process of thought, can provide it.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 13: ph 21.] To the extent that a man is guided by his rational judgment, he acts inaccordance with the requirements of his nature and, to that extent, succeeds inachieving a human form of survival and well-being; to the extent that he actsirrationally, he acts as his own destroyer.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 21.] If some men do not choose to think. they can survive only by imitating andrepeating a routine of work discovered by others but those others had todiscover it, or none would have survived. If some men do not choose to think orto work, they can survive (temporarily) only by looting the goods produced byothers—but those others had to produce them, or none would have survived.Regardless of what choice is made, in this issue, by any man or by any number ofmen, regardless of what blind, irrational, or evil course they may choose topursue—the fact remains that reason is man’s means of survival and that menprosper or fail, survive or perish in proportion to the degree of theirrationality.[Ibid.] Nothing is given to man on earth except a potential and the material on which toactualize it. The potential is a superlative machine: his consciousness; but itis a machine without a spark plug, a machine of which his own will has to be thespark plug, the self-starter and the driver; he has to discover how to use itand he has to keep it in constant action. The material is the whole of theuniverse, with no limits set to the knowledge he can acquire and to theenjoyment of life he can achieve. But everything he needs or desires has to belearned, discovered and produced by him—by his own choice, by his own effort, byhis own mind.A being who does not know automatically what is true or false, cannot knowautomatically what is right or wrong, what is good for him or evil. Yet he needsthat knowledge in order to live. He is not exempt from the laws of reality, heis a specific organism of a specific nature that requires specific actions tosustain his life. He cannot achieve his survival by arbitrary means nor byrandom motions nor by blind urges nor by chance nor by whim. That which hissurvival requires is set by his nature and is not open to his choice. What isopen to his choice is only whether he will discover it or not, whether he willchoose the right goals and values or not.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 14; pb 22.] The faculty of volition gives man a special status in two crucial respects: 1.unlike the metaphysically given, man’s products, whether material orintellectual, are not to be accepted uncritically—and 2. by its metaphysicallygiven nature, a man’s volition is outside the power of other men. What theunalterable basic constituents are to nature, the attribute of a volitionalconsciousness is to the entity “man.” Nothing can force a man to think. Othersmay offer him incentives or impediments, rewards or punishments, they maydestroy his brain by drugs or by the blow of a club, but they cannot order hismind to function: this is in his exclusive, sovereign power. Man is neither tobe obeyed nor to be commanded.[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 38; pb 31.]To deal with men by force is as impractical as to deal with nature bypersuasion.[Ibid., 39; pb 32.] An animal’s life consists of a series of separate cycles, repeated over and overagain, such as the cycle of breeding its young, or of storing food for thewinter; an animal’s consciousness cannot integrate its entire lifespan; it cancarry just so far, then the animal has to begin the cycle all over again, withno connection to the past. Man’s life is a continuous whole: for good or evil,every day, year and decade of his life holds the sum of all the days behind him.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 18; pb 24.] Man is the only living species that can transmit and expand his store ofknowledge from generation to generation; but such transmission requires aprocess of thought on the part of the individual recipients. As witness, thebreakdowns of civilization, the dark ages in the history of mankind’s progress,when the accumulated knowledge of centuries vanished from the lives of men whowere unable, unwilling, or forbidden to think.[“What Is Capitalism?” GUI, 16.] Man gains enormous values from dealing with other men; living in a human societyis his proper way of life—but only on certain conditions. Man is not a lone wolfand he is not a social animal. He is a contractual animal. He has to plan hislife long-range, make his own choices, and deal with other men by voluntaryagreement (and he has to be able to rely on their observance of the agreementsthey entered).[“A Nation’s Unity,” ARL, II, 2, 3.] A living entity that regarded its means of survival as evil, would not survive.A plant that struggled to mangle its roots, a bird that fought to break itswings would not remain for long in the existence they affronted. But the historyof man has been a struggle to deny and to destroy his mind.[GS, FNI, 148; pb 122.] Almost unanimously, man is regarded as an unnatural phenomenon: either as asupernatural entity, whose mystic (divine) endowment, the mind (“soul”), isabove nature—or as a subnatural entity, whose mystic (demoniacal) endowment, themind, is an enemy of nature (“ecology”). The purpose of all such theories is toexempt man from the law of identity.But man exists and his mind exists. Both are part of nature, both possess aspecific identity. The attribute of volition does not contradict the fact ofidentity, just as the existence of living organisms does not contradict theexistence of inanimate matter. Living organisms possess the power ofself-initiated motion, which inanimate matter does not possess; man’sconsciousness possesses the power of self-initiated motion in the realm ofcognition (thinking), which the consciousnesses of other living species do notpossess. But just as animals are able to move only in accordance with the natureof their bodies, so man is able to initiate and direct his mental action only inaccordance with the nature (the identity) of his consciousness. His volition islimited to his cognitive processes; he has the power to identify (and toconceive of rearranging) the elements of reality, but not the power to alterthem. He has the power to use his cognitive faculty as its nature requires, butnot the power to alter it nor to escape the consequences of its misuse. He hasthe power to suspend, evade, corrupt or subvert his perception of reality, butnot the power to escape the existential and psychological disasters that follow.(The use or misuse of his cognitive faculty determines a man’s choice of values,which determine his emotions and his character. It is in this sense that man isa being of self-made soul.)[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 32; pb 26.] Whatever he was—that robot in the Garden of Eden, who existed without mind,without values, without labor, without love—he was not man. [GS, FNI, 169; pb 137.] They have cut man in two, setting one half against the other. They have taughthim that his body and his consciousness are two enemies engaged in deadlyconflict, two antagonists of opposite natures, contradictory claims,incompatible needs, that to benefit one is to injure the other, that his soulbelongs to a supernatural realm, but his body is an evil prison holding it inbondage to this earth—and that the good is to defeat his body, to undermine itby years of patient struggle, digging his way to that glorious jail-break whichleads into the freedom of the grave.They have taught man that he is a hopeless misfit made of two elements, bothsymbols of death. A body without a soul is a corpse, a soul without a body is aghost—yet such is their image of man’s nature: the battleground of a strugglebetween a corpse and a ghost, a corpse endowed with some evil volition of itsown and a ghost endowed with the knowledge that everything known to man isnon-existent, that only the unknowable exists.Do you observe what human faculty that doctrine was designed to ignore? It wasman’s mind that had to be negated in order to make him fall apart. Once hesurrendered reason, he was left at the mercy of two monsters whom he could notfathom or control: of a body moved by unaccountable instincts and a soul movedby mystic revelations—he was left as the passively ravaged victim of a battlebetween a robot and a dictaphone.[Ibid., 170; pb 138.] Man is an indivisible entity, an integrated unit of two attributes: of matterand consciousness, and ... he may permit no breach between body and mind,between action and thought, between his life and his convictions.[Ibid., 157; pb 129.] Man cannot survive in the kind of state of nature that the ecologistsenvision—i.e., on the level of sea urchins or polar bears. In that sense, man isthe weakest of animals: he is born naked and unarmed, without fangs, claws,horns or “instinctual” knowledge. Physically, he would fall an easy prey, notonly to the higher animals, but also to the lowest bacteria: he is the mostcomplex organism and, in a contest of brute force, extremely fragile andvulnerable. His only weapon—his basic means of survival—is his mind.In order to survive, man has to discover and produce everything he needs, whichmeans that he has to alter his background and adapt it to his needs. Nature hasnot equipped him for adapting himself to his background in the manner ofanimals. From the most primitive cultures to the most advanced civilizations,man has had to manufacture things; his well-being depends on his success atproduction. The lowest human tribe cannot survive without that alleged source ofpollution: fire. It is not merely symbolic that fire was the property of thegods which Prometheus brought to man. The ecologists are the new vulturesswarming to extinguish that fire.[“The Anti-Industrial Revolution,” NL, 136.] “It’s only human,” you cry in defense of any depravity, reaching the stage ofself-abasement where you seek to make the concept “human” mean the weakling, thefool, the rotter, the liar, the failure, the coward, the fraud, and to exilefrom the human race the hero, the thinker, the producer, the inventor, thestrong, the purposeful, the pure—as if “to feel” were human, but to think werenot, as if to fail were human, but to succeed were not, as if corruption werehuman, but virtue were not —as if the premise of death were proper to man, butthe premise of life were not. [GS, FNI, 209; pb 167.] In the name of the values that keep you alive, do not let your vision of man bedistorted by the ugly, the cowardly, the mindless in those who have neverachieved his title. Do not lose your knowledge that man’s proper estate is anupright posture, an intransigent mind and a step that travels unlimited roads.[Ibid., 241; pb 191.]See also CONCEPTS; EMOTIONS; FREE WILL; HISTORY; MAN-WORSHIP; METAPHYSICAL vs.MAN-MADE; MORALITY; OBJECTIVISM; PERCEPTION; PHYSICAL FORCE; PRODUCTION; REASON;SOUL-BODY DICHOTOMY; THOUGHT/THINKING. Man-Worship. Just as religion has pre-empted the field of ethics, turningmorality against man, so it has usurped the highest moral concepts of ourlanguage, placing them outside this earth and beyond man’s reach. “Exaltation”is usually taken to mean an emotional state evoked by contemplating thesupernatural. “Worship” means the emotional experience of loyalty and dedicationto something higher than man. “Reverence” means the emotion of a sacred respect,to be experienced on one’s knees. “Sacred” means superior to andnot-to-be-touched-by any concerns of man or of this earth. Etc.But such concepts do name actual emotions, even though no supernatural dimensionexists; and these emotions are experienced as uplifting or ennobling, withoutthe self-abasement required by religious definitions. What, then, is theirsource or referent in reality? It is the entire emotional realm of man’sdedication to a moral ideal. Yet apart from the man-degrading aspects introducedby religion, that emotional realm is left unidentified, without concepts, wordsor recognition.It is this highest level of man’s emotions that has to be redeemed from the murkof mysticism and redirected at its proper object: man.It is in this sense, with this meaning and intention, that I would identify thesense of life dramatized in The Fountainhead as man worship.It is an emotion that a few—a very few-men experience consistently; some menexperience it in rare, single sparks that flash and die without consequences;some do not know what I am talking about; some do and spend their lives asfrantically virulent spark-extinguishers.Do not confuse “man worship” with the many attempts, not to emancipate moralityfrom religion and bring it into the realm of reason, but to substitute a secularmeaning for the worst, the most profoundly irrational elements of religion. Forinstance, there are all the variants of modern collectivism (communist, fascist,Nazi, etc.), which preserve the religious-altruist ethics in full and merelysubstitute “society” for God as the beneficiary of man’s self-immolation. Thereare the various schools of modern philosophy which, rejecting the law ofidentity, proclaim that reality is an indeterminate flux ruled by miracles andshaped by whims—not God’s whims, but man’s or “society’s.” These neomystics arenot man-worshipers; they are merely the secularizers of as profound a hatred forman as that of their avowedly mystic predecessors.A cruder variant of the same hatred is represented by those concrete-bound,“statistical” mentalities who—unable to grasp the meaning of man’svolition—declare that man cannot be an object of worship, since they have neverencountered any specimens of humanity who deserved it.The man-worshipers, in my sense of the term, are those who see man’s highestpotential and strive to actualize it.... [Man-worshipers are] those dedicated tothe exaltation of man’s self-esteem and the sacred-ness of his happiness onearth.[“Introduction to The Fountainhead,” TO, March 1968, 4.] This view of man has rarely been expressed in human history. Today, it isvirtually non-existent. Yet this is the view with which—in various degrees oflonging, wistfulness, passion and agonized confusion—the best of mankind’s youthstart out in life. It is not even a view, for most of them, but a foggy,groping, undefined sense made of raw pain and incommunicable happiness. It is asense of enormous expectation, the sense that one’s life is important, thatgreat achievements are within one’s capacity, and that great things lie ahead.It is not in the nature of man—nor of any living entity—to start out by givingup, by spitting in one’s own face and damning existence; that requires a processof corruption, whose rapidity differs from man to man. Some give up at the firsttouch of pressure; some sell out; some run down by imperceptible degrees andlose their fire, never knowing when or how they lost it. Then all of thesevanish in the vast swamp of their elders who tell them persistently thatmaturity consists of abandoning one’s mind; security, of abandoning one’svalues; practicality, of losing self-esteem. Yet a few hold on and move on,knowing that that fire is not to be betrayed, learning how to give it shape,purpose and reality. But whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, menseek a noble vision of man’s nature and of life’s potential.[Ibid., 6.]See also FEMININITY; MAN; HAPPINESS; RELIGION; SACRED; SELF-ESTEEM; SENSE ofLIFE. Managerial Work. Managerial work—the organization and integration of humaneffort into purposeful, large-scale, long-range activities—is, in the realm ofaction, what man’s conceptual faculty is in the realm of cognition.[“The Cashing-in: The Student ‘Rebellion,’ ” CUI, 262.] If there is any one proof of a man’s incompetence, it is the stagnant mentalityof a worker (or of a professor) who, doing some small, routine job in a vastundertaking, does not care to look beyond the lever of a machine (or the lecternof a classroom), does not choose to know how the machine (or the classroom) gotthere or what makes his job possible, and proclaims that the management of theundertaking is parasitical and unnecessary.[Ibid.] See also BUSINESSMEN; CAREER. Market Value. It is in regard to a free market that the distinction between anintrinsic, subjective, and objective view of values is particularly important tounderstand. The market value of a product is not an intrinsic value, not a“value in itself” hanging in a vacuum. A free market never loses sight of thequestion: Of value to whom? And, within the broad field of objectivity, themarket value of a product does not reflect its philosophically objective value,but only its socially objective value.By “philosophically objective,” I mean a value estimated from the standpoint ofthe best possible to man, i.e., by the criterion of the most rational mindpossessing the greatest knowledge, in a given category, in a given period, andin a defined context (nothing can be estimated in an undefined context). Forinstance, it can be rationally proved that the airplane is objectively ofimmeasurably greater value to man (to man at his best) than the bicycle—and thatthe works of Victor Hugo are objectively of immeasurably greater value thantrue-confession magazines. But if a given man’s intellectual potential canbarely manage to enjoy true confessions, there is no reason why his meagerearnings, the product of his effort, should be spent on books he cannot read—oron subsidizing the airplane industry, if his own transportation needs do notextend beyond the range of a bicycle. (Nor is there any reason why the rest ofmankind should be held down to the level of his literary taste, his engineeringcapacity, and his income. Values are not determined by fiat nor by majorityvote.)Just as the number of its adherents is not a proof of an idea’s truth orfalsehood, of an art work’s merit or demerit, of a product’s efficacy orinefficacy—so the free-market value of goods or services does not necessarilyrepresent their philosophically objective value, but only their sociallyobjective value, i.e., the sum of the individual judgments of all the meninvolved in trade at a given time, the sum of what they valued, each in thecontext of his own life.Thus, a manufacturer of lipstick may well make a greater fortune than amanufacturer of microscopes—even though it can be rationally demonstrated thatmicroscopes are scientifically more valuable than lipstick. But—valuable towhom?A microscope is of no value to a little stenographer struggling to make aliving; a lipstick is; a lipstick, to her, may mean the difference betweenself-confidence and self-doubt, between glamour and drudgery.This does not mean, however, that the values ruling a free market aresubjective. If the stenographer spends all her money on cosmetics and has noneleft to pay for the use of a microscope (for a visit to the doctor) when sheneeds it, she learns a better method of budgeting her income; the free marketserves as her teacher: she has no way to penalize others for her mistakes. Ifshe budgets rationally, the microscope is always available to serve her ownspecific needs and no more, as far as she is concerned: she is not taxed tosupport an entire hospital, a research laboratory, or a space ship’s journey tothe moon. Within her own productive power, she does pay a part of the cost ofscientific achievements, when and as she needs them.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 24.] Within every category of goods and services offered on a free market, it is thepurveyor of the best product at the cheapest price who wins the greatestfinancial rewards in that field—not automatically nor immediately nor by fiat,but by virtue of the free market, which teaches every participant to look forthe objective best within the category of his own competence, and penalizesthose who act on irrational considerations.[Ibid., 25.] The “philosophically objective” value of a new product serves as the teacher forthose who are willing to exercise their rational faculty, each to the extent ofhis ability. Those who are unwilling remain unrewarded —as well as those whoaspire to more than their ability produces....A given product may not be appreciated at once, particularly if it is tooradical an innovation; but, barring irrelevant accidents, it wins in the longrun. It is in this sense that the free market is not ruled bv the intellectualcriteria of the majority, which prevail only at and for any given moment; thefree market is ruled by those who are able to see and plan long-range—and thebetter the mind, the longer the range.The economic value of a man’s work is determined, on a free market, by a singleprinciple: by the voluntary consent of those who are willing to trade him theirwork or products in return.[Ibid., 26.] [An] objection is usually expressed by a question such as: “Why should ElvisPresley make more money than Einstein?” The answer is: Because men work in orderto support and enjoy their own lives—and if many men find value in ElvisPresley, they are entitled to spend their money on their own pleasure. Presley’sfortune is not taken from those who do not care for his work (I am one of them)nor from Einstein—nor does he stand in Einstein’s way—nor does Einstein lackproper recognition and support in a free society, on an appropriate intellectuallevel.[Ibid., 27.]See also CAPITALISM; COMPETITION; FREE MARKET; MONEY; PURCHASING POWER; TRADERPRINCIPLE. Marriage. I consider marriage a very important institution, but it is importantwhen and if two people have found the person with whom they wish to spend therest of their lives—a question of which no man or woman can be automaticallycertain. When one is certain that one’s choice is final, then marriage is, ofcourse, a desirable state. But this does not mean that any relationship based onless than total certainty is improper. I think the question of an affair or amarriage depends on the knowledge and the position of the two persons involvedand should be left up to them. Either is moral, provided only that both partiestake the relationship seriously and that it is based on values.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 8.]See also LOVE; SEX. Materials, Concepts of. Concepts of materials are formed by observing thedifferences in the constituent materials of entities. (Materials exist only inthe form of specific entities, such as a nugget of gold, a plank of wood, a dropor an ocean of water.) The concept of “gold,” for instance, is formed byisolating gold objects from all others, then abstracting and retaining thematerial, the gold, and omitting the measurements of the objects (or of thealloys) in which gold may exist. Thus, the material is the same in all theconcrete instances subsumed under the concept, and differs only in quantity.[ITOE. 19.]See also CONCEPT-FORMATION; CONCEPT; MATTER. Mathematics. Mathematics is a science of method (the science of measurement,i.e., of establishing quantitative relationships), a cognitive method thatenables man to perform an unlimited series of integrations. Mathematicsindicates the pattern of the cognitive role of concepts and thepsycho-epistemological need they fulfill.[ITOE, 85.] With the grasp of the (implicit) concept “unit,” man reaches the conceptuallevel of cognition which consists of two interrelated fields: the conceptual andthe mathematical. The process of concept-formation is, in large part, amathematical process.[Ibid., 8.] A vast part of higher mathematics, from geometry on up, is devoted to the taskof discovering methods by which various shapes can be measured—complex methodswhich consist of reducing the problem to the terms of a simple, primitivemethod, the only one available to man in this field: linear measurement.(Integral calculus, used to measure the area of circles, is just one example.)In this respect, concept-formation and applied mathematics have a similar task,just as philosophical epistemology and theoretical mathematics have a similargoal: the goal and task of bringing the universe within the range of man’sknowledge—by identifying relationships to perceptual data.[lbid., 17.]See also EPISTEMOLOGY; MEASUREMENT; METHOD, CONCEPTS of; NUMBERS;PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY; SCIENCE; UNIT; UNIT-ECONOMY. Matter. Matter is indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease toexist.[GS, FNI, 147; pb 121.] The day when [one] grasps that matter has no volition is the day when he graspsthat he has—and this is his birth as a human being.[Ibid., 194; pb 156.] To grasp the axiom that existence exists, means to grasp the fact that nature,i.e., the universe as a whole, cannot be created or annihilated, that it cannotcome into or go out of existence. Whether its basic constituent elements areatoms, or subatomic particles, or some yet undiscovered forms of energy, it isnot ruled by a consciousness or by will or by chance, but by the Law ofIdentity. All the countless forms, motions, combinations and dissolutions ofelements within the universe—from a floating speck of dust to the formation of agalaxy to the emergence of life—are caused and determined by the identities ofthe elements involved. Nature is the metaphysically given—i.e., the nature ofnature is outside the power of any volition.[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 30; pb 25.]See also EXISTENCE; FREE WILL; LIFE; MATERIALS, CONCEPTS of; UNIVERSE. “McCarthyism.” In the late 1940’s, another newly coined term was shot into ourcultural arteries: “McCarthyism.” Again, it was a derogatory term, suggestingsome insidious evil, and without any clear definition. Its alleged meaning was:“Unjust accusations, persecutions, and character assassinations of innocentvictims.” Its real meaning was: “Anti-communism.”Senator McCarthy was never proved guilty of those allegations, but the effect ofthat term was to intimidate and silence public discussions. Any uncompromisingdenunciation of communism or communists was —and still is—smeared as“McCarthyism.” As a consequence, opposition to and exposes of communistpenetration have all but vanished from our intellectual scene. (I must mentionthat I am not an admirer of Senator McCarthy, but not for the reasons implied inthat smear.)[“ ‘Extremism,’ or The Art of Smearing,” CUI, 176.]See also “ANTI-CONCEPTS”; COMMUNISM; SOVIET RUSSIA. Meaning (of Concepts). A word has no meaning other than that of the concept itsymbolizes, and the meaning of a concept consists of its units.[ITOE, 52.] A widespread error, in this context, holds that the wider the concept, the lessits cognitive content—on the ground that its distinguishing characteristic ismore generalized than the distinguishing characteristics of its constituentconcepts. The error lies in assuming that a concept consists of nothing but itsdistinguishing characteristic. But the fact is that in the process ofabstracting from abstractions, one cannot know what is a distinguishingcharacteristic unless one has observed other characteristics of the unitsinvolved and of the existents from which they are differentiated.Just as the concept “man” does not consist merely of “rational faculty” (if itdid, the two would be equivalent and interchangeable, which they are not), butincludes all the characteristics of “man,” with “rational faculty” serving asthe distinguishing characteristic—so, in the case of wider concepts, the concept“animal” does not consist merely of “consciousness and locomotion,” but subsumesall the characteristics of all the animal species, with “consciousness andlocomotion” serving as the distinguishing characteristic.[Ibid., 34.] To know the exact meaning of the concepts one is using, one must know theircorrect definitions, one must be able to retrace the specific (logical, notchronological) steps by which they were formed, and one must be able todemonstrate their connection to their base in perceptual reality.When in doubt about the meaning or the definition of a concept, the best methodof clarification is to look for its referents—i.e., to ask oneself: What fact orfacts of reality gave rise to this concept? What distinguishes it from all otherconcepts?For instance: what fact of reality gave rise to the concept “justice”? The factthat man must draw conclusions about the things, people and events around him,i.e., must judge and evaluate them. Is his judgment automatically right? No.What causes his judgment to be wrong? The lack of sufficient evidence, or hisevasion of the evidence, or his inclusion of considerations other than the factsof the case. How, then, is he to arrive at the right judgment? By basing itexclusively on the factual evidence and by considering all the relevant evidenceavailable. But isn’t this a description of “objectivity”? Yes, “objectivejudgment” is one of the wider categories to which the concept “justice” belongs.What distinguishes “justice” from other instances of objective judgment? Whenone evaluates the nature or actions of inanimate objects, the criterion ofjudgment is determined by the particular purpose for which one evaluates them.But how does one determine a criterion for evaluating the character and actionsof men, in view of the fact that men possess the faculty of volition? Whatscience can provide an objective criterion of evaluation in regard to volitionalmatters? Ethics. Now, do I need a concept to designate the act of judging aman’s character and/or actions exclusively on the basis of all the factualevidence available, and of evaluating it by means of an objective moralcriterion? Yes. That concept is “justice.”[Ibid., 67.] Since a word is a symbol for a concept, it has no meaning apart from the contentof the concept it symbolizes. And since a concept is an integration of units, ithas no content or meaning apart from its units.The meaning of a concept consists of the units—the existents—which itintegrates, including all the characteristics of these units.Observe that concepts mean existents, not arbitrarily selected portions ofexistents. There is no basis whatever—neither metaphysical nor epistemological,neither in the nature of reality nor of a conceptual consciousness—for adivision of the characteristics of a concept’s units into two groups, one ofwhich is excluded from the concept’s meaning.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 132.] What, then, is the meaning of the concept “man”? “Man” means a certain type ofentity, a rational animal, including all the characteristics of this entity(anatomical, physiological, psychological, etc., as well as the relations ofthese characteristics to those of other entities)—all the characteristicsalready known, and all those ever to be discovered. Whatever is true of theentity, is meant by the concept.It follows that there are no grounds on which to distinguish “analytic” from“synthetic” propositions. Whether one states that “A man is a rational animal,”or that “A man has only two eyes”—in both cases, the predicated characteristicsare true of man and are, therefore, included in the concept “man.” The meaningof the first statement is: “A certain type of entity, including all itscharacteristics (among which are rationality and animality) is: a rationalanimal.” The meaning of the second is: “A certain type of entity, including allits characteristics (among which is the possession of only two eyes) has: onlytwo eyes.” Each of these statements is an instance of the Law of Identity; eachis a “tautology”; to deny either is to contradict the meaning of the concept“man,” and thus to endorse a self-contradiction.A similar type of analysis is applicable to every true statement. Every truthabout a given existent(s) reduces, in basic pattern, to: “X is: one or more ofthe things which it is.” The predicate in such a case states somecharacteristic(s) of the subject; but since it is a characteristic of thesubject, the concept(s) designating the subject in fact includes the predicatefrom the outset.[Ibid., 135.]See also ANALYTIC-SYNTHETIC DICHOTOMY; CONCEPTS; UNIT; WORDS. Measurement. Measurement is the identification of a relationship —a quantitativerelationship established by means of a standard that serves as a unit. Entities(and their actions) are measured by their attributes (length, weight, velocity,etc.) and the standard of measurement is a concretely specified unitrepresenting the appropriate attribute. Thus, one measures length in inches,feet and miles—weight in pounds —velocity by means of a given distance traversedin a given time, etc.It is important to note that while the choice of a given standard is optional,the mathematical rules of using it are not. It makes no difference whether onemeasures length in terms of feet or meters; the standard provides only the formof notation, not the substance nor the result of the process of measuring. Thefacts established by measurement will be the same, regardless of the particularstandard used; the standard can neither alter nor affect them. The requirementsof a standard of measurement are: that it represent the appropriate attribute,that it be easily perceivable by man and that, once chosen, it remain immutableand absolute whenever used. (Please remember this; we will have reason to recallit.)Now what is the purpose of measurement? Observe that measurement consists ofrelating an easily perceivable unit to larger or smaller quantities, then toinfinitely larger or infinitely smaller quantities, which are not directlyperceivable to man. (The word “infinitely” is used here as a mathematical, not ametaphysical, term.) The purpose of measurement is to expand the range of man’sconsciousness, of his knowledge, beyond the perceptual level: beyond the directpower of his senses and the immediate concretes of any given moment. Man canperceive the length of one foot directly; he cannot perceive ten miles. Byestablishing the relationship of feet to miles, he can grasp and know anydistance on earth; by establishing the relationship of miles to light-years, hecan know the distances of galaxies.The process of measurement is a process of integrating an unlimited scale ofknowledge to man’s limited perceptual experience—a process of making theuniverse knowable by bringing it within the range of man’s consciousness, byestablishing its relationship to man. It is not an accident that man’s earliestattempts at measurement (the evidence of which survives to this day) consistedof relating things to himself—as, for instance, taking the length of his foot asa standard of length, or adopting the decimal system, which is supposed to haveits origin in man’s ten fingers as units of counting.It is here that Protagoras’ old dictum may be given a new meaning, the oppositeof the one he intended: “Man is the measure of all things.” Man is the measure,epistemologically—not metaphysically. In regard to human knowledge, man has tobe the measure, since he has to bring all things into the realm of the humanlyknowable. But, far from leading to subjectivism, the methods which he has toemploy require the most rigorous mathematical precision, the most rigorouscompliance with objective rules and facts—if the end product is to be knowledge.[ITOE, 8.]Observe the multiple role of measurements in the process of concept-formation,in both of its two essential parts: differentiation and integration. Conceptscannot be formed at random. All concepts are formed by first differentiating twoor more existents from other existents. All conceptual differentiations are madein terms of commensurable characteristics (i.e., characteristics possessing acommon unit of measurement). No concept could be formed, for instance, byattempting to distinguish long objects from green objects. Incommensurablecharacteristics cannot be integrated into one unit.Tables, for instance, are first differentiated from chairs, beds and otherobjects by means of the characteristic of shape, which is an attribute possessedby all the objects involved. Then, their particular kind of shape is set as thedistinguishing characteristic of tables—i.e., a certain category of geometricalmeasurements of shape is specified. Then, within that category, the particularmeasurements of individual table-shapes are omitted.Please note the fact that a given shape represents a certain category or set ofgeometrical measurements. Shape is an attribute; differences of shape—whethercubes, spheres, cones or any complex combinations —are a matter of differingmeasurements; any shape can be reduced to or expressed by a set of figures interms of linear measurement. When, in the process of concept-formation, manobserves that shape is a commensurable characteristic of certain objects, hedoes not have to measure all the shapes involved nor even to know how to measurethem; he merely has to observe the element of similarity.Similarity is grasped perceptually; in observing it, man is not and does nothave to be aware of the fact that it involves a matter of measurement. It is thetask of philosophy and of science to identify that fact.As to the actual process of measuring shapes, a vast part of higher mathematics,from geometry on up, is devoted to the task of discovering methods by whichvarious shapes can be measured-complex methods which consist of reducing theproblem to the terms of a simple, primitive method, the only one available toman in this field: linear measurement. (Integral calculus, used to measure thearea of circles, is just one example.)[Ibid., 16.] There is no exact method of measuring the intensity of all psychologicalprocesses, but—as in the case of forming concepts of colors—conceptualizationdoes not require the knowledge of exact measurements. Degrees of intensity canbe and are measured approximately, on a comparative scale. For instance, theintensity of the emotion of joy in response to certain facts varies according tothe importance of these facts in one’s hierarchy of values; it varies in suchcases as buying a new suit, or getting a raise in pay, or marrying the personone loves. The intensity of a process of thought and of the intellectual effortrequired varies according to the scope of its content; it varies when one graspsthe concept “table” or the concept “justice,” when one grasps that 2 + 2 = 4 orthat e = mc2.[Ibid., 40.] Observe that the attacks on the conceptual level of man’s consciousness, i.e.,on reason, come from the same ideological quarters as the attacks onmeasurement. When discussing man’s consciousness, particularly his emotions,some persons use the word “measurement” as a pejorative term—as if an attempt toapply it to the phenomena of consciousness were a gross, insulting,“materialistic” impropriety. The question “Can you measure love?” is an exampleand a symptom of that attitude.As in many other issues, the two allegedly opposite camps are merely twovariants growing out of the same basic premises. The old-fashioned mysticsproclaim that you cannot measure love in pounds, inches or dollars. They areaided and abetted by the neo-mystics who—punch-drunk with undigested concepts ofmeasurement, proclaiming measurement to be the sole tool of science—proceed tomeasure knee-jerks, statistical questionnaires, and the learning time of rats,as indices to the human psyche.Both camps fail to observe that measurement requires an appropriate standard,and that in the physical sciences—which one camp passionately hates, and theother passionately envies—one does not measure length in pounds, or weight ininches.Measurement is the identification of a relationship in numerical terms —and thecomplexity of the science of measurement indicates the complexity of therelationships which exist in the universe and which man has barely begun toinvestigate. They exist, even if the appropriate standards and methods ofmeasurement are not always as easily apparent nor the degree of achievableprecision as great as in the case of measuring the basic, perceptually givenattributes of matter. If anything were actually “immeasurable,” it would bear norelationship of any kind to the rest of the universe, it would not affect nor beaffected by anything else in any manner whatever, it would enact no causes andbear no consequences—in short, it would not exist.The motive of the anti-measurement attitude is obvious: it is the desire topreserve a sanctuary of the indeterminate for the benefit of the irrational—thedesire, epistemologically, to escape from the responsibility of cognitiveprecision and wide-scale integration; and, metaphysically, the desire to escapefrom the absolutism of existence, of facts, of reality and, above all, ofidentity.[Ibid., 49.]See also IDENTITY; MATHEMATICS; TELEOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT; UNIT.

By means of nothing more than its last five letters,that word obliterates the difference between mind and force: it equates the menof ability with political rulers, and the power of their creative achievementswith political power. There is no difference, the word suggests, between freedomand tyranny: an “aristocracy” is tyranny by a politically established elite, a“democracy” is tyranny by the majority—and when a government protects individualrights, the result is tyranny by talent or “merit” (and since “to merit” means“to deserve,” a free society is ruled by the tyranny of justice).[“An Untitled Letter,” PWNI, 126; pb 105.]See also “ANTI-CONCEPTS”; DEMOCRACY; ECONOMIC POWER vs. POLITICAL POWER;FREEDOM; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; JUSTICE; “PACKAGE-DEALING,” FALLACY of; TYRANNY.Metaphysical. I use the word “metaphysical” to mean: that which pertains toreality, to the nature of things, to existence.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 2; pb 14.]See also EXISTENCE; METAPHYSICAL VALUE-JUDGMENTS; METAPHYSICAL vs. MAN-MADE;METAPHYSICS. Metaphysical Value Judgments. The key concept, in the formation of a sense oflife, is the term “important.” It is a concept that belongs to the realm ofvalues, since it implies an answer to the question: Important—to whom? Yet itsmeaning is different from that of moral values. “Important” does not necessarilymean “good.” It means “a quality, character or standing such as to entitle toattention or consideration” (The American College Dictionary). What, in afundamental sense, is entitled to one’s attention or consideration? Reality.“Important”—in its essential meaning, as distinguished from its more limited andsuperficial uses—is a metaphysical term. It pertains to that aspect ofmetaphysics which serves as a bridge between metaphysics and ethics: to afundamental view of man’s nature. That view involves the answers to suchquestions as whether the universe is knowable or not, whether man has the powerof choice or not, whether he can achieve his goals in life or not. The answersto such questions are “metaphysical value-judgments,” since they form the baseof ethics.It is only those values which he regards or grows to regard as “important,”those which represent his implicit view of reality, that remain in a man’ssubconscious and form his sense of life.“It is important to understand things”—“It is important to obey my parents”—“Itis important to act on my own”—“It is important to please other people”—“It isimportant to fight for what I want”—“It is important not to make enemies”—“Mylife is important”—“Who am I to stick my neck out?” Man is a being of self-madesoul—and it is of such conclusions that the stuff of his soul is made. (By“soul” I mean “consciousness.”)[“Philosophy and Sense of Life,” RM, 34; pb 28.] Is the universe intelligible to man, or unintelligible and unknowable? Can manfind happiness on earth, or is he doomed to frustration and despair? Does manhave the power of choice, the power to choose his goals and to achieve them, thepower to direct the course of his life—or is he the helpless plaything of forcesbeyond his control, which determine his fate? Is man, by nature, to be valued asgood, or to be despised as evil? These are metaphysical questions, but theanswers to them determine the kind of ethics men will accept and practice; theanswers are the link between metaphysics and ethics. And although metaphysics assuch is not a normative science, the answers to this category of questionsassume, in man’s mind, the function of metaphysical value-judgments, since theyform the foundation of all of his moral values.Consciously or subconsciously, explicitly or implicitly, man knows that he needsa comprehensive view of existence to integrate his values, to choose his goals,to plan his future, to maintain the unity and coherence of his life—and that hismetaphysical value-judgments are involved in every moment of his life, in hisevery choice, decision and action.[“The Psycho-Epistemology of Art,” RM, 21; pb 19.]See also ART; BENEVOLENT UNIVERSE PREMISE; MALEVOLENT UNIVERSE PREMISE;METAPHYSICS; MORALITY; PHILOSOPHY; SENSE of LIFE; SUBCONSCIOUS. Metaphysical vs. Man-Made. Any natural phenomenon, i.e., any event which occurswithout human participation, is the metaphysically given, and could not haveoccurred differently or failed to occur; any phenomenon involving human actionis the man-made, and could have been different. For example, a flood occurringin an uninhabited land, is the metaphysically given; a dam built to contain theflood water, is the man-made; if the builders miscalculate and the dam breaks,the disaster is metaphysical in its origin, but intensified by man in itsconsequences. To correct the situation, men must obey nature by studying thecauses and potentialities of the flood, then command nature by building betterflood controls.[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 33; pb 27.] Things of human origin (whether physical or psychological) may be designated as“man-made facts”—as distinguished from the metaphysically given facts. Askyscraper is a man-made fact, a mountain is a metaphysically given fact. Onecan alter a skyscraper or blow it up (just as one can alter or blow up amountain), but so long as it exists, one cannot pretend that it is not there orthat it is not what it is.[Ibid., 37; pb 31.] Nature, i.e., the universe as a whole, cannot be created or annihilated ... itcannot come into or go out of existence. Whether its basic constituent elementsare atoms, or subatomic particles, or some yet undiscovered forms of energy, itis not ruled by a consciousness or by will or by chance, but by the law ofidentity. All the countless forms, motions, combinations and dissolutions ofelements within the universe—from a floating speck of dust to the formation of agalaxy to the emergence of life—are caused and determined by the identities ofthe elements involved. Nature is the metaphysically given—i.e., the nature ofnature is outside the power of any volition.[Ibid., 30; pb 25.] Man’s faculty of volition as such is not a contradiction of nature, but it opensthe way for a host of contradictions—when and if men do not grasp the crucialdifference between the metaphysically given and any object, institution,procedure, or rule of conduct made by man.It is the metaphysically given that must be accepted: it cannot be changed. Itis the man-made that must never be accepted uncritically: it must be judged,then accepted or rejected and changed when necessary. Man is not omniscient orinfallible: he can make innocent errors through lack of knowledge, or he canlie, cheat and fake. The man-made may be a product of genius, perceptiveness,ingenuity—or it may be a product of stupidity, deception, malice, evil. One manmay be right and everyone else wrong, or vice versa (or any numerical divisionin between). Nature does not give man any automatic guarantee of the truth ofhis judgments (and this is a metaphysically given fact, which must be accepted).Who, then, is to judge? Each man, to the best of his ability and honesty. Whatis his standard of judgment? The metaphysically given.The metaphysically given cannot be true or false, it simply is—and mandetermines the truth or falsehood of his judgments by whether they correspond toor contradict the facts of reality. The metaphysically given cannot be right orwrong—it is the standard of right or wrong, by which a (rational) man judges hisgoals, his values, his choices. The metaphysically given is, was, will be, andhad to be. Nothing made by man had to be: it was made by choice.[Ibid., 32: pb 27.] A man-made product did not have to exist, but, once made, it does exist. A man’sactions did not have to be performed, but, once performed, they are facts ofreality. The same is true of a man’s character: he did not have to make thechoices he made, but, once he has formed his character, it is a fact, and it ishis personal identity. (Man’s volition gives him great, but not unlimited,latitude to change his character; if he does, the change becomes a fact.)[Ibid., 37; pb 31.] [One must] distinguish metaphysical facts from man-made facts—i.e., facts whichare inherent in the identities of that which exists, from facts which dependupon the exercise of human volition. Because man has free will, no humanchoice—and no phenomenon which is a product of human choice—is metaphysicallynecessary. In regard to any man-made fact, it is valid to claim that man haschosen thus, but it was not inherent in the nature of existence for him to havedone so; he could have chosen otherwise. For instance, the U.S. did not have toconsist of 50 states; men could have subdivided the larger ones, or consolidatedthe smaller ones, etc.Choice, however, is not chance. Volition is not an exception to the Law ofCausality; it is a type of causation.... Further, metaphysical facts areunalterable by man, and limit the alternatives open to his choice. Man canrearrange the materials that exist in reality, but he cannot violate theiridentity; he cannot escape the laws of nature. “Nature, to be commanded, must beobeyed.”[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 149.] In regard to nature, “to accept what I cannot change” means to accept themetaphysically given; “to change what I can” means to strive to rearrange thegiven by acquiring knowledge—as science and technology (e.g., medicine) aredoing; “to know the difference” means to know that one cannot rebel againstnature and, when no action is possible, one must accept nature serenely.... Whatone must accept is the fact that the minds of other men are not in one’s power,as one’s own mind is not in theirs; one must accept their right to make theirown choices, and one must agree or disagree, accept or reject, join or opposethem, as one’s mind dictates. The only means of “changing” men is the same asthe means of “changing” nature: knowledge—which, in regard to men, is to be usedas a process of persuasion, when and if their minds are active; when they arenot, one must leave them to the consequences of their own errors....To deal with men by force is as impractical as to deal with nature bypersuasion.[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 39; pb 32.]See also ABSOLUTES; CHARACTER; CREATION; FREE WILL; IDENTITY; MORAL JUDGMENT;NATURE; NECESSITY; PHYSICAL FORCE; UNIVERSE. Metaphysics. Are you in a universe which is ruled by natural laws and,therefore, is stable, firm, absolute—and knowable? Or are you in anincomprehensible chaos, a realm of inexplicable miracles, an unpredictable,unknowable flux, which your mind is impotent to grasp? Are the things you seearound you real—or are they only an illusion? Do they exist independent of anyobserver—or are they created by the observer? Are they the object or the subjectof man’s consciousness? Are they what they are—or can they be changed by a mereact of your consciousness, such as a wish?The nature of your actions—and of your ambition—will be different, according towhich set of answers you come to accept. These answers are the province ofmetaphysics—the study of existence as such or, in Aristotle’s words, of “beingqua being”—the basic branch of philosophy.[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 3; pb 2.] The branch of philosophy that studies existence is metaphysics. Metaphysicsidentifies the nature of the universe as a whole. It tells men what kind ofworld they live in, and whether there is a supernatural dimension beyond it. Ittells men whether they live in a world of solid entities, natural laws, absolutefacts, or in a world of illusory fragments, unpredictable miracles, andceaseless flux. It tells men whether the things they perceive by their sensesand mind form a comprehensible reality, with which they can deal, or some kindof unreal appearance, which leaves them staring and helpless.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 14; pb 23.]See also ABSOLUTES; ABSTRACTIONS and CONCRETES; CAUSALITY; CONSCIOUSNESS;EXISTENCE; IDENTITY; METAPHYSICAL VALUE-JUDGMENTS; METAPHYSICAL vs. MAN-MADE;PRIMACY of EXISTENCE vs. PRIMACY of CONSCIOUSNESS; SUBJECTIVISM. Method, Concepts of. A special subcategory of concepts pertaining to theproducts of consciousness, is reserved for concepts of method. Concepts ofmethod designate systematic courses of action devised by men for the purpose ofachieving certain goals. The course of action may be purely psychological (suchas a method of using one’s consciousness) or it may involve a combination ofpsychological and physical actions (such as a method of drilling for oil),according to the goal to be achieved.Concepts of method are formed by retaining the distinguishing characteristics ofthe purposive course of action and of its goal, while omitting the particularmeasurements of both.For instance, the fundamental concept of method, the one on which all the othersdepend, is logic. The distinguishing characteristic of logic (the art ofnon-contradictory identification) indicates the nature of the actions (actionsof consciousness required to achieve a correct identification) and their goal(knowledge)-while omitting the length, complexity or specific steps of theprocess of logical inference, as well as the nature of the particular cognitiveproblem involved in any given instance of using logic.Concepts of method represent a large part of man’s conceptual equipment.Epistemology is a science devoted to the discovery of the proper methods ofacquiring and validating knowledge. Ethics is a science devoted to the discoveryof the proper methods of living one’s life. Medicine is a science devoted to thediscovery of the proper methods of curing disease. All the applied sciences(i.e., technology) are sciences devoted to the discovery of methods.[ITOE, 46.] See also CONCEPT-FORMATION; CONCEPTS; CONSCIOUSNESS; EPISTEMOLOGY; LOGIC;MATHEMATICS. Middle Ages. The Middle Ages were an era of mysticism, ruled by blind faith andblind obedience to the dogma that faith is superior to reason. [“The Left: Old and New,” NL, 83.] In the history of Western civilization, the period known as the Dark Ages, afterthe fall of the Roman Empire, was a period when Western Europe existed withoutany social organization beyond chance local groupings clustered around smallvillages, large castles, and remnants of various traditions—swept periodicallyby massive barbarian invasions, warring robber bands, and sundry local looters.It was as close to a state of pure anarchy as men could come. The feudal systemgrew out of the need for organized protection. The system, in essence, consistedin the peasants swearing allegiance to a lord, who claimed ownership of the landand a percentage of their harvest in exchange for his duty to protect themagainst military attacks.This system brought some semblance of order, but no protection and no peace.Disarmed men were left in the total power of an armed ruler, who had his ownmilitary gang and who robbed them as ruthlessly as, but more systematicallythan, any foreign invader. The history of the Middle Ages is a series ofinternal and external wars: there were various lords struggling to enlarge theirdomains, foreign lords struggling to subjugate neighboring lands, and bloody,hopeless uprisings of desperate peasants, bloodily suppressed. It was also thelongest period of stagnation—intellectually and productively—in Europe’shistory.[“A Nation’s Unity,” ARL, II, 2, 2.] The medieval period, under the sway of such philosophers as Plotinus andAugustine, was an era dominated by Platonism. During much of this periodAristotle’s philosophy was almost unknown in the West.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 22; pb 30.]For centuries, nature had been regarded as a realm of miracles manipulated by apersonal deity, a realm whose significance lay in the clues it offered to thepurposes of its author.[Ibid., 107; pb 106.] The dominant moralists had said that man must not seek his ultimate fulfillmenton earth; that he must renounce the pleasures of this life, whether as aflesh-mortifying ascetic or as an abstemious toilet, for the sake of God,salvation, and the life to come.... Whatever their concern with the individualsoul, the medievals had derogated or failed to discover the individual man. Inphilosophy, the Platonists had denied his reality; in practice, the feudalsystem had (by implication) treated the group—the caste, the guild, etc.—as theoperative social unit.[Ibid., 110; pb 108.] An entirely different view of man dominated the medieval Christian civilization.Man, according to Augustine, is “crooked and sordid, bespotted and ulcerous.”Medieval mystics regarded man as an evil creature whose body is loathsomebecause it is material, and whose mind is impotent because it is human. Hatingman’s body, they said that pleasure is evil, and virtue consists ofrenunciation. Hating this earth, they said that it is a prison where man isdoomed to pain, misery, calamity. Hating life, they said that death and escapeinto some other dimension is all that man could—and should—hope for.Man as a helpless and depraved creature, was the basic theme of medievalsculpture until the Gothic period, whether he was shown being pushed into Hellor accepted into Heaven.[Mary Ann Sures, “Metaphysics in Marble,” TO, Feb. 1969, 14.] The supernatural doctrines of the Middle Ages, ... kept men huddling on the mudfloors of their hovels, in terror that the devil might steal the soup they hadworked eighteen hours to earn.[GS.

A nation’s productive—and moral, and intellectual —top is themiddle class. It is a broad reservoir of energy, it is a country’s motor andlifeblood, which feeds the rest. The common denominator of its members, on theirvarious levels of ability, is: independence. The upper classes are merely anation’s past; the middle class is its future.[“The Dead End,” ARL. 1, 20, 3.]The middle class is the heart, the lifeblood, the energy source of a free,industrial economy, i.e., of capitalism; it did not and cannot exist under anyother system; it is the product of upward mobility, incompatible with frozensocial castes. Do not ask, therefore, for whom the bell of inflation is tolling;it tolls for you. It is not at the destruction of a handful of the rich thatinflation is aimed (the rich are mostly in the vanguard of the destroyers), butat the middle class.[“The Inverted Moral Priorities,” ARL, III, 21, 2.] See also CAPITALISM; INFLATION. Military Conscription. See Draft. Mill, John Stuart. Religious influences are not the only villain behind thecensorship legislation; there is another one: the social school of morality,exemplified by John Stuart Mill. Mill rejected the concept of individual rightsand replaced it with the notion that the “public good” is the sole justificationof individual freedom. (Society, he argued, has the power to enslave or destroyits exceptional men, but it should permit them to be free, because it benefitsfrom their efforts.) Among the many defaults of the conservatives in the pasthundred years, the most shameful one, perhaps, is the fact that they acceptedJohn Stuart Mill as a defender of capitalism.[“Thought Control,” ARL, III, 2, 2.] The terrible aspect of Mill’s influence is the fact that his followers becomeunable to consider great values—such as truth, science, morality, art—apart fromand without the permission of “the people’s desires.”[Ibid., 3.] [Mill’s] On Liberty is the most pernicious piece of collectivism ever adopted bysuicidal defenders of liberty.[“An Untitled Letter,” PWNI, 138; pb 114.] A weary agnostic on most of the fundamental issues of philosophy, Mill bases hisdefense of capitalism on the ethics of Utilitarianism.Utilitarianism is a union of hedonism and Christianity. The first teaches man tolove pleasure; the second, to love his neighbor. The union consists in teachingman to love his neighbor’s pleasure. To be exact, the Utilitarians teach that anaction is moral if its result is to maximize pleasure among men in general. Thistheory holds that man’s duty is to serve—according to a purely quantitativestandard of value.He is to serve not the well-being of the nation or of the economic class, but“the greatest happiness of the greatest number,” regardless of who comprise itin any given issue. As to one’s own happiness, says Mill, the individual must be“disinterested” and “strictly impartial”; he must remember that he is only oneunit out of the dozens, or millions, of men affected by his actions. “All honorto those who can abnegate for themselves the personal enjoyment of life,” saysMill, “when by such renunciation they contribute worthily to increase the amountof happiness in the world....”Capitalism, Mill acknowledges, is not based on any desire for abnegation orrenunciation; it is based on the desire for selfish profit. Nevertheless, hesays, the capitalist system ensures that, most of the time, the actual result ofindividual profit-seeking is the happiness of society as a whole. Hence theindividual should be left free of government regulation. He should be left freenot as an absolute (there are no absolutes, says Mill), but under the presentcircumstances—not on the ground of inalienable rights (there are no such rights,Mill holds), but of social utility.Under capitalism, concluded one American economist of the period with evidentmoral relief, “the Lord maketh the selfishness of man to work for the materialwelfare of his kind.” As one commentator observes, the essence of this argumentis the claim that capitalism is justified by its ability to convert “man’sbaseness” to “noble ends.” “Baseness” here means egoism; “nobility” meansaltruism. And the justification of individual freedom in terms of itscontribution to the welfare of society means collectivism.Mill (along with Smith, Say, and the rest of the classical economists) wastrying to defend an individualist system by accepting the fundamental moralideas of its opponents. It did not take Mill long to grasp this contradiction insome terms and amend his political views accordingly. He ended his life as aself-proclaimed “qualified socialist.”[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 122; pb 119.]See also AGNOSTICISM; ALTRUISM; CAPITALISM; COLLECTIVISM; “CONSERVATIVES”; FREESPEECH; HAPPINESS; HEDONISM; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; PLEASURE and PAIN; “PUBLICINTEREST,” the; UTILITARIANISM; VALUES. Mind-Body Dichotomy. See Soul-Body Dichotomy. Minority Rights. The smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those whodeny individual rights, cannot claim to be defenders of minorities.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 61.]The defense of minority rights is acclaimed today, virtually by everyone, as amoral principle of a high order. But this principle, which forbidsdiscrimination, is applied by most of the “liberal” intellectuals in adiscriminatory manner: it is applied only to racial or religious minorities. Itis not applied to that small, exploited, denounced, defenseless minority whichconsists of businessmen.Yet every ugly, brutal aspect of injustice toward racial or religious minoritiesis being practiced toward businessmen.[Ibid., 44.]See also BUSINESSMEN; DEMOCRACY; “ETHNICITY”; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; RACISM.

We are not a capitalist system any longer: we are a mixedeconomy, i.e., a mixture of capitalism and statism, of freedom and controls. Amixed economy is a country in the process of disintegration, a civil war ofpressure-groups looting and devouring one another.[“The Obliteration of Capitalism,” CUI, 185.] A mixed economy is a mixture of freedom and controls—with no principles, rules,or theories to define either. Since the introduction of controls necessitatesand leads to further controls, it is an unstable, explosive mixture which,ultimately, has to repeal the controls or collapse into dictatorship. A mixedeconomy has no principles to define its policies, its goals, its laws—noprinciples to limit the power of its government. The only principle of a mixedeconomy—which, necessarily, has to remain unnamed and unacknowledged—is that noone’s interests are safe, everyone’s interests are on a public auction block,and anything goes for anyone who can get away with it. Such a system—or, moreprecisely, anti-system—breaks up a country into an ever-growing number of enemycamps, into economic groups fighting one another for self preservation in anindeterminate mixture of defense and offense, as the nature of such a jungledemands. While, politically, a mixed economy preserves the semblance of anorganized society with a semblance of law and order, economically it is theequivalent of the chaos that had ruled China for centuries: a chaos of robbergangs looting—and draining—the productive elements of the country.A mixed economy is rule by pressure groups. It is an amoral, institutionalizedcivil war of special interests and lobbies, all fighting to seize a momentarycontrol of the legislative machinery, to extort some special privilege at oneanother’s expense by an act of government—i.e., by force. In the absence ofindividual rights, in the absence of any moral or legal principles, a mixedeconomy’s only hope to preserve its precarious semblance of order, to restrainthe savage, desperately rapacious groups it itself has created, and to preventthe legalized plunder from running over into plain, unlegalized looting of allby all—is compromise; compromise on everything and in every realm—material,spiritual, inteuectuat—so that no group would step over the line by demandingtoo much and topple the whole rotted structure. If the game is to continue,nothing can be permitted to remain firm, solid, absolute, untouchable;everything (and everyone) has to be fluid, flexible, indeterminate, approximate.By what standard are anyone’s actions to be guided? By the expediency of anyimmediate moment.The only danger, to a mixed economy, is any not-to-be-compromised value, virtue,or idea. The only threat is any uncompromising person, group, or movement. Theonly enemy is integrity.[“The New Fascism: Rule by Consensus,” CUI, 206.] There can be no compromise between freedom and government controls; to accept“just a few controls” is to surrender the principle of inalienable individualrights and to substitute for it the principle of the government’s unlimited,arbitrary power, thus delivering oneself into gradual enslavement. As an exampleof this process, observe the present domestic policy of the United States.[“Doesn’t Life Require Compromise?” VOS, 86; pb 68.] You have seen, within the span of the last few years, that controls breed morecontrols, and that the proliferation of controls breeds the proliferation ofpressure groups. Today, you see political manipulators setting up new conflicts,such as ethnic minorities against the majority, the young against the old, theold against the middle, women against men, even welfare-recipients against theself-supporting. Openly and cynically, these new groups clamor for “a biggerslice of the pie” (which you have to bake).[“The Principals and the Principles,” ARL, II, 21, 3.] In a controlled (or mixed) economy, a legislator’s job consists in sacrificingsome men to others. No matter what choice he makes, no choice of this kind canbe morally justified (and never has been). Proceeding from an immoral base, nodecision of his can be honest or dishonest, just or unjust—these concepts areinapplicable. He becomes, therefore, an easy target for the promptings of anypressure group, any lobbyist, any influence-peddler, any maniputator—he has nostandards by which to judge or to resist them. You do not know what hiddenpowers drive him or what he is doing. Neither does he.[Ibid., 4.] If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist,a mixed economy would bring them into existence.[“The Pull Peddlers,” CUI, 170.] A mixed economy has to reach the day when it faces a final crossroad: either theprivate sector regains its freedom and starts rebuilding—or it gives up and letsthe absolute state take over the shambles.[“A Preview,” ARL, 1, 23, 4.] See also CAPITALISM; COMPROMISE; FREEDOM; GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS;INTERVENTIONISM (ECONOMIC); LOBBYING; PHYSICAL FORCE; STATISM. Modern Art. As a re-creation of reality, a work of art has to berepresentational; its freedom of stylization is limited by the requirement ofintelligibility; if it does not present an intelligible subject, it ceases to beart.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 75.] Decomposition is the postscript to the death of a human body; disintegration isthe preface to the death of a human mind. Disintegration is the keynote and goalof modern art—the disintegration of man’s conceptual faculty, and theretrogression of an adult mind to the state of a mewling infant.To reduce man’s consciousness to the level of sensations, with no capacity tointegrate them, is the intention behind the reducing of language to grunts, ofliterature to “moods,” of painting to smears, of sculpture to slabs, of music tonoise.But there is a philosophically and psychopathologically instructive element inthe spectacle of that gutter. It demonstrates—by the negative means of anabsence—the relationships of art to philosophy, of reason to man’s survival, ofhatred for reason to hatred for existence. After centuries of the philosophers’war against reason, they have succeeded —by the method of vivisection—inproducing exponents of what man is like when deprived of his rational faculty,and these in turn are giving us images of what existence is like to a being withan empty skull.While the alleged advocates of reason oppose “system-building” and haggleapologetically over concrete-bound words or mystically floating abstractions,its enemies seem to know that integration is the psycho-epistemological key toreason, that art is man’s psycho-epistemological conditioner, and that if reasonis to be destroyed, it is man’s integrating capacity that has to be destroyed.It is highly doubtful that the practitioners and admirers of modern art have theintellectual capacity to understand its philosophical meaning; all they need todo is indulge the worst of their subconscious premises. But their leaders dounderstand the issue consciously: the father of modern art is Immanuel Kant (seehis Critique of Judgment).I do not know which is worse: to practice modern art as a colossal fraud or todo it sincerely.Those who do not wish to be the passive, silent victims of frauds of this kind,can learn from modern art the practical importance of philosophy, and theconsequences of philosophical default. Specifically, it is the destruction oflogic that disarmed the victims, and, more specifically, the destruction ofdefinitions. Definitions are the guardians of rationality, the first line ofdefense against the chaos of mental disintegration.Works of art—tike everything else in the universe—are entities of a specificnature: the concept requires a definition by their essential characteristics,which distinguish them from all other existing entities. The genus of art worksis: man-made objects which present a selective recreation of reality accordingto the artist’s metaphysical value-judgments, by means of a specific materialmedium. The species are the works of the various branches of art, defined by theparticular media which they employ and which indicate their relation to thevarious elements of man’s cognitive faculty.Man’s need of precise definitions rests on the Law of Identity: A is A, a thingis itself. A work of art is a specific entity which possesses a specific nature.If it does not, it is not a work of art. If it is merely a material object, itbelongs to some category of material objects—and if it does not belong to anyparticular category, it belongs to the one reserved for such phenomena: junk.“Something made by an artist” is not a definition of art. A beard and a vacantstare are not the defining characteristics of an artist.“Something in a frame hung on a wall” is not a definition of painting.“Something with a number of pages in a binding” is not a definition ofliterature.“Something piled together” is not a definition of sculpture.“Something made of sounds produced by anything” is not a definition of music.“Something glued on a flat surface” is not a definition of any art. There is noart that uses glue as a medium. Blades of grass glued on a sheet of paper torepresent grass might be good occupational therapy for retarded children—thoughI doubt it—but it is not art.“Because I felt like it” is not a definition or validation of anything.There is no place for whim in any human activity—if it is to be regarded ashuman. There is no place for the unknowable, the unintelligible, theundefinable, the non-objective in any human product. This side of an insaneasylum, the actions of a human being are motivated by a conscious purpose; whenthey are not, they are of no interest to anyone outside a psychotherapist’soffice. And when the practitioners of modern art declare that they don’t knowwhat they are doing or what makes them do it, we should take their word for itand give them no further consideration.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 76.] As an example of an entire field of activity based on nothing but the Argumentfrom Intimidation, I give you modern art—where, in order to prove that they dopossess the special insight possessed only by the mystic “elite,” the populaceare trying to surpass one another in loud exclamations on the splendor of somebare (but smudged) piece of canvas. [“The Argument from Intimidation,” VOS, 193; pb 140.] Just as modern philosophy is dominated by the attempt to destroy the conceptuallevel of man’s consciousness and even the perceptual level, reducing man’sawareness to mere sensations—so modern art and literature are dominated by theattempt to disintegrate man’s consciousness and reduce it to mere sensations, tothe “enjoyment” of meaningless colors, noises and moods.The art of any given period or culture is a faithful mirror of that culture’sphilosophy. If you see obscene, dismembered monstrosities leering at you fromtoday’s esthetic mirrors—the aborted creations of mediocrity, irrationality andpanic—you are seeing the embodied, concretized reality of the philosophicalpremises that dominate today’s culture. Only in this sense can thosemanifestations be called “art”—not by the intention or accomplishment of theirperpetrators.[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 79; pb 97.] The composite picture of man that emerges from the art of our time is thegigantic figure of an aborted embryo whose limbs suggest a vaguely anthropoidshape, who twists his upper extremity in a frantic quest for a light that cannotpenetrate its empty sockets, who emits inarticulate sounds resembling snarls andmoans, who crawls through a bloody muck, red froth dripping from his jaws, andstruggles to throw the froth at his own non-existent face, who pausesperiodically and, lifting the stumps of his arms, screams in abysmal terror atthe universe at large.Engendered by generations of anti-rational philosophy, three emotions dominatethe sense of life of modern man: fear, guilt and pity (more precisely,self-pity). Fear, as the appropriate emotion of a creature deprived of his meansof survival, his mind; guilt, as the appropriate emotion of a creature devoid ofmoral values; pity, as the means of escape from these two, as the only responsesuch a creature could beg for. A sensitive, discriminating man, who has absorbedthat sense of life, but retained some vestige of self-esteem, will avoid sorevealing a profession as art. But this does not stop the others.Fear, guilt and the quest for pity combine to set the trend of art in the samedirection, in order to express, justify and rationalize the artists’ ownfeelings. To justify a chronic fear, one has to portray existence as evil; toescape from guilt and arouse pity, one has to portray man as impotent andinnately loathsome. Hence the competition among modern artists to find everlower levels of depravity and ever higher degrees of mawkishness—a competitionto shock the public out of its wits and jerk its tears. Hence the frantic searchfor misery, the descent from compassionate studies of alcoholism and sexualperversion to dope, incest, psychosis, murder, cannibalism.[“Bootleg Romanticism,” RM, 122; pb 130.] See also ARGUMENT from INTIMIDATION; ART; DEFINITIONS; GENUS and SPECIES;INTEGRATION (MENTAL); OBJECTIVITY; PERCEPTION; PHILOSOPHY; REASON; SENSATIONS;SUBJECTIVISM: WHIMS/WHIM-WORSHIP. Money. Money is the tool of men who have reached a high level of productivityand a long-range control over their lives. Money is not merely a tool ofexchange: much more importantly, it is a tool of saving, which permits delayedconsumption and buys time for future production. To fulfill this requirement,money has to be some material commodity which is imperishable, rare,homogeneous, easily stored, not subject to wide fluctuations of value, andalways in demand among those you trade with. This leads you to the decision touse gold as money. Cold money is a tangible value in itself and a token ofwealth actually produced. When you accept a gold coin in payment for your goods,you actually deliver the goods to the buyer; the transaction is as safe assimple harter. When you store your savings in the form of gold coins, theyrepresent the goods which you have actually produced and which have gone to buytime for other producers, who will keep the productive process going, so thatyou’ll be able to trade your coins for goods any time you wish. time you wish.[“Egalitarianism and Inflation,” PWNI, 154; pb 127.] Money cannot function as money, i.e., as a medium of exchange, unless it isbacked by actual. unconsumed goods.[“Hunger and Freedom,” ARL, III, 22, 3.] So you think that money is the root of all evil? ... Have you ever asked what isthe root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can’t exist unless thereare goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape ofthe principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade andgive value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim yourproduct by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money ismade possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?When you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on theconviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. Itis not the moochers or the looters who give value to money. Not an ocean oftears nor all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in yourwallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of paper,which should have been gold, are a token of honor—your claim upon the energy ofthe men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in theworld around you there are men who will not default on that moral principlewhich is the root of money. Is this what you consider evil?Have you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electricgenerator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort ofunthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to youby men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food bymeans of nothing but physical motions —and you’ll learn that man’s mind is theroot of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed onearth.But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? Whatstrength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is theproduct of man’s capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who invents amotor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made by theintelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of theincompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is made—beforeit can be looted or mooched—made by the effort of every honest man, each to theextent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he can’t consume morethan he has produced.[“The Meaning of Money,” FNI, 104; pb 88.] Money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his effort.Money allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except the voluntarychoice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in return. Moneypermits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth tothe men who buy them, but no more. Money permits no deals except those to mutualbenefit by the unforced judgment of the traders.[Ibid., 105; pb 89.] So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with oneanother—their only substitute, if they abandon money, is the muzzle of a gun.[Ibid., 108; pb 91.] Most people lump together into the same category all men who become rich,refusing to consider the essential question: the source of the riches, the meansby which the wealth was acquired.Money is a tool of exchange; it represents wealth only so long as it can betraded for material goods and services. Wealth does not grow in nature; it hasto be produced by men. Nature gives us only the raw materials, but it is man’smind that has to discover the knowledge of how to use them. It is man’s thinkingand labor that transform the materials into food, clothing, shelter ortelevision sets—into all the goods that men require for their survival, comfortand pleasure.Behind every step of humanity’s long climb from the cave to New York City, thereis the man who took that step for the first time—the man who discovered how tomake a fire or a wheel or an airplane or an electric light.When people refuse to consider the source of wealth, what they refuse torecognize is the fact that wealth is the product of man’s intellect, of hiscreative ability, fully as much as is art, science, philosophy or any otherhuman value.[“The Money-Making Personality,” TOF, Feb. 1983, 2.] Money is a great power—because, in a free or even a semi-free society, it is afrozen form of productive energy. And, therefore, the spending of money is agrave responsibility. Contrary to the altruists and the advocates of theso-called “academic freedom,” it is a moral crime to give money to support ideaswith which you disagree; it means: ideas which you consider wrong, false, evil.It is a moral crime to give money to support your own destroyers.[“The Sanction of the Victims,” TOF, April 1982, 7.]See also CONSUMPTION; CREDIT; GOLD STANDARD; INFLATION; MARKET VALUE; OBJECTIVETHEORY of VALUES; PHYSICAL FORCE; PRODUCTION; PURCHASING POWER; SANCTION of theVICTIM; SAVINGS; SELFISHNESS; TRADER PRINCIPLE. Monopoly. The alleged purpose of the Antitrust laws was to protect competition;that purpose was based on the socialistic fallacy that a free, unregulatedmarket will inevitably lead to the establishment of coercive monopolies. But, infact, no coercive monopoly has ever been or ever can be established by means offree trade on a free market. Every coercive monopoly was created by governmentintervention into the economy: by special privileges, such as franchises orsubsidies, which closed the entry of competitors into a given field, bylegislative action. (For a full demonstration of this fact, I refer you to theworks of the best economists.)[“Antitrust: The Rule of Unreason,” TON, Feb. 1962, 5.] A “coercive monopoly” is a business concern that can set its prices andproduction policies independent of the market, with immunity from competition,from the law of supply and demand. An economy dominated by such monopolies wouldbe rigid and stagnant.The necessary precondition of a coercive monopoly is closed entry—the barring ofall competing producers from a given field. This can be accomplished only by anact of government intervention, in the form of special regulations, subsidies,or franchises. Without government assistance, it is impossible for a would-bemonopolist to set and maintain his prices and production policies independent ofthe rest of the economy. For if he attempted to set his prices and production ata level that would yield profits to new entrants significantly above thoseavailable in other fields, competitors would be sure to invade his industry.[Alan Greenspan, “Antitrust,” CUI, 68.]See also ANTITRUST LAWS; COMPETITION; ECONOMIC POWER us. POLITICAL POWER; FREEMARKET; INTERVENTIONISM (ECO NOMIC). Moral Cowardice. Moral cowardice is fear of upholding the good because it isgood, and fear of opposing the evil because it is evil.[“Altruism as Appeasement,” TO, Jan. 1966, 5.)Moral cowardice is the necessary consequence of discarding morality asinconsequential. It is the common symptom of all intellectual appeasers. Theimage of the brute is the symbol of an appeaser’s belief in the supremacy ofevil, which means—not in conscious terms, but in terms of his quaking, cringing,blinding panic—that when his mind judges a thing to be evil, his emotionsproclaim its power, and the more evil, the more powerful.[Ibid., 4.] See also APPEASEMENT; COMPROMISE; COURAGE and CONFIDENCE; EVIL; MORAL JUDGMENT;MORALITY. Moral Judgment. One must never fail to pronounce moral judgment.Nothing can corrupt and disintegrate a culture or a man’s character asthoroughly as does the precept of moral agnosticism, the idea that one mustnever pass moral judgment on others, that one must be morally tolerant ofanything, that the good consists of never distinguishing good from evil.It is obvious who profits and who loses by such a precept. It is not justice orequal treatment that you grant to men when you abstain equally from praisingmen’s virtues and from condemning men’s vices. When your impartial attitudedeclares, in effect, that neither the good nor the evil may expect anything fromyou—whom do you betray and whom do you encourage?But to pronounce moral judgment is an enormous responsibility. To be a judge,one must possess an unimpeachable character: one need not be omniscient orinfallible, and it is not an issue of errors of knowledge; one needs anunbreached integrity, that is, the absence of any indulgence in conscious,willful evil. Just as a judge in a court of law may err, when the evidence isinconclusive, but may not evade the evidence available, nor accept bribes, norallow any personal feeling, emotion, desire or fear to obstruct his mind’sjudgment of the facts of reality—so every rational person must maintain anequally strict and solemn integrity in the courtroom within his own mind, wherethe responsibility is more awesome than in a public tribunal, because he, thejudge, is the only one to know when he has been impeached.[“How Does One Lead a Rational Life in an Irrational Society?” VOS, 89; pb 71.] If people did not indulge in such abject evasions as the claim that somecontemptible liar “means well”—that a mooching bum “can’t help it”—that ajuvenile delinquent “needs love”—that a criminal “doesn’t know any better”—thata power-seeking politician is moved by patriotic concern for “the publicgood”—that communists are merely “agrarian reformers”—the history of the pastfew decades, or centuries, would have been different.[Ibid., 93; pb 73.] The precept: “Judge not, that ye be not judged” ... is an abdication of moralresponsibility: it is .a moral blank check one gives to others in exchange for amoral blank check one expects for oneself.There is no escape from the fact that men have to make choices; so long as menhave to make choices, there is no escape from moral values; so long as moralvalues are at stake, no moral neutrality is possible. To abstain from condemninga torturer, is to become an accessory to the torture and murder of his victims.The moral principle to adopt in this issue, is: “Judge, and be prepared to bejudged.”The opposite of moral neutrality is not a blind, arbitrary, self-righteouscondemnation of any idea, action or person that does not fit one’s mood, one’smemorized slogans or one’s snap judgment of the moment. Indiscriminate toleranceand indiscriminate condemnation are not two opposites: they are two variants ofthe same evasion. To declare that “everybody is white” or “everybody is black”or “everybody is neither white nor black, but gray,” is not a moral judgment,but an escape from the responsibility of moral judgment.To judge means: to evaluate a given concrete by reference to an abstractprinciple or standard. It is not an easy task; it is not a task that can beperformed automatically by one’s feelings, “instincts” or hunches. It is a taskthat requires the most precise, the most exacting, the most ruthlessly objectiveand rational process of thought. It is fairly easy to grasp abstract moralprinciples; it can be very difficult to apply them to a given situation,particularly when it involves the moral character of another person. When onepronounces moral judgment, whether in praise or in blame, one must be preparedto answer “Why?” and to prove one’s case—to oneself and to any rationalinquirer.[Ibid., 91; pb 72.] The man who refuses to judge, who neither agrees nor disagrees, who declaresthat there are no absolutes and believes that he escapes responsibility, is theman responsible for all the blood that is now spilled in the world. Reality isan absolute, existence is an absolute, a speck of dust is an absolute and so isa human life....There are two sides to every issue: one side is right and the other is wrong,but the middle is always evil. The man who is wrong still retains some respectfor truth, if only by accepting the responsibility of choice. But the man in themiddle is the knave who blanks out the truth in order to pretend that no choiceor values exist.[GS, FNI, 216; pb 173.] Morality is the province of philosophical judgment, not ot psychologicaldiagnosis. Moral judgment must be objective, i.e., based on perceivable,demonstrable facts. A man’s moral character must be judged on the basis of hisactions, his statements and his conscious convictions—not on the basis ofinferences (usually, spurious) about his subconscious.A man is not to be condemned or excused on the grounds of the state of hissubconscious. His psychological problems are his private concern which is not tobe paraded in public and not to be made a burden on innocent victims or ahunting ground for poaching psychologizers. Morality demands that one treat andjudge men as responsible adults.This means that one grants a man the respect of assuming that he is conscious ofwhat he says and does, and one judges his statements and actionsphilosophically, i.e., as what they are—not psychologically, i.e., as leads orclues to some secret, hidden, unconscious meaning. One neither speaks norlistens to people in code.[“The Psychology of ‘Psychologizing,’ ”TO, March 1971, 5.] It is not man’s subconscious, but his conscious mind that is subject to hisdirect control—and to moral judgment. It is a specific individual’s consciousmind that one judges (on the basis of objective evidence) in order to judge hismoral character.... The alternative is not: rash, indiscriminate moralizing or cowardly, evasivemoral neutrality—i.e., condemnation without knowledge or the refusal to know, inorder not to condemn. These are two interchangeable variants of the same motive:escape from the responsibility of cognition and of moral judgment.[Ibid., 6.] See also ABSOLUTES; CHARACTER; COMPROMISE; ERRORS of KNOWLEDGE vs. BREACHES ofMORALITY; EVASION; EVIL; JUSTICE; MORALITY; MORAL COWARDICE; “PSYCHOLOGIZING”;RATIONALITY; STANDARD of VALUE; VIRTUE. Moral.Practical Dichotomy. Your impracticable creed ... [inculcates a] lethaltenet: the belief that the moral and the practical are opposites. Sincechildhood, you have been running from the terror of a choice you have neverdared fully to identify: If the practical, whatever you must practice to exist,whatever works, succeeds, achieves your purpose, whatever brings you food andjoy, whatever profits you, is evil— and if the good, the moral, is theimpractical, whatever fails, destroys, frustrates, whatever injures you andbrings you loss or pain—then your choice is to be moral or to live.The sole result of that murderous doctrine was to remove morality from life. Yougrew up to believe that moral laws bear no relation to the job of living, exceptas an impediment and threat, that man’s existence is an amoral jungle whereanything goes and anything works. And in that fog of switching definitions whichdescends upon a frozen mind, you have forgotten that the evils damned by yourcreed were the virtues required for living, and you have come to believe thatactual evils are the practical means of existence. Forgetting that theimpractical “good” was self-sacrifice, you believe that self-esteem isimpractical; forgetting that the practical “evil” was production, you believethat robbery is practical.Swinging like a helpless branch in the wind of an uncharted moral wilderness,you dare not fully to be evil or fully to live. When you are honest, you feelthe resentment of a sucker; when you cheat, you feel terror and shame. When youare happy, your joy is diluted by guilt; when you suffer, your pain is augmentedby the feeling that pain is your natural state. You pity the men you admire, youbelieve they are doomed to fail; you envy the men you hate, you believe they arethe masters of existence. You feel disarmed when you come up against ascoundrel: you believe that evil is bound to win, since the moral is theimpotent, the impractical.Morality, to you, is a phantom scarecrow made of duty, of boredom, ofpunishment, of pain, a cross-breed between the first schoolteacher of your pastand the tax collector of your present, a scarecrow standing in a barren field,waving a stick to chase away your pleasures—and pleasure, to you, is aliquor-soggy brain, a mindless slut, the stupor of a moron who stakes his cashon some animal’s race, since pleasure cannot be moral.If you identify your actual belief, you will find a triple damnation—ofyourself, of life, of virtue—in the grotesque conclusion you have reached: youbelieve that morality is a necessary evil.[GS, FNI, 214; pb 171.]See also ALTRUISM; “DUTY”; EVIL; GOOD, the; MORALITY; ORIGINAL SIN; PLEASURE andPAIN; RATIONALITY; SACRIFICE; SELFISHNESS; STANDARD of VALUE. Morality. What is morality, or ethics? It is a code of values to guide man’schoices and actions—the choices and actions that determine the purpose and thecourse of his life. Ethics, as a science, deals with discovering and definingsuch a code.The first question that has to be answered, as a precondition of any attempt todefine, to judge or to accept any specific system of ethics, is: Why does manneed a code of values?Let me stress this. The first question is not: What particular code of valuesshould man accept? The first question is: Does man need values at all—and why?[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 2; pb 13.] Ethics is an objective, metaphysical necessity of man’s survival....I quote from Galt’s speech: “Man has been called a rational being, butrationality is a matter of choice—and the alternative his nature offers him is:rational being or suicidal animal. Man has to be man—by choice; he has to holdhis life as a vatue—by choice; he has to learn to sustain it —by choice; he hasto discover the values it requires and practice his virtues—by choice. A code ofvalues accepted by choice is a code of morality.”The standard of value of the Objectivist ethics—the standard by which one judgeswhat is good or evit—is man’s life, or: that which is required for man’ssurvival qua man.Since reason is man’s basic means of survival, that which is proper to the lifeof a rational being is the good; that which negates, opposes or destroys it isthe evil.Since everything man needs has to be discovered by his own mind and produced byhis own effort, the two essentials of the method of survival proper to arational being are: thinking and productive work.[Ibid., 16; pb 23.]Man must choose his actions, values and goals by the standard of that which isproper to man—in order to achieve, maintain, fulfill and enjoy that ultimatevalue, that end in itself, which is his own life.[Ibid., 19; pb 25.] Life or death is man’s only fundamental alternative. To live is his basic act ofchoice. If he chooses to live, a rational ethics will tell him what principlesof action are required to implement his choice. If he does not choose to live,nature will take its course.[“Causality Versus Duty,” PWNI, 118; pb 99.] The purpose of morality is to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoyyourself and live.[GS, FNI, 150; pb 123.] Sweep aside those parasites of subsidized classrooms, who live on the profits ofthe mind of others and proclaim that man needs no morality, no values, no codeof behavior. They, who pose as scientists and claim that man is only an animal,do not grant him inclusion in the law of existence they have granted to thelowest of insects. They recognize that every living species has a way ofsurvival demanded by its nature, they do not claim that a fish can live out ofwater or that a dog can live without its sense of smell—but man, they claim, themost complex of beings, man can survive in any way whatever, man has noidentity, no nature, and there’s no practical reason why he cannot live with hismeans of survival destroyed, with his mind throttled and placed at the disposalof any orders they might care to issue.Sweep aside those hatred-eaten mystics, who pose as friends of humanity andpreach that the highest virtue man can practice is to hold his own life as of novalue. Do they tell you that the purpose of morality is to curb man’s instinctof self-preservation? It is for the purpose of self-preservation that man needsa code of morality. The only man who desires to be moral is the man who desiresto live.[Ibid.] If I were to speak your kind of language, I would say that man’s only moralcommandment is: Thou shalt think. But a “moral commandment” is a contradictionin terms. The moral is the chosen, not the forced; the understood, not theobeyed. The moral is the rational, and reason accepts no commandments.My morality, the morality of reason, is contained in a single axiom: existenceexists—and in a single choice: to live. The rest proceeds from these. To live,man must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of his life:Reason—Purpose—Self-esteem. Reason, as his only tool of knowledge—Purpose, ashis choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve—Self-esteem,as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person isworthy of happiness, which means: is worthy of living. These three values implyand require all of man’s virtues, and all his virtues pertain to the relation ofexistence and consciousness: rationality, independence, integrity, honesty,justice, productiveness, pride.[Ibid., 156; pb 128.] You who prattle that morality is social and that man would need no morality on adesert island—it is on a desert island that he would need it most. Let him tryto claim, when there are no victims to pay for it, that a rock is a house, thatsand is clothing, that food will drop into his mouth without cause or effort,that he will collect a harvest tomorrow by devouring his stock seed today—andreality will wipe him out, as he deserves; reality will show him that life is avalue to be bought and that thinking is the only coin noble enough to buy it.[Ibid., 156; pb 127.]A moral code is a system of teleological measurement which grades the choicesand actions open to man, according to the degree to which they achieve orfrustrate the code’s standard of value. The standard is the end, to which man’sactions are the means.A moral code is a set of abstract principles; to practice it, an individual musttranslate it into the appropriate concretes—he must choose the particular goalsand values which he is to pursue. This requires that he define his particularhierarchy of values, in the order of their importance, and that he actaccordingly.[ITOE, 42.] Morality per tains only to the sphere of man’s free will—only to those actionswhich are open to his choice.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 4.] A sin without volition is a slap at morality and an insolent contradiction interms: that which is outside the possibility of choice is outside the provinceof morality. If man is evil by birth, he has no will, no power to change it; ifhe has no will, he can be neither good nor evil; a robot is amoral. To hold, asman’s sin, a fact not open to his choice is a mockery of morality.[GS, FNI, 168; pb 136.] In spite of all their irrationalities, inconsistencies, hypocrisies andevasions, the majority of men will not act, in major issues, without a sense ofbeing morally right and will not oppose the morality they have accepted. Theywill break it, they will cheat on it, but they will not oppose it; and when theybreak it, they take the blame on themselves. The power of morality is thegreatest of all intellectual powers—and mankind’s tragedy lies in the fact thatthe vicious moral code men have accepted destroys them by means of the bestwithin them.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 81; pb 67.]See Conceptual Index: Ethics. Motion. They proclaim that there are no entities, that nothing exists butmotion, and blank out the fact that motion presupposes the thing which moves,that without the concept of entity, there can be no such concept as “motion.”[GS, FNI, 191; pb 154.]Motions are motions of entities; ... a child is aware of motion perceptually,but cannot conceptualize “motion” until he has formed some concepts of thatwhich moves, i.e., of entities.[ITOE, 18. ] Concepts of motion are formed by specifying the distinctive nature of the motionand of the entities performing it, and/or of the medium in which it isperformed—and omitting the particular measurements of any given instance of suchmotion and of the entities involved. For instance, the concept “walking” denotesa certain kind of motion performed by living entities possessing legs, and doesnot apply to the motion of a snake or of an automobile. The concept “swimming”denotes the motion of any living entity propelling itself through water, anddoes not apply to the motion of a boat. The concept “flying” denotes the motionof any entity propelling itself through the air, whether a bird or an airplane.[Ibid., 20.] The concept of “location” arises in the context of entities which are at restrelative to each other. A thing’s location is the place where it is situated.But a moving object is not at any one place—it is in motion. One can locate amoving object only in the sense of specifying the location of the larger fixedregion through which it is moving during a given period of time. For instance:“Between 4:00 and 4:05 p.m., the car was moving through New York City.” One cannarrow down the time period and, correspondingly, the region; but one cannotnarrow down the time to nothing in the contradictory attempt to locate themoving car at a single, fixed position. If it is moving, it is not at a fixedposition.The law of identity does not attempt to freeze reality. Change exists; it is afact of reality. When a thing is changing, that is what it is doing, that is itsidentity for that period. What is still is still. What is in process is inprocess. A is A.[Harry Binswanger, “Q & A Department: Identity and Motion,” TOF, Dec. 1981, 14.] See also CHANGE; ENTITY; HIERARCHY of KNOWLEDGE; “STOLEN CONCEPT,” FALLACY of. Motion Pictures. In motion pictures or television, literature is the ruler andterm-setter, with music serving only as an incidental, background accompaniment.Screen and television plays are subcategories of the drama, and in the dramaticarts “the play is the thing.” The play is that which makes it art; the playprovides the end, to which all the rest is the means. [“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 71.] Visual art is an intrinsic part of films in a much deeper sense than the mereselection of sets and camera angles ... a “motion picture” is literally that,and has to he a stylized visual composition in motion....Potentially, motion pictures are a great art, but that potential has not as yetbeen actualized, except in single instances and random moments. An art thatrequires the synchronization of so many esthetic elements and so many differenttalents cannot develop in a period of philosophical-cultural disintegration suchas the present. Its development requires the creative cooperation of men who areunited, not necessarily by their formal philosophical convictions, but by theirfundamental view of man, i.e.. by their sense of life.[Ibid., 72.] The movies are still in the position of a retarded child: born into a collapsingfamily, i.e., a deteriorating culture, an art that demanded Romanticism was leftto struggle blindly in the midst of a value-desert. It produced a few rare,almost accidental sparks of true greatness, displaying its untouched potential,then was swallowed again in a growing tide of mediocrity.[Frank O’Connor, review of Lillian Gish’s The Movies, Mr. Griffith, and Me, TO,Nov. 1969, 8.] Today, the movies have gone all the way back to the pre-Griffith days; orrather, they have accepted, on a broad scale, the error that destroyed D. W.Griffith: the belief that a movie is primarily a director’s art, that content,story, and cast do not matter—i.e., that it is an art concerned only with the“how,” not the “what”—i.e., that it is an art of means, without ends—i.e., thatit is the field of trick photographers, not of artists.[Ibid., 15.] See also ART: DIRECTOR; LITERATURE; ROMANTICISM; SENSE of LIFE. Motivation. Motivation is a key-concept in psychology and in fiction. It is aman’s basic premises and values that form his character and move him toaction—and in order to understand a man’s character, it is the motivation behindhis actions that we must understand. To know “what makes a man tick,” we mustask: “What is he after?”To re-create the reality of his characters, to make both their nature and theiractions intelligible, it is their motivation that a writer has to reveal. He maydo it gradually, revealing it bit by bit, building up the evidence as the storyprogresses, but at the end of the novel the reader must know why the charactersdid the things they did.[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 67; pb 88.]See also ART; FREE WILL; LITERATURE; MOTIVATION by LOVE vs. by FEAR; PSYCHOLOGY;VALUES. Motivation by Love vs. by Fear. Achieving life is not the equivalent of avoidingdeath. Joy is not the absence of pain.[GS, FNI, 166; pb 135.] You seek escape from pain. We seek the achievement of happiness. You exist forthe sake of avoiding punishment. We exist for the sake of earning rewards.Threats will not make us function; fear is not our incentive. It is not deaththat we wish to avoid, but life that we wish to live.You, who have lost the concept of the difference, you who claim that fear andjoy are incentives of equal power—and secretly add that fear is the more“practical”—you do not wish to live, and only fear of death still holds you tothe existence you have damned.[Ibid., 167; pb 135.] See also MOTIVATION; HAPPINESS; PLEASURE and PAIN; SUFFERING; VALUES; ZERO,REIFICATION of. Music. Music employs the sounds produced by the periodic vibrations of asonorous body, and evokes man’s sense-of-life emotions.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 46.] The fundamental difference between music and the other arts lies in the factthat music is experienced as if it reversed man’s normal psycho-epistemologicalprocess.The other arts create a physical object (i.e., an object perceived by man’ssenses, be it a book or a painting) and the psycho-epistemological process goesfrom the perception of the object to the conceptual grasp of its meaning, to anappraisal in terms of one’s basic values, to a consequent emotion. The patternis: from perception—to conceptual understanding—to appraisal—to emotion.The pattern of the process involved in music is: from perception—to emotion—toappraisal—to conceptual understanding.Music is experienced as if it had the power to reach man’s emotions directly.[Ibid., 50.] Psycho-epistemologically, the pattern of the response to music seems to be asfollows: one perceives the music, one grasps the suggestion of a certainemotional state and, with one’s sense of life serving as the criterion, oneappraises this state as enjoyable or painful, desirable or undesirable,significant or negligible, according to whether it corresponds to or contradictsone’s fundamental feeling about life.[Ibid., 53.] It is in terms of his fundamental emotions—i.e., the emotions produced by hisown metaphysical value-judgments—that man responds to music.Music cannot tell a story, it cannot deal with concretes, it cannot convey aspecific existential phenomenon, such as a peaceful countryside or a stormy sea.the theme of a composition entitled “Spring Song” is not spring, but theemotions which spring evoked in the composer. Even concepts which,intellectually, belong to a complex level of abstraction, such as “peace,”“revolution,” “religion,” are too specific, too concrete to be expressed inmusic. All that music can do with such themes is convey the emotions ofserenity, or defiance, or exaltation. Liszt’s “St. Francis Walking on theWaters” was inspired by a specific legend, but what it conveys is a passionatelydedicated struggle and triumph—by whom and in the name of what, is for eachindividual listener to supply.Music communicates emotions, which one grasps, but does not actually feel; whatone feels is a suggestion, a kind of distant, dissociated, depersonalizedemotion—until and unless it unites with one’s own sense of life. But since themusic’s emotional content is not communicated conceptually or evokedexistentially, one does feel it in some peculiar, subterranean way.Music conveys the same categories of emotions to listeners who hold widelydivergent views of life. As a rule, men agree on whether a given piece of musicis gay or sad or violent or solemn. But even though, in a generalized way, theyexperience the same emotions in response to the same music, there are radicaldifferences in how they appraise this experience—i. e.. how they feel aboutthese feelings.[Ibid., 52.] The formulation of a common vocabulary of music ... would require: a translationof the musical experience, the inner experience, into conceptual terms; anexplanation of why certain sounds strike us a certain way; a definition of theaxioms of musical perception, from which the appropriate esthetic principlescould be derived, which would serve as a base for the objective validation ofesthetic judgments....Until a conceptual vocabulary is discovered and defined, no objectively validcriterion of esthetic judgment is possible in the field of music....No one, therefore, can claim the objective superiority of his choices over thechoices of others. Where no objective proof is available, it’s every man forhimself—and only for himself.The nature of musical perception has not been discovered because the key to thesecret of music is physiological—it lies in the nature of the process by whichman perceives sounds—and the answer would require the joint effort of aphysiologist, a psychologist and a philosopher (an esthetician).The start of a scientific approach to this problem and the lead to an answerwere provided by Helmholtz, the great physiologist of the nineteenth century.[Ibid., 55.] From the standpoint of psycho-epistemology, I can offer a hypothesis on thenature of man’s response to music, but I urge the reader to remember that it isonly a hypothesis....One may listen to noise for an hour, a day or a year, and it remains just noise.But musical tones heard in a certain kind of succession produce a differentresult—the human ear and brain integrate them into a new cognitive experience,into what may be called an auditory entity: a melody. The integration is aphysiological process; it is performed unconsciously and automatically. Man isaware of the process only by means of its results.Helmholtz has demonstrated that the essence of musical perception ismathematical: the consonance or dissonance of harmonies depends on the ratios ofthe frequencies of their tones. The brain can integrate a ratio of one to two,for instance, but not of eight to nine....The psycho-epistemological meaning of a given composition lies in the kind ofwork it demands of a listener’s ear and brain.A composition may demand the active alertness needed to resolve complexmathematical relationships—or it may deaden the brain by means of monotonoussimplicity. It may demand a process of building an integrated sum—or it maybreak up the process of integration into an arbitrary series of random bits—orit may obliterate the process by a jumble of soundsmathematically-physiologically impossible to integrate, and thus turn intonoise.The listener becomes aware of this process in the form of a sense of efficacy,or of strain, or of boredom, or of frustration. His reaction is cognitivefunctioning on which he feels at home.|Ibid., 57.] Music gives man’s consciousness the same experience as the other arts: aconcretization of his sense of life. But the abstraction being concretized isprimarily epistemological, rather than metaphysical; the abstraction is man’sconsciousness, i.e., his method of cognitive functioning, which he experiencesin the concrete form of hearing a specific piece of music. A man’s acceptance orrejection of that music depends on whether it calls upon or clashes with,confirms or contradicts, his mind’s way of working. The metaphysical aspect ofthe experience is the sense of a world which he is able to grasp, to which hismind’s working is appropriate.Music is the only phenomenon that permits an adult to experience the process ofdealing with pure sense data. Single musical tones are not percepts, but puresensations; they become percepts only when integrated. Sensations are man’sfirst contact with reality; when integrated into percepts, they are the given,the self-evident, the not-to-be-doubted. Music offers man the singularopportunity to reenact, on the adult level, the primary process of his method ofcognition: the automatic integration of sense data into an intelligible,meaningful entity. To a conceptual consciousness, it is a unique form of restand reward.[Ibid., 59.] See also ART; BALLET; CONCEPT-FORMATION; DANCE; EMOTIONS; PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY;OPERA and OPERETTA; PERFORMING ARTS; SENSATION; SENSE of LIFE. Mystical Ethics. The mystic theory of ethics is explicitly based on the premisethat the standard of value of man’s ethics is set beyond the grave, by the lawsor requirements of another, supernatural dimension, that ethics is impossiblefor man to practice, that it is unsuited for and opposed to man’s life on earth,and that man must take the blame for it and suffer through the whole of hisearthly existence, to atone for the guilt of being unable to practice theimpracticable. The Dark Ages and the Middle Ages are the existential monument tothis theory of ethics.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 33; pb 34.] A mystic code of morality demanding self-sacrifice cannot be promulgated orpropagated without a supreme ruler that becomes the collector of thesacrificing. Traditionally, there have been two such collectors: either God orsociety. The collector had to be inaccessible to mankind at large, and hisauthority had to be revealed only through an elite of special intermediaries,variously called “high priests,” “commissars,” “Gauleiters.” etc.[“The Stimulus and the Response,” PWNI, 177; pb 146.] See also GOD; INTRINSIC THEORY of VALUES; MORALITY; RELIGION; SACRIFICE;STANDARD of VALUE; SUPERNATURALISM; VALUES. Mysticism. What is mysticism? Mysticism is the acceptance of allegations withoutevidence or proof, either apart from or against the evidence of one’s senses andone’s reason. Mysticism is the claim to some non-sensory, non-rational,non-definable, non-identifiable means of knowledge, such as “instinct,”“intuition,” “revelation,” or any form of “just knowing.”Reason is the perception of reality, and rests on a single axiom: the Law ofIdentity.Mysticism is the claim to the perception of some other reality—other than theone in which we live—whose definition is only that it is not natural, it issupernatural, and is to be perceived by some form of unnatural or supernaturalmeans.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 75; pb 62.] The damnation of this earth as a realm where nothing is possible to man butpain, disaster and defeat, a realm inferior to another, “higher,” reality; thedamnation of all values, enjoyment, achievement and success on earth as a proofof depravity; the damnation of man’s mind as a source of pride, and thedamnation of reason as a “limited,” deceptive, unreliable, impotent faculty,incapable of perceiving the “real” reality and the “true” truth; the split ofman in two, setting his consciousness (his soul) against his body, and his moralvalues against his own interest; the damnation of man’s nature, body and self asevil; the commandment of self-sacrifice, renunciation, suffering, obedience,humility and faith, as the good; the damnation of life and the worship of death,with the promise of rewards beyond the grave—these are the necessary tenets ofthe [mystic’s] view of existence, as they have been in every variant of[mystical] philosophy throughout the course of mankind’s history.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 14; pb 18.] To the [mystic], as to an animal, the irreducible primary is the automaticphenomena of his own consciousness.An animal has no critical faculty; he has no control over the function of hisbrain and no power to question its content. To an animal, whatever strikes hisawareness is an absolute that corresponds to reality—or rather, it is adistinction he is incapable of making: reality, to him, is whatever he senses orfeels. And this is the [mystic’s] epistemological ideal, the mode ofconsciousness he strives to induce in himself. To the [mystic], emotions aretools of cognition, and wishes take precedence over facts. He seeks to escapethe risks of a quest for knowledge by obliterating the distinction betweenconsciousness and reality, between the perceiver and the perceived, hoping thatan automatic certainty and an infallible knowledge of the universe will begranted to him by the blind, unfocused stare of his eyes turned inward,contemplating the sensations, the feelings, the urgings, the muggy associationaltwistings projected by the rudderless mechanism of his undirected consciousness.Whatever his mechanism produces is an absolute not to be questioned; andwhenever it clashes with reality, it is reality that he ignores.Since the clash is constant, the [mystic’s] solution is to believe that what heperceives is another, “higher” reality—where his wishes are omnipotent, wherecontradictions are possible and A is non-A, where his assertions, which arefalse on earth, become true and acquire the status of a “superior” truth whichhe perceives by means of a special faculty denied to other, “inferior,” beings.The only validation of his consciousness he can obtain on earth is the beliefand the obedience of others, when they accept his “truth” as superior to theirown perception of reality.[Ibid., 12; pb 17.] A mystic is a man who surrendered his mind at its first encounter with the mindsof others. Somewhere in the distant reaches of his childhood, when his ownunderstanding of reality clashed with the assertions of others, with theirarbitrary orders and contradictory demands, he gave in to so craven a fear ofindependence that he renounced his rational faculty. At the crossroads of thechoice between “I know” and “They say,” he chose the authority of others, hechose to submit rather than to understand, to believe rather than to think.Faith in the supernatural begins as faith in the superiority of others. Hissurrender took the form of the feeling that he must hide his lack ofunderstanding, that others possess some mysterious knowledge of which he aloneis deprived, that reality is whatever they want it to be, through some meansforever denied to him.From then on, afraid to think, he is left at the mercy of unidentified feelings.His feelings become his only guide, his only remnant of personal identity, heclings to them with ferocious possessiveness—and whatever thinking he does isdevoted to the struggle of hiding from himself that the nature of his feelingsis terror.When a mystic declares that he feels the existence of a power superior toreason, he feels it all right, but that power is not an omniscient super-spiritof the universe, it is the consciousness of any passer-by to whom he hassurrendered his own. A mystic is driven by the urge to impress, to cheat, toflatter, to deceive, to force that omnipotent consciousness of others. “They”are his only key to reality, he feels that he cannot exist save by harnessingtheir mysterious power and extorting their unaccountable consent. “They” are hisonly means of perception and, like a blind man who depends on the sight of adog, he feels he must leash them in order to live. To control the consciousnessof others becomes his only passion; power-lust is a weed that grows only in thevacant lots of an abandoned mind.[GS, FNI, 200; pb 160.) The motive of all the attacks on man’s rational faculty—from any quarter, in anyof the endless variations, under the verbal dust of all the murky volumes—is asingle, hidden premise: the desire to exempt consciousness from the law ofidentity. The hallmark of a mystic is the savagely stubborn refusal to acceptthe fact that consciousness, like any other existent, possesses identity, thatit is a faculty of a specific nature, functioning through specific means. Whilethe advance of civilization has been eliminating one area of magic afteranother, the last stand of the believers in the miraculous consists of theirfrantic attempts to regard identity as the disqualifying element ofconsciousness.The implicit, but unadmitted premise of the neo-mystics of modern philosophy, isthe notion that only an ineffable consciousness can acquire a valid knowledge ofreality, that “true” knowledge has to be causeless, i.e., acquired without anymeans of cognition.[ITOE, 106.] Mysticism requires the notion of the unknowable, which is revealed to some andwithheld from others; this divides men into those who feel guilt and those whocash in on it. The two groups are interchangeable, according to circumstances.When being judged, a mystic cries: “I couldn’t help it!” When judging others, hedeclares: “You can’t know, but I can.”[“The Psychulogy of ‘Psychologizing,’ ”TO, March 1971, 1.] There is only one state that fulfills the mystic’s longing for infinity,non-causality, non-identity: death. No matter what unintelligible causes heascribes to his incommunicable feelings, whoever rejects reality rejectsexistence—and the feelings that move him from then on are hatred for all thevalues of man’s life, and lust for all the evils that destroy it.[GS, FNI, 202; pb 162.]The advocates of mysticism are motivated not by a quest for truth, but by hatredfor man’s mind.[“An Untitled Letter,” PWNI, 123; pb 102.] For centuries, the mystics of spirit had existed by running a protectionracket—by making life on earth unbearable, then charging you for consolation andrelief, by forbidding all the virtues that make existence possible, then ridingon the shoulders of your guilt, by declaring production and joy to be sins, thencollecting blackmail from the sinners.[GS, FNI, 190; pb 153.] I have said that faith and force are corollaries, and that mysticism will alwayslead to the rule of brutality. The cause of it is contained in the very natureof mysticism. Reason is the only objective means of communication and ofunderstanding among men; when men deal with one another by means of reason,reality is their objective standard and frame of reference. But when men claimto possess supernatural means of knowledge, no persuasion, communication orunderstanding are possible. Why do we kill wild animals in the jungle? Becauseno other way of dealing with them is open to us. And that is the state to whichmysticism reduces mankind—a state where, in case of disagreement, men have norecourse except to physical violence. And more: no man or mystical elite canhold a whole society subjugated to their arbitrary assertions, edicts and whims,without the use of force. Anyone who resorts to the formula: “It’s so, because Isay so,” will have to reach for a gun, sooner or later. Communists, like allmaterialists, are neo-mystics: it does not matter whether one rejects the mindin favor of revelations or in favor of conditioned reflexes. The basic premiseand the results are the same.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 85; pb 70.] Men have been taught either that knowledge is impossible (skepticism) or that itis available without effort (mysticism). These two positions appear to beantagonists, but are, in fact, two variants on the same theme, two sides of thesame fraudulent coin: the attempt to escape the responsibility of rationalcognition and the absolutism of reality—the attempt to assert the primacy ofconsciousness over existence.Although skepticism and mysticism are ultimately interchangeable, and thedominance of one always leads to the resurgence of the other, they differ in theform of their inner contradiction—the contradiction, in both cases, betweentheir philosophical doctrine and their psychological motivation.Philosophically, the mystic is usually an exponent of the intrinsic (revealed)school of epistemology; the skeptic is usually an advocate of epistemologicalsubjectivism. But, psychologically, the mystic is a subjectivist who usesintrinsicism as a means to claim the primacy of his consciousness over that ofothers. The skeptic is a disillusioned intrinsicist who, having failed to findautomatic supernatural guidance, seeks a substitute in the collectivesubjectivism of others.[ITOE, 105.] Only three brief periods of history were culturally dominated by a philosophy ofreason: ancient Greece, the Renaissance, the nineteenth century. These threeperiods were the source of mankind’s greatest progress in all fields ofintellectual achievement—and the eras of greatest political freedom. The rest ofhuman history was dominated by mysticism of one kind or another, that is: by thebelief that man’s mind is impotent, that reason is futile or evil or both, andthat man must be guided by some irrational “instinct” or feeling or intuition orrevelation, by some form of blind, unreasoning faith. All the centuriesdominated by mysticism were the eras of political tyranny and slavery, of ruleby brute force—from the primitive barbarism of the jungle—to the Pharaohs ofEgypt—to the emperors of Rome—to the feudalism of the Dark and Middle Ages—tothe absolute monarchies of Europe—to the modern dictatorships of Soviet Russia,Nazi Germany and all their lesser carbon copies.[“The Intellectual Bankruptcy of Our Age,” pamphlet, 5.] See also AXIOMS; CAUSALITY; CONSCIOUSNESS; DICTATOR; EMOTIONS; EPISTEMOLOGY;GOD; FAITH; KANT, IMMANUEL; KNOWLEDGE; LOGIC; MYSTICS of SPIRIT and of MUSCLE;OBJECTIVITY; PERCEPTION; PHYSICAL FORCE; PROOF; REASON; RELIGION;SECOND-HANDERS; SKEPTICISM; SUPERNATURALISM. Mystics of Spirit and of Muscle. As products of the split between man’s soul andbody, there are two kinds of teachers of the Morality of Death: the mystics ofspirit and the mystics of muscle, whom you call the spiritualists and thematerialists, those who believe in consciousness without existence and those whobelieve in existence without consciousness. Both demand the surrender of yourmind, one to their revelations, the other to their reflexes. No matter howloudly they posture in the roles of irreconcilable antagonists, their moralcodes are alike, and so are their aims: in matter—the enslavement of man’s body,in spirit—the destruction of his mind.The good, say the mystics of spirit, is God, a being whose only definition isthat he is beyond man’s power to conceive—a definition that invalidates man’sconsciousness and nullifies his concepts of existence. The good, say the mysticsof muscle, is Society—a thing which they define as an organism that possesses nophysical form, a super-being embodied in no one in particular and everyone ingeneral except yourself. Man’s mind, say the mystics of spirit, must besubordinated to the will of God. Man’s mind, say the mystics of muscle, must besubordinated to the will of Society. Man’s standard of value, say the mystics ofspirit, is the pleasure of God, whose standards are beyond man’s power ofcomprehension and must be accepted on faith. Man’s standard of value, say themystics of muscle, is the pleasure of Society, whose standards are beyond man’sright of judgment and must be obeyed as a primary absolute. The purpose of man’slife, say both, is to become an abject zombie who serves a purpose he does notknow, for reasons he is not to question. His reward, say the mystics of spirit,will be given to him beyond the grave. His reward, say the mystics of muscle,will be given on earth—to his great-grandchildren.Selfishness—say both—is man’s evil. Man’s good—say both—is to give up hispersonal desires, to deny himself, renounce himself, surrender; man’s good is tonegate the life he lives. Sacrifice—cry both—is the essence of morality, thehighest virtue within man’s reach.[GS, FNI, 171; pb 138.] The mystics of spirit declare that they possess an extra sense you lack: thisspecial sixth sense consists of contradicting the whole of the knowledge of yourfive. The mystics of muscle do not bother to assert any claim to extrasensoryperception: they merely declare that your senses are not valid, and that theirwisdom consists of perceiving your blindness by some manner of unspecifiedmeans. Both kinds demand that you invalidate your own consciousness andsurrender yourself into their power. They offer you, as proof of their superiorknowledge, the fact that they assert the opposite of everything you know, and asproof of their superior ability to deal with existence, the fact that they leadyou to misery, self-sacrifice, starvation, destruction.They claim that they perceive a mode of being superior to your existence on thisearth. The mystics of spirit call it “another dimension,” which consists ofdenying dimensions. The mystics of muscle call it “the future,” which consistsof denying the present.[Ibid., 184; pb 148.] What is the nature of that superior world to which they sacrifice the world thatexists? The mystics of spirit curse matter, the mystics of muscle curse profit.The first wish men to profit by renouncing the earth, the second wish men toinherit the earth by renouncing all profit. Their non-material, non-profitworlds are realms where rivers run with milk and coffee, where wine spurts fromrocks at their command, where pastry drops on them from clouds at the price ofopening their mouth. On this material, profit-chasing earth, an enormousinvestment of virtue —of intelligence, integrity, energy, skill—is required toconstruct a railroad to carry them the distance of one mile; in theirnon-material, non-profit world, they travel from planet to planet at the cost ofa wish. If an honest person asks them: “How?”—they answer with righteous scornthat a “how” is the concept of vulgar realists; the concept of superior spiritsis “Somehow.” On this earth restricted by matter and profit, rewards areachieved by thought; in a world set free of such restrictions rewards areachieved by wishing.And that is the whole of their shabby secret. The secret of all their esotericphilosophies, of all their dialectics and super-senses, of their evasive eyesand snarling words, the secret for which they destroy civilization, language,industries and lives, the secret for which they pierce their own eyes andeardrums, grind out their senses, blank out their minds, the purpose for whichthey dissolve the absolutes of reason, logic, matter, existence, reality—is toerect upon that plastic fog a single holy absolute: their Wish.[Ibid., 185; pb 149.] For centuries, the mystics of spirit have proclaimed that faith is superior toreason, but have not dared deny the existence of reason. Their heirs andproduct, the mystics of muscle, have completed their job and achieved theirdream: they proclaim that everything is faith, and call it a revolt againstbelieving. As revolt against unproved assertions, they proclaim that nothing canbe proved; as revolt against supernatural knowledge, they proclaim that noknowledge is possible; as revolt against the enemies of science, they proclaimthat science is superstition; as revolt against the enslavement of the mind,they proclaim that there is no mind.

Naturalism. [Today we observe] two broad categories of art: Romanticism, whichrecognizes the existence of man’s volition—and Naturalism, which denies it.[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 81; pb 99.] [The] basic premises of Romanticism and Naturalism (the volition oranti-volition premise) affect all the other aspects of a literary work, such asthe choice of theme and the quality of the style, but it is the nature of thestory structure—the attribute of plot or plotlessness—that represents the mostimportant difference between them and serves as the main distinguishingcharacteristic for classifying a given work in one category or the other.[Ibid., 83; pb 101.] Instead of presenting a metaphysical view of man and of existence, theNaturalists presented a journalistic view. In answer to the question: “What isman?”—they said: “This is what the village grocers are, in the south of France,in the year 1887,” or: “This is what the inhabitants of the slums are, in NewYork, in 1921,” or: “These are the folks next door.”[“The Esthetic Vacuum of Our Age,” RM, 114; pb 124.] The practitioners of the literary school diametrically opposed to mine —theschool of Naturalism—claim that a writer must reproduce what they call “reallife,” allegedly “as it is,” exercising no selectivity and no value-judgments.By “reproduce,” they mean “photograph”; by “real life,” they mean whatever givenconcretes they happen to observe; by “as it is,” they mean “as it is lived bythe people around them.” But observe that these Naturalists—or the good writersamong them—are extremely selective in regard to two attributes of literature:style and characterization. Without selectivity, it would be impossible toachieve any sort of characterization whatever, neither of an unusual man nor ofan average one who is to be offered as statistically typical of a large segmentof the population. Therefore, the Naturalists’ opposition to selectivity appliesto only one attribute of literature: the content or subject. It is in regard tohis choice of subject that a novelist must exercise no choice, they claim.Why?The Naturalists have never given an answer to that question—not a rational,logical, noncontradictory answer. Why should a writer photograph his subjectsindiscriminately and unselectively? Because they “really” happened? To recordwhat really happened is the job of a reporter or of a historian, not of anovelist. To enlighten readers and educate them? That is the job of science, notof literature, of nonfiction writing, not of fiction. To improve men’s lot byexposing their misery? But that is a value-judgment and a moral purpose and adidactic “message” —all of which are forbidden by the Naturalist doctrine.Besides, to improve anything one must know what constitutes an improvement —andto know that, one must know what is the good and how to achieve it—and to knowthat, one must have a whole system of value-judgments, a system of ethics, whichis anathema to the Naturalists.Thus, the Naturalists’ position amounts to giving a novelist full estheticfreedom in regard to means, but not in regard to ends. He may exercise choice,creative imagination, value-judgments in regard to how he portrays things, butnot in regard to what he portrays—in regard to style or characterization, butnot in regard to subject. Man—the subject of literature—must not be viewed orportrayed selectively. Man must be accepted as the given, the unchangeable, thenot-to-be-judged, the status quo. But since we observe that men do change, thatthey differ from one another, that they pursue different values, who, then, isto determine the human status quo? Naturalism’s implicit answer is: everybodyexcept the novelist.The novelist—according to the Naturalist doctrine—must neither judge nor value.He is not a creator, but only a recording secretary whose master is the rest ofmankind. Let others pronounce judgments, make decisions, select goals, fightover values and determine the course, the fate and the soul of man. The novelistis the only outcast and deserter of that battle. His is not to reason why—his isonly to trot behind his master, notebook in hand, taking down whatever themaster dictates, picking up such pearls or such swinishness as the master maychoose to drop.[“The Goal of My Writing,” RM, 163; pb 164.] The Naturalists object that a plot is an artificial contrivance, because in“real life” events do not fall into a logical pattern. That claim depends on theobserver’s viewpoint, in the literal sense of the word “viewpoint.” Anearsighted man standing two feet away from the wall of a house and staring atit, would declare that the map of the city’s streets is an artificial, inventedcontrivance. That is not what an airplane pilot would say, flying two thousandfeet above the city. The events of men’s lives follow the logic of men’spremises and values—as one can observe if one looks past the range of theimmediate moment, past the trivial irrelevancies, repetitions and routines ofdaily living, and sees the essentials, the turning points, the direction of aman’s life.[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 60; pb 83.] The Naturalists object that the events of men’s lives are inconclusive, diffuseand seldom fall into the clear-cut, dramatic situations required by a plotstructure. This is predominantly true—and this is the chief esthetic argumentagainst the Naturalist position. Art is a selective recreation of reality, itsmeans are evaluative abstractions, its task is the concretization ofmetaphysical essentials. To isolate and bring into clear focus, into a singleissue or a single scene, the essence of a conflict which, in “real life,” mightbe atomized and scattered over a lifetime in the form of meaningless clashes, tocondense a long, steady drizzle of buckshot into the explosion of ablockbuster—that is the highest, hardest and most demanding function of art. Todefault on that function is to default on the essence of art and to engage inchild’s play along its periphery.[Ibid., 61; pb 83.] Although Naturalism is a product of the nineteenth century, its spiritualfather, in modern history, was Shakespeare. The premise that man does notpossess volition, that his destiny is determined by an innate “tragic flaw,” isfundamental in Shakespeare’s work. But, granted this false premise, his approachis metaphysical, not journalistic. His characters are not drawn from “reallife,” they are not copies of observed concretes nor statistical averages: theyare grand-scale abstractions of the character traits which a determinist wouldregard as inherent in human nature: ambition, power-lust, jealousy, greed, etc.[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 102; pb 115.] No matter how concrete-bound their theories forced them to be, the writers ofthe Naturalist school still had to exercise their power of abstraction to asignificant extent: in order to reproduce “real-life” characters, they had toselect the characteristics they regarded as essential, differentiating them fromthe non-essential or accidental. Thus they were led to substitute statistics forvalues as a criterion of selectivity: that which is statistically prevalentamong men, they held, is metaphysically significant and representative of man’snature; that which is rare or exceptional, is not. (See Chapter 7.)At first, having rejected the element of plot and even of story, the Naturalistsconcentrated on the element of characterization—and psychological perceptivenesswas the chief value that the best of them had to offer. With the growth of thestatistical method, however, that value shrank and vanished: characterizationwas replaced by indiscriminate recording and buried under a catalogue of trivia,such as minute inventories of a character’s apartment. clothing and meals.Naturalism lost the attempted universality of Shakespeare or Tolstoy, descendingfrom metaphysics to photography with a rapidly shrinking lens directed at therange of the immediate moment—until the final remnants of Naturalism became asuperficial, meaningless, “unserious” school that had nothing to say about humanexistence.[Ibid., 104; pb 117.] The obvious question, to which the heirs of statistical Naturalism have noanswer, is: if heroes and geniuses are not to be regarded as representative ofmankind, by reason of their numerical rarity, why are freaks and monsters to beregarded as representative? Why are the problems of a bearded lady of greateruniversal significance than the problems of a genius? Why is the soul of amurderer worth studying, but not the soul of a hero?The answer lies in the basic metaphysical premise of Naturalism, whether itspractitioners ever chose it consciously or not: as an outgrowth of modernphilosophy, that basic premise is anti-man, anti-mind, anti-life; and, as anoutgrowth of the altruist morality, Naturalism is a frantic escape from moraljudgment—a long, wailing plea for pity, for tolerance, for the forgiveness ofanything.[“The Esthetic Vacuum of Our Age,” RM. 116; pb 125.]See also ART; CHARACTERIZATION; DETERMINISM; FREE WILL; LITERATURE; PLOT;ROMANTICISM; SENSE of LIFE; STYLIZATION; VALUES. Nature. What is nature? Nature is existence—the sum of that which is. It isusually called “nature” when we think of it as a system of interconnected,interacting entities governed by law. So “nature” really means the universe ofentities acting and interacting in accordance with their identities.[Leonard Peikoff. “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture2.]See also ATHEISM; CAUSALITY; EXISTENCE; SUPERNATURALISM; UNIVERSE. Nazism. See Fascism/Nazism. Necessity. As far as metaphysical reality is concerned (omitting human actionsfrom consideration, for the moment), there are no “facts which happen to be butcould have been otherwise” as against “facts which must be.” There are only:facts which are.... Since things are what they are, since everything that existspossesses a specific identity, nothing in reality can occur causelessly or bychance. The nature of an entity determines what it can do and, in any given setof circumstances, dictates what it will do. The Law of Causality is entailed bythe Law of Identity. Entities follow certain laws of action in consequence oftheir identity, and have no alternative to doing so. Metaphysically, all factsare inherent in the identities of the entities that exist; i.e., all facts are“necessary.” In this sense, to be is to be “necessary.” The concept of“necessity,” in a metaphysical context, is superfluous.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 146.] A typical package-deal, used by professors of philosophy, runs as follows: toprove the assertion that there is no such thing as “necessity” in the universe,a professor declares that just as this country did not have to have fiftystates, there could have been forty-eight or fifty-two-so the solar system didnot have to have nine planets, there could have been seven or eleven. It is notsufficient, he declares, to prove that something is, one must also prove that ithad to be—and since nothing had to be, nothing is certain and anything goes.The technique of undercutting man’s mind consists in palming off the man-made asif it were the metaphysically given, then ascribing to nature the concepts thatrefer only to men’s lack of knowledge, such as “chance” or “contingency,” thenreversing the two elements of the package-deal. From the assertion: “Man isunpredictable, therefore nature is unpredictable,” the argument goes to: “Naturepossesses volition, man does not—nature is free, man is ruled by unknowableforces—nature is not to be conquered, man is.”[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 34; pb 28.]See also ANALYTIC-SYNTHETIC DICHOTOMY; CAUSALITY; IDENTITY; FREE WILL;METAPHYSICAL vs. MAN-MADE; “PACKAGE-DEALING,” FALLACY of; PRIMACY of EXISTENCEvs. PRIMACY of CONSCIOUSNESS. Neurosis vs. Psychosis. A man who has psychological problems is a consciousbeing; his cognitive faculty is hampered, burdened, slowed down, but notdestroyed. A neurotic is not a psychotic. Only a psychotic is presumed to sufferfrom a total break with reality and to have no control over his actions or theoperations of his consciousness (and even this is not always true). A neuroticretains the ability to perceive reality, and to control his consciousness andhis actions (this control is merely more difficult for him than for a healthyperson). So long as he is not psychotic, this is the control that a man cannotlose and must not abdicate.

Old-line Marxists claimed [falsely] that they were champions ofreason, that socialism or communism was a scientific social system, that anadvanced technology could not function in a capitalist society, but required ascientifically planned and organized human community to bring its maximumbenefits to every man, in the form of material comforts and a higher standard ofliving.... [T]oday we see the spectacle of old Marxists blessing, aiding andabetting the young hoodlums [of the New Left] (who are their products and heirs)who proclaim the superiority of feelings over reason, of faith over knowledge,of leisure over production, of spiritual concerns over material comforts, ofprimitive nature over technology, of astrology over science, of drugs overconsciousness.[“The Left: Old and New,” NL, 90.] If concern with poverty and human suffering were the collectivists’ motive, theywould have become champions of capitalism long ago; they would have discoveredthat it is the only political system capable of producing abundance. But theyevaded the evidence as long as they could. When the issue became overwhelminglyclear to the whole world, the collectivists were faced with a choice: eitherturn to the right, in the name of humanity—or to the left, in the name ofdictatorial power. They turned to the left—the New Left.Instead of their old promises that collectivism would create universal abundanceand their denunciations of capitalism for creating poverty, they are nowdenouncing capitalism for creating abundance. Instead of promising comfort andsecurity for everyone, they are now denouncing people for being comfortable andsecure.[“The Anti-Industrial Revolution,” NL, 141.] Intellectually, the activists of the New Left are the most docile conformists.They have accepted as dogma all the philosophical beliefs of their elders forgenerations: the notions that faith and feeling are superior to reason, thatmaterial concerns are evil, that love is the solution to all problems, that themerging of one’s self with a tribe or a community is the noblest way to live.There is not a single basic principle of today’s Establishment which they do notshare. Far from being rebels, they embody the philosophic trend of the past 200years (or longer): the mysticism-altruism-collectivism axis, which has dominatedWestern philosophy from Kant to Hegel to James and on down.

Nietzsche, Friedrich. Philosophically, Nietzsche is a mystic and anirrationalist. His metaphysics consists of a somewhat “Byronic” and mystically“malevolent” universe; his epistemology subordinates reason to “will,” orfeeling or instinct or blood or innate virtues of character. But, as a poet, heprojects at times (not consistently) a magnificent feeling for man’s greatness,expressed in emotional, not intellectual, terms,[“Introduction to The Fountainhead,” TO, March 1968, 6.] Nietzsche’s rebellion against altruism consisted of replacing the sacrifice ofoneself to others by the sacrifice of others to oneself. He proclaimed that theideal man is moved, not by reason, but by his “blood,” by his innate instincts,feelings and will to power—that he is predestined by birth to rule others andsacrifice them to himself, while they are predestined by birth to be his victimsand slaves—that reason, logic, principles are futile and debilitating, thatmorality is useless, that the “superman” is “beyond good and evil,” that he is a“beast of prey” whose ultimate standard is nothing but his own whim. ThusNietzsche’s rejection of the Witch Doctor consisted of elevating Attila into amoral ideal—which meant: a double surrender of morality to the Witch Doctor.

Nineteenth Century. If you want to prove to yourself the power of ideas and,particularly, of morality—the intellectual history of the nineteenth centurywould be a good example to study. The greatest, unprecedented, undreamed ofevents and achievements were taking place before men’s eyes—but men did not seethem and did not understand their meaning, as they do not understand it to thisday. I am speaking of the industrial revolution, of the United States and ofcapitalism. For the first time in history, men gained control over physicalnature and threw off the control of men over men—that is: men discovered scienceand political freedom. The creative energy, the abundance, the wealth, therising standard of living for every level of the population were such that thenineteenth century looks like a fiction-Utopia, like a blinding burst ofsunlight, in the drab progression of most of human history. If life on earth isone’s standard of value, then the nineteenth century moved mankind forward morethan all the other centuries combined.Did anyone appreciate it? Does anyone appreciate it now? Has anyone identifiedthe causes of that historical miracle?They did not and have not. What blinded them? The morality of altruism.Let me explain this. There are, fundamentally, only two causes of the progressof the nineteenth century—the same two causes which you will find at the root ofany happy, benevolent, progressive era in human history. One cause ispsychological, the other existential—or: one pertains to man’s consciousness,the other to the physical conditions of his existence. The first is reason, thesecond is freedom. And when I say “freedom,” I do not mean poetic sloppiness,such as “freedom from want” or “freedom from fear” or “freedom from thenecessity of earning a living.” I mean “freedom from compulsion—freedom fromrule by physical force.” Which means: political freedom.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 79; pb 65.] See also AMERICA; CAPITALISM; FREEDOM; HISTORY; PHYSICAL FORCE; WAR. Nominalism. The “nominalists” ... hold that all our ideas are only images ofconcretes, and that abstractions are merely “names” which we give to arbitrarygroupings of concretes on the basis of vague resemblances.... (There is also theextreme nominalist position, the modern one, which consists of declaring thatthe problem [of universals] is a meaningless issue, that “reality” is ameaningless term, that we can never know whether our concepts correspond toanything or not, that our knowledge consists of words—and that words are anarbitrary social convention.)[ITOE, 2.] Denying that concepts have an objective basis in the facts of reality,nominalists declare that the source of concepts is a subjective human decision:men arbitrarily select certain characteristics to serve as the basis (the“essentials”) for a classification; thereafter, they agree to apply the sameterm to any concretes that happen to exhibit these “essentials,” no matter howdiverse these concretes are in other respects. On this view, the concept (theterm) means only those characteristics initially decreed to be “essential.” Theother characteristics of the subsumed concretes bear no necessary connection tothe “essential” characteristics, and are excluded from the concept’s meaning.Observe that, while condemning Plato’s mystic view of a concept’s meaning, thenominalists embrace the same view in a skeptic version. Condemning theessence-accident dichotomy as implicitly arbitrary, they institute an explicitlyarbitrary equivalent. Condemning Plato’s “intuitive” selection of essences as adisguised subjectivism, they spurn the disguise and adopt subjectivism as theirofficial theory—as though a concealed vice were heinous, but a brazenly flauntedone, rational. Condemning Plato’s supernaturally-determined essences, theydeclare that essences are socially-determined, thus transferring to the provinceof human whim what had once been the prerogative of Plato’s divine realm. Thenominalists’ “advance” over Plato consisted of secularizing his theory. Tosecularize an error is still to commit it.Its form, however, changes. Nominalists do not say that a concept designatesonly an entity’s “essence,” excluding its “accidents.” Their secularized versionis: A concept is only a shorthand tag for the characteristics stated in itsdefinition; a concept and its definition are interchangeable; a concept meansonly its definition.It is the Platonic-nominalist approach to concept-formation, expressed in suchviews as these, that gives rise to the theory of the analytic-syntheticdichotomy.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 129.] The nominalist view that a concept is merely a shorthand tag for its definition,represents a profound failure to grasp the function of a definition in theprocess of concept-formation. The penalty for this failure is that the processof definition, in the hands of the nominalists, achieves the exact opposite ofits actual purpose. The purpose of a definition is to keep a concept distinctfrom all others, to keep it connected to a specific group of existents. On thenominalist view, it is precisely this connection that is severed: as soon as aconcept is defined, it ceases to designate existents; and designates insteadonly the defining characteristic.And further: On a rational view of definitions, a definition organizes andcondenses—and thus helps one to retain—a wealth of knowledge about thecharacteristics of a concept’s units. On the nominalist view, it is preciselythis knowledge that is discarded when one defines a concept: as soon as adefining characteristic is chosen, all the other characteristics of the unitsare banished from the concept, which shrivels to mean merely the definition. Forinstance, as long as a child’s concept of “man” is retained ostensively, thechild knows that man has a head, two eyes, two arms, etc.; on the nominalistview, as soon as the child defines “man,” he discards all this knowledge;thereafter, “man” means to him only: “a thing with rationality and animality.”On the nominalist view, the process of defining a concept is a process ofcutting the concept off from its referents, and of systematically evading whatone knows about their characteristics. Definition, the very tool which isdesigned to promote conceptual integration, becomes an agent of its destruction,a means of disintegration.[Ibid., 140.]See also ABSTRACTIONS and CONCRETES; ANALYTlC-SYNTHETIC DICHOTOMY; ARBITRARY;CONCEPT-FORMATION; CONCEPTS; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); LANGUAGE; LINGUISTICANALYSIS; LOGICAL POSITIVISM; MEANING (of CONCEPTS); MYSTICISM; SKEPTICISM;WORDS. Non-Contradiction. See Contradictions. Non-Existence. Non-existence is not a fact, it is the absence of a fact, it is aderivative concept pertaining to a relationship, i.e., a concept which can beformed or grasped only in relation to some existent that has ceased to exist.(One can arrive at the concept “absence” starting from the concept “presence,”in regard to some particular existent(s); one cannot arrive at the concept“presence” starting from the concept “absence,” with the absence includingeverything.) Non-existence as such is a zero with no sequence of numbers tofollow it, it is the nothing, the total blank.[ITOE, 77.] Achieving life is not the equivalent of avoiding death. Joy is not “the absenceof pain,” intelligence is not “the absence of stupidity,” light is not “theabsence of darkness,” an entity is not “the absence of a nonentity.” Building isnot done by abstaining from demolition; centuries of sitting and waiting in suchabstinence will not raise one single girder for you to abstain fromdemolishing.... Existence is not a negation of negatives.[GS, FNI, 166; pb 135.]See also EXISTENCE; ZERO, REIFICATION of. Normative Abstractions. There are many special or “cross-filed” chains ofabstractions (of interconnected concepts) in man’s mind. Cognitive abstractionsare the fundamental chain, on which all the others depend. Such chains aremental integrations, serving a special purpose and formed accordingly by aspecial criterion. Cognitive abstractions are formed by the criterion of: whatis essential? (epistemologically essential to distinguish one class of existentsfrom all others). Normative abstractions are formed by the criterion of: what isgood?[“Art and Sense of Life,” RM, 45; pb 36.] Consider the long conceptual chain that starts from simple, ostensivedefinitions and rises to higher and still higher concepts, forming ahierarchical structure of knowledge so complex that no electronic computer couldapproach it. It is by means of such chains that man has to acquire and retainhis knowledge of reality.Yet this is the simpler part of his psycho-epistemological task. There isanother part which is still more complex.The other part consists of applying his knowledge—i.e., evaluating the facts ofreality, choosing his goals and guiding his actions accordingly. To do that, manneeds another chain of concepts, derived from and dependent on the first, yetseparate and, in a sense, more complex: a chain of normative abstractions.While cognitive abstractions identify the facts of reality, normativeabstractions evaluate the facts, thus prescribing a choice of values and acourse of action. Cognitive abstractions deal with that which is; normativeabstractions deal with that which ought to be (in the realms open to man’schoice).[“The Psycho-Epistemology of Art,” RM, 20; pb 18.] The process of a child’s development consists of acquiring knowledge, whichrequires the development of his capacity to grasp and deal with an ever-wideningrange of abstractions. This involves the growth of two interrelated butdifferent chains of abstractions, two hierarchical structures of concepts, whichshould be integrated, but seldom are: the cognitive and the normative. The firstdeals with knowledge of the facts of reality—the second, with the evaluation ofthese facts. The first forms the epistemological foundation of science—thesecond, of morality and of art.In today’s culture, the development of a child’s cognitive abstractions isassisted to some minimal extent, even if ineptly, half-heartedly, with manyhampering, crippling obstacles (such as anti-rational doctrines and influenceswhich, today, are growing worse). But the development of a child’s normativeabstractions is not merely left unaided, it is all but stifled and destroyed.The child whose valuing capacity survives the moral barbarism of his upbringinghas to find his own way to preserve and develop his sense of values.[“Art and Moral Treason,” RM, 140; pb 145.] See also ABSTRACTION (PROCESS of); ABSTRACTIONS and CONCRETES;CONCEPT-FORMATION; CONCEPTS; GOOD, the; LEARNING; MORALITY; VALUES. Novel. A novel is a long, fictional story about human beings and the events oftheir lives. The four essential attributes of a novel are: Theme—Pot—Characterization—Style.These are attributes, not separable parts. They can be isolated conceptually forpurposes of study, but one must always remember that they are interrelated andthat a novel is their sum. (If it is a good novel, it is an indivisible sum.)...A novel is the major literary form—in respect to its scope, its inexhaustiblepotentiality, its almost unlimited freedom (including the freedom from physicallimitations of the kind that restrict a stage play) and, most importantly, inrespect to the fact that a novel is a purely literary form of art which does notrequire the intermediary of the performing arts to achieve its ultimate effect.[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 57; pb 80.] A good novel is an indivisible sum: every scene, sequence and passage of a goodnovel has to involve, contribute to and advance all three of its majorattributes: theme, plot, characterization.[Ibid., 74; pb 93.] Since the theme of a novel is an idea about or pertaining to human existence, itis in terms of its effects on or expression in human actions that that idea hasto be presented.This leads to the crucial attribute of a novel—the plot....To present a story in terms of action means: to present it in terms of events. Astory in which nothing happens is not a story. A story whose events arehaphazard and accidental is either an inept conglomeration or, at best. achronicle. a memoir, a reportorial recording, not a novel.[Ibid., 59; pb 82.]See also ART; CHARACTERIZATION; LITERATURE; PLOT; POPULAR LITERATURE; STYLE;THEME (LITERARY); THRILLERS. Numbers.

See Objectivity.Objective Theory of Values. The intrinsic theory holds that the good resides insome sort of reality, independent of man’s consciousness; the subjectivisttheory holds that the good resides in man’s consciousness, independent ofreality.The objective theory holds that the good is neither an attribute of “things inthemselves” nor of man’s emotional states, but an evaluation of the facts ofreality by man’s consciousness according to a rational standard of value.(Rational, in this context, means: derived from the facts of reality andvalidated by a process of reason.) The objective theory holds that the good isan aspect of reality in relation to man—and that it must be discovered, notinvented, by man. Fundamental to an objective theory of values is the question:Of value to whom and for what? An objective theory does not permitcontext-dropping or “concept-stealing”; it does not permit the separation of“value” from “purpose,” of the good from beneficiaries, and of man’s actionsfrom reason.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 22.] The objective theory of values is the only moral theory incompatible with ruleby force. Capitalism is the only system based implicitly on an objective theoryof values—and the historic tragedy is that this has never been made explicit.If one knows that the good is objective—i.e., determined by the nature ofreality, but to be discovered by man’s mind—one knows that an attempt to achievethe good by physical force is a monstrous contradiction which negates moralityat its root by destroying man’s capacity to recognize the good, i.e., hiscapacity to value. Force invalidates and paralyzes a man’s judgment, demandingthat he act against it, thus rendering him morally impotent. A value which oneis forced to accept at the price of surrendering one’s mind, is not a value toanyone; the forcibly mindless can neither judge nor choose nor value. An attemptto achieve the good by force is like an attempt to provide a man with a picturegallery at the price of cutting out his eyes. Values cannot exist (cannot bevalued) outside the full context of a man’s life, needs, goals, and knowledge.[Ibid., 23.]The free market represents the social application of an objective theory ofvalues. Since values are to be discovered by man’s mind, men must be free todiscover them—to think, to study, to translate their knowledge into physicalform, to offer their products for trade, to judge them, and to choose, be itmaterial goods or ideas, a loaf of bread or a philosophical treatise. Sincevalues are established contextually, every man must judge for himself, in thecontext of his own knowledge, goals, and interests. Since values are determinedby the nature of reality, it is reality that serves as men’s ultimate arbiter:if a man’s judgment is right, the rewards are his; if it is wrong, he is hisonly victim.[Ibid.. 24.] See also CAPITALISM; CONTEXT-DROPPING; FREE MARKET; INTRINSIC THEORY of VALUES;MARKET VALUE; MYSTICAL ETHICS; OBJECTIVITY; PHYSICAL FORCE; REASON; SOCIALTHEORY of ETHICS; “STOLEN CONCEPT,” FALLACY of; SUBJECTIVISM (IN ETHICS);VALUES. Objectivism. The name I have chosen for my philosophy is Objectivism. [“Preface,” FNI, ii, pb viii.] My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his ownhappiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as hisnoblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.[“About the Author,” Appendix to Atlas Shrugged.] At a sales conference at Random House, preceding the publication of AtlasShrugged, one of the book salesmen asked me whether I could present the essenceof my philosophy while standing on one foot. I did. as follows:1. Metaphysics: Objective Reality2. Epistemology: Reason3. Ethics: Self-interest4. Politics: CapitalismIf you want this translated into simple language, it would read: 1. “Nature, tobe commanded, must be obeyed” or “Wishing won’t make it so.” 2. “You can’t eatyour cake and have it, too.” 3. “Man is an end in himself.” 4. “Give me libertyor give me death.”If you held these concepts with total consistency, as the base of yourconvictions, you would have a full philosophical system to guide the course ofyour life. But to hold them with total consistency—to understand, to define, toprove and to apply them—requires volumes of thought. Which is why philosophycannot be discussed while standing on one foot—nor while standing on two feet onboth sides of every fence. This last is the predominant philosophical positiontoday, particularly in the field of politics.In the space of a column, I can give only the briefest summary of my position,as a frame-of-reference for all my future columns. My philosophy, Objectivism,holds that:1. Reality exists as an objective absolute—facts are facts, independent of man’sfeelings, wishes, hopes or fears.2. Reason (the faculty which identifies and integrates the material provided byman’s senses) is man’s only means of perceiving reality, his only source ofknowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic means of survival.3. Man—every man—is an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others. Hemust exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others norsacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational self-interest andof his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life.4. The ideal political-economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is asystem where men deal with one another, not as victims and executioners, nor asmasters and slaves, but as traders, by free, voluntary exchange to mutualbenefit. It is a system where no man may obtain any values from others byresorting to physical force, and no man may initiate the use of physical forceagainst others. The government acts only as a policeman that protects man’srights; it uses physical force only in retaliation and only against those whoinitiate its use, such as criminals or foreign invaders. In a system of fullcapitalism, there should be (but, historically, has not yet been) a completeseparation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons asthe separation of state and church.[“Introducing Objectivism,” TON, Aug. 1962, 35.] I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am notprimarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacyof reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows.This—the supremacy of reason—was, is and will be the primary concern of my work,and the essence of Objectivism.[“Brief Summary,” TO, Sept. 1971, 1.] The only philosophical debt I can acknowledge is to Aristotle. I mostemphatically disagree with a great many parts of his philosophy—but hisdefinition of the laws of logic and of the means of human knowledge is so greatan achievement that his errors are irrelevant by comparison.[“About the Author,” Appendix to Atlas Shrugged.]Objectivism is a philosophical movement; since politics is a branch ofphilosophy, Objectivism advocates certain political principles—specifically,those of laissez-faire capitalism—as the consequence and the ultimate practicalapplication of its fundamental philosophical principles. It does not regardpolitics as a separate or primary goal, that is: as a goal that can be achievedwithout a wider ideological context.Politics is based on three other philosophical disciplines: metaphysics,epistemology and ethics—on a theory of man’s nature and of man’s relationship toexistence. It is only on such a base that one can formulate a consistentpolitical theory and achieve it in practice. When, however, men attempt to rushinto politics without such a base, the result is that embarrassingconglomeration of impotence, futility, inconsistency and superficiality which isloosely designated today as “conservatism.” Objectivists are not“conservatives.” We are radicals for capitalism; we are fighting for thatphilosophical base which capitalism did not have and without which it was doomedto perish.[“Choose Your Issues,” TON. Jan. 1962. 1.] I regard the spread of Objectivism through today’s culture as an intellectualmovement—i.e., a trend among independent individuals who share the sameideas—but not as an organized movement.[“A Statement of Policy,” TO. June 1968, 7.] Objectivity. Objectivity is both a metaphysical and an epistemological concept.It pertains to the relationship of consciousness to existence. Metaphysically,it is the recognition of the fact that reality exists independent of anyperceiver’s consciousness. Epistemologically, it is the recognition of the factthat a perceiver’s (man’s) consciousness must acquire knowledge of reality bycertain means (reason) in accordance with certain rules (logic). This means thatalthough reality is immutable and, in any given context, only one answer istrue, the truth is not automatically available to a human consciousness and canbe obtained only by a certain mental process which is required of every man whoseeks knowledge—that there is no substitute for this process, no escape from theresponsibility for it, no shortcuts, no special revelations to privilegedobservers—and that there can be no such thing as a final “authority” in matterspertaining to human knowledge. Metaphysically, the only authority is reality;epistemologically—one’s own mind. The first is the ultimate arbiter of thesecond.The concept of objectivity contains the reason why the question “Who decideswhat is right or wrong?” is wrong. Nobody “decides.” Nature does not decide—itmerely is; man does not decide, in issues of knowledge, he merely observes thatwhich is. When it comes to applying his knowledge, man decides what he choosesto do, according to what he has learned, remembering that the basic principle ofrational action in all aspects of human existence, is: “Nature, to be commanded,must be obeyed.” This means that man does not create reality and can achieve hisvalues only by making his decisions consonant with the facts of reality.[“Who Is the Final Authority in Ethics?” TON, Feb. 1965,7.] Objectivity begins with the realization that man (including his every attributeand faculty, including his consciousness) is an entity of a specific nature whomust act accordingly; that there is no escape from the law of identity, neitherin the universe with which he deals nor in the working of his own consciousness,and if he is to acquire knowledge of the first, he must discover the propermethod of using the second; that there is no room for the arbitrary in anyactivity of man, least of all in his method of cognition—and just as he haslearned to be guided by objective criteria in making his physical tools, so hemust be guided by objective criteria in forming his tools of cognition: hisconcepts.[ITOE, 110.] It is axiomatic concepts that identify the precondition of knowledge: thedistinction between existence and consciousness, between reality and theawareness of reality, between the object and the subject of cognition. Axiomaticconcepts are the foundation of objectivity.[Ibid.. 76.] Most people ... think that abstract thinking must be “impersonal”—which meansthat ideas must hold no personal meaning, value or importance to the thinker.This notion rests on the premise that a personal interest is an agent ofdistortion. But “personal” does not mean “non-objective”; it depends on the kindof person you are. If your thinking is determined by your emotions, then youwill not be able to judge anything, personally or impersonally. But if you arethe kind of person who knows that reality is not your enemy, that truth andknowledge are of crucial, personal, selfish importance to you and to your ownlife—then. the more passionately personal the thinking, the clearer and truer.[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 19; pb 16.]See also AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS; AXIOMS; CONCEPTS; DEFINITIONS; EPISTEMOLOGY;IDENTITY; KANT, IMMANUEL; KNOWLEDGE; LOGIC; METAPHYSICS; MORALITY; MYSTICISM;“OPEN MIND” and “CLOSED MIND”; PRIMACY of EXISTENCE vs. PRIMACY ofCONSCIOUSNESS; PROOF; REASON; SUBJECTIVISM; TRUTH. Obligation. See Responsibility/Obligation.“Open Mind” and “Closed Mind.” [There is a| dangerous little catch phrase whichadvises you to keep an “open mind.” This is a very ambiguous term—asdemonstrated by a man who once accused a famous politician of having “a wideopen mind.” That term is an anti-concept: it is usually taken to mean anobjective, unbiased approach to ideas, but it is used as a call for perpetualskepticism, for holding no firm convictions and granting plausibility toanything. A “closed mind” is usually taken to mean the attitude of a manimpervious to ideas, arguments, facts and logic, who clings stubbornly to somemixture of unwarranted assumptions, fashionable catch phrases, tribal prejudices—and emotions. But this is not a “closed” mind, it is a passive one. It is amind that has dispensed with (or never acquired) the practice of thinking orjudging, and feels threatened by any request to consider anything.What objectivity and the study of philosophy require is not an “open mind,” butan active mind—a mind able and eagerly willing to examine ideas, but to examinethem critically. An active mind does not grant equal status to truth andfalsehood; it does not remain floating forever in a stagnant vacuum ofneutrality and uncertainty; by assuming the responsibility of judgment, itreaches firm convictions and holds to them. Since it is able to prove itsconvictions, an active mind achieves an unassailable certainty in confrontationswith assailants—a certainty untainted by spots of blind faith, approximation,evasion and fear.[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 25; pb 21.]See also ABSOLUTES; AGNOSTICISM; “ANTI-CONCEPTS”; CERTAINTY; OBJECTIVITY; PROOF;REASON; SKEPTICISM. Opera and Operetta. In operas and operettas, the esthetic base is music, withthe libretto serving only to provide an appropriate emotional context oropportunity for the musical score, and an integrating line for the totalperformance. (In this respect, there are very few good librettos.)[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 71.]See also ART; MUSIC; PERFORMING ARTS. Original Sin. Your code begins by damning man as evil, then demands that hepractice a good which it defines as impossible for him to practice. It demands,as his first proof of virtue, that he accept his own depravity without proof. Itdemands that he start, not with a standard of value, but with a standard ofevil, which is himself, by means of which he is then to define the good: thegood is that which he is not.It does not matter who then becomes the profiteer on his renounced glory andtormented soul, a mystic. God with some incomprehensible design or any passer-bywhose rotting sores are held as some inexplicable claim upon him—it does notmatter, the good is not for him to understand, his duty is to crawl throughyears of penance, atoning for the guilt of his existence to any stray collectorof unintelligible debts, his only concept of a value is a zero: the good is thatwhich is non-man.The name of this monstrous absurdity is Original Sin.A sin without volition is a slap at morality and an insolent contradiction interms: that which is outside the possibility of choice is outside the provinceof morality. If man is evil by birth, he has no will, no power to change it; ifhe has no will, he can be neither good nor evil; a robot is amoral. To hold, asman’s sin, a fact not open to his choice is a mockery of morality. To hold man’snature as his sin is a mockery of nature. To punish him for a crime he committedbefore he was born is a mockery of justice. To hold him guilty in a matter whereno innocence exists is a mockery of reason. To destroy morality, nature, justiceand reason by means of a single concept is a feat of evil hardly to be matched.Yet that is the root of your code.Do not hide behind the cowardly evasion that man is born with free will, butwith a “tendency” to evil. A free will saddled with a tendency is like a gamewith loaded dice. It forces man to struggle through the effort of playing, tobear responsibility and pay for the game, but the decision is weighted in favorof a tendency that he had no power to escape. If the tendency is of his choice,he cannot possess it at birth; if it is not of his choice, his will is not free.What is the nature of the guilt that your teachers call his Original Sin? Whatare the evils man acquired when he fell from a state they consider perfection?Their myth declares that he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge—he acquired amind and became a rational being. It was the knowledge of good and evil—hebecame a moral being. He was sentenced to earn his bread by his labor—he becamea productive being. He was sentenced to experience desire—he acquired thecapacity of sexual enjoyment. The evils for which they damn him are reason,morality, creativeness, joy—all the cardinal values of his existence. It is nothis vices that their myth of man’s fall is designed to explain and condemn, itis not his errors that they hold as his guilt, but the essence of his nature asman. Whatever he was—that robot in the Garden of Eden, who existed without mind,without values, without labor, without love —he was not man.Man’s fall, according to your teachers, was that he gained the virtues requiredto live. These virtues, by their standard, are his Sin. His evil, they charge,is that he’s man. His guilt, they charge, is that he lives.They call it a morality of mercy and a doctrine of love for man.[GS, FNI, 168; pb 136.]See also ATHEISM; CONTRADICTIONS; EVIL; FREE WILL; MAN; MORALITY; MYSTICISM;PRODUCTIVENESS; RATIONALITY; RELIGION; RESPONSIBILITY/OBLIGATlON; SELFISHNESS;SEX; VIRTUE. Ostensive Definition. With certain significant exceptions, every concept can bedefined and communicated in terms of other concepts. The exceptions are conceptsreferring to sensations, and metaphysical axioms.Sensations are the primary material of consciousness and, therefore, cannot becommunicated by means of the material which is derived from them. Theexistential causes of sensations can be described and defined in conceptualterms (e.g., the wavelengths of light and the structure of the human eye, whichproduce the sensations of color), but one cannot communicate what color is like,to a person who is born blind. To define the meaning of the concept “blue,” forinstance, one must point to some blue objects to signify, in effect: “I meanthis.” Such an identification of a concept is known as an “ostensivedefinition.”Ostensive definitions are usually regarded as applicable only to conceptualizedsensations. But they are applicable to axioms as well. Since axiomatic conceptsare identifications of irreducible primaries, the only way to define one is bymeans of an ostensive definition—e.g., to define “existence,” one would have tosweep one’s arm around and say: “I mean this.”[ITOE, 52.]See also AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS; AXIOMS; DEFINITIONS; IRREDUCIBLE PRIMARIES;PERCEPTION; SELF-EVIDENT; SENSATIONS."},{"pageContent":"PPacifism. The necessary consequence of man’s right to life is his right toself-defense. In a civilized society, force may be used only in retaliation andonly against those who initiate its use. All the reasons which make theinitiation of physical force an evil, make the retaliatory use of physical forcea moral imperative.If some “pacifist” society renounced the retaliatory use of force, it would beleft helplessly at the mercy of the first thug who decided to be immoral. Such asociety would achieve the opposite of its intention: instead of abolishing evil,it would encourage and reward it.[“The Nature of Government,” VOS, 146; pb 108.]See also ANARCHISM; GOVERNMENT; PEACE MOVEMENTS; PHYSICAL FORCE; RETALIATORYFORCE; SELF-DEFENSE; WAR. “Package-Dealing,” Fallacy of. “Package-dealing” is the fallacy of failing todiscriminate crucial differences. It consists of treating together, as parts ofa single conceptual whole or “package,” elements which differ essentially innature, truth-status, importance or value.[Leonard Peikoff, editor’s footnote to Ayn Rand’s “The Metaphysical Versus theMan-Made,” PWNI, 30; pb 24.] [Package-dealing employs] the shabby old gimmick of equating opposites bysubstituting nonessentials for their essential characteristics, obliteratingdifferences.[“How to Read (and Not to Write),” ARL, 1, 26, 3.] A disastrous intellectual package-deal, put over on us by the theoreticians ofstatism, is the equation of economic power with political power. You have heardit expressed in such bromides as: “A hungry man is not free,” or “It makes nodifference to a worker whether he takes orders from a businessman or from abureaucrat.” Most people accept these equivocations—and yet they know that thepoorest laborer in America is freer and more secure than the richest commissarin Soviet Russia. What is the basic, the essential, the crucial principle thatdifferentiates freedom from slavery? It is the principle of voluntary actionversus physical coercion or compulsion.The difference between political power and any other kind of social “power,”between a government and any private organisation, is the fact that a governmentholds a legal monopoly on the use of physical force.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 46.] A typical package-deal, used by professors of philosophy, runs as follows: toprove the assertion that there is no such thing as “necessity” in the universe,a professor declares that just as this country did not have to have fiftystates, there could have been forty-eight or fifty-two—so the solar system didnot have to have nine planets, there could have been seven or eleven. It is notsufficient, he declares, to prove that something is, one must also prove that ithad to be—and since nothing had to be, nothing is certain and anything goes.[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 34; pb 28.]See also “ANTI-CONCEPTS”; DEFINITIONS; ECONOMIC POWER vs. POLITICAL POWER;FUNDAMENTALITY, RULE of; NECESSITY; “RAND’S RAZOR”; STATISM. Painting. Painting [re-creates reality] by means of color on a two-dimensionalsurface.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 46.] The so-called visual arts (painting, sculpture, architecture) produce concrete,perceptually available entities and make them convey an abstract, conceptualmeaning.[Ibid., 47.] The visual arts do not deal with the sensory field of awareness as such, butwith the sensory field as perceived by a conceptual consciousness.[Ibid.] It is a common experience to observe that a particular painting—foi example, astill life of apples—makes its subject “more real than it is in reality.” Theapples seem brighter and firmer, they seem to possess an almost self-assertivecharacter, a kind of heightened reality which neither their real-life models norany color photograph can match. Yet if one examines them closely, one sees thatno real-life apple ever looked like that. What is it, then, that the artist hasdone? He has created a visual abstraction.He has performed the process of concept-formation—of isolating andintegrating—but in exclusively visual terms. He has isolated the essential,distinguishing characteristics of apples, and integrated them into a singlevisual unit. He has brought the conceptual method of functioning to theoperations of a single sense organ, the organ of sight.[Ibid. ] The closer an artist comes to a conceptual method of functioning visually, thegreater his work. The greatest of all artists, Vermeer, devoted his paintings toa single theme: light itself. The guiding principle of his compositions is: thecontextual nature of our perception of light (and of color). The physicalobjects in a Vermeer canvas are chosen and placed in such a way that theircombined interrelationships feature, lead to and make possible the painting’sbrightest patches of light, sometimes blindingly bright, in a manner which noone has been able to render before or since.(Compare the radiant austerity of Vermeer’s work to the silliness of thedots-and-dashes Impressionists who allegedly intended to paint pure light. Heraised perception to the conceptual level; they attempted to disintegrateperception into sense data.)One might wish (and I do) that Vermeer had chosen better subjects to express histheme, but to him, apparently, the subjects were only the means to his end. Whathis style projects is a concretized image of an immense, nonvisual abstraction:the psycho-epistemology of a rational mind. It projects clarity, discipline,confidence, purpose, power—a universe open to man. When one feels, looking at aVermeer painting: “This is my view of life,” the feeling involves much more thanmere visual perception.[Ibid., 48.] See also ABSTRACTIONS and CONCRETES; ART; BEAUTY; CONCEPTS; CONTEXT; ESTHETICS;MODERN ART; SENSE of LIFE; STYLE; SUBJECT (in ART); VISUAL ARTS. Parts of Speech. See Grammar. Patents and Copyrights. Patents and copyrights are the legal implementation ofthe base of all property rights: a man’s right to the product of his mind.[“Patents and Copyrights,” CUI, 130.] What the patent and copyright laws acknowledge is the paramount role of mentaleffort in the production of material values; these laws protect the mind’scontribution in its purest form: the origination of an idea. The subject ofpatents and copyrights is intellectual property.An idea as such cannot be protected until it has been given a material form. Aninvention has to be embodied in a physical model before it can be patented; astory has to be written or printed. But what the patent or copyright protects isnot the physical object as such, but the idea which it embodies. By forbiddingan unauthorized reproduction of the object, the law declares, in effect, thatthe physical labor of copying is not the source of the object’s value, that thatvalue is created by the originator of the idea and may not be used without hisconsent; thus the law establishes the property right of a mind to that which ithas brought into existence.It is important to note, in this connection, that a discovery cannot bepatented, only an invention. A scientific or philosophical discovery, whichidentifies a law of nature, a principle or a fact of reality not previouslyknown, cannot be the exclusive property of the discoverer because: (a) he didnot create it, and (b) if he cares to make his discovery public, claiming it tobe true, he cannot demand that men continue to pursue or practice falsehoodsexcept by his permission. He ran copyright the book in which he presents hisdiscovery and he can demand that his authorship of the discovery beacknowledged, that no other man appropriate or plagiarize the credit for it—buthe cannot copyright theoretical knowledge. Patents and copyrights pertain onlyto the practical application of knowledge, to the creation of a specific objectwhich did not exist in nature—an object which, in the case of patents, may neverhave existed without its particular originator; and in the case of copyrights,would never have existed.The government does not “grant” a patent or copyright, in the sense of a gift,privilege, or favor; the government merely secures it—i.e.. the governmentcertifies the origination of an idea and protects its owner’s exclusive right ofuse and disposal.[Ibid.] Since intellectual property rights cannot be exercised in perpetuity, thequestion of their time limit is an enormously complex issue.... In the case ofcopyrights, the most rational solution is Great Britain’s Copyright Act of 1911.which established the copyright of books, paintings, movies, etc. for thelifetime of the author and fifty years thereafter.[Ibid., 132.] As an objection to the patent laws, some people cite the fact that two inventorsmay work independently for years on the same invention, but one will beat theother to the patent office by an hour or a day and will acquire an exclusivemonopoly, while the loser’s work will then be totally wasted. This type ofobjection is based on the error of equating the potential with the actual. Thefact that a man might have been first, does not alter the fact that he wasn’t.Since the issue is one of commercial rights, the loser in a case of that kindhas to accept the fact that in seeking to trade with others he must face thepossibility of a competitor winning the race, which is true of all types ofcompetition.[Ibid., 133.] See also CREATION; GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; PROPERTY RIGHTS. Peace Movements. Observe the nature of today’s alleged peace movements.Professing love and concern for the survival of mankind, they keep screamingthat the nuclear-weapons race should be stopped, that armed force should beabolished as a means of settling disputes among nations, and that war should beoutlawed in the name of humanity. Yet these same peace movements do not opposedictatorships; the political views of their members range through all shades ofthe statist spectrum, from welfare statism to socialism to fascism to communism.This means that they are opposed to the use of coercion by one nation againstanother, but not by the government of a nation against its own citizens; itmeans that they are opposed to the use of force against armed adversaries, butnot against the disarmed.Consider the plunder, the destruction, the starvation, the brutality, theslave-labor camps, the torture chambers, the wholesale slaughter perpetrated bydictatorships. Yet this is what today’s alleged peace-lovers are willing toadvocate or tolerate—in the name of love for humanity.[“‘The Roots of War,” CUI, 35.] It is capitalism that today’s peace-lovers oppose and statism that theyadvocate—in the name of peace.Laissez-faire capitalism is the only social system based on the recognition ofindividual rights and, therefore, the only system that bans force from socialrelationships. By the nature of its basic principles and interests, it is theonly system fundamentally opposed to war.[Ibid., 37.] It is true that nuclear weapons have made wars too horrible to contemplate. Butit makes no difference to a man whether he is killed by a nuclear bomb or adynamite bomb or an old-fashioned club. Nor does the number of other victims orthe scale of the destruction make any difference to him. And there is somethingobscene in the attitude of those who regard horror as a matter of numbers, whoare willing to send a small group of youths to die for the tribe, but screamagainst the danger to the tribe itself—and more: who are willing to condone theslaughter of defenseless victims, but march in protest against wars between thewell-armed....If nuclear weapons are a dreadful threat and mankind cannot afford war anylonger, then mankind cannot afford statism any longer. Let no man of good willtake it upon his conscience to advocate the rule of force—outside or inside hisown country. Let all those who are actually concerned with peace—those who dolove man and do care about his survival—realize that if war is ever to beoutlawed, it is the use of force that has to be outlawed.[Ibid., 42.] See also CAPITALISM; DICTATORSHIP; FOREIGN POLICY; GENOCIDE; PACIFISM; PHYSICALFORCE; RETALIATORY FORCE; SELF-DEFENSE; SOVIET RUSSIA; STATISM; WAR. Perception. The higher organisms possess a much more potent form ofconsciousness: they possess the faculty of retaining sensations, which is thefaculty of perception. A “perception” is a group of sensations automaticallyretained and integrated by the brain of a living organism, which gives it theability to be aware, not of single stimuli, but of entities, of things. Ananimal is guided, not merely by immediate sensations, but by percepts. Itsactions are not single, discrete responses to single, separate stimuli, but aredirected by an integrated awareness of the perceptual reality confronting it. Itis able to grasp the perceptual concretes immediately present and it is able toform automatic perceptual associations, but it can go no further.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 10; pb 19.] Man’s senses are his only direct cognitive contact with reality and, therefore,his only source of information. Without sensory evidence, there can be noconcepts; without concepts, there can be no language; without language, therecan he no knowledge and no science.[“Kant Versus Sullivan.” PWNI, 108; pb 90.] Although, chronologically, man’s consciousness develops in three stages: thestage of sensations, the perceptual, the conceptual—epistemologically, the baseof all of man’s knowledge is the perceptual stage.Sensations, as such, are not retained in man’s memory, nor is man able toexperience a pure isolated sensation. As far as can be ascertained, an infant’ssensory experience is an undifferentiated chaos. Discriminated awareness beginson the level of percepts.A percept is a group of sensations aummatically retained and integrated by thebrain of a living organism. It is in the form of percepts that man grasps theevidence of his senses and apprehends reality. When we speak of “directperception” or “direct awareness,” we mean the perceptual level. Percepts, notsensations, are the given, the self-evident. The knowledge of sensations ascomponents of percepts is not direct, it is acquired by man much later: it is ascientific, conceptual discovery.[ITOE, 5.] [Man’s] senses do not provide him with automatic knowledge in separate snatchesindependent of context, but only with the material of knowledge, which his mindmust learn to integrate.... His senses cannot deceive him, ... physical objectscannot act without causes, ... his organs of perception are physical and have novolition, no power to invent or to distort ... the evidence they give him is anabsolute, but his mind must learn to understand it, his mind must discover thenature, the causes, the full context of his sensory material, his mind mustidentify the things that he perceives.[GS, FNI, 194; pb 156.] Let the witch doctor who does not choose to accept the validity of sensoryperception, try to prove it without using the data he obtained by sensoryperception.[Ibid., 193; pb 155.] The arguments of those who attack the senses are merely variants of the fallacyof the “stolen concept.”[ITOE, 4.] As far as can be ascertained, the perceptual level of a child’s awareness issimilar to the awareness of the higher animals: the higher animals are able toperceive entities, motions, attributes, and certain numbers of entities. Butwhat an animal cannot perform is the process of abstraction —of mentallyseparating attributes, motions or numbers from entities. It has been said thatan animal can perceive two oranges or two potatoes, but cannot grasp the concept“two.”[Ibid., 19.] The range of man’s perceptual awareness—the number of percepts he can deal withat any one time—is limited. He may be able to visualize four or five units—as,for instance, five trees. He cannot visualize a hundred trees or a distance often light-years. It is only his conceptual faculty that makes it possible forhim to deal with knowledge of that kind.[“The Psycho-Epistemology of Art,” RM, 20; pb 17.]See also AXIOMS; CONCEPTS; CONSCIOUSNESS; ENTITY; EPISTEMOLOGY; FREE WILL;HIERARCHY of KNOWLEDGE; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); OSTENSIVE DEFINITION; PRIMACY ofEXISTENCE vs. PRIMACY of CONSCIOUSNESS; REASON; SELF-EVIDENT; SENSATIONS;“STOLEN CONCEPT,” FALLACY of; UNIT-ECONOMY. Performing Arts. Let us turn now to the performing arts (acting, playing amusical instrument, singing, dancing).In these arts, the medium employed is the person of the artist. His task is notto re-create reality, but to implement the re-creation made by one of theprimary arts.This does not mean that the performing arts are secondary in esthetic value orimportance, but only that they are an extension of and dependent on the primaryarts. Nor does it mean that performers are mere “interpreters”: on the higherlevels of his art, a performer contributes a creative element which the primarywork could not convey by itself; he becomes a partner, almost a co-creator—ifand when he is guided by the principle that he is the means to the end set bythe work.The basic principles which apply to all the other arts, apply to the performingartist as well, particularly stylization, i.e., selectivity: the choice andemphasis of essentials, the structuring of the progressive steps of aperformance which lead to an ultimately meaningful sum. The performing artist’sown metaphysical value-judgments are called upon to create and apply the kind oftechnique his performance requires. For instance, an actor’s view of humangrandeur or baseness or courage or timidity will determine how he projects thesequalities on the stage. A work intended to be performed leaves a wide latitudeof creative choice to the artist who will perform it. In an almost literalsense, he has to embody the soul created by the author of the work: a specialkind of creativeness is required to bring that soul into full physical reality.When the performance and the work (literary or musical) are perfectly integratedin meaning, style and intention, the result is a magnificent estheticachievement and an unforgettable experience for the audience.The psycho-epistemological role of the performing arts—their relationship toman’s cognitive faculty—lies in the full concretization of the metaphysicalabstractions projected by a work of the primary arts. The distinction of theperforming arts lies in their immediacy—in the fact that they translate a workof art into existential action, into a concrete event open to direct awareness.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 64.] Music and/or literature are the base of the performing arts and of thelarge-scale combinations of all the arts, such as opera or motion pictures. Thebase, in this context, means that primary art which provides the metaphysicalelement and enables the performance to become a concretization of an abstractview of man.Without this base, a performance may be entertaining, in such fields asvaudeville or the circus, but it has nothing to do with art. The performance ofan aerialist, for instance, demands an enormous physical skill —greater,perhaps, and harder to acquire than the skill demanded of a ballet dancer—butwhat it offers is merely an exhibition of that skill, with no further meaning,i.e., a concrete, not a concretization of anything.[Ibid., 70.] See also ART; BALLET; DANCE; ESTHETICS; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); METAPHYSICAL VALUEJUDGMENTS; MUSIC; OPERA and OPERETTA; PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY. Permission (vs. Rights). A right is the sanction of independent action. A rightis that which can be exercised without anyone’s permission.If you exist only because society permits you to exist—you have no right to yourown life. A permission can be revoked at any time.If, before undertaking some action, you must obtain the permission ofsociety—you are not free, whether such permission is granted to you or not. Onlya slave acts on permission. A permission is not a right.Do not make the mistake, at this point, of thinking that a worker is a slave andthat he holds his job by his employer’s permission. He does not hold it bypermission—but by contract, that is, by a voluntary mutual agreement. A workercan quit his job. A slave cannot.[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet, 5.] See also CONTRACTS; INALIENABILITY; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. Philosophy. Philosophy studies the fundamental nature of existence, of man, andof man’s relationship to existence. As against the special sciences, which dealonly with particular aspects, philosophy deals with those aspects of theuniverse which pertain to everything that exists. In the realm of cognition, thespecial sciences are the trees, but philosophy-is the soil which makes theforest possible.[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 2; pb 2.] Philosophy is the science that studies the fundamental aspects of the nature ofexistence. The task of philosophy is to provide man with a comprehensive view oflife. This view serves as a base, a frame of reference, for all his actions,mental or physical, psychological or existential. This view tells him the natureof the universe with which he has to deal (metaphysics); the means by which heis to deal with it, i.e., the means of acquiring knowledge (epistemology); thestandards by which he is to choose his goals and values, in regard to his ownlife and character (ethics)—and in regard to society (politics); the means ofconcretizing this view is given to him by esthetics.[“The Chickens’ Homecoming,” NL, 107.] In order to live, man must act; in order to act, he must make choices; in orderto make choices, he must define a code of values; in order to define a code ofvalues, he must know what he is and where he is—i.e., he must know his ownnature (including his means of knowledge) and the nature of the universe inwhich he acts—i.e., he needs metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, which means:philosophy. He cannot escape from this need; his only alternative is whether thephilosophy guiding him is to be chosen by his mind or by chance.[“Philosophy and Sense of Life,” RM, 37; pb 30.] As a human being, you have no choice about the fact that you need a philosophy.Your only choice is whether you define your philosophy by a conscious, rational,disciplined process of thought and scrupulously logical deliberation—or let yoursubconscious accumulate a junk heap of unwarranted conclusions, falsegeneralizations, undefined contradictions, undigested slogans, unidentifiedwishes, doubts and fears, thrown together by chance, but integrated by yoursubconscious into a kind of mongrel philosophy and fused into a single, solidweight: self-doubt, like a ball and chain in the place where your mind’s wingsshould have grown.[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 6; pb 5.] The men who are not interested in philosophy need it most urgently: they aremost helplessly in its power.The men who are not interested in philosophy absorb its principles from thecultural atmosphere around them—from schools, colleges, books, magazines,newspapers, movies, television, etc. Who sets the tone of a culture? A smallhandful of men: the philosophers. Others follow their lead, either by convictionor by default.[Ibid., 8; pb 6.] Philosophy is a necessity for a rational being: philosophy is the foundation ofscience, the organizer of man’s mind, the integrator of his knowledge, theprogrammer of his subconscious, the selector of his values. [“From the Horse’s Mouth,” PWNI, 99; pb 82.] just as a man’s actions are preceded and determined by some form of idea in hismind, so a society’s existential conditions are preceded and determined by theascendancy of a certain philosophy among those whose job is to deal with ideas.The events of any given period of history are the result of the thinking of thepreceding period.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 27; pb 28.] The power that determines the establishment, the changes, the evolution, and thedestruction of social systems is philosophy. The role of chance, accident, ortradition, in this context, is the same as their role in the life of anindividual: their power stands in inverse ratio to the power of a culture’s (oran individual’s) philosophical equipment, and grows as philosophy collapses. Itis, therefore, by reference to philosophy that the character of a social systemhas to be defined and evaluated.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 19.] The present state of the world is not the proof of philosophy’s impotence, butthe proof of philosophy’s power. It is philosophy that has brought men to thisstate—it is only philosophy that can lead them out. [“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 58; pb 50.] In philosophy, the fundamentals are metaphysics and epistemology. On the basisof a knowable universe and of a rational faculty’s competence to grasp it, youcan define man’s proper ethics, politics and esthetics. (And if you make anerror, you retain the means and the frame of reference necessary to correct it.)But what will you accomplish if you advocate honesty in ethics, while tellingmen that there is no such thing as truth, fact or reality? What will you do ifyou advocate political freedom on the grounds that you feel it is good, and findyourself confronting an ambitious thug who declares that he feels quitedifferently?The layman’s error, in regard to philosophy, is the tendency to acceptconsequences while ignoring their causes—to take the end result of a longsequence of thought as the given and to regard it as “self-evident” of as anirreducible primary, while negating its preconditions.[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 14; pb 12.] Philosophy provides man with a comprehensive view of life. In order to evaluateit properly, ask yourself what a given theory, if accepted, would do to a humanlife, starting with your own.[Ibid., 19; pb 16.] Man came into his own in Greece, some two-and-a-half thousand years ago. Thebirth of philosophy marked his adulthood; not the content of any particularsystem of philosophy, but deeper: the concept of philosophy—the realization thata comprehensive view of existence is to be reached by man’s mind.Philosophy is the goal toward which religion was only a helplessly blindgroping. The grandeur, the reverence, the exalted purity, the austere dedicationto the pursuit of truth, which are commonly associated with religion, shouldproperly belong to the field of philosophy. Aristotle lived up to it and, inpart, so did Plato, Aquinas, Spinoza—but how many others? It is earlier than wethink.If you observe that ever since Hume and Kant (mainly Kant, because Hume wasmerely the Bertrand Russell of his time) philosophy has been striving to provethat man’s mind is impotent, that there’s no such thing as reality and wewouldn’t be able to perceive it if there were—you will realize the magnitude ofthe treason involved.[“The Chickens’ Homecoming,” NL, 107.] The foundation of any culture, the source responsible for all of itsmanifestations, is its philosophy. What does modern philosophy offer us?Virtually the only point of agreement among today’s leading philosophers is thatthere is no such thing as philosophy—and that this knowledge constitutes theirclaim to the title of philosophers. With a hysterical virulence, strange inadvocates of skepticism, they insist that there can be no valid philosophicalsystems (i.e., there can be no integrated, consistent, comprehensive view ofexistence)—that there are no answers to fundamental questions—there is no suchthing as truth—there is no such thing as reason, and the battle is only overwhat should replace it: “linguistic games” or unbridled feelings?[“Our Cultural Value-Deprivation,” TO, April 1966, 4.] If, in the course of philosophical detection, you find yourself, at times,stopped by the indignantly bewildered question: “How could anyone arrive at suchnonsense?”—you will begin to understand it when you discover that evilphilosophies are systems of rationalization.[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 22; pb 18.] Even though philosophy is held in a (today) well-earned contempt by the othercollege departments, it is philosophy that determines the nature and directionof all the other courses, because it is philosophy that formulates theprinciples of epistemology, i.e., the rules by which men are to acquireknowledge. The influence of the dominant philosophic theories permeates everyother department, including the physical sciences.[“The Comprachicos,” NL, 224.] Philosophy is the foundation of science; epistemology is the foundation ofphilosophy. It is with a new approach to epistemology that the rebirth ofphilosophy has to begin.[ITOE, 99.]See also ARISTOTLE; COMMON SENSE; CULTURE; EPISTEMOLOGY; ESTHETICS; HISTORY;IDEOLOGY; INTELLECTUALS; LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS; LOGICAL POSITIVISM; MAN;METAPHYSICS; MILL, JOHN STUART; MORALITY; NIETZSCHE, FRIEDRICH; OBJECTIVISM;POLITICS; PRAGMATISM; PRINCIPLES; RATIONALISM vs. EMPIRICISM; RATIONALIZATION;REASON; RELIGION; SCIENCE; SELF-EVIDENT. Photography. A certain type of confusion about the relationship betweenscientific discoveries and art, leads to a frequently asked question: Isphotography an art? The answer is: No. It is a technical, not a creative, skill.Art requires a selective re-creation. A camera cannot perform the basic task ofpainting: a visual conceptualization, i.e., the creation of a concrete in termsof abstract essentials. The selection of camera angles, lighting or lenses ismerely a selection of the means to reproduce various aspects of the given, i.e.,of an existing concrete. There is an artistic element in some photographs, whichis the result of such selectivity as the photographer can exercise, and some ofthem can be very beautiful—but the same artistic element (purposefulselectivity) is present in many utilitarian products: in the better kinds offurniture, dress design, automobiles, packaging, etc. The commercial art work inads (or posters or postage stamps) is frequently done by real artists and hasgreater esthetic value than many paintings, but utilitarian objects cannot beclassified as works of art.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 74.1See also ART; ESTHETICS.Physical Force. Whatever may be open to disagreement, there is one act of evilthat may not, the act that no man may commit against others and no man maysanction or forgive. So long as men desire to live together, no man mayinitiate—do you hear me? no man may start —the use of physical force againstothers.To interpose the threat of physical destruction between a man and his perceptionof reality, is to negate and paralyze his means of survival; to force him to actagainst his own judgment, is like forcing him to act against his own sight.Whoever, to whatever purpose or extent, initiates the use of force, is a killeracting on the premise of death in a manner wider than murder: the premise ofdestroying man’s capacity to live.Do not open your mouth to tell me that your mind has convinced you of your rightto force my mind. Force and mind are opposites; morality ends where a gunbegins. When you declare that men are irrational animals and propose to treatthem as such, you define thereby your own character and can no longer claim thesanction of reason—as no advocate of contradictions can claim it. There can beno “right” to destroy the source of rights, the only means of judging right andwrong: the mind.To force a man to drop his own mind and to accept your will as a substitute,with a gun in place of a syllogism, with terror in place of proof, and death asthe final argument—is to attempt to exist in defiance of reality. Realitydemands of man that he act for his own rational interest; your gun demands ofhim that he act against it. Reality threatens man with death if he does not acton his rational judgment; you threaten him with death if he does. You place himin a world where the price of his life is the surrender of all the virtuesrequired by life—and death by a process of gradual destruction is all that youand your system will achieve, when death is made to be the ruling power, thewinning argument in a society of men.Be it a highwayman who confronts a traveler with the ultimatum: “Your money oryour life,” or a politician who confronts a country with the ultimatum: “Yourchildren’s education or your life,” the meaning of that ultimatum is: “Your mindor your life”—and neither is possible to man without the other.[GS, FNI, 164; pb 133.] The basic political principle of the Objectivist ethics is: no man may initiatethe use of physical force against others. No man—or group or society orgovernment—has the right to assume the role of a criminal and initiate the useof physical compulsion against any man. Men have the right to use physical forceonly in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use. The ethicalprinciple involved is simple and clear-cut: it is the difference between murderand self-defense. A holdup man seeks to gain a value, wealth, by killing hisvictim; the victim does not grow richer by killing a holdup man. The principleis: no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 31; pb 32.] Man’s rights can be violated only by the use of physical force. It is only bymeans of physical force that one man can deprive another of his life, or enslavehim, or rob him, or prevent him from pursuing his own goals, or compel him toact against his own rational judgment.The precondition of a civilized society is the barring of physical force fromsocial relationships—thus establishing the principle that if men wish to dealwith one another, they may do so only by means of reason: by discussion,persuasion and voluntary, uncoerced agreement.[“The Nature of Government,” VOS, 146; pb 108.] When men abandon reason, physical force becomes their only means of dealing withone another and of settling disagreements.[“The Comprachicos,” NL., 234.] A rational mind does not work under compulsion; it does not subordinate itsgrasp of reality to anyone’s orders, directives, or controls; it does notsacrifice its knowledge, its view of the truth, to anyone’s opinions, threats,wishes, plans, or “welfare.” Such a mind may be hampered by others, it may besilenced, proscribed, imprisoned, or destroyed; it cannot be forced; a gun isnot an argument. (An example and symbol of this attitude is Galileo.)[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 17.] Force is the antonym and negation of thought. Understanding is not produced by apunch in the face; intellectual clarity does not flow from the muzzle of a gun;the weighing of evidence is not mediated by spasms of terror. The mind is acognitive faculty; it cannot achieve knowledge or conviction apart from oragainst its perception of reality; it cannot be forced.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 336; pb 309.] An attempt to achieve the good by physical force is a monstrous contradictionwhich negates morality at its root by destroying man’s capacity to recognize thegood, i.e., his capacity to value. Force invalidates and paralyzes a man’sjudgment, demanding that he act against it, thus rendering him morally impotent.A value which one is forced to accept at the price of surrendering one’s mind,is not a value to anyone; the forcibly mindless can neither judge nor choose norvalue. An attempt to achieve the good by force is like an attempt to provide aman with a picture gallery at the price of cutting out his eyes. Values cannotexist (cannot be valued) outside the full context of a man’s life, needs, goals.and knowledge.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 23.] To deal with men by force is as impractical as to deal with nature bypersuasion.[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNl, 39; pb 32.] If some men attempt to survive by means of brute force or fraud, by looting,robbing, cheating or enslaving the men who produce, it still remains true thattheir survival is made possible only by their victims, only by the men whochoose to think and to produce the goods which they, the looters, are seizing.Such looters are parasites incapable of survival. who exist by destroying thosewho are capable, those who are pursuing a course of action proper to man.The men who attempt to survive, not by means of reason, but by means of force,are attempting to survive by the method of animals. But just as animals wouldnot be able to survive by attempting the method of plants, by rejectinglocomotion and waiting for the soil to feed them —so men cannot survive byattempting the method of animals, by rejecting reason and counting on productivemen to serve as their prey. Such looters may achieve their goals for the rangeof a moment, at the price of destruction: the destruction of their victims andtheir own. As evidence. I offer you any criminal or any dictatorship.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 17.] One does not and cannot “negotiate” with brutality, nor give it the benefit ofthe doubt. The moral absolute should be: if and when, in any dispute, one sideinitiates the use of physical force, that side is wrong— and no consideration ordiscussion of the issues is necessary or appropriate.[“Brief Comments,” TO, March 1969, 1.] When a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters-by-law—men who useforce to seize the wealth of disarmed victims—then money becomes its creators’avenger. Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once they’vepassed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for otherlooters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to theablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is thestandard, the murderer wins over the pickpocket.[“‘The Meaning of Money,” FNI. 109; pb 92.] There are only two fundamental methods by which men can deal with one another:by reason or by force, by intellectual persuasion or by physical coercion, bydirecting to an opponent’s brain an argument—or a bullet.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 90; pb 90.] Those who declare, today, that force is the only way to deal with men (with theunstated footnote that they, the speakers, would be safe in the position ofrulers), ought to take a careful look at the history of absolute monarchies—andof modern dictatorships as well. Under the rule of force, it is the rulers whoare in greatest danger, who live—and die—in permanent terror. The courtintrigues, the plots and counterplots, the coups d’état, the known executionsand secret assassinations are a matter of record. So are the purges of Partyleaders and their cliques, in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.[“A Nation’s Unity,” ARL, II, 2, 2.] Altruism gives to the use of force a moral sanction, making it not only anunavoidable practical recourse, but also a positive virtue, an expression ofmilitant righteousness.A man is morally the property of others—of those others it is his duty toserve—argue Fichte, Hegel, and the rest, explicitly or by implication. As such,a man has no moral right to refuse to make the requisite sacrifices for others.If he attempts it, he is depriving men of what is properly theirs, he isviolating men’s rights, their right to his service—and it is, therefore, anassertion of morality if others intervene forcibly and compel him to fulfill hisobligations. “Social justice” in this view not only allows but demands the useof force against the non-sacrificial individual.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 90; pb 91.] The use of physical force—even its retaliatory use—cannot be left at thediscretion of individual citizens. Peaceful coexistence is impossible if a manhas to live under the constant threat of force to be unleashed against him byany of his neighbors at any moment. Whether his neighbors’ intentions are goodor bad, whether their judgment is rational or irrational, whether they aremotivated by a sense of justice or by ignorance or by prejudice or by malice—theuse of force against one man cannot be left to the arbitrary decision ofanother.Visualize, for example, what would happen if a man missed his wallet, concludedthat he had been robbed, broke into every house in the neighborhood to searchit, and shot the first man who gave him a dirty look, taking the look to be aproof of guilt.The retaliatory use of force requires objective rules of evidence to establishthat a crime has been committed and to prove who committed it, as well asobjective rules to define punishments and enforcement procedures. Men whoattempt to prosecute crimes, without such rules, are a lynch mob. If a societyleft the retaliatory use of force in the hands of individual citizens, it woulddegenerate into mob rule, lynch law and an endless series of bloody privatefeuds or vendettas.If physical force is to be barred from social relationships, men need aninstitution charged with the task of protecting their rights under an objectivecode of rules.This is the task of a government—of a proper government—its basic task, its onlymoral justification and the reason why men do need a government.A government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force underobjective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws.[“The Nature of Government,” VOS, 146; pb 108.] A unilateral breach of contract involves an indirect use of physical force: itconsists, in essence, of one man receiving the material values, goods orservices of another, then refusing to pay for them and thus keeping them byforce (by mere physical possession), not by right—i.e., keeping them without theconsent of their owner. Fraud involves a similarly indirect use of force: itconsists of obtaining material values without their owner’s consent, under falsepretenses or false promises. Extortion is another variant of an indirect use offorce: it consists of obtaining material values, not in exchange for values, butby the threat of force, violence or injury.[Ibid., 150; pb 111.] See also ALTRUISM; CRIME; DICTATORSHIP; ECONOMIC POWER vs. POLITICAL POWER;FRAUD; FREEDOM; GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; JUSTICE; LAW, OBJECTIVE andNON-OBJECTIVE; MORALITY; OBJECTIVE THEORY of VALUES; PRODUCTION; REASON;RETALIATORY FORCE; SELF-DEFENSE; SELFISHNESS; STATISM; WAR.

The “extreme realists” or Platonists,... hold thatabstractions exist as real entities or archetypes in another dimension ofreality and that the concretes we perceive are merely their imperfectreflections, but the concretes evoke the abstractions in our mind. (According toPlato, they do so by evoking the memory of the archetypes which we had known,before birth, in that other dimension.)[ITOE, 2.] The extreme realist (Platonist) and the moderate realist (Aristotelian) schoolsof thought regard the referents of concepts as intrinsic, i.e., as “universals”inherent in things (either as archetypes or as metaphysical essences), asspecial existents unrelated to man’s consciousness—to be perceived by mandirectly, like any other kind of concrete existents, but perceived by somenon-sensory or extra-sensory means.[Ibid., 70.] The Platonist school begins by accepting the primacy of consciousness, byreversing the relationship of consciousness to existence, by assuming thatreality must conform to the content of consciousness, not the other wayaround—on the premise that the presence of any notion in man’s mind proves theexistence of a corresponding referent in reality.[Ibid., 71.] The content of true reality, according to Plato, is a set of universals orForms—in effect, a set of disembodied abstractions representing that which is incommon among various groups of particulars in this world. Thus for Platoabstractions are supernatural existents. They are non-material entities inanother dimension, independent of man’s mind and of any of their materialembodiments. The Forms, Plato tells us repeatedly, are what is really real. Theparticulars they subsume—the concretes that make up this wortd—are not; theyhave only a shadowy, dreamlike half-reality.Momentous conclusions about man are implicit in this metaphysics (and were latermade explicit by a long line of Platonists): since individual men are merelyparticular instances of the universal “man,” they are not ultimately real. Whatis real about men is only the Form which they share in common and reflect. Tocommon sense, there appear to be many separate, individual men, each independentof the others, each fully real in his own right. To Platonism, this is adeception; all the seemingly individual men are really the same one Form, invarious reflections or manifestations. Thus, all men ultimately comprise oneunity, and no earthly man is an autonomous entity—just as. if a man werereflected in a multifaceted mirror, the many reflections would not be autonomousentities.

Pleasure and Pain. Now in what manner does a human being discover the concept of“value”? By what means does he first become aware of the issue of “good or evil”in its simplest form? By means of the physical sensations of pleasure or pain.Just as sensations are the first step of the development of a humanconsciousness in the realm of cognition, so they are its first step in the realmof evaluation.The capacity to experience pleasure or pain is innate in a man’s body; it ispart of his nature, part of the kind of entity he is. He has no choice about it,and he has no choice about the standard that determines what will make himexperience the physical sensation of pleasure or of pain. What is that standard?His life.The pleasure-pain mechanism in the body of man—and in the bodies of all theliving organisms that possess the faculty of consciousness—serves as anautomatic guardian of the organism’s life. The physical sensation of pleasure isa signal indicating that the organism is pursuing the right course of action.The physical sensation of pain is a warning signal of danger, indicating thatthe organism is pursuing the wrong course of action, that something is impairingthe proper function of its body, which requires action to correct it. The bestillustration of this can be seen in the rare, freak cases of children who areborn without the capacity to experience physical pain; such children do notsurvive for long; they have no means of discovering what can injure them, nowarning signals, and thus a minor cut can develop into a deadly infection, or amajor illness can remain undetected until it is too late to fight it. [“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 8; pb 17.] The form in which man experiences the reality of his values is pleasure.... Achronic lack of pleasure, of any enjoyable, rewarding or stimulatingexperiences, produces a slow, gradual, day-by-day erosion of man’s emotionalvitality, which he may ignore or repress, but which is recorded by therelentless computer of his subconscious mechanism that registers an ebbing flow,then a trickle, then a few last drops of fuel —unti) the day when his innermotor stops and he wonders desperately why he has no desire to go on, unable tofind any definable cause of his hopeless, chronic sense of exhaustion.[“Our Cultural Value-Deprivation,” TO, April 1966, 3.]See also EMOTIONS; HAPPINESS; HEDONISM; LIFE; MILL, JOHN STUART; STANDARD ofVALUE; SENSATIONS; SUBCONSCIOUS; SUFFFRING; UTILITARIANISM; VALUES;WHIMS/WHIM-WORSHIP. Plot. A plot is a purposeful progression of logically connected events leadingto the resolution of a climax.The word “purposeful” in this definition has two applications: it applies to theauthor and to the characters of a novel. It demands that the author devise alogical structure of events, a sequence in which every major event is connectedwith, determined by and proceeds from the preceding events of the story—asequence in which nothing is irrelevant, arbitrary or accidental, so that thelogic of the events leads inevitably to a final resolution.Such a sequence cannot be constructed unless the main characters of the novelare engaged in the pursuit of some purpose—unless they are motivated by somegoals that direct their actions. In real life, only a process of finalcausation—i.e.. the process of choosing a goal, then taking the steps to achieveit—can give logical continuity, coherence and meaning to a man’s actions. Onlymen striving to achieve a purpose can move through a meaningful series ofevents.Contrary to the prevalent literary doctrines of today, it is realism thatdemands a plot structure in a novel. All human actions are goal-directed,consciously or subconsciously; purposelessness is contrary to man’s nature: itis a state of neurosis. Therefore, if one is to present man as he is—as he ismetaphysically, by his nature, in reality—one has to present him ingoal-directed action.[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 59; pb 82.] To present a story in terms of action means: to present it in terms of events. Astory in which nothing happens is not a story. A story whose events arehaphazard and accidental is either an inept conglomeration or, at best, achronicle, a memoir, a reportorial recording, not a novel.A chronicle, real or invented, may possess certain values; but these values areprimarily informative—historical or sociological or psychological—not primarilyesthetic or literary; they are only partly literary.Since art is a selective re-creation and since events are the building blocks ofa novel, a writer who fails to exercise selectivity in regard to events defaultson the most important aspect of his art.[Ibid.] Since a plot is the dramatization of goal-directed action, it has to be based onconflict; it may be one character’s inner conflict or a conflict of goals andvalues between two or more characters. Since goals are not achievedautomatically, the dramatization of a purposeful pursuit has to includeobstacles; it has to involve a clash, a struggle—an action struggle, but not apurely physical one. Since art is a concretization of values, there are not manyerrors as bad esthetically—or as dull—as fist fights, chases, escapes and otherforms of physical action, divorced from any psychological conflict orintellectual value-meaning. Physical action, as such, is not a plot nor asubstitute for a plot—as many bad writers attempt to make it, particularly intoday’s television dramas.This is the other side of the mind-body dichotomy that plagues literature. Ideasor psychological states divorced from action do not constitute a story—andneither does physical action divorced from ideas and values. [Ibid., 65; pb 86.] To isolate and bring into clear focus, into a single issue or a single scene,the essence of a conflict which, in “real life,” might be atomized and scatteredover a lifetime in the form of meaningless clashes, to condense a long, steadydrizzle of buckshot into the explosion of a blockbuster—that is the highest,hardest and most demanding function of art. [Ibid., 61; pb 84.] The plot of a novel serves the same function as the steel skeleton of askyscraper: it determines the use, placement and distribution of all the otherelements. Matters such as number of characters, background, descriptions,conversations, introspective passages, etc. have to be determined by what theplot can carry, i.e., have to be integrated with the events and contribute tothe progression of the story. Just as one cannot pile extraneous weight orornamentation on a building without regard for the strength of its skeleton, soone cannot burden a novel with irrelevancies without regard for its plot. Thepenalty, in both cases, is the same: the collapse of the structure.If the characters of a novel engage in lengthy abstract discussions of theirideas, but their ideas do not affect their actions or the events of the story,it is a bad novel....In judging a novel, one must take the events as expressing its meaning, becauseit is the events that present what the story is about. No amount of esotericdiscussions on transcendental topics, attached to a novel in which nothinghappens except “boy meets girl,” will transform it into anything other than “boymeets girl.”This leads to a cardinal principle of good fiction: the theme and the plot of anovel must be integrated—as thoroughly integrated as mind and body or thoughtand action in a rational view of man.[Ibid., 62; pb 84.]See also ART; LITERATURE; MOTIVATION; NATURALISM; NOVEL; PLOT-THEME;ROMANTICISM; THEME (LITERARY); THRILLERS. Plot-Theme. The link between the theme and the events of a novel is an elementwhich I call the plot-theme. It is the first step of the translation of anabstract theme into a story, without which the construction of a plot would beimpossible. A “plot-theme” is the central conflict or “situation” of a story—aconflict in terms of action, corresponding to the theme and complex enough tocreate a purposeful progression of events.The theme of a novel is the core of its abstract meaning—the plot-theme is thecore of its events.For example, the theme of Atlas Shrugged is: “The role of the mind in man’sexistence.” The plot-theme is: “The men of the mind going on strike against analtruist-collectivist society.”The theme of Les Miserable, is: “The injustice of’ society toward its lowerclasses.” The plot-theme is: “The life-long flight of an ex-convict from thepursuit of a ruthless representative of the law.”The theme of Gone With the Wind is: “The impact of the Civil War on Southernsociety.” The plot-theme is: “The romantic conflict of a woman who loves a manrepresenting the old order, and is loved by another man, representing the new.”[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 63; pb 85.]See also PLOT; THEME (LITERARY). Political Power. See Economic Power vs. Political Power. Politics. The answers given by ethics determine how man should treat other men,and this determines the fourth branch of philosophy: politics, which defines theprinciples of a proper social system. As an example of philosophy’s function,political philosophy will not tell you how much rationed gas you should be givenand on which day of the week—it will tell you whether the government has theright to impose any rationing on anything.[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 4; pb 4.] The basic and crucial political issue of our age is: capitalism versussocialism, or freedom versus statism. For decades, this issue has been silenced,suppressed, evaded, and hidden under the foggy, undefined rubber-terms of“conservatism” and “liberalism” which had lost their original meaning and couldbe stretched to mean all things to all men.[“ ‘Extremism,’ or The Art of Smearing,” CUI, 178.] It is political philosophy that sets the goals and determines the course of acountry’s practical politics. But political philosophy means: abstract theory toidentify, explain and evaluate the trend of events, to discover their causes,project their consequences, define the problems and offer the solutions.[“The Chickens’ Homecoming,” NL, 109.] Politics is based on three other philosophical disciplines: metaphysics,epistemology and ethics—on a theory of man’s nature and of man’s relationship toexistence. It is only on such a base that one can formulate a consistentpolitical theory and achieve it in practice. When, however, men attempt to rushinto politics without such a base, the result is that embarrassingconglomeration of impotence, futility, inconsistency and superficiality which isloosely designated today as “conservatism.” Objectivists are not“conservatives.” We are radicals for capitalism; we are fighting for thatphilosophical base which capitalism did not have and without which it was doomedto perish.[“Choose Your Issues,” TON, Jan. 1962, 1.] The basic political principle of the Objectivist ethics is: no man may initiatethe use of physical force against others. No man—or group or society orgovernment—has the right to assume the role of a criminal and initiate the useof physical compulsion against any man. Men have the right to use physical forceonly in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 31; pb 32.] See: Conceptual Index: Politics. Pollution. The word “pollution” implies health hazards, such as smog or dirtywaters.[“The Left: Old and New,” NL, 87.]As far as the issue of actual pollution is concerned, it is primarily ascientific, not a political, problem. In regard to the political principleinvolved: if a man creates a physical danger or harm to others, which extendsbeyond the line of his own property, such as unsanitary conditions or even loudnoise, and if this is proved, the law can and does hold him responsible. If thecondition is collective, such as in an overcrowded city, appropriate andobjective laws can be defined, protecting the rights of all those involved—aswas done in the case of oil rights, air-space rights, etc. But such laws cannotdemand the impossible, must not be aimed at a single scapegoat, i.e., theindustrialists, and must take into consideration the whole context of theproblem, i.e., the absolute necessity of the continued existence of industry—ifthe preservation of human life is the standard.It has been reported in the press many times that the issue of pollution is tobe the next big crusade of the New Left activists, after the war in Vietnampeters out. And just as peace was not their goal or motive in that crusade, soclean air is not their goal or motive in this one.[Ibid., 89.] See also ECOLOGY/ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT; ECONOMIC GROWTH; LAW, OBJECTIVE ANDNON-OBJECTIVE; NEW LEFT; TECHNOLOGY. Potylogism. Polylogism is the doctrine that there is not one correct logic, onecorrect method of reasoning necessarily binding on all men, but that there aremany logics, each valid for some men and invalid for the others. The polylogistdivides men into groups, and holds that each group has by nature (or creates foritself by choice) its own distinctive method of inference based on its owndistinctive logical laws, so that the inferences that are entirely logical forone group are entirely illogical for the others....On the polylogist view, there is no common or universal logic to serve as theobjective standard and arbiter when men disagree. There is no way for members ofopposing groups, with opposing views, to resolve their disputes; it is uselessto appeal to facts or to evidence for this purpose, since the minds which engagein the process of reasoning obey different rules of thinking.In the Nazi version of polylogism, ... there is Aryan logic, British logic,Jewish logic, etc., and these give rise respectively to Aryan truth, Britishtruth, Jewish truth, etc.... The movement that first launched the doctrine ofpolylogism in a culturally influential form [is] Marxism. Aware of the fact thatcommunism cannot be defended by reason, the Marxists proceeded to turn thefallacy of ad hominem into a formal philosophic doctrine, claiming that logicvaries with men’s economic class, and that objections to communist doctrine maybe dismissed as expressions of “bourgeois logic.” Thus, vilification of anopponent replaces analysis of his argument.... Kant [is] the real father ofpolylogism, the first among the major philosophers officially to sever logicfrom reality. ... In terms of fundamentals, Nazi polylogism, like Nazisubjectivism, is simply a pluralizing and racializing of the Kantian view.Actually, polylogism is not a theory of logic—it is a denial of logic. Thepolylogist invests “logic” with the character of a mystic revelation, and turnslogic into its antithesis: instead of being the means of validating objectivelymen’s claims to knowledge, logic becomes a subjective device to be used to“justify” anything anyone wishes.[Leonard Peikoff, “Nazi Politics,” TO, Feb. 1971, 12.]See also COMMUNISM; FASCISM/NAZISM; KANT, IMMANUEL; LOGIC; OBJECTIVITY; RACISM. Popular Literature. Popular literature is fiction that does not deal withabstract problems; it takes moral principles as the given, accepting certaingeneralized, common-sense ideas and values as its base. (Common-sense values andconventional values are not the same thing; the first can be justifiedrationally, the second cannot. Even though the second may include some of thefirst, they are justified, not on the ground of reason, but on the ground ofsocial conformity.)Popular fiction does not raise or answer abstract t questions; it assumes thatman knows what he needs to know in order to live, and it proceeds to show hisadventures in living (which is one of the reasons for its popularity among alltypes of readers, including the problem-laden intellectuals). The distinctivecharacteristic of popular fiction is the absence of an explicitly ideationalelement, of the intent to convey intellectual information (or misinformation).[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 95; pb 110.]See also LITERATURE; ROMANTICISM; THRILLERS. Possible. “X is possible” means: in the present context of knowledge, there issome, but not much, evidence in favor of X and nothing known that contradicts X.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture6.] When you say “maybe,” you are saying there is at least some evidence, somereason to suspect X. This is a claim that must be justified. There are manyfantasies that are outrightly impossible, because they contradict already knownfacts. And there are other fantasies that are mere arbitrary inventions; even ifyou cannot specify facts which contradict these inventions, you have absolutelyno basis to hypothesize them.[Ibid.] It is possible, the skeptic argument declares, for man to be in error;therefore, it is possible that every individual is in error on every question.This argument is a non sequitur; it is an equivocation on the term “possible.”What is possible to a species under some circumstances, is not necessarilypossible to every individual member of that species under every set ofcircumstances. Thus, it is possible for a human being to run the mile in lessthan four minutes; and it is possible for a human being to be pregnant. Icannot, however, go over to a crippled gentleman in his wheelchair and say:“Perhaps you’ll give birth to a son next week, after you’ve run the mile to thehospital in 3.9 minutes—after all, you’re human, and it is possible for humanbeings to do these things.”The same principle applies to the possibility of error.[Leonard Peikoff, “ ‘Maybe You’re Wrong,’ ” TOF, April 1981, 10.] See also AGNOSTICISM; ARBITRARY; CERTAINTY; CHANCE; CONTEXT; KNOWLEDGE;SKEPTICISM. Poverty. If concern for human poverty and suffering were one’s primary motive,one would seek to discover their cause. One would not fail to ask: Why did somenations develop, while others did not? Why have some nations achieved materialabundance, while others have remained stagnant in subhuman misery? History and,specifically, the unprecedented prosperity-explosion of the nineteenth century,would give an immediate answer: capitalism is the only system that enables mento produce abundance—and the key to capitalism is individual freedom.[“Requiem for Man,” CUI, 308.] Poverty is not a mortgage on the labor of others—misfortune is not a mortgage onachievement—failure is not a mortgage on success—sutfering is not a claim check,and its relief is not the goal of existence—man is not a sacrificial animal onanyone’s altar nor for anyone’s cause —life is not one huge hospital.[“Apollo 11,” TO, Sept. 1969, 13.] See also ALTRUISM; CAPITALISM; CHARITY; FREEDOM; NINETEENTH CENTURY; SACRIFICE;SELFISHNESS.Pragmatism. [The Pragmatists] declared that philosophy must be practical andthat practicality consists of dispensing with all absolute principles andstandards—that there is no such thing as objective reality or permanenttruth—that truth is that which works, and its validity can be judged only by itsconsequences -that no facts can be known with certainty in advance, and anythingmay be tried by rule-of-thumb—that reality is not firm, but fluid and“indeterminate,” that there is no such thing as a distinction between anexternal world and a consciousness (between the perceived and the perceiver),there is only an undifferentiated package-deal labeled “experience,” andwhatever one wishes to be true, is true. whatever one wishes to exist, doesexist, provided it works or makes one feel better.A later school of more Kantian Pragmatists amended this philosophy as follows.If there is no such thing as an objective reality, men’s metaphysical choice iswhether the selfish, dictatorial whims of an individual or the democratic whimsof a collective are to shape that plastic goo which the ignorant call “reality,”therefore this school decided that objectivity consists of collectivesubjectivism—that knowledge is to be gained by means of public polls amongspecial elites of “competent investigators” who can “predict and control”reatity—that whatever people wish to he true, is true, whatever people wish toexist, does exist, and anyone who holds any firm convictions of his own is anarbitrary, mystic dogmatist, since reality is indeterminate and people determineits actual nature.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 35; pb 34.] In the whirling Heraclitean flux which is the pragmatist’s universe, there areno absolutes. There are no facts, no fixed laws of logic, no certainty, noobjectivity.There are no facts, only provisional “hypotheses” which for the momentfacilitate human action. There are no fixed laws of logic, only mutable“conventions,” without any basis in reality. (Aristotle’s logic, Dewey remarks,worked so well for earlier cultures that it is now overdue for a replacement.)There is no certainty—the very quest for it, says Dewey, is a fundamentalaberration, a “perversion.” There is no objectivity—the object is created by thethought and action of the subject.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 130; pb 126.] Epistemologically, their dogmatic agnosticism holds, as an absolute, that aprinciple is false because it is a principle—that conceptual integration (i.e.,thinking) is impractical or “simplistic”—that an idea which is clear and simpleis necessarily “extreme and unworkable.” Along with Kant, their philosophicforefather, the pragmatists claim, in effect: “If you perceive it, it cannot bereal,” and: “If you conceive of it, it cannot be true.”What, then, is left to man? The sensation, the wish, the whim, the range and theconcrete of the moment. Since no solution to any problem is possible, anyone’ssuggestion, guess or edict is as valid as anyone else’s —provided it is narrowenough.To give you an example: if a building were threatened with collapse and youdeclared that the crumbling foundation has to be rebuilt, a pragmatist wouldanswer that your solution is too abstract, extreme, unprovable, and thatimmediate priority must be given to the need of putting ornaments on the balconyrailings, because it would make the tenants feel better.There was a time when a man would not utter arguments of this sort, for fear ofbeing rightly considered a fool. Today, Pragmatism has not merely given himpermission to do it and liberated him from the necessity of thought, but haselevated his mental default into an intellectual virtue, has given him the rightto dismiss thinkers (or construction engineers) as naive, and has endowed himwith that typically modern quality: the arrogance of the concrete-bound, whotakes pride in not seeing the forest fire, or the forest, or the trees, while heis studying one inch of bark on a rotted tree stump.[“How to Read (and Not to Write),” ARI., I, 26, 5.] The two points central to the pragmatist ethics are: a formal rejection of allfixed standards—and an unquestioning absorption of the prevailing standards. Thesame two points constitute the pragmatist approach to politics, which, developedmost influentially by Dewey, became the philosophy of the Progressive movementin this country (and of most of its liberal descendants down to the presentday).[Leonard Peikoff, “Pragmatism Versus America,” ARL, III, 17, I.] By itself, as a distinctive theory, the pragmatist ethics is contentless. Iturges men to pursue “practicality,” but refrains from specifying any “rigid” setof values that could serve to define the concept. As a result,pragmatists—despite their repudiation of all systems of morality—are compelled,if they are to implement their ethical approach at all, to rely on value codesformulated by other, non-pragmatist moralists. As a rule the pragmatistappropriates these codes without acknowledging them; he accepts them by aprocess of osmosis, eclectically absorbing the cultural deposits left by themoral theories of his predecessors—and protesting all the while the futility ofthese theories.The dominant, virtually the only, moral code advocated by modern intellectualsin Europe and in America is some variant of altruism. This, accordingly, is whatmost American pragmatists routinely preach....In politics, also, pragmatism presents itself as opposed to “rigidity,” to“dogma,” to “extremes” of any kind (whether capitalist or socialist); it avowsthat it is relativist, “moderate,” “experimental.” As in ethics, however, sohere: the pragmatist is compelled to employ some kind of standard to evaluatethe results of his social experiments, a standard which, given his ownself-imposed default, he necessarily absorbs from other, non-pragmatisttrend-setters.... When Dewey wrote, the political principle imported fromGermany and proliferating in all directions, was collectivism.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 131; pb 128.] Pragmatism is the only twentieth-century philosophy to gain broad, nationalacceptance in the United States.[Ibid., 138; pb 134.] The American people were led to embrace the pragmatist philosophy not because ofits actual, theoretical content (of which they were and remain largelyignorant), but because of the method by which that content was presented tothem. In its terminology and promises, pragmatism is a philosophy calculated toappeal specifically to an American audience....The pragmatists present themselves as the exponents of a distinctively“American” approach, which consists in enshrining the basic premises of [Germanphilosophy] while rejecting every fundamental idea, from metaphysics topolitics, on which this country was founded. Most important of all, theAmericans wanted ideas to be good for something on earth, to have tangible,practical significance; and, insistently, the pragmatists stress “practicality,”which, according to their teachings, consists in action divorced from thoughtand reality.The pragmatists stress the “cash value” of ideas. But the Americans did not knowthe “cash value” of the pragmatist ideas they were buying. They did not knowthat pragmatism could not deliver on its promise of this-worldly successbecause, at root, it is a philosophy which does not believe in this, or any,world.When the Americans flocked to pragmatism, they believed that they were joining abattle to advance their essential view of reality and of life. They did not knowthat they were being marched in the opposite direction, that the battle had beencalculated for a diametrically opposite purpose, or that the enemy they werebeing pushed to destroy was: themselves.[Ibid., 136; pb 132.]See also ABSOLUTES; ALTRUISM; AMERICA; ANTI-CONCEPTUAL MENTALITY; CERTAINTY;COMPROMISE; EDUCATION; KANT, IMMANUEL; MORAL-PRACTICAL DICHOTOMY; MORALITY:OBJECTIVITY; PRIMACY of EXISTENCE vs. PRIMACY of CONSCIOUSNESS; PRINCIPLES;THEORY-PRACTICE DICHOTOMY; TRUTH; WHIMS/ WHIM-WORSHIP. Prestige. The desire for the unearned has two aspects: the unearned in matterand the unearned in spirit. (By “spirit” I mean: man’s consciousness.) These twoaspects are necessarily interrelated, but a man’s desire may be focusedpredominantly on one or the other. The desire for the unearned in spirit is themore destructive of the two and the more corrupt. It is a desire for unearnedgreatness; it is expressed (but not defined) by the foggy murk of the term“prestige.” ...Unearned greatness is so unreal, so neurotic a concept that the wretch who seeksit cannot identify it even to himself: to identify it, is to make it impossible.He needs the irrational, undefinable slogans of altruism and collectivism togive a semiplausible form to his nameless urge and anchor it to reality—tosupport his own self-deception more than to deceive his victims.[“The Monument Builders,” VOS, 115; pb 88.]See also ALTRUISM; COLLECTIVISM; SECOND-HANDERS. Pride. Pride is the recognition of the fact that you are your own highest valueand, like all of man’s values, it has to be earned—that of any achievements opento you, the one that makes all others possible is the creation of your owncharacter—that your character, your actions, your desires, your emotions are theproducts of the premises held by your mind—that as man must produce the physicalvalues he needs to sustain his life, so he must acquire the values of characterthat make his life worth sustaining—that as man is a being of self-made wealth,so he is a being of self-made sou!—[hat to live requires a sense of self-value,but man, who has no automatic values, has no automatic sense of self-esteem andmust earn it by shaping his soul in the image of his moral ideal, in the imageof Man, the rational being he is born able to create, but must create bychoice—that the first precondition of self-esteem is that radiant selfishness ofsoul which desires the best in all things, in values of matter and spirit, asoul that seeks above all else to achieve its own moral perfection, valuingnothing higher than itsetf—and that the proof of an achieved self-esteem is yoursoul’s shudder of contempt and rebellion against the role of a sacrificialanimal, against the vile impertinence of any creed that proposes to immolate theirreplaceable value which is your consciousness and the incomparable glory whichis your existence to the blind evasions and the stagnant decay of others.[GS, FNI. 160: pb 130.] The virtue of Pride can best be described by the term: “moral ambitiousness.” Itmeans that one must earn the right to hold oneself as one’s own highest value byachieving one’s own moral perfection—which one achieves by never accepting anycode of irrational virtues impossible to practice and by never failing topractice the virtues one knows to he rationa!—by never accepting an unearnedguilt and never earning any, or, if one has earned it, never leaving ituncorrected—by never resigning oneself passively to any flaws in one’scharacter—by never placing any concern, wish, fear or mood of the moment abovethe reality of one’s own self-esteem. And, above all, it means one’s rejectionof the role of a sacrificial animal, the rejection of any doctrine that preachesself-immolation as a moral virtue or duty.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 22; pb 27.] See also AMBITION; ARISTOTLE; CHARACTER; EMOTIONS; FREE WILL; HONOR;RATIONALITY; SACRIFICE; SELF-ESTEEM; SELFISHNESS; VIRTUE. Primacy of Existence vs. Primacy of Consciousness. The basic metaphysical issuethat lies at the root of any system of philosophy [is] the primary of existenceor the primacy of consciousness.The primacy of existence (of reality) is the axiom that existence exists, i.e.,that the universe exists independent of consciousness (of any consciousness),that things are what they are, that they possess a specific nature, an identity.The epistemological corollary is the axiom that consciousness is the faculty ofperceiving that which exists—and that man gains knowledge of reality by lookingoutward. The rejection of these axioms represents a reversal: the primacy ofconsciousness—the notion that the universe has no independent existence, that itis the product of a consciousness (either human or divine or both). Theepistemological corollary is the notion that man gains knowledge of reality bylooking inward (either at his own consciousness or at the revelations itreceives from another, superior consciousness).The source of this reversal is the inability or unwillingness fully to grasp thedifference between one’s inner state and the outer world, i.e., between theperceiver and the perceived (thus blending consciousness and existence into oneindeterminate package-deal). This crucial distinction is not given to manautomatically; it has to be learned. It is implicit in any awareness, but it hasto be grasped conceptually and held as an absolute.[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 29; pb 24.] Observe that the philosophical system based on the axiom of the primacy ofexistence (i.e., on recognizing the absolutism of reality) led to therecognition of man’s identity and rights. But the philosophical systems based onthe primacy of consciousness (i.e., on the seemingly megalomaniacal notion thatnature is whatever man wants it to be) lead to the view that man possesses noidentity, that he is infinitely flexible, malleable, usable and disposable. Askyourself why.[Ibid., 34; pb 28.] They want to cheat the axiom of existence and consciousness, they want theirconsciousness to be an instrument not of perceiving but of creating existence,and existence to be not the object but the subject of their consciousness—theywant to be that God they created in their image and likeness, who creates auniverse out of a void by means of an arbitrary whim. But reality is not to becheated. What they achieve is the opposite of their desire. They want anomnipotent power over existence; instead, they lose the power of theirconsciousness. By refusing to know, they condemn themselves to the horror of aperpetual unknown.[GS, FNI, 187; pb 151.] It is important to observe the interrelation of these three axioms [existence,consciousness, and identity]. Existence is the first axiom. The universe existsindependent of consciousness. Man is able to adapt his background to his ownrequirements, but “Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed” (Francis Bacon).There is no mental process that can change the laws of nature or erase facts.The function of consciousness is not to create reality, but to apprehend it.“Existence is Identity, Consciousness is Identification.”The philosophic source of this viewpoint and its major advocate in the historyof philosophy is Aristotle. Its opponents are all the other major traditions,including Platonism, Christianity, and German idealism. Directly or indirectly,these traditions uphold the notion that consciousness is the creator of reality.The essence of this notion is the denial of the axiom that existence exists.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 329; pb 303.]See also ABSOLUTES; AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS; AXIOMS; CONSCIOUSNESS; CREATION;EVASION; EXISTENCE; GOD; IDENTITY; IMAGINATION; KANT, IMMANUEL; METAPHYSICS;MYSTICISM; NATURE; OBJECTIVITY, PHILOSOPHY; PLATONIC REALISM; PRAGMATISM; PRIORCERTAINTY of CONSCIOUSNESS; SUBJECTIVISM; UNIVERSE. Principles. A principle is “a fundamental, primary, or general truth, on whichother truths depend.” Thus a principle is an abstraction which subsumes a greatnumber of concretes. It is only by means of principles that one can set one’slong-range goals and evaluate the concrete alternatives of any given moment. Itis only principles that enable a man to plan his future and to achieve it.The present state of our culture may be gauged by the extent to which principleshave vanished from public discussion, reducing our cultural atmosphere to thesordid, petty senselessness of a bickering family that haggles over trivialconcretes, while betraying all its major values, selling out its future for somespurious advantage of the moment.To make it more grotesque, that haggling is accompanied by an aura of hystericalself-righteousness, in the form of belligerent assertions that one mustcompromise with anybody on anything (except on the tenet that one mustcompromise) and by panicky appeals to “practicality.”But there is nothing as impractical as a so-called “practical” man. His view ofpracticality can best be illustrated as follows: if you want to drive from NewYork to Los Angeles, it is “impractical” and “idealistic” to consult a map andto select the best way to get there; you will get there much faster if you juststart out driving at random, turning (or cutting) any corner, taking any road inany direction, following nothing but the mood and the weather of the moment.The fact is, of course, that by this method you will never get there at all. Butwhile most people do recognize this fact in regard to the course of a journey,they are not so perceptive in regard to the course of their lite and of theircountry.[“The Anatomy of Compromise,” CUI, 144.] Concrete problems cannot even be grasped, let alone judged or solved, withoutreference to abstract principles.[“Credibility and Polarization,” ARL, I, 1, 3.] You have no choice about the necessity to integrate your observations, yourexperiences, your knowledge into abstract ideas, i.e., into principles. Youronly choice is whether these principles are true or false, whether theyrepresent your conscious, rational convictions—or a grab-bag of notions snatchedat random, whose sources, validity, context and consequences you do not know,notions which, more often than not, you would drop like a hot potato if youknew....You might say, as many people do, that it is not easy always to act on abstractprinciples. No, it is not easy. But how much harder is it, to have to act onthem without knowing what they are?[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 6; pb 5.] Consider a few rules about the working of principles in practice and about therelationship of principles to goals....1. In any conflict between two men (or two groups) who hold the same basicprinciples, it is the more consistent one who wins.2. In any collaboration between two men (or two groups) who hold different basicprinciples, it is the more evil or irrational one who wins.3. When opposite basic principles are clearly and openly defined, it works tothe advantage of the rational side; when they are not clearly defined, but arehidden or evaded, it works to the advantage of the irrational side.[“The Anatomy of Compromise,” CUI, 145.] When men abandon principles (i.e., their conceptual faculty), two of the majorresults are: individually, the inability to project the future; socially, theimpossibility of communication.[“Credibility and Polarization,” ARL, I, 1, 3.] Only fundamental principles, rationally validated, dearly understood andvoluntarily accepted, can create a desirable kind of unity among men.

Descartes began with the basic epistemologicalpremise of every Witch Doctor (a premise he shared explicitly with Augustine):“the prior certainty of consciousness,” the belief that the existence of anexternal world is not self-evident, but must be proved by deduction from thecontents of one’s consciousness —which means: the concept of consciousness assome faculty other than the faculty of perception—which means: theindiscriminate contents of one’s consciousness as the irreducible primary andabsolute, to which reality has to conform. What followed was the grotesquelytragic spectacle of philosophers struggling to prove the existence of anexternal world by staring, with the Witch Doctor’s blind, inward stare, at therandom twists of their conceptions—then of perceptions—then of sensations.When the medieval Witch Doctor had merely ordered men to doubt the validity oftheir mind, the philosophers’ rebellion against him consisted of proclaimingthat they doubted whether man was conscious at all and whether anything existedfor him to be conscious of.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 28; pb 28.] See also AXIOMS; CONSCIOUSNESS; EXISTENCE; IRREDUCIBLE PRIMARIES; PRIMACY ofEXISTENCE vs. PRIMACY of CONSCIOUSNESS; SENSATIONS. Production. Production is the application of reason to the problem of survival.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 17.] Have you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electricgenerator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort ofunthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to youby men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food bymeans of nothing but physical motions —and you’ll learn that man’s mind is theroot of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed onearth.But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? Whatstrength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is theproduct of man’s capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who invents amotor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made by theintelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of theincompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is made—beforeit can be looted or mooched—made by the effort of every honest man, each to theextent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he can’t consume morethan he has produced.[“The Meaning of Money,” FNI, 105; pb 89.] Whether it’s a symphony or a coal mine, all work is an act of creating and comesfrom the same source: from an inviolate capacity to see through one’s owneyes—which means: the capacity to perform a rational identification—which means:the capacity to see, to connect and to make what had not been seen, connectedand made before.[“The Nature of an Artist,” FNI, 140; pb 115.]Every type of productive work involves a combination of mental and physicaleffort: of thought and of physical action to translate that thought into amaterial form. The proportion of these two elements varies in different types ofwork. At the lowest end of the scale, the mental effort required to performunskilled manual labor is minimal. At the other end, what the patent andcopyright laws acknowledge is the paramount role of mental effort in theproduction of material values. [“Patents and Copyrights,” CUI, 130.] The root of production is man’s mind; the mind is an attribute of the individualand it does not work under orders, controls and compulsion, as centuries ofstagnation have demonstrated. Progress cannot be planned by government, and itcannot be restricted or retarded; it can only be stopped, as every statistgovernment has demonstrated.[“The Anti-Industrial Revolution,” NL, 140.] See also CONSUMPTION; CREATION; CREATORS; ECONOMIC GOOD; ECONOMIC GROWTH; MONEY;PHYSICAL FORCE; PRODUCTIVENESS; PYRAMID OF ABILITY; REASON; STATISM.

The virtue of Productiveness is the recognition of the fact thatproductive work is the process by which man’s mind sustains his life, theprocess that sets man free of the necessity to adjust himself to his background,as all animals do, and gives him the power to adjust his background to himself.Productive work is the road of man’s unlimited achievement and calls upon thehighest attributes of his character: his creative ability, his ambitiousness,his self-assertive-ness, his refusal to bear uncontested disasters, hisdedication to the goal of reshaping the earth in the image of his values.“Productive work” does not mean the unfocused performance of the motions of somejob. It means the consciously chosen pursuit of a productive career, in any lineof rational endeavor, great or modest, on any level of ability. It is not thedegree of a man’s ability nor the scale of his work that is ethically relevanthere, but the fullest and most purposeful use of his mind.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 21; pb 26.] Productiveness is your acceptance of morality, your recognition of the fact thatyou choose to tive—that productive work is the process by which man’sconsciousness controls his existence, a constant process of acquiring knowledgeand shaping matter to fit one’s purpose, of translating an idea into physicalform, of remaking the earth in the image of one’s values—that all work iscreative work if done by a thinking mind, and no work is creative if done by ablank who repeats in uncritical stupor a routine he has learned from others—thatyour work is yours to choose, and the choice is as wide as your mind, thatnothing more is possible to you and nothing less is human—that to cheat your wayinto a job bigger than your mind can handle is to become a fear-corroded ape onborrowed motions and borrowed time, and to settle down into a job that requiresless than your mind’s full capacity is to cut your motor and sentence yourselfto another kind of motion: decay—that your work is the process of achieving yourvalues, and to lose your ambition for values is to lose your ambition tolive—that your body is a machine, but your mind is its driver, and you mustdrive as far as your mind will take you, with achievement as the goal of yourroad—that the man who has no purpose is a machine that coasts downhill at themercy of any boulder to crash in the first chance ditch, that the man whostifles his mind is a stalled machine slowly going to rust, that the man wholets a leader prescribe his course is a wreck being towed to the scrap heap, andthe man who makes another man his goal is a hitchhiker no driver should everpick up—that your work is the purpose of your life, and you must speed past anykiller who assumes the right to stop you, that any value you might find outsideyour work, any other loyalty or love, can be only travelers you choose to shareyour journey and must be travelers going on their own power in the samedirection.[GS, FNI, 159; pb 130.] Productive work is the central purpose of a rational man’s life, the centralvalue that integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values.Reason is the source, the precondition of his productive work—pride is theresult.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 20; pb 25.]See also AMBITION; CAREER; COMPETITION; CREATORS; LIFE; MORALITY; PRODUCTION;PURPOSE; PRIDE; RATIONALITY; REASON; VIRTUE. Proof. “Proof,” in the full sense, is the process of deriving a conclusion stepby step from the evidence of the senses, each step being taken in accordancewith the laws of logic.[Leonard Peikoff, “Introduction to Logic” lecture series (1974), Lecture 1.] “You cannot prove that you exist or that you’re conscious,” they chatter,blanking out the fact that proof presupposes existence, consciousness and acomplex chain of knowledge: the existence of something to know, of aconsciousness able to know it, and of a knowledge that has learned todistinguish between such concepts as the proved and the unproved.When a savage who has not learned to speak declares that existence must beproved, he is asking you to prove it by means of non-existence —when he declaresthat your consciousness must be proved, he is asking you to prove it by means ofunconsciousness—he is asking you to step into a void outside of existence andconsciousness to give him proof of both—he is asking you to become a zerogaining knowledge about a zero. [GS, FNI, 192; pb 154.] An axiomatic concept is the identification of a primary fact of reality, whichcannot be analyzed, i.e., reduced to other facts or broken into component parts.It is implicit in all facts and in all knowledge. It is the fundamentally givenand directly perceived or experienced, which requires no proof or explanation,but on which all proofs and explanations rest.The first and primary axiomatic concepts are “existence,” “identity” (which is acorollary of “existence”) and “consciousness.” One can study what exists and howconsciousness functions; but one cannot analyze (or “prove”) existence as such,or consciousness as such. These are irreducible primaries. (An attempt to“prove” them is self-contradictory: it is an attempt to “prove” existence bymeans of non-existence, and consciousness by means of unconsciousness.)[ITOE, 73.] See also AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS; AXIOMS; COROLLARIES; IRREDUCIBLE PRIMARIES; LOGIC;OBJECTIVITY; PERCEPTION; REASON; SELF-EVIDENT; VALIDATION. Property Rights. The right to life is the source of all rights—and the right toproperty is their only implementation. Without property rights, no other rightsare possible. Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man whohas no right to the product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. Theman who produces while others dispose of his product, is a slave.Bear in mind that the right to property is a right to action, like all theothers: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequencesof producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earnany property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is theright to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values.[“Man’s Rights,” VOS, 125; pb 94.]Any material element or resource which, in order to become of use or value tomen, requires the application of human knowledge and effort, should be privateproperty—by the right of those who apply the knowledge and effort.[“The Property Status of Airwaves,” CUI, 122.] Just as man can’t exist without his body, so no rights can exist without theright to translate one’s rights into reaiity—to think, to work and to keep theresults—which means: the right of property. The modern mystics of muscle whooffer you the fraudulent alternative of “human rights” versus “property rights,”as if one could exist without the other, are making a last, grotesque attempt torevive the doctrine of soul versus body. Only a ghost can exist without materialproperty; only a slave can work with no right to the product of his effort. Thedoctrine that “human rights are superior to “property rights” simply means thatsome human beings have the right to make property out of others; since thecompetent have nothing to gain from the incompetent, it means the right of theincompetent to own their betters and to use them as productive cattle. Whoeverregards this as human and right, has no right to the title of “human.”The source of property rights is the law of causality. All property and allforms of wealth are produced by man’s mind and labor. As you cannot have effectswithout causes, so you cannot have wealth without its source: withoutintelligence. You cannot force intelligence to work: those who’re able to think,will not work under compulsion; those who will, won’t produce much more than theprice of the whip needed to keep them enslaved. You cannot obtain the productsof a mind except on the owner’s terms, by trade and by volitional consent. Anyother policy of men toward man’s property is the policy of criminals, no matterwhat their numbers. Criminals are savages who play it short-range and starvewhen their prey runs out—just as you’re starving today, you who believed thatcrime could be “practical” if your government decreed that robbery was legal andresistance to robbery illegal.[GS, FNI, 230; pb 182.] Man has to work and produce in order to support his life. He has to support hislife by his own effort and by the guidance of his own mind. If he cannot disposeof the product of his effort, he cannot dispose of his effort; if he cannotdispose of his effort, he cannot dispose of his life. Without property rights,no other rights can be practiced.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 18.]If some men are entitled by right to the products of the work of others, itmeans that those others are deprived of rights and condemned to slave labor.Any alleged “right” of one man, which necessitates the violation of the rightsof another, is not and cannot be a right.No man can have a right to impose an unchosen obligation, an unrewarded duty oran involuntary servitude on another man. There can be no such thing as “theright to enslave.”A right does not include the material implementation of that right by other men;it includes only the freedom to earn that implementation by one’s own effort....The right to property means that a man has the right to take the economicactions necessary to earn property, to use it and to dispose of it; it does notmean that others must provide him with property.The right of free speech means that a man has the right to express his ideaswithout danger of suppression, interference or punitive action by thegovernment. It does not mean that others must provide him with a lecture hall, aradio station or a printing press through which to express his ideas.Any undertaking that involves more than one man, requires the voluntary consentof every participant. Every one of them has the right to make his own decision,but none has the right to force his decision on the others.There is no such thing as “a right to a job”—there is only the right of freetrade, that is: a man’s right to take a job if another man chooses to hire him.There is no “right to a home,” only the right of free trade: the right to builda home or to buy it. There are no “rights to a ‘fair’ wage or a ‘fair’ price” ifno one chooses to pay it, to hire a man or to buy his product. There are no“rights of consumers” to milk, shoes, movies or champagne if no producers chooseto manufacture such items (there is only the right to manufacture them oneself).There are no “rights” of special groups, there are no “rights of farmers, ofworkers, of businessmen, of employees, of employers, of the old, of the young,of the unborn.” There are only the Rights of Man—rights possessed by everyindividual man and by all men as individuals.Property rights and the right of free trade are man’s only “economic rights”(they are, in fact, political rights)—and there can be no such thing as “aneconomic bill of rights.” But observe that the advocates of the latter have allbut destroyed the former.[“Man’s Rights,” VOS, 129; pb 96.] It is only on the basis of property rights that the sphere and application ofindividual rights can be defined in any given social situation. Without propertyrights, there is no way to solve or to avoid a hopeless chaos of clashing views,interests, demands, desires, and whims.[“The Cashing-in: The Student ‘Rebellion,’ ” CUI, 259.] The right to agree with others is not a problem in any society; it is the rightto disagree that is crucial. It is the institution of private property thatprotects and implements the right to disagree—and thus keeps the road open toman’s most valuable attribute (valuable personally, socially, and objectively):the creative mind.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 19.] The institution of private property, in the full, legal meaning of the term, wasbrought into existence only by capitalism. In the pre-capitalist eras, privateproperty existed de facto, but not de jure, i.e., by custom and sufferance, notby right or by law. In law and in principle, all property belonged to the headof the tribe, the king, and was held only by his permission, which could berevoked at any time, at his pleasure. (The king could and did expropriate theestates of recalcitrant noblemen throughout the course of Europe’s history.)[Ibid., 13.] See also CAPITALISM; CAUSALITY; COMMUNISM; CONTRACTS; FASCISM/NAZISM; FREESPEECH; FREEDOM; HUMAN RIGHTS and PROPERTY RIGHTS; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; PATENTSand COPYRIGHTS; PRODUCTION; SOCIALISM; STATISM. Propositions. Since concepts, in the field of cognition, perform a functionsimilar to that of numbers in the field of mathematics, the function of aproposition is similar to that of an equation: it applies conceptualabstractions to a specific problem.A proposition, however, can perform this function only if the concepts of whichit is composed have precisely defined meanings. If, in the field of mathematics,numbers had no fixed, firm values, if they were mere approximations determinedby the mood of their users—so that “5,” for instance, could mean five in somecalculations, but six-and-a-half or four-and-three-quarters in others, accordingto the users’ “convenience”—there would be no such thing as the science ofmathematics.[ITOE, 100.] See also CONCEPTS; DEFINITIONS; GRAMMAR; INDUCTION and DEDUCTION; LANGUAGE;MEANING (of CONCEPTS); NUMBERS; THOUGHT/THINKING.Psycho-Epistemology. Psycho-epistemology is the study of man’s cognitiveprocesses from the aspect of the interaction between the conscious mind and theautomatic functions of the subconscious.[“The Psycho-Epistemology of Art,” RM, 20; pb 18.] “Psycho-epistemology,” a term coined by Ayn Rand, pertains not to the content ofa man’s ideas, but to his method of awareness, i.e., the method by which hismind habitually deals with its content.”[Leonard Peikoff, editor’s footnote to Ayn Rand’s “The Missing Link,” PWNI, 47;pb 39.] The subconscious is an integrating mechanism. Man’s conscious mind observes andestablishes connections among his experiences; the subconscious integrates theconnections and makes them become automatic. For example, the skill of walkingis acquired, after many faltering attempts, by the automatization of countlessconnections controlling muscular movements; once he learns to walk, a childneeds no conscious awareness of such problems as posture, balance, length ofstep, etc.—the mere decision to walk brings the integrated total into hiscontrol.A mind’s cognitive development involves a continual process of automatization.For example, you cannot perceive a table as an infant perceives it—as amysterious object with four legs. You perceive it as a table, i.e., a man-madepiece of furniture, serving a certain purpose belonging to a human habitation,etc.; you cannot separate these attributes from your sight of the table, youexperience it as a single, indivisible percept—yet all you see is a four-leggedobject; the rest is an automatized integration of a vast amount of conceptualknowledge which, at one time, you had to learn bit by bit. The same is true ofeverything you perceive or experience; as an adult, you cannot perceive orexperience in a vacuum, you do it in a certain automatized context— and theefficiency of your mental operations depends on the kind of context yoursubconscious has automatized.“Learning to speak is a process of automatizing the use (i.e., the meaning andthe application) of concepts. And more: all learning involves a process ofautomatizing, i.e., of first acquiring knowledge by fully conscious, focusedattention and observation, then of establishing mental connections which makethat knowledge automatic (instantly available as a context), thus freeing man’smind to pursue further, more complex knowledge.” (Introduction to ObjectivistEpistemology.)The process of forming, integrating and using concepts is not an automatic, buta volitional process—i.e., a process which uses both new and automatizedmaterial, but which is directed volitionally. It is not an innate, but anacquired skill; it has to be learned—it is the most crucially important part oflearning—and all of man’s other capacities depend on how well or how badly helearns it.This skill does not pertain to the particular content of a man’s knowledge atany given age, but to the method by which he acquires and organizesknowledge—the method by which his mind deals with its content. The methodprograms his subconscious computer, determining how efficiently, lamely ordisastrously his cognitive processes will function. The programming of a man’ssubconscious consists of the kind of cognitive habits he acquires; these habitsconstitute his psycho-epistemology.It is a child’s early experiences, observations and subverbal conclusions thatdetermine this programming. Thereafter, the interaction of content and methodestablishes a certain reciprocity: the method of acquiring knowledge affects itscontent, which affects the further development of the method, and so on.[“The Comprachicos.” NI., 192.] Most people know nothing about psycho-epistemology. They take their habitualmethod of thought for granted, leaving it unidentified and unquestioned. Yetthis kind of ignorance can be disastrous.... Men can automatize wrong methods ofthought without even knowing it. In order to achieve intellectual control,therefore, in order to enjoy the full power over your mind that volition makespossible, you must identify your psycho-epistemological methods, and correctthose, if any, which are not consonant with your adult knowledge.This is a crucial discovery of Miss Rand’s—the discovery of psycho-epistemology,and of its roots, forms, and errors. Without such knowledge, men would be leftat the mercy of unidentified mental habits that they hardly evensuspected—habits that perhaps derived unknowingly from childhood errors thatthey long since had consciously renounced. Psycho-epistemology represents awhole science, a new branch of psychology.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture6.] Men’s epistemology—or, more precisely, their psycho-epistemology, their methodof awareness—is the most fundamental standard by which they can be classified.Few men are consistent in that respect: most men keep switching from one levelof awareness to another, according to the circumstances or the issues involved,ranging from moments of full rationality to an almost somnambulistic stupor. Butthe battle of human history is fought and determined by those who arepredominantly consistent, those who, for good or evil, are committed to andmotivated by their chosen psycho-epistemology and its corollary view ofexistence.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 18; pb 21.] While the alleged advocates of reason oppose “system-building” and haggleapologetically over concrete-bound words or mystically floating abstractions,its enemies seem to know that integration is the psycho-epistemological key toreason, that art is man’s psycho-epistemological conditioner, and that if reasonis to be destroyed, it is man’s integrating capacity that has to be destroyed.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 77.] See also ANTI-CONCEPTUAL MENTALITY; AUTOMATIZATION; CONSCIOUSNESS; EPISTEMOLOGY;FREE WILL; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); LEARNING; PSYCHOLOGY; RATIONALITY; STYLE;SUBCONSCIOUS. “Psychologizing.” Just as reasoning, to an irrational person, becomesrationalizing, and moral judgment becomes moralizing, so psychological theoriesbecome psychologizing. The common denominator is the corruption of a cognitiveprocess to serve an ulterior motive.Psychologizing consists in condemning or excusing specific individuals on thegrounds of their psychological problems, real or invented, in the absence of orcontrary to factual evidence.[“The Psychology of ‘Psychologizing,’ ” TO, March 1971, 2.] While the racket of the philosophizing mystics rested on the claim that man isunable to know the external world, the racket of the psychologizing mysticsrests on the claim that man is unable to know his own motivation.[Ibid., 4.] Armed with a smattering, not of knowledge, but of undigested slogans, they rush,unsolicited, to diagnose the problems of their friends and acquaintances.Pretentiousness and presumptuousness are the psychologizer’s invariablecharacteristics: he not merely invades the privacy of his victims’ minds, heclaims to understand their minds better than they do, to know more than they doabout their own motives. With reckless irresponsibility, which an old-fashionedmystic oracle would hesitate to match, he ascribes to his victims any motivationthat suits his purpose, ignoring their denials. Since he is dealing with thegreat “unknowable” —which used to be life after death or extrasensoryperception, but is now man’s subconscious—all rules of evidence, logic and proofare suspended, and anything goes (which is what attracts him to his racket).[Ibid., 2.] A man’s moral character must be judged on the basis of his actions, hisstatements and his conscious convictions—not on the basis of inferences(usually, spurious) about his subconscious.A man is not to be condemned or excused on the grounds of the state of hissubconscious.[Ibid., 5.] See also ARGUMENT from INTIMIDATION; CHARACTER; MORAL JUDGMENT; MYSTICISM;PSYCHOLOGY; RATIONALIZATION; SUBCONSCIOUS. Psychology. The task of evaluating the processes of man’s subconscious is theprovince of psychology. Psychology does not regard its subject morally, butmedically—i.e., from the aspect of health or malfunction (with cognitivecompetence as the proper standard of health).[“The Psychology of ‘Psychologizing,’ ” TO, March 1971, 5.] As a science, psychology is barely making its first steps. It is still in theanteroom of science, in the stage of observing and gathering material from whicha future science will come. This stage may be compared to the pre-Socraticperiod in philosophy; psychology has not yet found a Plato, let alone anAristotle, to organize its material, systematize its problems and define itsfundamental principles.[Ibid., 2.] In psychology, one school holds that man, by nature, is a helpless,guilt-ridden, instinct-driven automaton—white another school objects that thisis not true, because there is no scientific evidence to prove that man isconscious.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 86; pb 71.] Psychology departments have a sprinkling of Freudians, but are dominated byBehaviorism, whose leader is B. F. Skinner. (Here the controversy is between theclaim that man is moved by innate ideas, and the claim that he has no ideas atall.)[“Fairness Doctrine for Education,” PWNI, 235; pb 192.] See Conceptual Index: Psychology.“Public Interest,” the. Since there is no such entity as “the public,” since thepublic is merely a number of individuals, any claimed or implied conflict of“the public interest” with private interests means that the interests of somemen are to be sacrificed to the interests and wishes of others. Since theconcept is so conveniently undefinable, its use rests only on any given gang’sability to proclaim that “The public, c‘est moi” —and to maintain the claim atthe point of a gun.[“The Monument Builders,” VOS, 116; pb 88.] So long as a concept such as “the public interest” (or the “social” or“national” or “international” interest) is regarded as a valid principle toguide legislation—lobbies and pressure groups will necessarily continue toexist. Since there is no such entity as “the public,” since the public is merelya number of individuals, the idea that “the public interest” supersedes privateinterests and rights, can have but one meaning: that the interests and rights ofsome individuals take precedence over the interests and rights of others.If so, then all men and all private groups have to fight to the death for theprivilege of being regarded as “the public.” The government’s policy has toswing like an erratic pendulum from group to group, hitting some and favoringothers, at the whim of any given moment—and so grotesque a profession aslobbying (selling “influence”) becomes a full-time job. If parasitism,favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixedeconomy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men toothers, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guidedin practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of moneytaken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes downultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrarypower to some government officials.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, butthat it cannot be used honestly. The wisest man in the world, with the purestintegrity, cannot find a criterion for the just, equitable, rational applicationof an unjust, inequitable, irrational principle.[“The Pull Peddlers,” CUI, 170.] There is no such thing as “the public interest” except as the sum of theinterests of individual men. And the basic, common interest of all men—allrational men—is freedom. Freedom is the first requirement of “the publicinterest”—not what men do when they are free, but that they are free. All theirachievements rest on that foundation—and cannot exist without it.The principles of a free, non-coercive social system are the only form of “thepublic interest.”[“The Fascist New Frontier,” pamphlet, 13.] I could say to you that you do not serve the public good—that nobody’s good canbe achieved at the price of human sacrifices—that when you violate the rights ofone man, you have violated the rights of all, and a public of rightlesscreatures is doomed to destruction. I could say to you that you will and canachieve nothing but universal devastation —as any looter must, when he runs outof victims. I could say it, but I won’t. It is not your particular policy that Ichallenge, but your moral premise. If it were true that men could achieve theirgood by means of turning some men into sacrificial animals, and I were asked toimmolate myself for the sake of creatures who wanted to survive at the price ofmy blood, if I were asked to serve the interests of society apart from, aboveand against my own—I would refuse, I would reject it as the most contemptibleevil, I would fight it with every power I possess, I would fight the whole ofmankind, if one minute were all I could last before I were murdered, I wouldfight in the full confidence of the justice of my battle and of a living being’sright to exist. Let there be no misunderstanding about me. If it is now thebelief of my fellow men, who call themselves the public, that their goodrequires victims, then I say: The public good be damned, I will have no part ofit![“The Moral Meaning of Capitalism,” FNI, 116; pb 98.]See also CAPITALISM; COLLECTIVISM; “COMMON GOOD”; FREEDOM; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS;LOBBYING; MIXED ECONOMY; SACRIFICE; SOCIETY; WELFARE STATE. Public Property. When you clamor for public ownership of the means ofproduction, you are clamoring for public ownership of the mind.[GS, FNI, 208; pb 166.] Since “public property” is a collectivist fiction, since the public as a wholecan neither use nor dispose of its “property,” that “property” will always betaken over by some political “elite,” by a small clique which will then rule thepublic—a public of literal, dispossessed proletarians.[“The Property Status of Airwaves,” CUI, 128.]See also COLLECTIVISM; GOVERNMENT; PROPERTY RIGHTS. Purchasing Power. Purchasing power is an attribute of producers, not ofconsumers. Purchasing power is a consequence of production: it is the power ofpossessing goods which one can trade for other goods. A “purchase” is anexchange of goods (or services) for goods (or services). Any other form oftransferring goods from one person to another may belong to many differentcategories of transactions, but it is not a purchase. It may be a gift, a loan,an inheritance, a handout, a fraud, a theft, a robbery, a burglary, anexpropriation. In regard to services, however (omitting temporary or occasionalacts of friendship, in which the payment is the friend’s value), there is onlyone alternative to trading: unpaid services, i.e., slavery.[“Hunger and Freedom,” ARL, III, 22, 3.]See also CAPITALISM; CONSUMPTION; CREDIT; ECONOMIC POWER vs. POLITICAL POWER;FREE MARKET; INFLATION; MONEY; PRODUCTION; TRADER PRINCIPLE. Purpose. The three cardinal values of the Objectivist ethics—the three valueswhich, together, are the means to and the realization of one’s ultimate value,one’s own life—are: Reason, Purpose, Self-Esteem, with their three correspondingvirtues: Rationality, Productiveness, Pride.Productive work is the central purpose of a rational man’s life, the centralvalue that integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values.Reason is the source, the precondition of his productive work—pride is theresult.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 19; pb 25.] A central purpose serves to integrate all the other concerns of a man’s life. Itestablishes the hierarchy, the relative importance, of his values, it saves himfrom pointless inner conflicts, it permits him to enjoy life on a wide scale andto carry that enjoyment into any area open to his mind; whereas a man without apurpose is lost in chaos. He does not know what his values are. He does not knowhow to judge. He cannot tell what is or is not important to him, and, therefore,he drifts helplessly at the mercy of any chance stimulus or any whim of themoment. He can enjoy nothing. He spends his life searching for some value whichhe will never find....The man without a purpose is a man who drifts at the mercy of random feelings orunidentified urges and is capable of any evil, because he is totally out ofcontrol of his own life. In order to be in control of your life, you have tohave a purpose—a productive purpose....The man who has no purpose, but has to act, acts to destroy others. That is notthe same thing as a productive or creative purpose.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 6.]See also CAREER; PRIDE; PRODUCTIVENESS; RATIONALITY; REASON; STANDARD of VALUE;ULTIMATE VALUE; VALUES. Pursuit of Happiness, Right to. The Right to the Pursuit of Happiness meansman’s right to live for himself, to choose what constitutes his own private,personal, individual happiness and to work for its achievement, so long as herespects the same right in others. It means that man cannot be forced to devotehis life to the happiness of another man nor of any number of other men. Itmeans that the collective cannot decide what is to be the purpose of a man’sexistence nor prescribe his choice of happiness.[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet, 5.] Observe, in this context, the intellectual precision of the Founding Fathers:they spoke of the right to the pursuit of happiness—not of the right tohappiness. It means that a man has the right to take the actions he deemsnecessary to achieve his happiness; it does not mean that others must make himhappy.[“Man’s Rights,” VOS, 129; pb 97.]See also FOUNDING FATHERS; HAPPINESS; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; SELFISHNESS. Pyramid of Ability. When you live in a rational society, where men are free totrade, you receive an incalculable bonus: the material value of your work isdetermined not only by your effort, but by the effort of the best productiveminds who exist in the world around you.When you work in a modern factory, you are paid, not only for your labor, butfor all the productive genius which has made that factory possible: for the workof the industrialist who built it, for the work of the investor who saved themoney to risk on the untried and the new, for the work of the engineer whodesigned the machines of which you are pushing the levers, for the work of theinventor who created the product which you spend your time on making, for thework of the scientist who discovered the laws that went into the making of thatproduct, for the work of the philosopher who taught men how to think and whomyou spend your time denouncing.The machine, the frozen form of a living intelligence, is the power that expandsthe potential of your life by raising the productivity of your time. If youworked as a blacksmith in the mystics’ Middle Ages, the whole of your earningcapacity would consist of an iron bar produced by your hands in days and days ofeffort. How many tons of rail do you produce per day if you work for HankRearden? Would you dare to claim that the size of your pay check was createdsolely by your physical labor and that those rails were the product of yourmuscles? The standard of living of that blacksmith is all that your muscles areworth; the rest is a gift from Hank Rearden.[GS, FNI, 233; pb 185.] In proportion to the mental energy he spent, the man who creates a new inventionreceives but a small percentage of his value in terms of material payment, nomatter what fortune he makes, no matter what millions he earns. But the man whoworks as a janitor in the factory producing that invention, receives an enormouspayment in proportion to the mental effort that his job requires of him. And thesame is true of all men between, on all levels of ambition and ability. The manat the top of the intellectual pyramid contributes the most to all those belowhim, but gets nothing except his material payment, receiving no intellectualbonus from others to add to the value of his time. The man at the bottom who,left to himself, would starve in his hopeless ineptitude, contributes nothing tothose above him, but receives the bonus of all of their brains. Such is thenature of the “competition” between the strong and the weak of the intellect.Such is the pattern of “exploitation” for which you have damned the strong.[Ibid., 234; pb 186.]See also CAPITALISM; COMPETITION; CREATORS; FREE MARKET; INVESTMENT; MEDIOCRITY;PRODUCTION; PRODUCTIVENESS; TECHNOLOGY."},{"pageContent":"QQuotas. The notion of racial quotas is so obviously an expression of racism thatno lengthy discussion is necessary. If a young man is barred from a school or ajob because the quota for his particular race has been filled, he is barred byreason of his race. Telling him that those admitted are his “representatives,”is adding insult to injury. To demand such quotas in the name of fighting racialdiscrimination, is an obscene mockery.[“Representation Without Authorization,” ARI,. I. 21, 2.] The quota doctrine assumes that all members of a given physiological group areidentical and interchangeable—not merely in the eyes of other people, but intheir own eyes and minds. Assuming a total merging of the self with the group,the doctrine holds that it makes no difference to a man whether he or his“representative” is admitted to a school, gets a job. or makes a decision.[Ibid., 3.] The inversion of all standards—the propagation of racism as antiracist, ofinjustice as just, of immorality as moral, and the reasoning behind it, which isworse than the offenses—is flagrantly evident in the policy of preferentialtreatment for minorities (i.e., racial quotas) in employment and education.[“Moral Inflation,” ARL, III, 14, 1.] No man, neither Negro nor white, has any claim to the property of another man. Aman’s rights are not violated by a private individual’s refusal to deal withhim. Racism is an evil, irrational and morally contemptible doctrine—butdoctrines cannot be forbidden or prescribed by law. Just as we have to protect acommunist’s freedom of speech, even though his doctrines are evil, so we have toprotect a racist’s right to the use and disposal of his own property. Privateracism is not a legal, but a moral issue—and can be fought only by privatemeans, such as economic boycott or social ostracism.[“Racism,” VOS, 184; pb 134.]See also “ETHNICITY”; PROPERTY RIGHTS: RACISM: TRIBALISM."},{"pageContent":"RRacism. Racism is the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism. It isthe notion of ascribing moral, social or political significance to a man’sgenetic tineage—the notion that a man’s intellectual and characterologicaltraits are produced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry. Which means,in practice, that a man is to be judged, not by his own character and actions,but by the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors.Racism claims that the content of a man’s mind (not his cognitive apparatus, butits content) is inherited; that a man’s convictions, values and character aredetermined before he is born, by physical factors beyond his control. This isthe caveman’s version of the doctrine of innate ideas—or of inheritedknowledge—which has been thoroughly refuted by philosophy and science. Racism isa doctrine of, by and for brutes. It is a barnyard or stock-farm version ofcollectivism, appropriate to a mentality that differentiates between variousbreeds of animals, but not between animals and men.Like every form of determinism, racism invalidates the specific attribute whichdistinguishes man from all other living species: his rational faculty. Racismnegates two aspects of man’s life: reason and choice, or mind and morality,replacing them with chemical predestination.[“Racism.” VOS, 172; pb 126.] A genius is a genius, regardless of the number of morons who belong to the samerace—and a moron is a moron, regardless of the number of geniuses who share hisracial origin.[Ibid., 174; pb 127.] Like every other form of collectivism, racism is a quest for the unearned. It isa quest for automatic knowledge—for an automatic evaluation of men’s charactersthat bypasses the responsibility of exercising rational or moral judgment—and,above all, a quest for an automatic self-esteem (or pseudo-self-esteem).[Ibid.] Today, racism is regarded as a crime if practiced by a majority—but as aninalienable right if practiced by a minority. The notion that one’s culture issuperior to all others solely because it represents the traditions of one’sancestors, is regarded as chauvinism if claimed by a majority— but as “ethnic”pride if claimed by a minority. Resistance to change and progress is regarded asreactionary if demonstrated by a majority—but retrogression to a Balkan village,to an Indian tepee or to the jungle is hailed if demonstrated by a minority.[“The Age of Envy,” NL, 167.]See also ANTI-CONCEPTUAL MENTALITY; COLLECTIVISM; DETERMINISM; “ETHNICITY”;FASCISM/NAZISM; FREE WILL; INDIVIDUALISM; POLYLOGISM; REASON; SELF-ESTEEM;SOVIET RUSSIA; TRIBALISM. 1“Rand’s Razor.” The requirements of cognition determine the objective criteriaof conceptualization. They can be summed up best in the form of anepistemological “razor”: concepts are not to be multiplied beyond necessity—thecorollary of which is: nor are they to be integrated in disregard of necessity.[ITOE, 96.] The requirements of cognition forbid the arbitrary grouping of existents, bothin regard to isolation and to integration. They forbid the random coining ofspecial concepts to designate any and every group of existents with any possiblecombination of characteristics. For example, there is no concept to designate“Beautiful blondes with blue eyes, 5’5” tall and 24 years old.” Such entities orgroupings are identified descriptively. If such a special concept existed, itwould lead to senseless duplication of cognitive effort (and to conceptualchaos): everything of significance discovered about that group would apply toall other young women as well. There would be no cognitive justification forsuch a concept—unless some essential characteristic were discovered,distinguishing such blondes from all other women and requiring special study, inwhich case a special concept would become necessary....In the process of determining conceptual classification, neither the essentialsimilarities nor the essential differences among existents may be ignored,evaded or omitted once they have been observed. Just as the requirements ofcognition forbid the arbitrary subdivision of concepts, so they forbid thearbitrary integration of concepts into a wider concept by means of obliteratingtheir essential differences—which is an error (or falsification) proceeding fromdefinitions by non-essentials. (This is the method involved in the obliterationof valid concepts by means of “anti-concepts.”)[ITOE, 94.]See also “ANTI-CONCEPTS”; CONCEPT-FORMATION; CONCEPTS; DEFINITIONS; INTEGRATION(MENTAL); INVALID CONCEPTS; OBJECTIVITY; “PACKAGE-DEALlNG,” FALLACY of;UNIT-ECONOMY.Rationality. Rationality is man’s basic virtue, the source of all his othervirtues. Man’s basic vice, the source of all his evils, is the act of unfocusinghis mind, the suspension of his consciousness, which is not blindness, but therefusal to see, not ignorance, but the refusal to know. Irrationality is therejection of man’s means of survival and, therefore, a commitment to a course ofblind destruction; that which is anti-mind, is anti-life.The virtue of Rationality means the recognition and acceptance of reason asone’s only source of knowledge, one’s only judge of values and one’s only guideto action. It means one’s total commitment to a state of full, consciousawareness, to the maintenance of a full mental focus in all issues, in allchoices, in all of one’s waking hours. It means a commitment to the fullestperception of reality within one’s power and to the constant, active expansionof one’s perception, i.e., of one’s knowledge. It means a commitment to thereality of one’s own existence, i.e., to the principle that all of one’s goals,values and actions take place in reality and, therefore, that one must neverplace any value or consideration whatsoever above one’s perception of reality.It means a commitment to the principle that all of one’s convictions, values,goals, desires and actions must be based on, derived from, chosen and validatedby a process of thought—as precise and scrupulous a process of thought, directedby as ruthlessly strict an application of logic, as one’s fullest capacitypermits. It means one’s acceptance of the responsibility of forming one’s ownjudgments and of living by the work of one’s own mind (which is the virtue ofIndependence). It means that one must never sacrifice one’s convictions to theopinions or wishes of others (which is the virtue of Integrity)—that one mustnever attempt to fake reality in any manner (which is the virtue ofHonesty)—that one must never seek or grant the unearned and undeserved, neitherin matter nor in spirit (which is the virtue of Justice). It means that one mustnever desire effects without causes, and that one must never enact a causewithout assuming full responsibility for its effects—that one must never actlike a zombie, i.e., without knowing one’s own purposes and motives—that onemust never make any decisions, form any convictions or seek any values out ofcontext, i.e., apart from or against the total, integrated sum of one’sknowledge—and, above all, that one must never seek to get away withcontradictions. It means the rejection of any form of mysticism, i.e., any claimto some nonsensory, nonrational, nondefinable, supernatural source of knowledge.It means a commitment to reason, not in sporadic fits or on selected issues orin special emergencies, but as a permanent way of life.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 20; pb 25.]Rationality is the recognition of the fact that existence exists, that nothingcan alter the truth and nothing can take precedence over that act of perceivingit, which is thinking—that the mind is one’s only judge of values and one’s onlyguide of action—that reason is an absolute that permits no compromise—that aconcession to the irrational invalidates one’s consciousness and turns it fromthe task of perceiving to the task of faking reality—that the alleged short-cutto knowledge, which is faith, is only a short-circuit destroying the mind—thatthe acceptance of a mystical invention is a wish for the annihilation ofexistenc and, properly, annihilates one’s consciousness.[GS, FNI, 157; pb 128.] To the extent to which a man is rational, life is the premise directing hisactions. To the extent to which he is irrational, the premise directing hisactions is death.[Ibid.. 156; pb 127.] A rational process is a moral process. You may make an error at any step of it,with nothing to protect you but your own severity, or you may try to cheat, tofake the evidence and evade the effort of the quest—but if devotion to truth isthe hallmark of morality, then there is no greater, nobler, more heroic form ofdevotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking.[Ibid., 155: pb 126.]See also ABSOLUTES; EXISTENCE; EVASION; EVIL; FOCUS; HONESTY; INDEPENDENCE;INTEGRITY; JUSTICE; LOGIC; MORALITY; MYSTICISM; PRIDE; PRIMACY of EXISTENCE vs.PRIMACY of CONSCIOUSNESS; PRODUCTIVENESS; REASON; THOUGHT/THINKING: VIRTUE. Rationalism vs. Empiricism. [Philosophers came to be divided] into two camps:those who claimed that man obtains his knowledge of the world by deducing itexclusively from concepts, which come from inside his head and are not derivedfrom the perception of physical facts (the Rationalists)—and those who claimedthat man obtains his knowledge from experience, which was held to mean: bydirect perception of immediate facts, with no recourse to concepts (theEmpiricists). To put it more simply: those who joined the [mystics] byabandoning reatity—and those who clung to reality, by abandoning their mind.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 31; pb 30.]See also CONCEPTS; EPISTEMOLOGY; INDUCTION and DEDUCTION; KANT, IMMANUEL;KNOWLEDGE; LOGIC; PERCEPTION; PHILOSOPHY; REASON. Rationalization. Since an emotion is experienced as an immediate primary, butis, in fact, a complex, derivative sum, it permits men to practice one of theugliest of psychological phenomena: rationalization. Rationalization is acover-up, a process of providing one’s emotions with a false identity, of givingthem spurious explanations and justifications —in order to hide one’s motives,not just from others, but primarily from oneself. The price of nationalizing isthe hampering, the distortion and, ultimately, the destruction of one’scognitive faculty. Rationalization is a process not of perceiving reality, butof attempting to make reality fit one’s emotions.Philosophical catch phrases are handy means of rationalization. They are quoted,repeated and perpetuated in order to justify feelings which men are unwilling toadmit.“Nobody can be certain of anything” is a rationalization for a feeling of envyand hatred toward those who are certain. “It may be true for you, but it’s nottrue for me” is a rationalization for one’s inability and unwillingness to provethe validity of one’s contentions. “Nobody is perfect in this world” is arationalization for the desire to continue indulging in one’s imperfections,i.e., the desire to escape morality. “Nobody can help anything he does” is arationalization for the escape from moral responsibility. “It may have been trueyesterday, but it’s not true today” is a rationalization for the desire to getaway with contradictions. “Logic has nothing to do with reality” is a cruderationalization for a desire to subordinate reality to one’s whims.“I can’t prove it, but I feel that it’s true” is more than a rationalization: itis a description of the process of rationalizing. Men do not accept a catchphrase by a process of thought, they seize upon a catch phrase—any catchphrase—because it fits their emotions. Such men do not judge the truth of astatement by its correspondence to reality—they judge reality by itscorrespondence to their feelings.If, in the course of philosophical detection, you find yourself, at times,stopped by the indignantly bewildered question: “How could anyone arrive at suchnonsense?”—you will begin to understand it when you discover that evilphilosophies are systems of rationalization.[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 21; pb 18.] When a theory achieves nothing but the opposite of its alleged goals, yet itsadvocates remain undeterred, you may be certain that it is not a conviction oran “ideal.” but a rationalization.[Ibid.. 24; pb 20.]See also EMOTIONS; LOGIC; MORAL JUDGMENT; MORALITY; OBJECTIVITY; PHILOSOPHY;PROOF; RATIONALITY; SUBCONSCIOUS. Reality. See Existence. Reason. Reason is the faculty that identities and integrates the materialprovided by man’s senses.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 13; pb 20.] Reason integrates man’s perceptions by means of forming abstractions orconceptions, thus raising man’s knowledge from the perceptual level, which heshares with animals, to the conceptual level, which he alone can reach. Themethod which reason employs in this process is logic —and logic is the art ofnon-contradictory identification.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 75; pb 62.] Reason is man’s only means of grasping reality and of acquiring knowledge—and,therefore, the rejection of reason means that men should act regardless ofand/or in contradiction to the facts of reality.[“The Left: Old and New,” NL, 84.] The senses, concepts, logic: these are the elements of man’s rationalfaculty—its start, its form, its method. In essence, “follow reason” means: baseknowledge on observation; form concepts according to the actual (measurable)relationships among concretes; use concepts according to the rules of logic(ultimately, the Law of Identity). Since each of these elements is based on thefacts of reality, the conclusions reached by a process of reason are objective.The alternative to reason is some form of mysticism or skepticism.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 332; pb 305.] [Reason] is a faculty that man has to exercise by choice. Thinking is not anautomatic function. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free to think orto evade that effort.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 13; pb 20.] Man’s essential characteristic is his rational faculty. Man’s mind is his basicmeans of survival—his only means of gaining knowledge....In order to sustain its life, every living species has to follow a certaincourse of action required by its nature. ‘I’he action required to sustain humanlife is primarily intellectual: everything man needs has to be discovered by hismind and produced by his effort. Production is the application of reason to theproblem of survival.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 16.] To live, man must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of hislife: Reason—Purpose—Self-esteem. Reason, as his only tool of knowledge—Purpose,as his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed toachieve—Setf-esteem, as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent tothink and his person is worthy of happiness, which means: is worthy of living.[GS, FNI, 156; pb 128.] Reason is man’s tool of knowledge, the faculty that enables him to perceive thefacts of reality. To act rationally means to act in accordance with the facts ofreality. Emotions are not tools of cognition. What you feel tells you nothingabout the facts; it merely tells you something about your estimate of the facts.Emotions are the result of your value judgments; they are caused by your basicpremises, which you may hold consciously or subconsciously, which may be rightor wrong.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 6.] There is no necessary clash, no dichotomy between man’s reason and hisemotions—provided he observes their proper relationship. A rational man knows—ormakes it a point to discover—the source of his emotions, the basic premises fromwhich they come; if his premises are wrong, he corrects them. He never acts onemotions for which he cannot account, the meaning of which he does notunderstand. In appraising a situation, he knows why he reacts as he does andwhether he is right. He has no inner conflicts, his mind and his emotions areintegrated, his consciousness is in perfect harmony. His emotions are not hisenemies, they are his means of enjoying life. But they are not his guide; theguide is his mind. This relationship cannot be reversed, however. If a man takeshis emotions as the cause and his mind as their passive effect, if he is guidedby his emotions and uses his mind only to rationalize or justify themsomehow—then he is acting immorally, he is condemning himself to misery,failure, defeat, and he will achieve nothing but destruction—his own and that ofothers.[Ibid.] I have said that faith and force are corollaries, and that mysticism will alwayslead to the rule of brutality. The cause of it is contained in the very natureof mysticism. Reason is the only objective means of communication and ofunderstanding among men; when men deal with one another by means of reason,reality is their objective standard and frame of reference. But when men claimto possess supernatural means of knowledge, no persuasion, communication orunderstanding are possible. Why do we kill wild animals in the jungle? Becauseno other way of dealing with them is open to us. And that is the state to whichmysticism reduces mankind—a state where, in case of disagreement, men have norecourse except to physical violence.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 85; pb 70.] Man’s mind is his basic means of survival—and of self-protection. Reason is themost selfish human faculty: it has to be used in and by a man’s own mind, andits product—truth—makes him inflexible, intransigent, impervious to the power ofany pack or any ruler. Deprived of the ability to reason, man becomes a docile,pliant, impotent chunk of clay, to be shaped into any subhuman form and used forany purpose by anyone who wants to bother.There has never been a philosophy, a theory or a doctrine that attacked (or“limited”) reason, which did not also preach submission to the power of someauthority. Philosophically, most men do not understand the issue to this day;but psycho-epistemologically, they have sensed it since prehistoric times.Observe the nature of mankind’s earliest legends—such as the fall of Lucifer,“the light-bearer,” for the sin of defying authority; or the story ofPrometheus, who taught men the practical arts of survival. Power-seekers havealways known that if men are to be made submissive, the obstacle is not theirfeelings, their wishes or their “instincts,” but their minds; if men are to beruled, then the enemy is reason.[“The Comprachicos,” NL, 227.] Only three brief periods of history were culturally dominated by a philosophy ofreason: ancient Greece, the Renaissance, the nineteenth century. These threeperiods were the source of mankind’s greatest progress in all fields ofintellectual achievement—and the eras of greatest political freedom.[“The Intellectual Bankruptcy of Our Age,” pamphlet, 5.] Western civilization was the child and product of reason—via ancient Greece. Inall other civilizations, reason has always been the menial servant—thehandmaiden—of mysticism. You may observe the results. It is only Western culturethat has ever been dominated—imperfectly, incompletely, precariously and at rareintervals—but still, dominated by reason. You may observe the results of that.The conflict of reason versus mysticism is the issue of life or death—of freedomor slavery—of progress or stagnant brutality. Or, to put it another way, it isthe conflict of consciousness versus unconsciousness.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 75; pb 62.] If you rebel against reason, if you succumb to the old bromides of the WitchDoctors, such as: “Reason is the enemy of the artist” or “The cold hand ofreason dissects and destroys the joyous spontaneity of man’s creativeimagination”—I suggest that you take note of the following fact: by rejectingreason and surrendering to the unhampered sway of their unleashed emotions (andwhims), the apostles of irrationality, the existentialists, the Zen Buddhists,the non-objective artists, have not achieved a free, joyous, triumphant sense oflife, but a sense of doom, nausea and screaming, cosmic terror. Then read thestories of O. Henry or listen to the music of Viennese operettas and rememberthat these were the products of the spirit of the nineteenth century—a centuryruled by the “cold, dissecting” hand of reason. And then ask yourself: whichpsycho-epistemology is appropriate to man, which is consonant with the facts ofreality and with man’s nature?[“The Esthetic Vacuum of Our Age,” RM, 119; pb 128.] I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am notprimarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacyof reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows.This—the supremacy of reason—was, is and will be the primary concern of my work,and the essence of Objectivism. (For a definition of reason, see Introduction toObjectivist Epistemology.) Reason in epistemology leads to egoism in ethics,which leads to capitalism in politics.[“Brief Summary,” TO, Sept. 1971, I.]See also ART; AXIOMS; CAPITALISM; CONCEPTS; EMOTIONS; EPISTEMOLOGY; FREE WILL;HISTORY; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; KANT, IMMANUEL; KNOWLEDGE; LOGIC; MAN; MORALITY;OBJECTIVISM; OBJECTIVITY; PERCEPTION; PHISICAL FORCE; PRODUCTION; RATIONALISMvs. EMPIRICISM; SELF-ESTEEM; SELFISHNESS; THOUGHT/THINKING. “Redistribution” of Wealth. If a man proposes to redistribute wealth, he meansexplicitly and necessarily that the wealth is his to distribute. If he proposesit in the name of the government, then the wealth belongs to the government; ifin the name of society, then it belongs to society. No one, to my knowledge, didor could define a difference between that proposal and the basic principle ofcommunism.[“The Dead End,” ARL, 1,20,2.] Observe that any social movement which begins by “redistributing” income, endsup by distributing sacrifices.[“The Fascist New Frontier,” pamphlet, 5.] Whoever claims the “right” to “redistribute” the wealth produced by others isclaiming the “right” to treat human beings as chattel.[“The Monument Builders,” VOS, 120; pb 91.]See also COLLECTIVISM; COMMUNISM; MONEY; PROPERTY RIGHTS; SACRIFICE. Reification of the Zero See Zero, Reification of. Religion, PLAYBOY: Has no religion, in your estimation, ever offered anything ofconstructive value to human life?RAND: Qua religion, no—in the sense of blind belief, belief unsupported by, orcontrary to, the facts of reality and the conclusions of reason. Faith, as such,is extremely detrimental to human life: it is the negation of reason. But youmust remember that religion is an early form of philosophy, that the firstattempts to explain the universe, to give a coherent frame of reference to man’slife and a code of moral values, were made by religion, before men graduated ordeveloped enough to have philosophy. And, as philosophies, some religions havevery valuable moral points. They may have a good influence or proper principlesto inculcate, but in a very contradictory context and, on a very—how should Isay it?—dangerous or malevolent base: on the ground of faith.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 10.] Christ, in terms of the Christian philosophy, is the human ideal. He personifiesthat which men should strive to emulate. Yet, according to the Christianmythology, he died on the cross not for his own sins but for the sins of thenonideal people. In other words, a man of perfect virtue was sacrificed for menwho are vicious and who are expected or supposed to accept that sacrifice. If Iwere a Christian, nothing could make me more indignant than that: the notion ofsacrificing the ideal to the nonideal, or virtue to vice. And it is in the nameof that symbol that men are asked to sacrifice themselves for their inferiors.That is precisely how the symbolism is used.[Ibid.]What is the nature of the guilt that your teachers call [man’s] Original Sin?What are the evils man acquired when he fell from a state they considerperfection? Their myth declares that he ate the fruit of the tree ofknowledge—he acquired a mind and became a rational being. It was the knowledgeof good and evil—he became a moral being. He was sentenced to earn his bread byhis labor—he became a productive being. He was sentenced to experience desire—heacquired the capacity of sexual enjoyment. The evils for which they damn him arereason, morality, creativeness, joy—all the cardinal values of his existence. Itis not his vices that their myth of man’s fall is designed to explain andcondemn, it is not his errors that they hold as his guilt, but the essence ofhis nature as man. Whatever he was—that robot in the Garden of Eden, who existedwithout mind, without values, without labor, without love —he was not man.Man’s fall, according to your teachers, was that he gained the virtues requiredto live. These virtues, by their standard, are his Sin. His evil, they charge,is that he’s man. His guilt, they charge, is that he lives.They call it a morality of mercy and a doctrine of love for man.No, they say, they do not preach that man is evil, the evil is only that alienobject: his body. No, they say, they do not wish to kill him, they only wish tomake him lose his body. They seek to help him, they say, against his pain—andthey point at the torture rack to which they’ve tied him, the rack with twowheels that pull him in opposite directions, the rack of the doctrine thatsplits his soul and body.[GS, FNI, 169; pb 137.] The good, say the mystics of spirit, is God, a being whose only definition isthat he is beyond man’s power to conceive—a definition that invalidates man’sconsciousness and nullifies his concepts of existence.... Man’s mind, say themystics of spirit, must be subordinated to the will of God.... Man’s standard ofvalue, say the mystics of spirit, is the pleasure of God, whose standards arebeyond man’s power of comprehension and must be accepted on faith.... Thepurpose of man’s life ... is to become an abject zombie who serves a purpose hedoes not know, for reasons he is not to question.[Ibid., 171; pb 139.] The kind of sense of life that produced the [papal] encyclical “PopulorumProgressio” ... was not produced by the sense of life of any one person, but bythe sense of life of an institution.The dominant chord of the encyclical’s sense of life is hatted for man’smind-hence hatred for man—hence hatred for life and for this earth—hence hatredfor man’s enjoyment of his life on earth—and hence, as a last and leastconsequence, hatred for the only social system that makes all these valuespossible in practice: capitalism.[“Requiem for Man,” CUI, 304.] The encyclical is the voice of the Dark Ages, rising again in today’sintellectual vacuum, like a cold wind whistling through the empty streets of anabandoned civilization.Unable to resolve a lethal contradiction, the conflict between individualism andaltruism, the West is giving up. When men give up reason and freedom, the vacuumis filled by faith and force.No social system can stand for long without a moral base. Project a magnificentskyscraper being built on quicksands: while men are struggling upward to add thehundredth and two-hundredth stories, the tenth and twentieth are vanishing,sucked under by the muck. That is the history of capitalism, of its swaying,tottering attempt to stand erect on the foundation of the altruist morality.It’s either-or. If capitalism’s befuddled, guilt-ridden apologists do not knowit, two fully consistent representatives of altruism do know it: Catholicism andcommunism.Their rapprochement, therefore, is not astonishing. Their differences pertainonly to the supernatural, but here, in reality, on earth, they have threecardinal elements in common: the same morality, altruism—the same goal, globalrule by force—the same enemy, man’s mind.There is a precedent for their strategy. In the German election of 1933, thecommunists supported the Nazis, on the premise that they could fight each otherfor power later, but must first destroy their common enemy, capitalism. Today,Catholicism and communism may well cooperate, on the premise that they willfight each other for power later, but must first destroy their common enemy, theindividual, by forcing mankind to unite to form one neck ready for one leash.[Ibid., 316.] Is there any difference between the encyclical’s philosophy and communism? I amperfectly willing, on this matter, to take the word of an eminent Catholicauthority. Under the headline: “Encyclical Termed Rebuff to Marxism,” The NewYork Times of March 31, 1967, reports: “The Rev. John Courtney Murray, theprominent Jesuit theologian, described Pope Paul’s newest encyclical yesterdayas ‘the church’s definitive answer to Marxism.’ ... ‘The Marxists have proposedone way, and in pursuing their program they rely on man alone,’ Father Murraysaid. ‘Now Pope Paul VI has issued a detailed plan to accomplish the same goalon the basis of true humanism—humanism that recognizes man’s religious nature.’”Amen.So much for those American “conservatives” who claim that religion is the baseof capitalism—and who believe that they can have capitalism and eat it, too, asthe moral cannibalism of the altruist ethics demands.And so much for those modern “liberals” who pride themselves on being thechampions of reason, science, and progress—and who smear the advocates ofcapitalism as superstitious, reactionary representatives of a dark past. Moveover, comrades, and make room for your latest fellow-travelers, who had alwaysbelonged on your side—then take a look, if you dare, at the kind of past theyrepresent.[Ibid., 314.] [There is one] possibly misleading sentence... in Roark’s speech: “From thissimplest necessity to the highest religious abstraction, from the wheel to theskyscraper, everything we are and everything we have comes from a singleattribute of man—the function of his reasoning mind.”This could be misinterpreted to mean an endorsement of religion or religiousideas. I remember hesitating over that sentence, when I wrote it, and decidingthat Roark’s and my atheism, as well as the overall spirit of the book, were soclearly established that no one would misunderstand it, particularly since Isaid that religious abstractions are the product of man’s mind, not ofsupernatural revelation.But an issue of this sort should not be left to implications. What I wasreferring to was not religion as such, but a special category of abstractions,the most exalted one, which, for centuries, had been the near-monopoly ofreligion: ethics—not the particular content of religious ethics, but theabstraction “ethics,” the realm of values, man’s code of good and evil, with theemotional connotations of height, uplift, nobility, reverence, grandeur, whichpertain to the realm of man’s values, but which religion has arrogated toitself....Religion’s monopoly in the field of ethics has made it extremely difficult tocommunicate the emotional meaning and connotations of a rational view of life.Just as religion has pre-empted the field of ethics, turning morality againstman, so it has usurped the highest moral concepts of our language, placing themoutside this earth and beyond man’s reach. “Exaltation” is usually taken to meanan emotional state evoked by contemplating the supernatural. “Worship” means theemotional experience of loyalty and dedication to something higher than man.“Reverence” means the emotion of a sacred respect, to be experienced on one’sknees. “Sacred” means superior to and not-to-be-touched-by any concerns of manor of this earth. Etc.But such concepts do name actual emotions, even though no supernatural dimensionexists; and these emotions are experienced as uplifting or ennobling, withoutthe self-abasement required by religious definitions. What, then, is theirsource or referent in reality? It is the entire emotional realm of man’sdedication to a moral ideal. Yet apart from the man-degrading aspects introducedby religion, that emotional realm is left unidentified, without concepts, wordsor recognition.It is this highest level of man’s emotions that has to be redeemed from the murkof mysticism and redirected at its proper object: man.[“Introduction to The Fountainhead” TO, March 1968, 4.] Philosophy is the goal toward which religion was only a helplessly blindgroping. The grandeur, the reverence, the exalted purity, the austere dedicationto the pursuit of truth, which are commonly associated with religion, shouldproperly belong to the field of philosophy.[“The Chickens’ Homecoming,” NL, 108.] The ideology that opposes man’s enjoyment of his life on earth and holds sex assuch to be evil—the same ideology that is the source and cause of anti-obscenitycensorship [is]: religion.For a discussion of the profound, metaphysical reasons of religion’s antagonismto sex, I refer you to my article “Of Living Death” (The Objectivist,September-November 1968), which deals with the papal encyclical oncontraception, “Of Human Life.” Today, most people who profess to be religious,particularly in this country, do not share that condemnation of sex—but it is anancient tradition which survives, consciously or subconsciously, even in theminds of many irreligious persons, because it is a logical consequence implicitin the basic causes and motives of any form of mysticism.[“Thought Control.” ARL, III. 1,3.] Since religion is a primitive form of philosophy—an attempt to offer acomprehensive view of reality—many of its myths are distorted, dramatizedallegories based on some element of truth, some actual, if profoundly elusive,aspect of man’s existence.[“Philosophy and Sense of Life,” RM, 31; pb 25.] In mankind’s history, art began as an adjunct (and, often, a monopoly) ofreligion. Religion was the primitive form of philosophy: it provided man with acomprehensive view of existence. Observe that the art of those primitivecultures was a concretization of their religion’s metaphysical and ethicalabstractions.[“The Psycho-Epistemology of Art,” RM, 23; pb 20.]It has often been noted that a proof of God would be fatal to religion: a Godsusceptible of proof would have to be finite and limited; He would be one entityamong others within the universe, not a mystic omnipotence transcending scienceand reality. What nourishes the spirit of religion is not proof, but faith,i.e., the undercutting of man’s mind.[Leonard Peikoff, “ ‘Maybe You’re Wrong,’ ” TOF, April 1981, 12.]See also ABORTION; AGNOSTICISM; ALTRUISM; ART; ATHEISM; BIRTH CONTROL;COMMUNISM; “CONSERVATIVES”; DARK AGES; FAITH; GOD; MAN; MAN-WORSHIP; MORALITY;MYSTICISM; ORIGINAL SIN; PHILOSOPHY; PRIMACY of EXISTENCE vs. PRIMACY ofCONSCIOUSNESS; REASON; SACRED; SACRIFICE; SEX; SOUL-BODY DICHOTOMY;SUPERNATURALISM. Renaissance. The Renaissance was specifically the rebirth of reason, theliberation of man’s mind, the triumph of rationality over mysticism —afaltering, incomplete, but impassioned triumph that led to the birth of science,of individualism, of freedom.[“The Left: Old and New,” NL, 83.] The Renaissance—the rebirth of man’s mind—btasted the rule of the [mystics]sky-high, setting the earth free of [their] power. The liberation was not total,nor was it immediate: the convulsions lasted for centuries, but the culturalinfluence of mysticism—of avowed mysticism—was broken. Men could no longer betold to reject their mind as an impotent tool, when the proof of its potency wasso magnificently evident that the lowest perceptual-level mentality was not ablefully to evade it: men were seeing the achievements of science.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 21; pb 24.] The Renaissance represented a rebirth of the Aristotelian spirit. The results ofthat spirit are written across the next two centuries, which men describe,properly, as the Age of Reason and the Age of Enlightenment. The results includethe rise of modern science; the rise of an individualist political philosophy(the work of John Locke and others); the consequent spread of freedom across thecivilized world; and the birth of the freest country in history, the UnitedStates of America. The great corollary of these results, the product of men whowere armed with the knowledge of the scientists and who were free at last toact, was the Industrial Revolution, which turned poverty into abundance andtransformed the face of the West. The Aristotelianism released by Aquinas andthe Renaissance was sweeping away the dogmas and the shackles of the past.Reason, freedom, and production were replacing faith, force, and poverty. Theage-old foundations of statisrn were being challenged and undercut.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 22; pb 31.] The Renaissance was the great rebirth intellectually, but not politically. Stillseeking order and unity, men attempted to solve the problem of feudal tyranny byreplacing many small tyrants with a single big one. ‘I’his was the birth ofmodern absolute monarchies.[“A Nation’s Unity,” ARL, 11, 2, 2.] The Renaissance of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was a consciousrebellion against the anti-human, otherworldly values of medieval Christendom.In its metaphysics and epistemology, the Renaissance was essentiallyAristotelian. Every aspect of the period, from science to literature to art,reflected the Aristotelian view that man is a worthy being, capable ofunderstanding the universe, and that the universe is worthy of man’s interestand study. Mysticism, which had saturated every aspect of medieval life andculture, lost its stranglehold on man’s mind. A rebirth of reason and of concernwith this earth, was the base of all the achievements of the Renaissance.In terms of its morality, the Renaissance was split in two: it waspart-Aristotelian, part-Christian. As Aristotelians, the men of the Renaissancedisplayed the virtues of intelligence and pride, and pursued the value ofhappiness on earth. As Christians, they upheld the virtues of humility,renunciation and self-sacrifice, and the value of rewards in Heaven. Thus theexistentially brilliant era of the Renaissance was marred, spiritually, by aprofound moral conflict.That conflict appeared, in different degrees, in virtually all of theRenaissance art. For the most part, sculpture did reflect an affirmative view ofman. Although the subject matter was largely Christian, scalp-tors abandoned thestylistic features of medieval art. They testored weight, three-dimensionalityand natural proportions to the human body. They reintroduced free-standingfigures. They were keenly aware of human anatomy, and created images ofpotentially active bodies, or of bodies engaged in energetic movement. And,equally significant, the naked body was featured in the representation of bothChristian and pagan subjects.The statues present men who have intelligence, courage. determination andstrength of character; but they do not convey a sense of happiness. The moralconflict tinged the Renaissance view of life, and in the faces of the statuesthere is a touch of sadness or uncertainty of tragedy, an expression of longingfor an ideal never fully reached.[Mary Ann Sures, “Metaphysics in Marble,” TO. March 1969. 11.]See also ARISTOTLE; ART; DARK AGES; ENLIGHTENMENT, AGE of; FREEDOM; HISTORY;HUMILITY; MIDDLE AGES; MYSTICISM; REASON; RELIGION; TYRANNY. Representative Government. The theory of representative government rests on theprinciple that man is a rational being, i.e., that he is able to perceive thefacts of reality, to evaluate them, to form rational judgments, to make his ownchoices, and to bear responsibility for the course of his life.Politically, this principle is implemented by a man’s right to choose his ownagents, i.e., those whom he authorizes to represent him in the government of hiscountry. To represent him, in this context, means to represent his views interms of political principles. Thus the government of a free country derives its“just powers from the consent of the governed.” (For the basis of thisdiscussion, see “Man’s Rights” and “The Nature of Government” in Capitalism: TheUnknown Ideal.)As a corroboration of the link between man’s rational faculty and arepresentative form of government, observe that those who are demonstrably (orphysiologically) incapable of rational judgment cannot exercise the right tovote. (Voting is a derivative, not a fundamental, right; it is derived from theright to life, as a political implementation of the requirements of a rationalbeing’s survival.) Children do not vote, because they have not acquired theknowledge necessary to form a rational judgment on political issues; neither dothe feeble-minded or the insane, who have lost or never developed their rationalfaculty. (The possession of a rational faculty does not guarantee that a manwill use it, only that he is able to use it and is, therefore, responsible forhis actions.)[“Representation Without Authorization,” ARL, I, 21, 1.]See also CONSTITUTION; DEMOCRACY; GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; POLITICS;REPUBLIC; VOTING. Republic. The American system is not a democracy. It is a constitutionalrepublic. A democracy, if you attach meaning to terms, is a system of unlimitedmajority rule ... a form of collectivism, which denies individual rights.... TheAmerican system is a constitutionally limited republic, restricted to theprotection of individual rights. In such a system, majority rule is applicableonly to lesser details, such as the selection of certain personnel. But themajority has no say over the basic principles governing the government. It hasno power to ask for or gain the infringement of individual rights.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture9.]See also AMERICA; COLLECTIVISM; CONSTITUTION; DEMOCRACY; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS;POLITICS; REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT; VOTING. Responsibility/Obligation. In reality and in the Objectivist ethics, there is nosuch thing as “duty.” There is only choice and the full, clear recognition of aprinciple obscured by the notion of “duty”: the Law of Causality.The proper approach to ethics, the start from a metaphysically clean slate,untainted by any touch of Kantianism, can best be illustrated by the followingstory. In answer to a man who was telling her that she’s got to do something orother, a wise old Negro woman said: “Mister, there’s nothing I’ve got to doexcept die.”Life or death is man’s only fundamental alternative. To live is his basic act ofchoice. If he chooses to live, a rational ethics will tell him what principlesof action are required to implement his choice. If he does not choose to live,nature will take its course.Reality confronts man with a great many “musts,” but all of them areconditional; the formula of realistic necessity is: “You must, if—” and the “if”stands for man’s choice: “—if you want to achieve a certain goal.” You must eat,if you want to survive. You must work, if you want to eat. You must think, ifyou want to work. You must look at reality, if you want to think—if you want toknow what to do—if you want to know what goals to choose—if you want to know howto achieve them.In order to make the choices required to achieve his goals, a man needs theconstant, automatized awareness of the principle which the anti-concept “duty”has all but obliterated in his mind: the principle of causality—specifically, ofAristotelian final causation (which, in fact, applies only to a consciousbeing), i.e., the process by which an end determines the means, i.e., theprocess of choosing a goal and taking the actions necessary to achieve it.In a rational ethics, it is causality—not “duty”—that serves as the guidingprinciple in considering, evaluating and choosing one’s actions, particularlythose necessary to achieve a long-range goal. Following this principle, a mandoes not act without knowing the purpose of his action. In choosing a goal, heconsiders the means required to achieve it, he weighs the value of the goalagainst the difficulties of the means and against the full, hierarchical contextof all his other values and goals. He does not demand the impossible of himself,and he does not decide too easily which things are impossible. He never dropsthe context of the knowledge available to him, and never evades reality,realizing fully that his goal will not be granted to him by any power other thanhis own action, and, should he evade, it is not some Kantian authority that hewould be cheating, but himself....A disciple of causation is profoundly dedicated to his values, knowing that heis able to achieve them. He is incapable of desiring contradictions, of relyingon a “somehow,” of rebelling against reality. He knows that in all such cases,it is not some Kantian authority that he would be defying and injuring, buthimsetf—and that the penalty would be not some mystic brand of “immorality,” butthe frustration of his own desires and the destruction of his values....Accepting no mystic “duties” or unchosen obligations, he is the man who honorsscrupulously the obligations which he chooses. The obligation to keep one’spromises is one of the most important elements in proper human relationships,the element that leads to mutual confidence and makes cooperation possible amongmen....The acceptance of full responsibility for one’s own choices and actions (andtheir consequences) is such a demanding moral discipline that many men seek toescape it by surrendering to what they believe is the easy, automatic,unthinking safety of a morality of “duty.” They learn better, often when it istoo late.The disciple of causation faces life without inexplicable chains, unchosenburdens, impossible demands or supernatural threats. His metaphysical attitudeand guiding moral principle can best be summed up by an old Spanish proverb:“God said: ‘Take what you want and pay for it.’ ” But to know one’s own desires,their meaning and their costs requires the highest human virtue: rationality.[“Causality Versus Duty,” PWNI, 118; pb 98.] See also CONTRACTS; “DUTY”; FREE WILL; KANT, IMMANUEL; LIFE; MORALITY;RATIONALITY; SELFISHNESS; VALUES. Retaliatory Force. The basic political principle of the Objectivist ethics is:no man may initiate the use of physical force against others. No man—or group orsociety or government—has the right to assume the role of a criminal andinitiate the use of physical compulsion against any man. Men have the right touse physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate itsuse. The ethical principle involved is simple and clear-cut: it is thedifference between murder and self-defense. A holdup man seeks to gain a value,wealth, by killing his victim; the victim does not grow richer by killing aholdup man. The principle is: no man may obtain any values from others byresorting to physical force.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 31; pb 32.] It is only as retaliation that force may be used and only against the man whostarts its use. No, I do not share his evil or sink to his concept of morality:I merely grant him his choice, destruction, the only destruction he had theright to choose: his own. He uses force to seize a value; I use it only todestroy destruction.[GS, FNI, 166; pb 135.] The principle of using force only in retaliation against those who initiate itsuse, is the principle of subordinating might to right.[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 13; pb 10.]See also ANARCHISM; CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE; GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; JUSTICE;PACIFISM; PEACE MOVEMENTS; PHYSICAL FORCE; SELF-DEFENSE; WAR. Retroactive Law. Retroactive (or ex post facto) law—i.e., a law that punishes aman for an action which was not legally defined as a crime at the time hecommitted it—is rejected by and contrary to the entire tradition of Anglo-Saxonjurisprudence. It is a form of persecution practiced only in dictatorships andforbidden by every civilized code of law. It is specifically forbidden by theUnited States Constitution. It is not supposed to exist in the United States andit is not applied to anyone —except to businessmen. A case in which a man cannotknow until he is convicted whether the action he took in the past was legal orillegal, is certainly a case of retroactive law.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUl, 50.]See also ANTITRUST LAWS; BUSINESSMEN; CONSTITUTION; GOVERNMENT; LAW, OBJECTIVEAND NON-OBJECTIVE. Revolution vs. Putsch. The New Left does not portend a revolution, as its pressagents claim, but a Putsch. A revolution is the climax of a long philosophicaldevelopment and expresses a nation’s profound discontent; a Putsch is aminority’s seizure of power. The goal of a revolution is to overthrow tyranny;the goal of a Putsch is to establish it.Tyranny is any political system (whether absolute monarchy or fascism orcommunism) that does not recognize individual rights (which necessarily includeproperty rights). The overthrow of a political system by force is justified onlywhen it is directed against tyranny: it is an act of self-defense against thosewho rule by force. For example, the American Revolution. The resort to force,not in defense, but in violation, of individual rights, can have no moraljustification; it is not a revolution, but gang warfare.[“From a Symposium,” NL, 96.]See also AMERICA; DICTATORSHIP; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; NEW LEFT; PHYSICAL FORCE;STATISM.“Rewriting Reality.” Unable to determine what they can or cannot change, somemen attempt to “rewrite reality,” i.e., to alter the nature of themetaphysically given. Some dream of a universe in which man experiences nothingbut happiness—no pain, no frustration, no illness—and wonder why they lose thedesire to improve their life on earth. Some feel that they would be brave,honest, ambitious in a world where everyone automatically shared thesevirtues—but not in the world as it is. Some dread the thought of eventualdeath—and never undertake the task of living.[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 36; pb 30.] By the “metaphysically given,” we mean any fact inherent in reality as such,apart from human action (whether mental or physical)—as against “man-madefacts,” i.e., objects, institutions, practices, or rules of conduct that are ofhuman origin....As soon as you say about a metaphysically given fact: “it is”—just that much—thewhole Objectivist metaphysics is implicit. If the fact is, it is what it is (thelaw of identity); it is what it is independent of consciousness, of anyone’s oreveryone’s desires, hopes, fears (the primacy of existence); and it is lawful,inherent in the identities of the relevant entities (the law of causality).Given the circumstances involved, such a fact is necessary; it had to be; anyalternative would have entailed a contradiction. In short, once you say about ametaphysical fact: “it is,” that means that, within the relevant circumstances,it is immutable, inexorable, inescapable, absolute. “Absolute” in this contextmeans necessitated by the nature of existence and, therefore, unchangeable byhuman (or any other) agency....The attempt to alter the nature of the metaphysically given is described by AynRand as the fallacy of “rewriting reality.” Those who commit it regardmetaphysical facts as non-absolute and, therefore, feel free to imagine analternative to them. In effect, they regard the universe as though it weremerely a first draft of reality, which anyone may decide at will to rewrite.A common example is provided by those who condemn life on earth because man iscapable of failure, frustration, pain, and who yearn instead for a world inwhich man knows nothing but happiness. But if the possibility of failure exists,it necessarily exists (it is inherent in the fact that achieving a value dependson a specific course of action, and that man is neither omniscient noromnipotent in regard to such action). Anyone who holds the full context—whokeeps in mind the identity of all the relevant entities—would be unable even toimagine an alternative to the facts as they are; the contradictions involved insuch a projection would obliterate it. The rewriters, however, do not keepidentity in mind; they specialize in out-of-context pining for a “heaven” thatis the antonym of the metaphysically given.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture6.] See also ABSOLUTES; AXIOMS; CAUSALITY; EXISTENCE; IDENTITY; METAPHYSICAL vs.MAN-MADE. Right to Life. See Life, Right to. Rightists vs. Leftists. Since, today, there are no clear definitions ofpolitical terms, I use the word “rightist” to denote the views of those who arepredominantly in favor of individual freedom and capitalism —and the word“leftist” to denote the views of those who are predominantly in favor ofgovernment controls and socialism. As to the middle or “center,” I take it tomean “zero,” i.e., no dominant position, i.e., a pendulum swinging from side toside, moment by moment.[“The Disfranchisement of the Right,” ARL., I, 6, 1.]See also CAPITALISM; COLLECTIVISM; “CONSERVATIVES” vs. “LIBERALS”; INDIVIDUALRIGHTS; INDIVIDUALISM; POLITICS; SOCIALISM; STATISM.

Romanticism. Romanticism is a category of art based on the recognition of theprinciple that man possesses the faculty of volition.[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 81; pb 99.] Romanticism is the conceptual school of art. It deals, not with the randomtrivia of the day, but with the timeless, fundamental, universal problems andvalues of human existence. It does not record or photograph; it creates andprojects. It is concerned—in the words of Aristotle —not with things as theyare, but with things as they might be and ought to be.[“Introduction to The Fountainhead,” TO, March 1968, 1.] What the Romanticists brought to art was the primacy of values, an element thathad been missing in the stale, arid, third- and fourth-hand (and rate)repetitions of the Classicists’ formula-copying. Values (and value-judgments)are the source of emotions; a great deal of emotional intensity was projected inthe work of the Romanticists and in the reactions of their audiences, as well asa great deal of color, imagination, originality, excitement and all the otherconsequences of a value-oriented view of life. This emotional element was themost easily perceivable characteristic of the new movement and it was taken asits defining characteristic, without deeper inquiry.Such issues as the fact that the primacy of values in human life is not anirreducible primary, that it rests on man’s faculty of volition, and, therefore,that the Romanticists, philosophically, were the champions of volition (which isthe root of values) and not of emotions (which are merely the consequences)—wereissues to be defined by philosophers, who defaulted in regard to esthetics asthey did in regard to every other crucial aspect of the nineteenth century.The still deeper issue, the fact that the faculty of reason is the faculty ofvolition, was not known at the time, and the various theories of free will werefor the most part of an anti-rational character, thus reinforcing theassociation of volition with mysticism.[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 88; pb 104.] In recent times, some literary historians have discarded, as inadequate, thedefinition of Romanticism as an emotion-oriented school and have attempted toredefine it, but without success. Following the rule of fundamentality, it is asa volition-oriented school that Romanticism must be defined—and it is in termsof this essential characteristic that the nature and history of Romanticliterature can be traced and understood.[Ibid., 90; pb 106.) If man possesses volition, then the crucial aspect of his life is his choice ofvalues—if he chooses values, then he must act to gain and/or keep them—if so,then he must set his goals and engage in purposeful action to achieve them. Theliterary form expressing the essence of such action is the plot. (A plot is apurposeful progression of logically connected events leading to the resolutionof a climax.)The faculty of volition operates in regard to the two fundamental aspects ofman’s life: consciousness and existence, i.e., his psychological action and hisexistential action, i.e., the formation of his own character and the course ofaction he pursues in the physical world. Therefore, in a literary work, both thecharacterizations and the events are to be created by the author, according tohis view of the role of values in human psychology and existence (and accordingto the code of values he holds to be right). His characters are abstractprojections, not reproductions of concretes; they are invented conceptually, notcopied reportorially from the particular individuals he might have observed. Thespecific characters of particular individuals are merely the evidence of theirparticular value-choices and have no wider metaphysical significance (except asmaterial for the study of the general principles of human psychology); they donot exhaust man’s characterological potential.[Ibid., 82; pb 100.] The Romanticists did not present a hero as a statistical average, but as anabstraction of man’s best and highest potentiality, applicable to and achievableby all men, in various degrees, according to their individual choices.[“The Esthetic Vacuum of Our Age,” RM, 117; pb 126.] Philosophically, Romanticism is a crusade to glorify man’s existence;psychologically, it is experienced simply as the desire to make lifeinteresting.[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 95; pb 109.] Romanticism demands mastery of the primary element of fiction: the art ofstorytelling—which requires three cardinal qualities: ingenuity, imagination, asense of drama. All this (and more) goes into the construction of an originalplot integrated to theme and characterization. Naturalism discards theseelements and demands nothing but characterization, in as shapeless a narrative,as “uncontrived” (i.e., purposeless) a progression of events (if any) as a givenauthor pleases.The value of a Romanticist’s work has to be created by its author; he owes noallegiance to men (only to man), only to the metaphysical nature of reality andto his own values. The value of a Naturalist’s work depends on the specificcharacters, choices and actions of the men he reproduces—and he is judged by thefidelity with which he reproduces them.The value of a Romanticist’s story lies in what might happen; the value of aNaturalist’s story lies in that it did happen.[Ibid., 105; pb 117.]The major source and demonstration of moral values available to a child isRomantic art (particularly Romantic literature). What Romantic art offers him isnot moral rules, not an explicit didactic message, but the image of a moralperson—i.e., the concretized abstraction of a moral ideal. It offers a concrete,directly perceivable answer to the very abstract question which a child senses,but cannot yet conceptualize: What kind of person is moral and what kind of lifedoes he lead?It is not abstract principles that a child learns from Romantic art, but theprecondition and the incentive for the later understanding of such principles:the emotional experience of admiration for man’s highest potential, theexperience of looking up to a hero—a view of life motivated and dominated byvalues, a life in which man’s choices are practicable, effective and cruciallyimportant—that is, a moral sense of life.[“Art and Moral Treason,” RM, 142; pb 146.] Romantic art is the fuel and the spark plug of a man’s soul; its task is to seta soul on fire and never let it go out.[Ibid., 150; pb 152.] It is only the superficiality of the Naturalists that classifies Romanticism as“an escape”; this is true only in the very superficial sense of contemplating aglamorous vision as a relief from the gray burden of “real-life” problems. Butin the deeper, metaphysical-moral-psychological sense, it is Naturalism thatrepresents an escape—an escape from choice, from values, from moralresponsibility—and it is Romanticism that trains and equips man for the battleshe has to face in reality.[“Bootleg Romanticism,” RM, 134; pb 139.] The (implicit) standards of Romanticism are so demanding that in spite of theabundance of Romantic writers at the time of its dominance, this school hasproduced very few pure, consistent Romanticists of the top rank. Amongnovelists, the greatest are Victor Hugo and Dostoevsky, and, as single novels(whose authors were not always consistent in the rest of their works), I wouldname Henryk Sienkiewicz’s Quo Vadis and Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The ScarletLetter. Among playwrights, the greatest are Friedrich Schiller and EdmondRostand.The distinguishing characteristic of this top rank (apart from their purelyliterary genius) is their full commitment to the premise of volition in both ofits fundamental areas: in regard to consciousness and to existence, in regard toman’s character and to his actions in the physical world. Maintaining a perfectintegration of these two aspects, unmatched in the brilliant ingenuity of theirplot structures, these writers are enormously concerned with man’s soul (i.e.,his consciousness). They are moralists in the most profound sense of the word;their concern is not merely with values, but specifically with moral values andwith the power of moral values in shaping human character. Their characters are“larger than life,” i.e., they are abstract projections in terms of essentials(not always successful projections, as we shall discuss later). In theirstories, one will never find action for action’s sake, unrelated to moralvalues. The events of their plots are shaped, determined and motivated by thecharacters’ values (or treason to values), by their struggle in pursuit ofspiritual goals and by profound value-conflicts. Their themes are fundamental,universal, timeless issues of man’s existence—and they are the only consistentcreators of the rarest attribute of literature: the perfect integration of themeand plot, which they achieve with superlative virtuosity.If philosophical significance is the criterion of what is to be taken seriously,then these are the most serious writers in world literature.[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 91; ph 107.] It must be noted that philosophers contributed to the confusion surrounding theterm “Romanticism.” They attached the name “Romantic” to certain philosophers(such as Schelling and Schopenhauer) who were avowed mystics advocating thesupremacy of emotions, instincts or will over reason. This movement inphilosophy had no significant relation to Romanticism in esthetics, and the twomovements must not be confused.[“What Is Romanticism?” RM, 90; pb 106.] The archenemy and destroyer of Romanticism was the altruist morality.Since Romanticism’s essential characteristic is the projection of values,particularly moral values, altruism introduced an insolvable conflict intoRomantic literature from the start. The altruist morality cannot be practiced(except in the form of self-destruction) and, therefore, cannot be projected ordramatized convincingly in terms of man’s life on earth (particularly in therealm of psychological motivation). With altruism as the criterion of value andvirtue, it is impossible to create an image of man at his best—“as he might beand ought to be.” The major flaw that runs through the history of Romanticliterature is the failure to present a convincing hero, i.e., a convincing imageof a virtuous man.[lbid., 100; pb 113.]With the resurgence of mysticism and collectivism, in the later part of thenineteenth century, the Romantic novel and the Romantic movement vanishedgradually from the cultural scene.[“The Esthetic Vacuum of Our Age,” RM, 114; pb 124.]See also ALTRUISM; ARISTOTLE; ART; CLASSICISM; EMOTIONS; FREE WILL;FUNDAMENTALlTY, RULE of; LITERATURE; METAPHYSICAL VALUE JUDGMENTS: MORALITY;NATURALISM: PLOT; POPULAR LITERATURE; REASON: THRILLERS; VALUES."},{"pageContent":"SSacred. I will ask you to project the look on a child’s face when he grasps theanswer to some problem he has been striving to understand. It is a radiant lookof joy, of liberation, almost of triumph, which is unself-conscious, yetself-assertive, and its radiance seems to spread in two directions: outward, asan illumination of the world—inward, as the first spark of what is to become thefire of an earned pride. If you have seen this look, or experienced it, you knowthat if there is such a concept as “sacred”—meaning: the best, the highestpossible to man—this look is the sacred, the not-to-be-betrayed, thenot-to-be-sacrificed for anything or anyone.[“Requiem for Man,” CUI, 303.] [I use] the word “sanctity” not in a mystical sense, but in the sense of“supreme value.”[WTL, “Foreword,” v.] See also MYSTICISM; PRIDE; RELIGION; UNDERSTANDING; VALUES. Sacrifice. “Sacrifice” is the surrender of a greater value for the sake of alesser one or of a nonvalue. Thus, altruism gauges a man’s virtue by the degreeto which he surrenders, renounces or betrays his values (since help to astranger or an enemy is regarded as more virtuous, less “selfish,” than help tothose one loves). The rational principle of conduct is the exact opposite:always act in accordance with the hierarchy of your values, and never sacrificea greater value to a lesser one.This applies to all choices, including one’s actions toward other men. Itrequires that one possess a defined hierarchy of rational values (values chosenand validated by a rational standard). Without such a hierarchy, neitherrational conduct nor considered value judgments nor moral choices are possible.[“The Ethics of Emergencies,” VOS, 48; pb 44.] “Sacrifice” does not mean the rejection of the worthless, but of the precious.“Sacrifice” does not mean the rejection of the evil for the sake of the good,but of the good for the sake of the evil. “Sacrifice” is the surrender of thatwhich you value in favor of that which you don’t.If you exchange a penny for a dollar, it is not a sacrifice; if you exchange adollar for a penny, it is. If you achieve the career you wanted, after years ofstruggle, it is not a sacrifice; if you then renounce it for the sake of arival, it is. If you own a bottle of milk and give it to your starving child, itis not a sacrifice; if you give it to your neighbor’s child and let your owndie, it is.If you give money to help a friend, it is not a sacrifice; if you give it to aworthless stranger, it is. If you give your friend a sum you can afford, it isnot a sacrifice; if you give him money at the cost of your own discomfort, it isonly a partial virtue, according to this sort of moral standard; if you give himmoney at the cost of disaster to yourself—that is the virtue of sacrifice infull.If you renounce all personal desires and dedicate your life to those you love,you do not achieve full virtue: you still retain a value of your own, which isyour love. If you devote your life to random strangers, it is an act of greatervirtue. If you devote your life to serving men you hate—that is the greatest ofthe virtues you can practice.A sacrifice is the surrender of a value. Full sacrifice is full surrender of allvalues. If you wish to achieve full virtue, you must seek no gratitude in returnfor your sacrifice, no praise, no love, no admiration, no self-esteem, not eventhe pride of being virtuous; the faintest trace of any gain dilutes your virtue.If you pursue a course of action that does not taint your life by any joy, thatbrings you no value in matter, no value in spirit, no gain, no profit, noreward—if you achieve this state of total zero, you have achieved the ideal ofmoral perfection.You are told that moral perfection is impossible to man—and, by this standard,it is. You cannot achieve it so long as you live, but the value of your life andof your person is gauged by how closely you succeed in approaching that idealzero which is death.If you start, however, as a passionless blank, as a vegetable seeking to beeaten, with no values to reject and no wishes to renounce, you will not win thecrown of sacrifice. It is not a sacrifice to renounce the unwanted. It is not asacrifice to give your life for others, if death is your personal desire. Toachieve the virtue of sacrifice, you must want to live, you must love it, youmust burn with passion for this earth and for all the splendor it can giveyou—you must feel the twist of every knife as it slashes your desires away fromyour reach and drains your love out of your body. It is not mere death that themorality of sacrifice holds out to you as an ideal, but death by slow torture.Do not remind me that it pertains only to this life on earth. I am concernedwith no other. Neither are you.If you wish to save the last of your dignity, do not call your best actions a“sacrifice”: that term brands you as immoral. If a mother buys food for herhungry child rather than a hat for herself, it is not a sacrifice: she valuesthe child higher than the hat; but it is a sacrifice to the kind of mother whosehigher value is the hat, who would prefer her child to starve and feeds him onlyfrom a sense of duty. If a man dies fighting for his own freedom, it is not asacrifice: he is not willing to live as a slave; but it is a sacrifice to thekind of man who’s willing. If a man refuses to sell his convictions, it is not asacrifice, unless he is the sort of man who has no convictions.Sacrifice could be proper only for those who have nothing to sacrifice —novalues, no standards, no judgment—those whose desires are irrational whims,blindly conceived and lightly surrendered. For a man of moral stature, whosedesires are born of rational values, sacrifice is the surrender of the right tothe wrong, of the good to the evil.The creed of sacrifice is a morality for the immorat—a morality that declaresits own bankruptcy by confessing that it can’t impart to men any personal stakein virtues or values, and that their souls are sewers of depravity, which theymust be taught to sacrifice. By its own confession, it is impotent to teach mento be good and can only subject them to constant punishment.[GS, FNI, 172; pb 139.] Concern for the welfare of those one loves is a rational part of one’s selfishinterests. If a man who is passionately in love with his wife spends a fortuneto cure her of a dangerous illness, it would be absurd to claim that he does itas a “sacrifice” for her sake, not his own, and that it makes no difference tohim, personally and selfishly, whether she lives or dies.Any action that a man undertakes for the benefit of those he loves is not asacrifice if, in the hierarchy of his values, in the total context of thechoices open to him, it achieves that which is of greatest personal (andrational) importance to him. In the above example, his wife’s survival is ofgreater value to the husband than anything else that his money could buy, it isof greatest importance to his own happiness and, therefore, his action is not asacrifice.But suppose he let her die in order to spend his money on saving the lives often other women, none of whom meant anything to him—as the ethics of altruismwould require. That would be a sacrifice. Here the difference betweenObjectivism and altruism can be seen most clearly: if sacrifice is the moralprinciple of action, then that husband should sacrifice his wife for the sake often other women. What distinguishes the wife from the ten others? Nothing buther value to the husband who has to make the choice—nothing but the fact thathis happiness requires her survival.The Objectivist ethics would tell him: your highest moral purpose is theachievement of your own happiness, your money is yours, use it to save yourwife, that is your moral right and your rational, moral choice.[“The Ethics of Emergencies,” VOS, 49; pb 45.] If the frustration of any desire constitutes a sacrifice, then a man who owns anautomobile and is robbed of it, is being sacrificed, but so is the man who wantsor “aspires to” an automobile which the owner refuses to give him—and these two“sacrifices” have equal ethical status. If so, then man’s only choice is to robor be robbed, to destroy or be destroyed, to sacrifice others to any desire ofhis own or to sacrifice himself to any desire of others; then man’s only ethicalalternative is to be a sadist or a masochist.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 27; pb 30.] The failure to give to a man what had never belonged to him can hardly bedescribed as “sacrificing his interests.”[“The ‘Conflicts’ of Men’s Interests,” VOS, 67; pb 56.] It stands to reason that where there’s sacrifice, there’s someone collectingsacrificial offerings. Where there’s service, there’s someone being served. Theman who speaks to you of sacrifice, speaks of slaves and masters. And intends tobe the master.[“The Soul of a Collectivist,” FNI, 84; pb 73.]See also ALTRUISM; “DUTY”; INTEGRITY; KANT, IMMANUEL; MORALITY; MYSTICISM;PRIDE; SELFISHNESS; SELFLESSNESS; STANDARD of VALUE; STATISM; ULTIMATE VALUE;VALUES. Sanction. To discuss evil in a manner implying neutrality, is to sanction it.[“The Argument from Intimidation,” VOS, 198; pb 143.] One must speak up in situations where silence can objectively be taken to meanagreement with or sanction of evil. When one deals with irrational persons,where argument is futile, a mere “I don’t agree with you” is sufficient tonegate any implication of moral sanction. When one deals with better people, afull statement of one’s views may be morally required. But in no case and in nosituation may one permit one’s own values to be attacked or denounced, and keepsilent.[“How Does One Lead a Rational Life in an Irrational Society?” VOS, 92; pb 73.]To combat petty larceny as a crucial danger, at a time when murder is beingcommitted, is to sanction the murder.[“Antitrust: The Rule of Unreason,” TON, Feb. 1962, 8.] To abstain from condemning a torturer, is to become an accessory to the tortureand murder of his victims.The moral principle to adopt in this issue, is: “Judge, and be prepared to bejudged.”[“How Does One Lead a Rational Life in an Irrational Society?” VOS, 91; pb 72.] A forced compliance is not a sanction. All of us are forced to comply with manylaws that violate our rights, but so long as we advocate the repeal of suchlaws, our compliance does not constitute a sanction. Unjust laws have to befought ideologically; they cannot be fought or corrected by means of meredisobedience and futile martyrdom.“The Wreckage of the Consensus,” CUI, 235.]See also APPEASEMENT; EVIL; MORAL COWARDICE; MORAL JUDGMENT; MORALITY; PHYSICALFORCE; SANCTION of the VICTIM; SOVIET RUSSIA. Sanction of the Victim. The “sanction of the victim” is the willingness of thegood to suffer at the hands of the evil, to accept the role of sacrificialvictim for the “sin” of creating values.[Leonard Peikoff. “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture8.] Then I saw what was wrong with the world, I saw what destroyed men and nations,and where the battle for life had to be fought. I saw that the enemy was aninverted morality—and that my sanction was its only power. I saw that evil wasimpotent—that evil was the irrational, the blind, the anti-real—and that theonly weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it. Just asthe parasites around me were proclaiming their helpless dependence on my mindand were expecting me voluntarily to accept a slavery they had no power toenforce, just as they were counting on my self-immolation to provide them withthe means of their plan—so throughout the world and throughout men’s history, inevery version and form, from the extortions of loafing relatives to theatrocities of collectivized countries, it is the good, the able, the men ofreason, who act as their own destroyers, who transfuse to evil the blood oftheir virtue and let evil transmit to them the poison of destruction, thusgaining for evil the power of survival, and for their own values—the impotenceof death. I saw that there comes a point, in the defeat of any man of virtue,when his own consent is needed for evil to win—and that no manner of injury doneto him by others can succeed if he chooses to withhold his consent. I saw that Icould put an end to your outrages by pronouncing a single word in my mind. Ipronounced it. The word was “No.”[GS, FNI, 206; pb 165.] Every kind of ethnic group is enormously sensitive to any slight. If one made aderogatory remark about the Kurds of Iran, dozens of voices would leap to theirdefense. But no one speaks out for businessmen, when they are attacked andinsulted by everyone as a matter of routine. What causes this overwhelminginjustice? The businessmen’s own policies: their betrayal of their own values,their appeasement of enemies, their compromises—all of which add up to an air ofmoral cowardice. Add to it the fact that businessmen are creating and supportingtheir own destroyers.The sources and centers of today’s philosophical corruption are theuniversities.... It is the businessmen’s money that supports Americanuniversities—not merely in the form of taxes and government handouts, but muchworse: in the form of voluntary, private contributions, donations, endowments,etc. In preparation for this lecture, I tried to do some research on the natureand amounts of such contributions. I had to give it up: it is too complex andtoo vast a field for the efforts of one person. To untangle it now would requirea major research project and, probably, years of work. All I can say is onlythat millions and millions and millions of dollars are being donated touniversities by big business enterprises every year, and that the donors have noidea of what their money is being spent on or whom it is supporting. What iscertain is only the fact that some of the worst anti-business, anti-capitalisrnpropaganda has been financed by businessmen in such projects.Money is a great power—because, in a free or even a semi-free society, it is afrozen form of productive energy. And, therefore, the spending of money is agrave responsibility. Contrary to the altruists and the advocates of theso-called “academic freedom,” it is a moral crime to give money to support ideaswith which you disagree; it means: ideas which you consider wrong, false, evil.It is a moral crime to give money to support your own destroyers. Yet that iswhat businessmen are doing with such reckless irresponsibility.[“The Sanction of the Victims,” TOF, April 1982, 6.]See also APPEASEMENT; BUSINESSMEN; COLLECTIVISM; COMPROMISE; EVIL; GOOD, the;MONEY; MORAL COWARDICE; MORALITY; SANCTION; SOVIET RUSSIA.Savings. Agriculture is the first step toward civilization, because it requiresa significant advance in men’s conceptual development: it requires that theygrasp two cardinal concepts which the perceptual, concrete-bound mentality ofthe hunters could not grasp fully: time and savings. Once you grasp these, youhave grasped the three essentials of human survival: time-savings-production.You have grasped the fact that production is not a matter confined to theimmediate moment, but a continuous process, and that production is fueled byprevious production. The concept of “stock seed” unites the three essentials andapplies not merely to agriculture, but much, much more widely: to all forms ofproductive work. Anything above the level of a savage’s precarious,hand-to-mouth existence requires savings. Savings buy time.[“Egalitarianism and Inflation,” PWNI, 153; pb 126.] Deferred consumption (i.e., savings) on a gigantic scale is required to keepindustrial production going. Savings pay for machines which enable men toproduce in a day an amount of goods they would not be able to produce by hand ina year (if at all). This enables the workers in turn to defer consumption and tosave some of their income for their future needs or goals. The hallmark of anindustrial society is its members’ distance from a hand-to-mouth mode of living;the greater this distance, the greater men’s progress.The major part of this country’s stock seed is not the fortunes of the rich (whoare a small minority), but the savings of the middle class—i.e., of responsiblemen who have the ability to grasp the concept “future” and to deposit one dollar(or more) into a bank account. A man of this type saves money for his ownfuture, but the bank invests his money in productive enterprises; thus, thegoods he did not consume today, are available to him when he needs themtomorrow—and, in the meantime, these goods serve as fuel for the country’sproductive process.[“The Inverted Moral Priorities,” ARL, III, 21, I.] Consumption is the final, not the efficient, cause of production. The efficientcause is savings, which can be said to represent the opposite of consumption:they represent unconsumed goods. Consumption is the end of production, and adead end, as far as the productive process is concerned. The worker who producesso little that he consumes everything he earns, carries his own weighteconomically, but contributes nothing to future production. The worker who has amodest savings account, and the millionaire who invests a fortune (and all themen in between), are those who finance the future.[“Egalitarianism and Inflation,” PWNI, 160; pb 132.]See also CONSUMPTION; CREDIT; FINAL CAUSATI0N; GOLD STANDARD; INFLATION;INTEREST (on LOANS); INVESTMENT; MIDDLE CLASS; MONEY; PRODUCTION. Science. Science was born as a result and consequence of philosophy; it cannotsurvive without a philosophical (particularly epistemological) base. Ifphilosophy perishes, science will be next to go.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 50; pb 44.] It is not the special sciences that teach man to think; it is philosophy thatlays down the epistemological criteria of all special sciences.[ITOE, 104.1 The disintegration of philosophy in the nineteenth century and its collapse inthe twentieth have led to a similar, though much slower and less obvious,process in the course of modern science.‘T’oday’s frantic development in the field of technology has a qualityreminiscent of the days preceding the economic crash of 1929: riding on themomentum of the past, on the unacknowledged remnants of an Aristotelianepistemology, it is a hectic, feverish expansion, heedless of the fact that itstheoretical account is long since overdrawn—that in the field of scientifictheory, unable to integrate or interpret their own data, scientists are abettingthe resurgence of a primitive mysticism. In the humanities, however, the crashis past, the depression has set in, and the collapse of science is all butcomplete.The clearest evidence of it may be seen in such comparatively young sciences aspsychology and political economy. In psychology, one may observe the attempt tostudy human behavior without reference to the fact that man is conscious. Inpolitical economy, one may observe the attempt to study and to devise socialsystems without reference to man. It is philosophy that defines and establishes the epistemological criteria toguide human knowledge in general and specific sciences in particular.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 11.]See also ARISTOTLE; BEHAVIORISM; EPISTEMOLOGY; LOGIC; MYSTICISM; PHILOSOPHY;REASON; TECHNOLOGY; TRIBAL, PREMISE (in ECONOMICS). Sculpture. Sculpture [re-creates reality] by means of a three-dimensional formmade of a solid material.... Sculpture [deals] with the combined fields of sightand touch....The so-called visual arts (painting, sculpture, architecture) produce concrete,perceptually available entities and make them convey an abstract. conceptualmeaning.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 46.] Compared to painting, sculpture is more limited a form of art. It expresses anartist’s view of existence through his treatment of the human figure, but it isconfined to the human figure. (For a discussion of sculpture’s means, I willrefer you to “Metaphysics in Marble” by Mary Ann Sures, The Objectivist,February-March 1969.)Dealing with two senses, sight and touch, sculpture is restricted by thenecessity to present a three-dimensional shape as man does not perceive it:without color. Visually, sculpture offers shape as an abstraction; but touch isa somewhat concrete-bound sense and confines sculpture to concrete entities. Ofthese, only the figure of man can project a metaphysical meaning. There islittle that one can express in the statue of an animal or of an inanimateobject.Psycho-epistemologically, it is the requirements of the sense of touch that makethe texture of a human body a crucial element in sculpture, and virtually ahallmark of great sculptors. Observe the manner in which the softness, thesmoothness, the pliant resiliency of the skin is conveyed by rigid marble insuch statues as the Venus de Milo or Michelangelo’s Pietà.It is worth noting that sculpture is almost a dead art. Its great day was inancient Greece which, philosophically, was a man-centered civilization. ARenaissance is always possible, but the future of sculpture depends to a largeextent on the future of architecture. The two arts are closely allied; one ofthe problems of sculpture lies in the fact that one of its most effectivefunctions is to serve as architectural ornament.[Ibid., 49.] The history of sculpture is a history of man’s view of man—of his body andspirit, i.e., of his metaphysical nature. Every culture, from the most primitiveto the most civilized, has held an estimate of man and has wanted to see theobjectified reality of that estimate. Man has been the predominant subject ofsculpture, whether he was judged to be an object of pride or of shame, a hero ora sinner.A metaphysical view of man is projected by the manner in which the sculptorpresents the human figure. In the process of shaping clay or wood or stone intothe form of a body, the sculptor reveals his answer to three questions: Is man abeing of free will or is he a helpless puppet of fate?—Is he good or evil?—Canhe achieve happiness or is he doomed to misery?—and then mounts his answer on apedestal and puts it in a tomb or in a temple or over the portal of a church orin a living room in New York City.[Mary Ann Sures, “Metaphysics in Marble,” TO, Feb. 1969, 10.] Philosophy is the sculptor of man’s soul. And sculpture is philosophy in stone.[Ibid., March 1969, 16.]See also ANCIENT GREECE; ART; DETERMINISM; ESTHETICS; FREE WILL; MAN;METAPHYSICS; PAINTING; PHILOSOPHY; PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY; VISUAL ARTS. Secession. Some people ask whether local groups or provinces have the right tosecede from the country of which they are a part. The answer is: on ethnicgrounds, no. Ethnicity is not a valid consideration, morally or politically, anddoes not endow anyone with any special rights. As to other than ethnic grounds,remember that rights belong only to individuals and that there is no such thingas “group rights.” If a province wants to secede from a dictatorship, or evenfrom a mixed economy, in order to establish a free country—it has the right todo so. But if a local gang, ethnic or otherwise, wants to secede in order toestablish its own government controls, it does not have that right. No group hasthe right to violate the rights of the individuals who happen to live in thesame locality. A wish—individuat or collective—is not a right.[“Global Balkanization,” pamphlet, 14.]See also DICTATORSHIP; “ETHNICITY”; FREEDOM; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; NATIONAL RIGHTS;SELF-DETERMINATION of NATIONS. Second-Handers. Isn’t that the root of every despicable action? Not selfishness,but precisely the absence of a self. Look at them. The man who cheats and lies,but preserves a respectable front. He knows himself to be dishonest, but othersthink he’s honest and he derives his self-respect from that, second-hand. Theman who takes credit for an achievement which is not his own. He knows himselfto be mediocre, but he’s great in the eyes of others. The frustrated wretch whoprofesses love for the inferior and clings to those less endowed, in order toestablish his own superiority by comparison.... They’re second-handers....They have no concern for facts, ideas, work. They’re concerned only with people.They don’t ask: “Is this true?” They ask: “Is this what others think is true?”Not to judge, but to repeat. Not to do, but to give the impression of doing. Notcreation, but show. Not ability, but friendship. Not merit, but pull. What wouldhappen to the world without those who do, think, work, produce? Those are theegoists. You don’t think through another’s brain and you don’t work throughanother’s hands. When you suspend your faculty of independent judgment, yoususpend consciousness. To stop consciousness is to stop life. Second-handershave no sense of reality. Their reality is not within them, but somewhere inthat space which divides one human body from another. Not an entity, but arelation—anchored to nothing. That’s the emptiness I couldn’t understand inpeople. That’s what stopped me whenever I faced a committee. Men without an ego.Opinion without a rational process. Motion without brakes or motor. Powerwithout responsibility. The second-hander acts, but the source of his actions isscattered in every other living person. It’s everywhere and nowhere and youcan’t reason with him. He’s not open to reason.[“The Nature of the Second-Hander,” FNI, 78; pb 69.] After centuries of being pounded with the doctrine that altruism is the ultimateideal, men have accepted it in the only way it could be accepted. By seekingself-esteem through others. By living second-hand. And it has opened the way forevery kind of horror. It has become the dreadful form of selfishness which atruly selfish man couldn’t have conceived. And now, to cure a world perishingfrom selflessness, we’re asked to destroy the self. Listen to what is beingpreached today. Look at everyone around us. You’ve wondered why they suffer, whythey seek happiness and never find it. If any man stopped and asked himselfwhether he’s ever held a truly personal desire, he’d find the answer. He’d seethat all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his ambitions are motivated byother men. He’s not really struggling even for material wealth, but for thesecond-hander’s delusion—prestige. A stamp of approval, not his own. He can findno joy in the struggle and no joy when he has succeeded. He can’t say about asingle thing: “This is what I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made myneighbors gape at me.” [Ibid., 79; pb 70.] [In Galt’s speech, below, Miss Rand discusses the second-hand nature of thepsychology of mystics.]A mystic is a man who surrendered his mind at its first encounter with the mindsof others. Somewhere in the distant reaches of his childhood, when his ownunderstanding of reality clashed with the assertions of others, with theirarbitrary orders and contradictory demands, he gave in to so craven a fear ofindependence that he renounced his rational faculty. At the crossroads of thechoice between “I know” and “They say,” he chose the authority of others, hechose to submit rather than to understand, to believe rather than to think.Faith in the supernatural begins as faith in the superiority of others. Hissurrender took the form of the feeling that he must hide his lack ofunderstanding, that others possess some mysterious knowledge of which he aloneis deprived, that reality is whatever they want it to be, through some meansforever denied to him.From then on, afraid to think, he is left at the mercy of unidentified feelings.His feelings become his only guide, his only remnant of personal identity, heclings to them with ferocious possessiveness—and whatever thinking he does isdevoted to the struggle of hiding from himself that the nature of his feelingsis terror.When a mystic declares that he feels the existence of a power superior toreason, he feels it all right, but that power is not an omniscient super-spiritof the universe, it is the consciousness of any passer-by to whom he hassurrendered his own. A mystic is driven by the urge to impress, to cheat, toflatter, to deceive, to force that omnipotent consciousness of others. “They”are his only key to reality, he feels that he cannot exist save by harnessingtheir mysterious power and extorting their unaccountable consent. “They” are hisonly means of perception and, like a blind man who depends on the sight of adog, he feels he must leash them in order to live. To control the consciousnessof others becomes his only passion; power-lust is a weed that grows only in thevacant lots of an abandoned mind.[GS, FNI, 200; pb 160.] A [second-hander] is one who regards the consciousness of other men as superiorto his own and to the facts of reality. It is to a [second-hander] that themoral appraisal of himself by others is a primary concern which supersedestruth, facts, reason, logic. The disapproval of others is so shatteringlyterrifying to him that nothing can withstand its impact within hisconsciousness; thus he would deny the evidence of his own eyes and invalidatehis own consciousness for the sake of any stray charlatan’s moral sanction. Itis only a [second-hander] who could conceive of such absurdity as hoping to winan intellectual argument by hinting: “But people won’t like you!”[“The Argument from Intimidation,” VOS, 195; pb 141.] Notice how they’ll accept anything except a man who stands alone. They recognizehim at once.... There’s a special, insidious kind of hatred for him. Theyforgive criminals. They admire dictators. Crime and violence are a tie. A formof mutual dependence. They need ties. They’ve got to force their miserablelittle personalities on every single person they meet. The independent man killsthem—because they don’t exist within him and that’s the only form of existencethey know. Notice the malignant kind of resentment against any idea thatpropounds independence. Notice the malice toward an independent man.[“The Nature of the Second-Hander,” FNI. 79; pb 69.] It is fear that drives them to seek the warmth, the protection, the “safety” ofa herd. When they speak of merging their selves into a “greater whole,” it istheir fear that they hope to drown in the undemanding waves of unfastidioushuman bodies. And what they hope to fish out of that pool is the momentaryillusion of an unearned personal significance.[“Apollo and Dionysus,” NL, 80.] Men were taught to regard second-handers—tyrants, emperors, dictators—asexponents of egoism. By this fraud they were made to destroy the ego, themselvesand others. The purpose of the fraud was to destroy the creators. Or to harnessthem. Which is a synonym.From the beginning of history, the two antagonists have stood face to face: thecreator and the second-hander. When the first creator invented the wheel, thefirst second-hander responded. He invented altruism.The creator—denied, opposed, persecuted, exploited—went on, moved forward andcarried all humanity along on his energy. The second-hander contributed nothingto the process except the impediments. The contest has another name: theindividual against the collective.

Self. A man’s self is his mind—the faculty that perceives reality, formsjudgments, chooses values.[“Selfishness Without a Self,” PWNI, 60; pb 50.] The self you have betrayed is your mind; self-esteem is reliance on one’s powerto think. The ego you seek, that essential “you” which you cannot express ordefine, is not your emotions or inarticulate dreams, but your intellect, thatjudge of your supreme tribunal whom you’ve impeached in order to drift at themercy of any stray shyster you describe as your “feeling.”[(;S, FNI, 222: pb 177.]Your self is your mind; renounce it and you become a chunk of meat ready for anycannibal to swallow.[Ibid., 176; pb 142.] The most selfish of all things is the independent mind that recognizes noauthority higher than its own and no value higher than its judgment of truth.[Ibid.]See also REASON; SELF-ESTEEM; SELF-INTEREST; SELFISHNESS; SELFLESSNESS;THOUGHT/THINKING; VALUES. Self-Defense. The necessary consequence of man’s right to life is his right toself--defense. In a civilized society, force may be used only in retaliation andonly against those who initiate its use. All the reasons which make theinitiation of physical force an evil, make the retaliatory use of physical forcea moral imperative.If some “pacifist” society renounced the retaliatory use of force, it would beleft helplessly at the mercy of the first thug who decided to be immoral. Such asociety would achieve the opposite of its intention: instead of abolishing evil,it would encourage and reward it.[“The Nature of Government,” VOS, 146; pb 108.] The individual does possess the right of self-defense and that is the rightwhich he delegates to the government, for the purpose of an orderly, legallydefined enforcement.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business,” CUI, 46.] A proper government is only a policeman, acting as an agent of man’sself-defense, and, as such, may resort to force only against those who start theuse of force.[GS, FNI, 231; pb 183.] Just as an individual has the right of self-defense, so has a free country ifattacked. But this does not give its government the right to draft men intomilitary service—which is the most blatantly statist violation of a man’s rightto his own life.[“The Roots of War,” CUI, 40.]See also DRAFT; FOREIGN POLICY; GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; LIFE, RIGHT to;PACIFISM; RETALIATORY FORCE; WAR. Self Determination of Nations. The right of “the self-determination of nations”applies only to free societies or to societies seeking to establish freedom; itdoes not apply to dictatorships. Just as an individual’s right of free actiondoes not include the “right” to commit crimes (that is, to violate the rights ofothers), so the right of a nation to determine its own form of government doesnot include the right to establish a slave society (that is, to legalize theenslavement of some men by others). There is no such thing as “the right toenslave.” A nation can do it, just as a man can become a criminal—but neithercan do it by right.It does not matter, in this context, whether a nation was enslaved by force,like Soviet Russia, or by vote, like Nazi Germany. Individual rights are notsubject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of aminority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minoritiesfrom oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is theindividual). Whether a slave society was conquered or chose to be enslaved, itcan claim no national rights and no recognition of such “rights” by civilizedcountries—just as a mob of gangsters cannot demand a recognition of its “rights”and a legal equality with an industrial concern or a university, on the groundthat the gangsters chose by unanimous vote to engage in that particular kind ofgroup activity.Dictatorship nations are outlaws. Any free nation had the right to invade NaziGermany and, today, has the right to invade Soviet Russia, Cuba or any otherslave pen. Whether a free nation chooses to do so or not is a matter of its ownself-interest, not of respect for the non-existent “rights” of gang rulers. Itis not a free nation’s duty to liberate other nations at the price ofself-sacrifice, but a free nation has the right to do it, when and if it sochooses.[“Collectivized ‘Rights,’ ” VOS, 139; pb 104.] A nation that violates the rights of its own citizens cannot claim any rightswhatsoever. In the issue of rights, as in all moral issues, there can be nodouble standard. A nation ruled by brute physical force is not a nation, but ahorde—whether it is led by Attila, Genghis Khan, Hitler, Khrushchev or Castro.What rights could Attila claim and on what grounds?[Ibid., 139; pb 103.] See also “COLLECTIVE RIGHTS”; DEMOCRACY; DICTATORSHIP; FOREIGN POLICY; FREEDOM;GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; NATIONAL RIGHTS; SACRIFICE; SECESSION; STATISM. Self-Esteem. To live, man must hold three things as the supreme and rulingvalues of his life: Reason-Purpose-Self-esteem. Reason, as his only tool ofknowledge-Purpose, as his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceedto achieve—Self-esteem, as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent tothink and his person is worthy of happiness, which means: is worthy of living.[GS, FNI, 156; pb 128.] By a feeling he has not learned to identify, but has derived from his firstawareness of existence, from his discovery that he has to make choices, manknows that his desperate need of self-esteem is a matter of life or death. As abeing of volitional consciousness, he knows that he must know his own value inorder to maintain his own life. He knows that he has to be right; to be wrong inaction means danger to his life; to be wrong in person, to be evil, means to beunfit for existence.Every act of man’s life has to be willed; the mere act of obtaining or eatinghis food implies that the person he preserves is worthy of being preserved;every pleasure he seeks to enjoy implies that the person who seeks it is worthyof finding enjoyment. He has no choice about his need of self-esteem, his onlychoice is the standard by which to gauge it. And he makes his fatal error whenhe switches this gauge protecting his life into the service of his owndestruction, when he chooses a standard contradicting existence and sets hisself-esteem against reality.[Ibid., 220; pb 176.] No value is higher than self-esteem, but you’ve invested it in counterfeitsecurities—and now your morality has caught you in a trap where you are forcedto protect your self-esteem by fighting for the creed of self-destruction. Thegrim joke is on you: that need of self-esteem, which you’re unable to explain orto define, belongs to my morality, not yours; it’s the objective token of mycode, it is my proof within your own soul. [lbid., 220; pb 175.] Self-esteem is reliance on one’s power to think. It cannot be replaced by one’spower to deceive. The self-confidence of a scientist and the self-confidence ofa con man are not interchangeable states, and do not come from the samepsychological universe. The success of a man who deals with reality augments hisself-confidence. The success of a con man augments his panic.[“The Age of Envy,” NL, 181.] The man of authentic self-confidence is the man who relies on the judgment ofhis own mind. Such a man is not malleable; he may be mistaken, he may be fooledin a given instance, but he is inflexible in regard to the absolutism ofreality, i.e., in seeking and demanding truth....There is only one source of authentic self-confidence: reason.[Ibid., 182.] The attack k on “selfishness” is an attack on man’s self-esteem; to surrenderone, is to surrender the other.[“Introduction,” VOS, xv; pb xi.] Honor is self-esteem made visible in action.[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 12; pb 10.] To love is to value. Only a rationally selfish man, a man of self esteeni, iscapable of love—because he is the only man capable of holding firm, consistent,uncompromising, unbetrayed values. The man who does not value himself, cannotvalue anything or anyone.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 29; pb 32.]See also ALTRUISM; FREE WILL; HUMILITY; LOVE; MENTAL HEALTH; PRIDE; PSYCHOLOGY;REASON; SACRIFICE; SELF; SELFISHNESS; SEX; VALUES. Self-Evident. Nothing is self-evident except the material of sensory perception.[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 15; pb 13.] When we speak of “direct perception” or “direct awareness,” we mean theperceptual level. Percepts, not sensations, are the given, the self-evident. Theknowledge of sensations as components of percepts is not direct, it is acquiredby man much later: it is a scientific, conceplual discovery.[ITOE, 5.] See also AXIOMS; COROLLARIES; OSTENSIVE DEFINITION; PERCEPTION; PROOF;SENSATIONS; VALIDATION. Self-Interest. Just as man cannot survive by any random means, but must discoverand practice the principles which his survival requires, so man’s self-interestcannot be determined by blind desires or random whims, but must be discoveredand achieved by the guidance of rational principles. This is why the Objectivistethics is a morality of rational self-interest—or of rational selfishness.[“Introduction,” VOS, xiv; pb x.]When one speaks of man’s right to exist for his own sake, for his own rationalself-interest, most people assume automatically that this means his right tosacrifice others. Such an assumption is a confession of their own belief that toinjure, enslave, rob or murder others is in man’s self-interest—which he mustselflessly renounce. The idea that man’s self-interest can be served only by anon-sacrificial relationship with others has never occurred to thosehumanitarian apostles of unselfishness, who proclaim their desire to achieve thebrotherhood of men. And it will not occur to them, or to anyone, so long as theconcept “rational” is omitted from the context of “values,” “desires,”“self-interest” and ethics.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 28; pb 30.] The term “interests” is a wide abstraction that covers the entire field ofethics. It includes the issues of: man’s values, his desires, his goals andtheir actual achievement in reality. A man’s “interests” depend on the kind ofgoals he chooses to pursue, his choice of goals depends on his desires, hisdesires depend on his values—and, for a rational man, his values depend on thejudgment of his mind.Desires (or feelings or emotions or wishes or whims) are not tools of cognition;they are not a valid standard of value, nor a valid criterion of man’sinterests. The mere fact that a man desires something does not constitute aproof that the object of his desire is good, nor that its achievement isactually to his interest.To claim that a man’s interests are sacrificed whenever a desire of his isfrustrated—is to hold a subjectivist view of man’s values and interests. Whichmeans: to believe that it is proper, moral and possible for man to achieve hisgoals, regardless of whether they contradict the facts of reality or not. Whichmeans: to hold an irrational or mystical view of existence. Which means: todeserve no further consideration.[“The ‘Conflicts’ of Men’s Interests,” VOS, 57; pb 50.] See also EMOTIONS; GOOD, the; LIFE; MORALITY; OBJECTIVISM; PRINCIPLES;RATIONALITY; SACRIFICE; SELFISHNESS; SELFLESSNESS; VALUES. Selfishness. The Objectivist ethics proudly advocates and upholds rationalselfishness—which means: the values required for man’s survival qua man—whichmeans: the values required for human survival—not the values produced by thedesires, the emotions, the “aspirations,” the feelings, the whims or the needsof irrational brutes, who have never outgrown the primordial practice of humansacrifices, have never discovered an industrial society and can conceive of noself-interest but that of grabbing the loot of the moment.The Objectivist ethics holds that human good does not require human sacrificesand cannot be achieved by the sacrifice of anyone to anyone. It holds that therational interests of men do not clash—that there is no conflict of interestsamong men who do not desire the unearned, who do not make sacrifices nor acceptthem, who deal with one another as traders, giving value for value.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 28; pb 31.] The meaning ascribed in popular usage to the word “selfishness” is not merelywrong: it represents a devastating intellectual “package-deal,” which isresponsible, more than any other single factor, for the arrested moraldevelopment of mankind.In popular usage, the word “selfishness” is a synonym of evil; the image itconjures is of a murderous brute who tramples over piles of corpses to achievehis own ends, who cares for no living being and pursues nothing but thegratification of the mindless whims of any immediate moment.Yet the exact meaning and dictionary definition of the word “selfishness” is:concern with one’s own interests.This concept does not include a moral evaluation; it does not tell us whetherconcern with one’s own interests is good or evil; nor does it tell us whatconstitutes man’s actual interests. It is the task of ethics to answer suchquestions.[“Introduction,” VOS, ix; pb vii.]There is a fundamental moral difference between a man who sees his self-interestin production and a man who sees it in robbery. The evil of a robber does notlie in the fact that he pursues his own interests, but in what he regards as tohis own interest; not in the fact that he pursues his values, but in what hechose to value; not in the fact that he wants to live, but in the fact that hewants to live on a subhuman level (see “The Objectivist Ethics”).If it is true that what I mean by “selfishness” is not what is meantconventionally, then this is one of the worst indictments of altruism: it meansthat altruism permits no concept of a self-respecting, self-supporting man—a manwho supports his life by his own effort and neither sacrifices himself norothers. It means that altruism permits no view of men except as sacrificialanimals and profiteers-on-sacrifice, as victims and parasites—that it permits noconcept of a benevolent co-existence among men—that it permits no concept ofjustice.[Ibid., xii; pb ix.] To redeem both man and morality, it is the concept of “selfishness” that one hasto redeem.The first step is to assert man’s right to a moral existence—that is: torecognize his need of a moral code to guide the course and the fulfillment ofhis own life....The reasons why man needs a moral code will tell you that the purpose ofmorality is to define man’s proper values and interests, that concern with hisown interests is the essence of a moral existence, and that man must be thebeneficiary of his own moral actions.Since all values have to be gained and/or kept by men’s actions, any breachbetween actor and beneficiary necessitates an injustice: the sacrifice of somemen to others, of the actors to the nonactors, of the moral to the immoral.Nothing could ever justify such a breach, and no one ever has.The choice of the beneficiary of moral values is merely a preliminary orintroductory issue in the field of morality. It is not a substitute for moralitynor a criterion of moral value, as altruism has made it. Neither is it a moralprimary: it has to be derived from and validated by the fundamental premises ofa moral system.The Objectivist ethics holds that the actor must always be the beneficiary ofhis action and that man must act for his own rational self-interest. But hisright to do so is derived from his nature as man and from the function of moralvalues in human life—and, therefore, is applicable only in the context of arational, objectively demonstrated and validated code of moral principles whichdefine and determine his actual self-interest. It is not a license “to do as hepleases” and it is not applicable to the altruists’ image of a “selfish” brutenor to any man motivated by irrational emotions, feelings, urges, wishes orwhims.This is said as a warning against the kind of “Nietzschean egoists” who, infact, are a product of the altruist morality and represent the other side of thealtruist coin: the men who believe that any action, regardless of its nature, isgood if it is intended for one’s own benefit. Just as the satisfaction of theirrational desires of others is not a criterion of moral value, neither is thesatisfaction of one’s own irrational desires. Morality is not a contest of whims...A similar type of error is committed by the man who declares that since man mustbe guided by his own independent judgment, any action he chooses to take ismoral if he chooses it. One’s own independent judgment is the means by which onemust choose one’s actions, but it is not a moral criterion nor a moralvalidation: only reference to a demonstrable principle can validate one’schoices.Just as man cannot survive by any random means, but must discover and practicethe principles which his survival requires, so man’s self-interest cannot bedetermined by blind desires or random whims, but must be discovered and achievedby the guidance of rational principles. This is why the Objectivist ethics is amorality of rational self-interest—or of rational selfishness.Since selfishness is “concern with one’s own interests,” the Objectivist ethicsuses that concept in its exact and purest sense. It is not a concept that onecan surrender to man’s enemies, nor to the unthinking misconceptions,distortions, prejudices and fears of the ignorant and the irrational. The attackon “selfishness” is an attack on man’s self-esteem; to surrender one, is tosurrender the other.[Ibid., xiii; pb ix.] Do you ask what moral obligation I owe to my fellow men? None—except theobligation I owe to myself, to material objects and to all of existence:rationality. I deal with men as my nature and theirs demands: by means ofreason. I seek or desire nothing from them except such relations as they care toenter of their own voluntary choice. It is only with their mind that I can dealand only for my own self-interest, when they see that my interest coincides withtheirs. When they don’t, I enter no relationship; I let dissenters go their wayand I do not swerve from mine. I win by means of nothing but logic and Isurrender to nothing but logic. I do not surrender my reason or deal with menwho surrender theirs.[GS, FNI, 163; pb 133.] Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness theideal of virtue. But the creator is the egoist in the absolute sense, and theselfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge or act. These arefunctions of the self.Here the basic reversal is most deadly. The issue has been perverted and man hasbeen left no alternative—and no freedom. As poles of good and evil, he wasoffered two conceptions: egoism and altruism. Egoism was held to mean thesacrifice of others to self. Altruism—the sacrifice of self to others. This tiedman irrevocably to other men and left him nothing but a choice of pain: his ownpain borne for the sake of others or pain inflicted upon others for the sake ofself. When it was added that man must find joy in self-immolation, the trap wasclosed. Man was forced to accept masochism as his ideal—under the threat thatsadism was his only alternative. This was the greatest fraud ever perpetrated onmankind.This was the device by which dependence and suffering were perpetuated asfundamentals of life.The choice is not self-sacrifice or domination. The choice is independence ordependence. The code of the creator or the code of the second-hander. This isthe basic issue. It rests upon the alternative of life or death. The code of thecreator is built on the needs of the reasoning mind which allows man to survive.The code of the second-hander is built on the needs of a mind incapable ofsurvival. All that which proceeds from man’s independent ego is good. All thatwhich proceeds from man’s dependence upon men is evil.The egoist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifices others. He is theman who stands above the need of using others in any manner. He does notfunction through them. He is not concerned with them in any primary matter. Notin his aim, not in his motive, not in his thinking, not in his desires, not inthe source of his energy. He does not exist for any other man—and he asks noother man to exist for him. This is the only form of brotherhood and mutualrespect possible between men. [“The Soul of an Individualist,” FNI, 94; pb 81.] The moral purpose of a man’s life is the achievement of his own happiness. Thisdoes not mean that he is indifferent to all men, that human life is of no valueto him and that he has no reason to help others in an emergency. But it doesmean that he does not subordinate his life to the welfare of others, that hedoes not sacrifice himself to their needs, that the relief of their suffering isnot his primary concern, that any help he gives is an exception, not a rule, anact of generosity, not of moral duty, that it is marginal and incidental—asdisasters are marginal and incidental in the course of human existence—and thatvalues, not disasters, are the goal, the first concern and the motive power ofhis life.[“The Ethics of Emergencies,” VOS, 55; pb 49.] Love, friendship, respect, admiration are the emotional response of one man tothe virtues of another, the spiritual payment given in exchange for thepersonal, selfish pleasure which one man derives from the virtues of anotherman’s character. Only a brute or an altruist would claim that the appreciationof another person’s virtues is an act of selflessness, that as far as one’s ownselfish interest and pleasure are concerned, it makes no difference whether onedeals with a genius or a fool, whether one meets a hero or a thug, whether onemarries an ideal woman or a slut. In spiritual issues, a trader is a man whodoes not seek to be loved for his weaknesses or flaws, only for his virtues, andwho does not grant his love to the weaknesses or the flaws of others, only totheir virtues.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 29; pb 31.] The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man’s first duty is tohimself. His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons ofothers. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes, provided his wish does notdepend primarily upon other men. This includes the whole sphere of his creativefaculty, his thinking, his work. But it does not include the sphere of thegangster, the altruist and the dictator.A man thinks and works alone. A man cannot rob, exploit or rule—alone. Robbery,exploitation and ruling presuppose victims. They imply dependence. They are theprovince of the second-hander.Rulers of men are not egoists. They create nothing. They exist entirely throughthe persons of others. Their goal is in their subjects, in the activity ofenslaving. They are as dependent as the beggar, the social worker and thebandit. The form of dependence does not matter.[“The Soul of an Individualist,” FNI, 96; pb 82.]See also ALTRUISM; AMORALISM; CAPITALISM; CHARITY; COLLECTIVISM; CREATORS;“DUTY”; EMOTIONS; GOOD, the; HAPPINESS; INDEPENDENCE; INDIVIDUALISM; LIFE; LOVE;MAN; MORALITY; NIETZSCHE,FRIEDRICH; “PACKAGE-DEALING,”FALLACY of; PRIDE;PRODUCTIVENESS; RATIONALITY; REASON; RESPONSIBILITY/ OBLIGATION; SACRIFICE;SECOND-HANDERS; SELF; SELF-ESTEEM; SELF-INTEREST; SELFLESSNESS; STANDARD OFVALUE; TRADER PRINCIPLE; VALUES; VIRTUE; WHIMS/WHIM-WORSHIP. Selflessness. Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, andselflessness the ideal of virtue. But the creator is the egoist in the absolutesense, and the selfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge or act.These are functions of the self.[“The Soul of an Individualist,” FNI, 94; pb 81.] [Peter Keating is] paying the price and wondering for what sin and tellinghimself that he’s been too selfish. In what act or thought of his has there everbeen a self? What was his aim in life? Greatness—in other people’s eyes. Fame,admiration, envy—all that which comes from others. Others dictated hisconvictions, which he did not hold, but he was satisfied that others believed heheld them. Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn’t want tobe great, but to be thought great. He didn’t want to build, but to be admired asa builder. He borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others.There’s your actual selflessness. It’s his ego that he’s betrayed and given up.But everybody calls him selfish....Isn’t that the root of every despicable action? Not selfishness, but preciselythe absence of a self. Look at them. The man who cheats and lies, but preservesa respectable front. He knows himself to be dishonest, but others think he’shonest and he derives his self-respect from that, second-hand. The man who takescredit for an achievement which is not his own. He knows himself to be mediocre,but he’s great in the eyes of others. The frustrated wretch who professes lovefor the inferior and clings to those less endowed, in order to establish his ownsuperiority by comparison.[“The Nature of the Second-Hander,” FNI, 78; pb 68.] When you are in love, it means that the person you love is of great personal,selfish importance to you and to your life. If you were selfless, it would haveto mean that you derive no personal pleasure or happiness from the company andthe existence of the person you love, and that you are motivated only byself-sacrificial pity for that person’s need of you. I don’t have to point outto you that no one would be flattered by, nor would accept, a concept of thatkind. Love is not self-sacrifice, but the most profound assertion of your ownneeds and values. It is for your own happiness that you need the person youlove, and that is the greatest compliment, the greatest tribute you can pay tothat person.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 7.] See also ALTRUISM; LOVE; SECOND-HANDERS; SELF: SELFISHNESS; SELF-ESTEEM. Self-Sacrifice. See Altruism; Sacrifice; Selflessness. Sensations. The lower of the conscious species possess only the faculty ofsensation, which is sufficient to direct their actions and provide for theirneeds. A sensation is produced by the automatic reaction of a sense organ to astimulus from the outside world; it lasts for the duration of the immediatemoment, as long as the stimulus lasts and no longer. Sensations are an automaticresponse, an automatic form of knowledge, which a consciousness can neither seeknor evade. An organism that possesses only the faculty of sensation is guided bythe pleasure-pain mechanism of its body....The higher organisms possess a much more potent form of consciousness: theypossess the faculty of retaining sensations, which is the faculty of perception.A “perception” is a group of sensations automatically retained and integrated bythe brain of a living organism, which gives it the ability to be aware, not ofsingle stimuli, but of entities, of things. An animal is guided, not merely byimmediate sensations, but by percepts. Its actions are not single, discreteresponses to single, separate stimuli, but are directed by an integratedawareness of the peyreptual reality confronting it.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 9; pb 18.]Although, chronologically, man’s consciousness develops in three stages: thestage of sensations, the perceptual, the conceptual—epistemologically, the baseof all of man’s knowledge is the perceptual stage.Sensations, as such, are not retained in man’s memory, nor is man able toexperience a pure isolated sensation. As far as can be ascertained, an infant’ssensory experience is an undifferentiated chaos. Discriminated awareness beginson the level of percepts....Percepts, not sensations, are the given, the self-evident. The knowledge ofsensations as components of percepts is not direct, it is acquired by man muchlater: it is a scientific, conceptual discovery ...(It may be supposed that the concept “existent” is implicit even on the level ofsensations—if and to the extent that a consciousness is able to discriminate onthat level. A sensation is a sensation of something, as distinguished from thenothing of the preceding and succeeding moments. A sensation does not tell manwhat exists, but only that it exists.)[ITOF,5.] Sensations are the primary material of consciousness and, therefore, cannot becommunicated by means of the material which is derived from them. Theexistential causes of sensations can be described and defined in conceptualterms (e.g., the wavelengths of light and the structure of the human eye, whichproduce the sensations of color), but one cannot communicate what color is like,to a person who is born blind. To define the meaning of the concept “blue,” forinstance, one must point to some blue objects to signify, in effect: “I meanthis.” Such an identification of a concept is known as an “ostensivedefinition.”[Ibid.. 53.1 See also CONCEPTS; ENTITY; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); OSTENSIVE DEFINITION;PERCEPTION; PLEASURE AND PAIN. Sense of Life. A sense of life is a pre-conceptual equivalent of metaphysics, anemotional, subconsciously integrated appraisal of man and of existence. It setsthe nature of a man’s emotional responses and the essence of his character.Long before he is old enough to grasp such a concept as metaphysics, man makeschoices, forms value-judgments, experiences emotions and acquires a certainimplicit view of life. Every choice and value-judgment implies some estimate ofhimself and of the world around him—most particularly, of his capacity to dealwith the world. He may draw conscious conclusions, which may be true or false;or he may remain mentally passive and merely react to events (i.e.. merelyfeel). Whatever the case may be, his subconscious mechanism sums up hispsychological activities, integrating his conclusions, reactions or evasionsinto an emotional sum that establishes a habitual pattern and becomes hisautomatic response to the world around him. What began as a series of single,discreet conclusions (or evasions) about his own particular problems, becomes ageneralized feeling about existence, an implicit metaphysics with the compellingmotivational power of a constant, basic emotion—an emotion which is part of allhis other emotions and underlies all his experiences. This is a sense of life.[“Philosophy and Sense of Life,” RM, 31; pb 25.] If one saw, in real life, a beautiful woman wearing an exquisite evening gown,with a cold sore on her lips, the blemish would mean nothing but a minoraffliction, and one would ignore it.But a painting of such a woman would be a corrupt, obscenely vicious attack onman, on beauty, on all values—and one would experience a feeling of immensedisgust and indignation at the artist. (There are also those who would feelsomething like approval and who would belong to the same moral category as theartist.)The emotional response to that painting would be instantaneous, much faster thanthe viewer’s mind could identify all the reasons involved. The psychologicalmechanism which produces that response (and which produced the painting) is aman’s sense of life.(A sense of life is a pre-conceptual equivalent of metaphysics, an emotional,subconsciously integrated appraisal of man and of existence.)It is the artist’s sense of life that controls and integrates his work,directing the innumerable choices he has to make, from the choice of subject tothe strbtlest details of style. It is the viewer’s or reader’s sense of lifethat responds to a work of art by a complex, yet automatic reaction ofacceptance and approval, or rejection and condemnation.This does not mean that a sense of life is a valid criterion of esthetic merit,either for the artist or the viewer. A sense of life is not infallible. But asense of life is the source of art, the psychological mechanism which enablesman to create a realm such as art.The emotion involved in art is not an emotion in the ordinary meaning of theterm. It is experienced more as a “sense” or a “feel,” but it has twocharacteristics pertaining to emotions: it is automatically immediate and it hasan intense, profoundly personal (yet undefined) value-meaning to the individualexperiencing it. The value involved is life, and the words naming the emotionare: “This is what life means to me.”Regardless of the nature or content of an artist’s metaphysical views, what anart work expresses, fundamentally, under all of its lesser aspects is: “This islife as I see it.” ‘The essential meaning of a viewer’s or reader’s response,under all of its lesser elements, is: “This is (or is not) life as I see it.”[“Art and Sense of Life,” RM, 43; pb 34.] A sense of life is formed by a process of emotional generalization which may bedescribed as a subconscious counterpart of a process of abstraction, since it isa method of classifying and integrating. But it is a process of emotionalabstraction: it consists of classifying things according to the emotions theyinvoke—i.e., of tying together, by association or connotation, all those thingswhich have the power to make an individual experience the same (or a similar)emotion. For instance: a new neighborhood, a discovery, adventure, struggle,triumph—or: the folks next door, a memorized recitation, a family picnic, aknown routine, comfort. On a more adult level: a heroic man, the skyline of NewYork, a sunlit landscape, pure colors, ecstatic music—or: a humble man, an oldvillage, a foggy landscape, muddy colors, folk music.... The subverbal,subconscious criterion of selection that forms his emotional abstractions is:“That which is important to me” or: “The kind of universe which is right for me,in which I would feel at home.”, . . .It is only those values which he regards or grows to regard as “important,”those which represent his implicit view of reality, that remain in a man’ssubconscious and form his sense of life.“It is important to understand things”—“tt is important to obey my parents”—“Itis important to act on my own”—“It is important to please other people”—“It isimportant to fight for what I want”—“It is important not to make enemies”—“Mylife is important”—“Who am I to stick my neck out?” Man is a being of self-madesoul—and it is of such conclusions that the stuff of his soul is made. (By“soul” I mean “consciousness.”)The integrated sum of a man’s basic values is his sense of life.[“Philosophy and Sense of Life,” RM, 33; pb 27.] A given person’s sense of life is hard to identify conceptually, because it ishard to isolate: it is involved in everything about that person, in his everythought, emotion, action, in his every response, in his every choice and value,in his every spontaneous gesture, in his manner of moving, talking, smiling, inthe total of his personality. It is that which makes him a “personality.”Introspectively, one’s own sense of life is experienced as an absolute and anirreducible primary—as that which one never questions, because the thought ofquestioning it never arises. Extrospectively, the sense of life of anotherperson strikes one as an immediate, yet undefinable, impression—on very shortacquaintance—an impression which often feels like certainty, yet isexasperatingly elusive, if one attempts to verify it.This leads many people to regard a sense of life as the province of some sort ofspecial intuition, as a matter perceivable only by some special, non-rationalinsight. The exact opposite is true: a sense of life is not an irreducibleprimary, but a very complex sum; it can be felt, but it cannot be understood, byan automatic reaction; to be understood, it has to be analyzed, identified andverified conceptually. That automatic impression—of oneself or of others—is onlya lead; left untranslated, it can be a very deceptive lead. But if and when thatintangible impression is supported by and unites with the conscious judgment ofone’s mind, the result is the most exultant form of certainty one can everexperience : it is the integration of mind and values.There are two aspects of man’s existence which are the special province andexpression of his sense of life: love and art.[Ibid., 39; pb 31.] A culture, like an individual, has a sense of life or, rather, the equivalent ofa sense of life—an emotional atmosphere created by its dominant philosophy, byits view of man and of existence. This emotional atmosphere represents aculture’s dominant values and serves as the leitmotif of a given age, settingits trends and its style.Thus Western civilization had an Age of Reason and an Age of Enlightenment. Inthose periods, the quest for reason and enlightenment was the dominantintellectual drive and created a corresponding emotional atmosphere thatfostered these values.Today, we live in the Age of Envy.[“The Age of Envy,” NL, 152.] A nation’s sense of life is formed by every individual child’s early impressionsof the world around him: of the ideas he is taught (which he may or may notaccept) and of the way of acting he observes and evaluates (which he mayevaluate correctly or not). And although there are exceptions at both ends ofthe psychological spectrum—men whose sense of life is better (truerphilosophically) or worse than that of their fettow-citizens—the majoritydevelop the essentials of the same subconscious philosophy. This is the sourceof what we observe as “national characteristics.” ...Just as an individual’s sense of life can be better or worse than his consciousconvictions, so can a nation’s. And just as an individual who has nevertranslated his sense of life into conscious convictions is in terrible danger—nomatter how good his subconscious vatues—so is a nation.This is the position of America today.If America is to be saved from destruction—specincatiy, from dictatorship—shewill be saved by her sense of life.[“Don’t Let It Go,” PWNI, 251; pb 206.] A sense of life is not a substitute for explicit knowledge. Values which onecannot identify, but merely senses implicitly, are not in one’s control. Onecannot tell what they depend on or require, what course of action is needed togain and/or keep them. One can lose or betray them without knowing it.[Ibid., 256; pb 210.]See also AMERICA; ART; ARTISTIC CREATION; BENEVOLENT UNIVERSE PREMISE; EMOTIONS;ENLIGHTENMENT, AGE OF; ENVY/ HATRED of the GOOD for BEING the GOOD; ESTHETICABSTRACTIONS; ESTHETIC JUDGMENT; LOVE; MALEVOLENT UNIVERSE PREMISE; METAPHYSICALVALUE-JUDGMENTS; METAPHYSICS; PHILOSOPHY; SEX; SUBCONSCIOUS. Service. The concept of “service” has been turned into a collectivist“package-deal” by means of a crude equivocation and a cruder evasion. In thelanguage of economics, the word “service” means work offered for trade on a freemarket, to be paid for by those who choose to buy it. In a free society, mendeal with one another by voluntary, uncoerced exchange, by mutual consent tomutual profit, each man pursuing his own rational self-interest, nonesacrificing himself or others; and all values—whether goods or services—aretraded, not given away.This is the opposite of what the word “service” means in the language ofaltruist ethics: to an altruist, “service” means unrewarded, self-sacrificial,unilateral giving, while receiving nothing in return. It is this sort ofselfless “service” to “society” that collectivists demand of all men.

Sex is a physical capacity, but its exercise is determined by man’s mind—byhis choice of values, held consciously or subconsciously. To a rational man, sexis an expression of self-esteem—a celebration of himself and of existence. Tothe man who lacks self-esteem, sex is an attempt to fake it, to acquire itsmomentary illusion.Romantic love, in the full sense of the term, is an emotion possible only to theman (or woman) of unbreached self-esteem: it is his response to his own highestvalues in the person of another—an integrated response of mind and body, of loveand sexual desire. Such a man (or woman) is incapable of experiencing a sexualdesire divorced from spiritual values.[“Of Living Death,” TO, Oct. 1968, 2.] Just as an idea unexpressed in physical action is contemptible hypocrisy, so isplatonic love—and just as physical action unguided by an idea is a fool’sself-fraud, so is sex when cut off from one’s code of values.... Only the manwho extols the purity of a love devoid of desire, is capable of the depravity ofa desire devoid of love.[“The Meaning of Sex,” FNI, 120; pb 100.] The man who despises himself tries to gain self-esteem from sexualadventures—which can’t be done, because sex is not the cause, but an effect andan expression of a man’s sense of his own value ...The men who think that wealth comes from material resources and has nointellectual root or meaning, are the men who think—for the same reason—that sexis a physical capacity which functions independently of one’s mind, choice orcode of values. They think that your body creates a desire and makes a choicefor you—just about in some such way as if iron ore transformed itself intorailroad rails of its own volition. Love is blind, they say; sex is imperviousto reason and mocks the power of all philosophers. But, in fact, a man’s sexualchoice is the result and the sum of his fundamental convictions. Tell me what aman finds sexually attractive and I will tell you his entire philosophy of life.Show me the woman he sleeps with and I will tell you his valuation of himself.No matter what corruption he’s taught about the virtue of selflessness, sex isthe most profoundly selfish of all acts, an act which he cannot perform for anymotive but his own enjoyment—just try to think of performing it in a spirit ofselfless charity!—an act which is not possible in self-abasement, only inself-exaltation, only in the confidence $of being desired and being worthy ofdesire. It is an act that forces him to stand naked in spirit, as well as inbody, and to accept his real ego as his standard of value. He will always beattracted to the woman who reflects his deepest vision of himself, the womanwhose surrender permits him to experience—or to fake—a sense of self-esteem....Love is our response to our highest values—and can be nothing else.[Ibid., 118; pb 99.] The doctrine that man’s sexual capacity belongs to a lower or animal part of hisnature ... is the necessary consequence of the doctrine that man is not anintegrated entity, but a being torn apart by two opposite, $antagonistic,irreconcilable elements; his body, which is of this earth, and his soul, whichis of another, supernatural realm. According to that doctrine, man’s sexualcapacity—regardless of how it is exercised or motivated, not merely its abuses,not unfastidious indulgence or promiscuity, but the capacity as such—is sinfulor depraved.[“Of Living Death,” TO, Sept. 1968, 1.] Sex is one of the most important aspects of man’s life and, therefore, mustnever be approached lightly or casually. A sexual relationship is proper only onthe ground of the highest values one can find in a human being. Sex must not beanything other than a response to values. And that is why I consider promiscuityimmoral. Not because sex is evil, but because sex is too good and tooimportant....[Sex should) involve ... a very serious relationship. Whether that relationshipshould or should not become a marriage is a question which depends on thecircumstances and the context of the two persons’ lives. I consider marriage avery important institution, but it is important when and if two people havefound the person with whom they wish to spend the rest of their lives—questionof which no man or woman can be automatically certain. When one is certain thatone’s choice is final, then marriage is, of course, a desirable state. But thisdoes not mean that any relationship based on less than total certainty isimproper. I think the question of an affair or a marriage depends on theknowledge and the position of the two persons involved and should be left up tothem. Either is moral, provided only that both parties take the relationshipseriously and that it is based on values.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 8.]See also ABORTION; BIRTH CONTROL; EMOTIONS; FEMININITY; FREUD; LOVE; MARRIAGE;PHILOSOPHY; RELIGION; SELF-ESTEEM; SELFISHNESS; SENSE of LIFE; SOUL-BODYDICHOTOMY; VALUES. Similarity. The element of similarity is crucially involved in the formation ofevery concept; similarity, in this context, is the relationship between two ormore existents which possess the same characteristic(s), but in differentmeasure or degree....Similarity is grasped perceptually; in observing it, man is not and does nothave to be aware of the fact that it involves a matter of measurement. It is thetask of philosophy and of science to identify that fact.[ITOE, 15.] See also CONCEPT-FORMATlON; MEASUREMENT; PERCEPTION.Singing. See Performing Arts.Skepticism. “We know that we know nothing,” they chatter, blanking out the factthat they are claiming knowledge—“There are no absolutes,” they chatter,blanking out the fact that they are uttering an absolute—“You cannot prove thatyou exist or that you’re conscious,” they chatter, blanking out the fact thatproof presupposes existence, consciousness and a complex chain of knowledge: theexistence of something to know, of a consciousness able to know it, and of aknowledge that has learned to distinguish between such concepts as the provedand the unproved.[GS, FNI, 192; pb 154.] In the history of philosophy—with some very rare exceptions—epistemologicaltheories have ... taught either that knowledge is impossible (skepticism) orthat it is available without effort (mysticism). These two positions appear tobe antagonists, but are, in fact, two variants on the same theme, two sides ofthe same fraudulent coin: the attempt to escape the responsibility of rationalcognition and the absolutism of reality—the attempt to assert the primacy ofconsciousness over existence....The mystic is usually an exponent of the intrinsic (revealed) school ofepistemology; the skeptic is usually an advocate of epistemologicalsubjectivism.[ITOE, 105.] The crusading skepticism of the modern era; the mounting attack on absolutes,certainty, reason itself; the insistence that firm convictions are a disease andthat compromise in any dispute is men’s only recourse—all this, in significantpart, is an outgrowth of Descartes’ basic approach to philosophy. To reclaim theself-confidence of man’s mind, the first modern to refute is Kant (seeIntroduction to Objectivist Epistemology); the second is Descartes.Observe that Descartes starts his system by using “error” and its synonyms orderivatives as “stolen concepts.”Men have been wrong, and therefore, he implies, they can never know what isright. But if they cannot, how did they ever discover that they were wrong? Howcan one form such concepts as “mistake” or “error” while wholly ignorant of whatis correct? “Error” signifies a departure from truth; the concept of “error”logically presupposes that one has already grasped some truth. If truth wereunknowable, as Descartes implies, the idea of a departure from it would bemeaningless.The same point applies to concepts denoting specific forms of error. If wecannot ever be certain that an argument is logically valid, if validity isunknowable, then the concept of “invalid” reasoning is impossible to reach orapply. If we cannot ever know that a man is sane, then the concept of “insanity”is impossible to form or define. If we cannot recognize the state of beingawake, then we cannot recognize or conceptualize a state of not being awake(such as dreaming). If man cannot grasp X, then “non-X” stands for nothing.Fallibility does not make knowledge impossible. Knowledge is what makes possiblethe discovery of fallibility.(Leonard Peikoff, “ ‘Maybe You’re Wrong,’ ” TOF, April 1981, 8.] It is possible, the skeptic argument declares, for man to be in error;therefore, it is possible that every individual is in error on every question.This argument is a non sequitur; it is an equivocation on the term “possible.”What is possible to a species under some circumstances, is not necessarilypossible to every individual member of that species under every set ofcircumstances. Thus, it is possible for a human being to run the mile in lessthan four minutes; and it is possible for a human being to be pregnant. Icannot, however, go over to a crippled gentleman in his wheelchair and say:“Perhaps you’ll give birth to a son next week, after you’ve run the mile to thehospital in 3.9 minutes—after all, you’re human, and it is possible for humanbeings to do these things.”The same principle applies to the possibility of error—or of truth. If someonemaintains that New York City is made of mushroom soup, he cannot defend his ideaby saying: “It is possible for human beings to reach the truth. I am human, somaybe this is the truth.” No matter what is possible under some conditions, aman cannot be “possibly” right when he is blatantly wrong. By the same token, noskeptic can declare that you are possibly wrong, when you are blatantly right.“It is possible for- man...” does not justify “It is possible that you . . .”The latter claim depends on the individual involved, and on the conditions.“Maybe you’re wrong” is an accusation that must be supported by specificevidence. It cannot be uttered without context, grounds, or basis, i.e.,arbitrarily.[Ibid., 10.] Doubting without a basis is the equivalent of—is indeed a form of—assertingwithout a basis. Both procedures, being arbitrary, are disqualified by the verynature of human cognition. In reason, certainty must precede doubt, just as agrasp of truth must precede the detection of error. To establish a claim toknowledge, what one must do is to prove an idea positively, on the basis of thefull context of evidence available; i.e., a man must prove that he is right. Itis not incumbent on anyone—nor is it possible—to prove that he is not wrong,when no evidence of error has been offered.[Ibid., 12.] See also ABSOLUTES; AGNOSTICISM; ARBITRARY; AXIOMS; CERTAINTY; CONTEXT;EPISTEMOLOGY; FALSEHOOD; KANT, IMMANUEL; MYSTICISM; “OPEN MIND” and “CLOSEDMIND”; PERCEPTION; POSSIBLE; PROOF; REASON; SELF-EVIDENT; “STOLEN CONCEPT,”FALLACY of; SUBJECTIVISM; TRUTH. Social System. A social system is a set of moral-political-economic principlesembodied in a society’s laws, institutions, and government, which determine therelationships, the terms of association, among the men living in a givengeographical area. It is obvious that these terms and relationships depend on anidentification of man’s nature, that they would be different if they pertain toa society of rational beings or to a colony of ants. It is obvious that theywill be radically different if men deal with one another as free, independentindividuals, on the premise that every man is an end in himself—or as members ofa pack, each regarding the others as the means to his ends and to the ends of“the pack as a whole.”There are only two fundamental questions (or two aspects of the same question)that determine the nature of any social system: Does a social system recognizeindividual rights?—and: Does a social system ban physical force from humanrelationships? The answer to the second question is the practical implementationof the answer to the first.. [“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 18.] A social system is a code of laws which men observe in order to live together.Such a code must have a basic principle, a starting point, or it cannot bedevised. The starting point is the question: Is the power of society limited orunlimited?Individualism answers: The power of society is limited by the inalienable,individual rights of man. Society may make only such laws as do not violatethese rights.Collectivism answers: The power of society is unlimited. Society may make anylaws it wishes, and force them upon anyone in any manner it wishes.[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet, 3.]See also CAPITALISM; COLLECTIVISM; GOVERNMENT; IDEOLOGY; INDIVIDUALISM;MORALITY; POLITICS; SOCIETY.Social Theory of Ethics. The social theory of ethics substitutes “society” forGod—and although it claims that its chief concern is life on earth, it is notthe life of man, not the life of an individual, but the life of a disembodiedentity, the collective, which, in relation to every individual, consists ofeverybody except himself. As far as the individual is concerned, his ethicalduty is to be the selfless, voiceless, rightless slave of any need, claim ordemand asserted by others. The motto “dog eat dog”—which is not applicable tocapitalism nor to dogs—is applicable to the social theory of ethics. Theexistential monuments to this theory are Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 33; pb 34.] The avowed mystics held the arbitrary, unaccountable “will of God” as thestandard of the good and as the validation of their ethics. The neomysticsreplaced it with “the good of society,” thus collapsing into the circularity ofa definition such as “the standard of the good is that which is good forsociety.” This meant, in logic—and, today, in worldwide practice—that “society”stands above any principles of ethics, since it is the source, standard andcriterion of ethics, since “the good” is whatever it wills, whatever it happensto assert as its own welfare and pleasure. This meant that “society” may doanything it pleases, since “the good” is whatever it chooses to do because itchooses to do it. And—since there is no such entity as “society,” since societyis only a number of individual men—this meant that some men (the majority or anygang that claims to be its spokesman) are ethically entitled to pursue any whims(or any atrocities) they desire to pursue, while other men are ethically obligedto spend their lives in the service of that gang’s desires.[Ibid., 3; pb 14.] See also GOD; GOOD, the; INDIVIDUALISM; INTRINSIC THEORY of VALUES: MORALITY;MYSTICAL ETHICS; OBJECTIVE THEORY of VALUES; SOCIETY; STANDARD of VALUE;STATISM; VALUES. Socialism. Socialism is the doctrine that man has no right to exist for his ownsake, that his life and his work do not belong to him, but belong to society,that the only justification of his existence is his service to society, and thatsociety may dispose of him in any way it pleases for the sake of whatever itdeems to be its own tribal, collective good.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 48; pb 43.] The essential characteristic of socialism is the denial of individual propertyrights; under socialism, the right to property (which is the right of use anddisposal) is vested in “society as a whole,” i.e., in the collective, withproduction and distribution controlled by the state, i.e., by the government.Socialism may be established by force, as in the Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics—or by vote, as in Nazi (National Socialist) Germany. The degree ofsocialization may be total, as in Russia—or partial, as in England.Theoretically, the differences are superficial; practically, they are only amatter of time. The basic principle, in all cases, is the same.The alleged goals of socialism were: the abolition of poverty, the achievementof general prosperity, progress, peace and human brotherhood. The results havebeen a terrifying failure—terrifying, that is, if one’s motive is men’s welfare.Instead of prosperity, socialism has brought economic paralysis and/ or collapseto every country that tried it. The degree of socialization has been the degreeof disaster. The consequences have varied accordingly.[“The Monument Builders,” VOS, 112; pb 86.] There is no difference between the principles, policies and practical results ofsocialism—and those of any historical or prehistorical tyranny. Socialism ismerely democratic absolute monarchy—that is, a system of absolutism without afixed head, open to seizure of power by all comers, by any ruthless climber,opportunist, adventurer, demagogue or thug.When you consider socialism, do not fool yourself about its nature. Rememberthat there is no such dichotomy as “human rights” versus “property rights.” Nohuman rights can exist without property rights. Since material goods areproduced by the mind and effort of individual men, and are needed to sustaintheir lives, if the producer does not own the result of his effort, he does notown his life. To deny property rights means to turn men into property owned bythe state. Whoever claims the “right” to “redistribute” the wealth produced byothers is claiming the “right” to treat human beings as chattel.[Ibid.. 120;pb91.] When one observes the nightmare of the desperate efforts made by hundreds ofthousands of people struggling to escape from the socialized countries ofEurope, to escape over barbed-wire fences, under machine-gun fire—one can nolonger believe that socialism, in any of its forms, is motivated by benevolenceand by the desire to achieve men’s welfare.No man of authentic benevolence could evade or ignore so great a horror on sovast a scale.Socialism is not a movement of the people. It is a movement of theintellectuals, originated, led and controlled by the intellectuals, carried bythem out of their stuffy ivory towers into those bloody fields of practice wherethey unite with their allies and executors: the thugs.[Ihid.. 115; pb 87.] The socialists had a certain kind of logic on their side: if the collectivesacrifice of all to all is the moral ideal, then they wanted to establish thisideal in practice, here and on this earth. The arguments that socialism wouldnot and could not work, did not stop them: neither has altruism ever worked, butthis has not caused men to stop and question it. Only reason can ask suchquestions—and reason, they were told on all sides, has nothing to do withmorality, morality lies outside the realm of reason, no rational morality canever be defined.The fallacies and contradictions in the economic theories of socialism wereexposed and refuted time and time again, in the Nineteenth Century as well astoday. This did not and does not stop anyone: it is not an issue of economics,but of morality. The intellectuals and the so-called idealists were determinedto make socialism work. How? By that magic means of all irrationalists: somehow.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 82: pb 68.] There is no difference between communism and socialism, except in the means ofachieving the same ultimate end: communism proposes to enslave men by force,socialism—by vote. It is merely the difference between murder and suicide.[“Foreign Policy Drains U.S. of Main Weapon,” Los Angeles Times, Sept. 9. 1962G2.] Both “socialism” and “fascism” involve the issue of property rights. The rightto property is the right of use and disposal. Observe the difference in thosetwo theories: socialism negates private property rights altogether, andadvocates “the vesting of ownershiP and control” in the community as a whole,i.e., in the state; fascism leaves ownership in the hands of privateindividuals, but transfers control of the property to the government.Ownership without control is a contradiction in terms: it means “property,”without the right to use it or to dispose of it. It means that the citizensretain the responsibility of holding property, without any of its advantages,while the government acquires all the advantages without any of theresponsibility.In this respect, socialism is the more honest of the two theories. I sav “morehonest,” not “better”—because, in practice, there is no difference between them:both come from the same collectivist-statist principle, both negate individualrights and subordinate the individual to the collective, both deliver thelivelihood and the lives of the citizens into the power of an omnipotentgovernment—and the differences between them are only a matter of time, degree,and superficial detail, such as the choice of slogans by which the rulers deludetheir enslaved subjects.[“The New Fascism: Rule by Consensus,” CUI, 202.] The Nazis defended their policies, and the country did not rebel; it acceptedthe Nazi argument. Selfish individuals may be unhappy, the Nazis said, but whatwe have established in Germany is the ideal system, socialism. In its Nazi usagethis term is not restricted to a theory of economics; it is to be understood ina fundamental sense. “Socialism” for the Nazis denotes the principle ofcollectivism as such and its corollary, statism—in every field of human action,including but not limited to economics.“To be a socialist,” says Goebbels, “is to submit the I to the thou; socialismis sacrificing the individual to the whole.”By this definition, the Nazis practiced what they preached. They practiced it athome and then abroad. No one can claim that they did not sacrifice enoughindividuals.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 10; pb 19.]See also ALTRUISM; CAPITALISM; COLLECTIVISM; DICTATORSHIP; ECONOMIC POWER vs.POLITICAL POWER; EGALITARIANISM; FASCISM and COMMUNISM/SOCIALISM; GUILDSOCIALISM; HUMAN RIGHTS and PROPERTY RIGHTS; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; “LIBERALS”; NEWLEFT; POVERTY; PROPERTY RIGHTS; “PUBLIC PROPERTY”; “REDISTRIBUTION” of WEALTH;SOCIETY; SOVIET RUSSIA; STATISM; TRIBALISM; TYRANNY. Society. Society is a large number of men who live together in the same country,and who deal with one another.[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet, 9.] Modern collectivists ... see society as a super-organism, as some supernaturalentity apart from and superior to the sum of its individual members.[“Collectivized ‘Rights,’ ” VOS, 138; pb 103.] A great deal may be learned about society by studying man; but this processcannot be reversed: nothing can be learned about man by studying society—bystudying the inter-relationships of entities one has never identified ordefined.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 15.]See also COLLECTIVISM; INDIVIDUALISM. Soul-Body Dichotomy. They have cut man in two, setting one half against theother. They have taught him that his body and his consciousness are two enemiesengaged in deadly conflict, two antagonists of opposite natures, contradictoryclaims, incompatible needs, that to benefit one is to injure the other, that hissoul belongs to a supernatural realm, but his body is an evil prison holding itin bondage to this earth—and that the good is to defeat his body, to undermineit by years of patient struggle, digging his way to that glorious jail-breakwhich leads into the freedom of the grave.They have taught man that he is a hopeless misfit made of two elements, bothsymbols of death. A body without a soul is a corpse, a soul without a body is aghost—yet such is their image of man’s nature: the battleground of a strugglebetween a corpse and a ghost, a corpse endowed with some evil volition of itsown and a ghost endowed with the knowledge that everything known to man isnon-existent, that only the unknowable exists.Do you observe what human faculty that doctrine was designed to ignore? It wasman’s mind that had to be negated in order to make him fall apart. Once hesurrendered reason, he was left at the mercy of two monsters whom he could notfathom or control: of a body moved by unaccountable instincts and of a soulmoved by mystic revelations—he was left as the passively ravaged victim of abattle between a robot and a dictaphone.[GS, FNI, 170; pb 138.] You are an indivisible entity of matter and consciousness. Renounce yourconsciousness and you become a brute. Renounce your body and you become a fake.Renounce the material world and you surrender it to evil. [Ibid., 175; pb 142. ] As products of the split between man’s soul and body, there are two kinds ofteachers of the Morality of Death: the mystics of spirit and the mystics ofmuscle, whom you call the spiritualists and the materialists, those who believein consciousness without existence and those who believe in existence withoutconsciousness. Both demand the surrender of your mind, one to their revelations,the other to their reflexes. No matter how loudly they posture in the roles ofirreconcilable antagonists, their moral codes are alike, and so are their aims:in matter—the enslavement of man’s body, in spirit—the destruction of his mind.[Ibid., 171; pb 138.]The New Intellectual ... will discard ... the soul-body dichotomy. He willdiscard its irrational conflicts and contradictions, such as: mind versus heart,thought versus action, reality versus desire, the practical versus the moral. Hewill be an integrated man, that is: a thinker who is a man of action. He willknow that ideas divorced from consequent action are fraudulent, and that actiondivorced from ideas is suicidal. He will know that the conceptual level ofpsycho-epistemology—the volitional level of reason and thought—is the basicnecessity of man’s survival and his greatest moral virtue. He will know that menneed philosophy for the purpose of living on earth.[“For the New Intellectual,” FNI, 59; pb 51.]See also ANALYTIC-SYNTHETIC DICHOTOMY; CONSCIOUSNESS; EMOTIONS; EXISTENCE; HUMANRIGHTS and PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIFE; MAN; MORAL-PRACTICAL DICHOTOMY; MYSTICS ofSPIRIT and of MUSCLE; RATIONALISM vs. EMPIRICISM; RELIGION; REASON;THEORY-PRACTICE DICHOTOMY. Soviet Russia. The essential characteristic of socialism is the denial ofindividual property rights; under socialism, the right to property (which is theright of use and disposal) is vested in “society as a whole,” i.e., in thecollective, with production and distribution controlled by the state, i.e., bythe government.Socialism may be established by force, as in the Union of Soviet SocialistRepubtics—or by vote, as in Nazi (National Socialist) Germany. The degree ofsocialization may be total, as in Russia—or partial, as in England.Theoretically, the differences are superficial; practically, they are only amatter of time. The basic principle, in all cases, is the same.The alleged goals of socialism were: the abolition of poverty, the achievementof general prosperity, progress, peace and human brotherhood. The results havebeen a terrifying failure—terrifying, that is, if one’s motive is men’s welfare.Instead of prosperity, socialism has brought economic paralysis and/ or collapseto every country that tried it. The degree of socialization has been the degreeof disaster. the consequences have varied accordingly.In more fully socialized countries, famine was the start, the insigniaannouncing socialist rule—as in Soviet Russia, as in Red China, as in Cuba. Inthose countries, socialism reduced the people to the unspeakable poverty of thepre-industrial ages, to literal starvation, and has kept them on a stagnantlevel of misery.No, it is not “just temporary,” as socialism’s apologists have been saying—forhalf a century. After forty-five years of government planning, Russia is stillunable to solve the problem of feeding her population.As far as superior productivity and speed of economic progress are concerned,the question of any comparisons between capitalism and socialism has beenanswered once and for all—for any honest person—by the present differencebetween West and East Berlin.Instead of peace, socialism has introduced a new kind of gruesome lunacy intointernational relations—the “cold war,” which is a state of chronic war withundeclared periods of peace between wantonly sudden invasions—with Russiaseizing one-third of the globe, with socialist tribes and nations at oneanother’s throats, with socialist India invading Goa, and communist Chinainvading socialist India.An eloquent sign of the moral corruption of our age is the callous complacencywith which most of the socialists and their sympathizers, the “liberals,” regardthe atrocities perpetrated in socialistic countries and accept rule by terror asa way of life—while posturing as advocates of “human brotherhood.” ...In the name of “humanity,” they condone and accept the following: the abolitionof all freedom and all rights, the expropriation of all property, executionswithout trial, torture chambers, slave-labor camps, the mass slaughter ofcountless millions in Soviet Russia—and the bloody horror of East Berlin,including the bullet-riddled bodies of fleeing children.When one observes the nightmare of the desperate efforts made by hundreds ofthousands of people struggling to escape from the socialized countries ofEurope, to escape over barbed-wire fences, under machine-gun fire—one can nolonger believe that socialism, in any of its forms, is motivated by benevolenceand by the desire to achieve men’s welfare.No man of authentic benevolence could evade or ignore so great a horror on sovast a scale.[“The Monument Builders,” VOS, 112; pb 86.] The collectivization of Soviet agriculture was achieved by means of agovernment-planned famine—planned and carried out deliberately to force peasantsinto collective farms; Soviet Russia’s enemies claim that fifteen millionpeasants died in that famine; the Soviet government admits the death of sevenmillion.At the end of World War II, Soviet Russia’s enemies claimed that thirty millionpeople were doing forced labor in Soviet concentration camps (and were dying ofplanned malnutrition, human lives being cheaper than food); Soviet Russia’sapologists admit to the figure of twelve million people.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 34.]When you hear the liberals mumble that Russia is not really socialistic, or thatit was all Stalin’s fault, or that socialism never had a real chance in England,or that what they advocate is something that’s different somehow—you know thatyou are hearing the voices of men who haven’t a leg to stand on, men who arereduced to some vague hope that “somehow, my gang would have done it better.”The secret dread of modern intellectuals, liberals and conservatives alike, theunadmitted terror at the root of their anxiety, which all of their currentirrationalities are intended to stave off and to disguise, is the unstatedknowledge that Soviet Russia is the full, actual, literal, consistent embodimentof the morality of altruism, that Stalin did not corrupt a noble ideal, thatthis is the only way altruism has to be or can ever be practiced. If service andself-sacrifice are a moral ideal, and if the “selfishness” of human natureprevents men from leaping into sacrificial furnaces, there is no reason—noreason that a mystic moralist could name—why a dictator should not push them inat the point of bayonets—for their own good, or the good of humanity, or thegood of posterity, or the good of the latest bureaucrat’s latest five-year plan.There is no reason that they can name to oppose any atrocity. The value of aman’s life? His right to exist? His right to pursue his own happiness? These areconcepts that belong to individualism and capitatism—to the antithesis of thealtruist morality.[“Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World,” PWNI, 84; pb 69.] Half a century ago, the Soviet rulers commanded their subjects to be patient,bear privations, and make sacrifices for the sake of “industrializing” thecountry, promising that this was only temporary, that industrialization wouldbring them abundance, and Soviet progress would surpass the capitalistic West.Today, Soviet Russia is still unable to feed her people—while the rulersscramble to copy, borrow, or steal the technological achievements of the West.Industrialization is not a static goal; it is a dynamic process with a rapidrate of obsolescence. So the wretched serfs of a planned tribal economy, whostarved while waiting for electric generators and tractors, are now starvingwhile waiting for atomic power and interplanetary travel. Thus, in a “people’sstate,” the progress of science is a threat to the people, and every advance istaken out of the people’s shrinking hides.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 29.] Under the inept government of the Czars and with the most primitive methods ofagriculture, Russia was a major grain exporter. The unusually fertile soil ofthe Ukraine alone was (and is) capable of feeding the entire world. Whatevernatural conditions are required for growing wheat, Russia had (and has) them inoverabundance. That Russia should now be on a list of hungry, wheat-beggingimporters, is the most damning indictment of a collectivist economy that realitycan offer us.[“Hunger and Freedom,” ARL, III, 22, 4.] Early in 1960, Anatoly Marchenko, a twenty-two-year-old laborer in the Union ofSoviet Socialist Republics, happened to be present when a brawl erupted amongsome workers in a hostel. Every person found on the scene—innocent or guilty—wasarrested and sent to a Siberian prison camp. Marchenko was one of them. Heescaped from the camp and fled toward the Iranian border. Fifty yards from it,he was captured. While Western “humanitarians” were loudly applauding the “newliberalism” of the Khrushchev regime, Anatoly Marchenko was convicted of hightreason and sentenced to six years in Russia’s concentration camps.My Testimony is Marchenko’s report on those years. “When I was locked up inVladimir Prison I was often seized by despair,” he writes in his preface.“Hunger, illness, and above all helplessness, the sheer impossibility ofstruggling against evil, provoked me to the point where I was ready to hurlmyself upon my jailers with the sole aim of being killed. Or to put an end tomyself in some other way. Or to maim myself as I had seen others do.“One thing alone prevented me, one thing alone gave me the strength to livethrough that nightmare: the hope that I would eventually come out and tell thewhole world what I had seen and experienced. I promised myself that for the sakeof this aim I would suffer and endure everything. And I gave my word on this tomy comrades who were doomed to spend many more years behind bars and barbedwire.” ...Marchenko’s account of his life in Vladimir [prison] is so horrifying that itbecomes, at times, almost impossible to continue reading. Anyone who doubts thenature of the Soviet system should read every word....For more than fifty years, the West’s liberal intellectuals have proclaimedtheir love for mankind, while being bored by the rivers of blood pouring out ofthe Soviet Union. Professing their compassion for human suffering, they havenone for the victims in Russia. Unable or unwilling to give up their faith incollectivism, they evade the existence of Soviet atrocities, of terror, secretpolice and concentration camps—and publish glowing tributes to Soviettechnology, production and art. Posturing as hurnanitarians, they man thebarricades to fight the “injustice,” “exploitation,” “repression,” and“persecution” they claim to find in America: as to the full reality of suchthings in Russia, they keep silent.If anyone has any doubts about the moral meaning of the liberals’ position, lethim read—and reread—every detail of Marchenko’s experiences. Let him rememberthat these horrors are not accidental in the Soviet Union and are not a matterof a particular dictator’s character. They are inherent in the system. They arethe inevitable products of a fully collectivist society.If anyone has any doubts about the evil of establishing cultural exchangeprograms or of building “trade-bridges” to the Soviet Union or of buying theproducts of slave labor, let him remember how Marchenko felt when he stood infront of a shop window in Moscow, after his release. “That television set hascost my friends our sweat, our health, roasting in the cooler and long hoursduring roll-call in the rain and snow. Look closely at that polished surface:can you not see reflected in it the close-shaven head, the yellow, emaciatedface, and the black cotton tunic of a convict? Maybe it’s a former friend ofyours?”[Susan Ludel, review of Anatoly Marchenko’s My Testimony, TO, July 1970, 10.] I would advocate that which the Soviet Union fears above all else: economicboycott. I would advocate a blockade of Cuba and an economic boycott of SovietRussia; and you would see both those regimes collapse without the loss of asingle American life.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 13. ] It is immoral for the U.S. (and for all free or semi-free countries) to engagein any undertaking with Soviet Russia as a partner. It is particularly immoralif the undertaking is intellectual or cultural. Such a partnership necessarilyimplies and proclaims the acceptance of Soviet Russia as a peaceful,well-meaning, civilized country.[“Comments on the Moscow Olympics,” The Intellectual Activist, Feb. 1, 1980, p.1.] There is only one form of protest open to the men of goodwill in the semi-freeworld: do not sanction the Soviet jailers of [the dissidents]—do not help themto pretend that they are the morally acceptable leaders of a civilized country.Do not patronize or support the evil pretense of the so-called “culturalexchanges”—any Soviet-government-sponsored scientists, professors, writers,artists, musicians, dancers (who are either vicious bootlickers or doomed,tortured victims). Do not patronize, support or deal with any Soviet supportersand apologists in this country: they are the guiltiest men of all.[“The ‘Inexplicable Personal Alchemy,’ ” NL, 125.]See also ALTRUISM; AMERICA; COLLECTIVISM; COMMUNISM; COMPROMISE; DICTATORSHIP;FASCISM and COMMUNISM/SOCIALISM; FOREIGN POLICY; INDIVIDUALISM; “LIBERALS”;PROPERTY RIGHTS; SACRIFICE; SANCTION; SOCIALLSM; STATISM: TYRANNY; UNITEDNATIONS. Space. “Space,” like “time,” is a relational concept. It does not designate anentity, but a relationship, which exists only within the universe. The universeis not in space any more than it is in time. To be “in a position” means to havea certain relationship to the boundary of some container. E.g.. you are in NewYork: there is a point of the earth’s surface on which you stand—that’s yourspatial position: your relation to this point. All it means to say “There isspace between two objects” is that they occupy different positions. In thiscase, you are focusing on two relationships—the relationship of one entity toits container and of another to its container—simultaneously.The universe, therefore, cannot be anywhere. Can the universe be in Boston? Canit be in the Milky Way? Places are in the universe, not the other way around.Is the universe then unlimited in size? No. Everything which exists is finite,including the universe. What then, you ask, is outside the universe, if it isfinite? This question is invalid. The phrase “outside the universe” has noreferent. The universe is everything. “Outside the universe” stands for “thatwhich is where everything isn’t.” There is no such place. There isn’t evennothing “out there”; there is no “out there.”[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976). Lecture2.]See also ENTITY; EXISTENCE; METAPHYSICS; TIME; UNIVERSE. Standard of Measurement. See Measurement. Standard of Value. The Objectivist ethics holds man’s life as the standard ofvalue—and his own life as the ethical purpose of every individual man.The difference between “standard” and “purpose” in this context is as follows: a“standard” is an abstract principle that serves as a measurement or gauge toguide a man’s choices in the achievement of a concrete, specific purpose. “Thatwhich is required for the survival of man qua man” is an abstract principle thatapplies to every individual man. The task of applying this principle to aconcrete, specific purpose—the purpose of living a life proper to a rationalbeing—belongs to every individual man, and the life he has to live is his own,Man must choose his actions, values and goals by the standard of that which isproper to man—in order to achieve, maintain, fulfill and enjoy that ultimatevalue, that end in itself, which is his own life.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 19; pb 25.] The standard of value of the Objectivist ethics—the standard by which one judgeswhat is good or evil—is man’s life, or: that which is required for man’ssurvival qua man.Since reason is man’s basic means of survival, that which is proper to the lifeof a rational being is the good; that which negates, opposes or destroys it isthe evil.[Ibid., 16; pb 23.] “Man’s survival qua man” means the terms, methods, conditions and goals requiredfor the survival of a rational being through the whole of his lifespan—in allthose aspects of existence which are open to his choice.[Ibid., 18; pb 24.]See also ABSTRACTIONS and CONCRETES; LIFE; MAN; MORALITY; OBJECTIVISM;RATIONALITY; REASON; TELEOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT; ULTIMATE VALUE; VALUES; VIRTUE. States’ Rights. The constitutional concept of “states’ rights” pertains to thedivision of power between local and national authorities, and serves to protectthe states from the Federal government; it does not grant to a state governmentan unlimited, arbitrary power over its citizens or the privilege of abrogatingthe citizens’ individual rights.[“Racism,” VOS, 180; pb 131.] [George Wallace] is not a defender of individual rights, but merely of states’rights—which is far, far from being the same thing. When he denounces “BigGovernment,” it is not the unlimited, arbitrary power of the state that he isdenouncing, but merely its centralization—and he seeks to place the sameunlimited, arbitrary power in the hands of many little governments. The break-upof a big gang into a number of warring small gangs is not a return to aconstitutional system nor to individual rights nor to law and order.[“The Presidential Candidates, 1968,” TO, June 1968, 5.]See also “COLLECTIVE RIGHTS”; “CONSERVATIVES”; CONSTITUTION; GOVERNMENT;INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. Statism. The political expression of altruism is collectivism or statism, whichholds that man’s life and work belong to the state—to society, to the group, thegang, the race, the nation—and that the state may dispose of him in any way itpleases for the sake of whatever it deems to be its own tribal, collective good.[“Introducing Objectivism,” TON, Aug. 1962, 35.] A statist system—whether of a communist, fascist, Nazi, socialist or “welfare”type—is based on the ... government’s unlimited power, which means: on the ruleof brute force. The differences among statist systems are only a matter of timeand degree; the principle is the same. Under statism, the government is not apoliceman, but a legalized criminal that holds the power to use physical forcein any manner and for any purpose it pleases against legally disarmed,defenseless victims.Nothing can ever justify so monstrously evil a theory. Nothing can justify thehorror, the brutality, the plunder, the destruction, the starvation, theslave-labor camps, the torture chambers, the wholesale slaughter of statistdictatorships.[“War and Peace,” TON, Oct. 1962, 44.] Government control of a country’s economy—any kind or degree of such control, byany group, for any purpose whatsoever—rests on the basic principle of statism,the principle that man’s life belongs to the state. [“Conservatism: An Obituary,” CUI. 192.] A statist is a man who believes that some men have the right to force, coerce,enslave, rob, and murder others. To be put into practice, this belief has to beimplemented by the political doctrine that the government—the state—has theright to initiate the use of physical force against its citizens. How oftenforce is to be used, against whom, to what extent, for what purpose and forwhose benefit, are irrelevant questions. The basic principle and the ultimateresults of all statist doctrines are the same: dictatorship and destruction. Therest is only a matter of time.[“America’s Persecuted Minority: Big Business. CUI, 47.] If the term “statism” designates concentration of power in the state at theexpense of individual liberty, then Nazism in politics was a form of statism. Inprinciple, it did not represent a new approach to government: it was acontinuation of the political absolutism—the absolute monarchies, theoligarchies, the theocracies, the random tyrannies—which has characterized mostof human history.In degree, however, the total state does differ from its predecessors: itrepresents statism pressed to its limits, in theory and in practice. devouringthe last remnants of the individual.[Leonard Peikoff. OP. 6: pb 16.]The ideological root of statism (or collectivism) is the tribal premise ofprimordial savages who, unable to conceive of individual rights, believed thatthe tribe is a supreme, omnipotent ruler, that it owns the lives of its membersand may sacrifice them whenever it pleases to whatever it deems to be its own“good.” Unable to conceive of any social principles, save the rule of bruteforce, they believed that the tribe’s wishes are limited only by its physicalpower and that other tribes are its natural prey, to be conquered, looted,enslaved, or annihilated. The history of all primitive peoples is a successionof tribal wars and intertribal slaughter. That this savage ideology now rulesnations armed with nuclear weapons, should give pause to anyone concerned withmankind’s survival.Statism is a system of institutionalized violence and perpetual civil war. Itleaves men no choice but to fight to seize political power—to rob or be robbed,to kill or be killed. When brute force is the only criterion of social conduct,and unresisting surrender to destruction is the only alternative, even thelowest of men, even an animal—even a cornered rat—will fight. There can be nopeace within an enslaved nation.[“The Roots of War,” CUI, 36.] The degree of statism in a country’s political system, is the degree to which itbreaks up the country into rival gangs and sets men against one another. Whenindividual rights are abrogated, there is no way to determine who is entitled towhat; there is no way to determine the justice of anyone’s claims, desires, orinterests. The criterion, therefore, reverts to the tribal concept of: one’swishes are limited only by the power of one’s gang.[Ibid.] Statism—in fact and in principle—is nothing more than gang rule. A dictatorshipis a gang devoted to looting the effort of the productive citizens of its owncountry. When a statist ruler exhausts his own country’s economy, he attacks hisneighbors. It is his only means of postponing internal collapse and prolonginghis rule. A country that violates the rights of its own citizens, will notrespect the rights of its neighbors. Those who do not recognize individualrights, will not recognize the rights of nations: a nation is only a number ofindividuals.Statism needs war; a free country does not. Statism survives by looting; a freecountry survives by production.Observe that the major wars of history were started by the more controlledeconomies of the time against the freer ones. For instance, World War I wasstarted by monarchist Germany and Czarist Russia, who dragged in their freerallies. World War II was started by the alliance of Nazi Germany with SovietRussia and their joint attack on Poland.Observe that in World War II, both Germany and Russia seized and dismantledentire factories in conquered countries, to ship them home —white the freest ofthe mixed economies, the semi-capitalistic United States, sent billions worth oflend-lease equipment, including enthe factories, to its allies.Germany and Russia needed war; the United States did not and gained nothing. (Infact, the United States lost, economically, even though it won the war: it wasleft with an enormous national debt, augmented by the grotesquely futile policyof supporting former allies and enemies to this day.) Yet it is capitalism thattoday’s peace-lovers oppose and statism that they advocate—in the name of peace.[Ibid., 37.] The human characteristic required by statism is docility, which is the productof hopelessness and intellectual stagnation. Thinking men cannot be ruled;ambitious men do not stagnate.[“Tax-Credits for Education,” ARL, I, 12, 1.] The first choice—and the only one that matters—is: freedom or dictatorship,capitalism or statism.That is the choice which today’s political leaders are determined to evade. The“liberals” are trying to put statism over by steahh—statism of a semi-socialist,semi-fascist kind—without letting the country realize what road they are takingto what ultimate goal. And while such a policy is reprehensible, there issomething more reprehensible still: the policy of the “conservatives,” who aretrying to defend freedom by stealth.[“Conservatism: An Obituary,” CUI. 193.] The statists’ epistemological method consists of endless debates about single,concrete, out-of-context, range-of-the-moment issues, never allowing them to beintegrated into a sum, never referring to basic principles or ultimateconsequences—and thus inducing a state of intellectual disintegration in theirfollowers. The purpose of that verbal fog is to conceal the evasion of twofundamentals: (a) that production and prosperity are the product of men’sintelligence, and (b) that government power is the power of coercion by physicalforce.Once these two facts are acknowledged, the conclusion to be drawn is inevitable:that intelligence does not work under coercion, that man’s mind will notfunction at the point of a gun.[“Let Us Alone!” CUI. 141.]See also ALTRUISM; CAPITALISM; COLLECTIVISM; COMMUNISM; “CONSERVATIVES”;DICTATORSHIP; FASCISM/NAZISM; GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; INDIVIDUALISM;INTERVENTIONISM (ECONOMIC); “LIBERALS”; PHYSICAL FORCE; TRIBALISM; TYRANNY; WAR;WELFARE STATE. “Stolen Concept,” Fallacy of. The “stolen concept” fallacy, first identified byAyn Rand, is the fallacy of using a concept while denying the validity of itsgenetic roots, i.e., of an earlier concept(s) on which it logically depends.[Leonard Peikoff, editor’s footnote to Ayn Rand’s “Philosophical Detection,”PWNI, 26; pb 22.] As they feed on stolen wealth in body, so they feed on stolen concepts in mind,and proclaim that honesty consists of refusing to know that one is stealing. Asthey use effects while denying causes, so they use our concepts while denyingthe roots and the existence of the concepts they are using.[GS, FNI, 191; pb 154.] When modern philosophers declare that axioms are a matter of arbitrary choice,and proceed to choose complex, derivative concepts as the alleged axioms oftheir alleged reasoning, one can observe that their statements imply and dependon “existence,” “consciousness,” “identity,” which they profess to negate, butwhich are smuggled into their arguments in the form of unacknowledged. “stolen”concepts.[ITOE, 79.] They proclaim that there are no entities, that nothing exists but motion, andblank out the fact that motion presupposes the thing which moves, that withoutthe concept of entity, there can be no such concept as “motion.”... They proclaim that there is no law of identity, that nothing exists butchange, and blank out the fact that change presupposes the concepts of whatchanges, from what and to what, that without the law of identity no such conceptas “change” is possible.... “You cannot prove that you exist or that you’re conscious,” they chatter,blanking out the fact that proof presupposes existence, consciousness and acomplex chain of knowledge: the existence of something to know, of aconsciousness able to know it, and of a knowledge that has learned todistinguish between such concepts as the proved and the unproved.[GS, FNI, 191; pb 154.]The arguments of those who attack the senses are merely variants of the fallacyof the “stolen concept.”[ITOE, 4.] Observe that Descartes starts his system by using “error” and its synonyms orderivatives as “stolen concepts.”Men have been wrong, and therefore, he implies, they can never know what isright. But if they cannot, how did they ever discover that they were wrong? Howcan one form such concepts as “mistake” or “error” while wholly ignorant of whatis correct? “Error” signifies a departure from truth; the concept of “error”logically presupposes that one has already grasped some truth. If truth wereunknowable, as Descartes implies, the idea of a departure from it would bemeaningless.The same point applies to concepts denoting specific forms of error. If wecannot ever be certain that an argument is logically valid, if validity isunknowable, then the concept of “invalid” reasoning is impossible to reach orapply. If we cannot ever know that a man is sane, then the concept of “insanity”is impossible to form or define. If we cannot recognize the state of beingawake, then we cannot recognize or conceptualize a state of not being awake(such as dreaming). If man cannot grasp X, then “non-X” stands for nothing.[Leonard Peikoff, “ ‘Maybe You’re Wrong,’ ” TOF, April 1981, 9.] Particularly since Kant, the philosophical technique of concept stealing, ofattempting to negate reason by means of reason, has become a general bromide, agimmick worn transparently thin.[ITOE, 81.] See also AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS; AXIOMS; CONCEPTS; HIERARCHY of KNOWLEDGE; INVALIDCONCEPTS; KANT, IMMANUEL; LOGIC; PERCEPTION; TRUTH. Style. “Style” is a particular, distinctive or characteristic mode of execution.[“Art and Sense of Life,” RM, 51; pb 40.] Two distinct, but interrelated, elements of a work of art are the crucial meansof projecting its sense of life: the subject and the style—what an artistchooses to present and how he presents it.The subject of an art work expresses a view of man’s existence, while the styleexpresses a view of man’s consciousness. The subject reveals an artist’smetaphysics, the style reveals his psycho-epistemology....The theme of an art work is the link uniting its subject and its style. “Style”is a particular, distinctive or characteristic mode of execution. An artist’sstyle is the product of his own psycho-epistemology—and, by implication, aprojection of his view of man’s consciousness, of its efficacy or impotence, ofits proper method and level of functioning.Predominantly (though not exclusively), a man whose normal mental state is astate of full focus, will create and respond to a style of radiant clarity andruthless precision—a style that projects sharp outlines, cleanliness, purpose,an intransigent commitment to full awareness and clear-cut identity—a level ofawareness appropriate to a universe where A is A, where everything is open toman’s consciousness and demands its constant functioning.A man who is moved by the fog of his feelings and spends most of his time out offocus will create and respond to a style of blurred, “mysterious” murk, whereoutlines dissolve and entities flow into one another, where words connoteanything and denote nothing, where colors float without objects, and objectsfloat without weight—a level of awareness appropriate to a universe where A canbe any non-A one chooses, where nothing can be known with certainty and nothingmuch is demanded of one’s consciousness.Style is the most complex element of art, the most revealing and, often, themost baffling psychologically. The terrible inner conflicts from which artistssuffer as much as (or, perhaps, more than) other men are magnified in theirwork. As an example: Salvador Dali, whose style projects the luminous clarity ofa rational psycho-epistemology, while most (though not all) of his subjectsproject an irrational and revoltingly evil metaphysics. A similar, but lessoffensive, conflict may be seen in the paintings of Vermeer, who combines abrilliant clarity of style with the bleak metaphysics of Naturalism. At theother extreme of the stylistic continuum, observe the deliberate blurring andvisual distortions of the so-called “painterly” school, from Rembrandt ondown—down to the rebellion against consciousness, expressed by a phenomenon suchas Cubism which seeks specifically to disintegrate man’s consciousness bypainting objects as man does not perceive them (from several perspectives atonce).A writer’s style may project a blend of reason and passionate emotion (VictorHugo)—or a chaos of floating abstractions, of emotions cut off from reality(Thomas Wolfe)—or the dry, bare, concrete-bound, humor-tinged raucousness of anintelligent reporter (Sinclair Lewis)—or the disciplined, perceptive, lucid, yetmuted understatement of a represser (John O’Hara)—or the carefully superficial,over-detailed precision of an amoralist (Flaubert)—or the mannered artificialityof a second-hander (several moderns not worthy of mention).Style conveys what may be called a “psycho-epistemological sense of life,” i.e.,an expression of that level of mental functioning on which the artist feels mostat home. This is the reason why style is crucially important in art—both to theartist and to the reader or viewer—and why its importance is experienced as aprofoundly personal matter. To the artist, it is an expression, to the reader orviewer a confirmation, of his own consciousness—which means: of hisefficacy—which means: of his self-esteem (or pseudo-self-esteem).[Ibid., 50; pb 40.] Style is not an end in itself, it is only a means to an end—the means of tellinga story. The writer who develops a beautiful style, but has nothing to say,represents a kind of arrested esthetic development; he is like a pianist whoacquires a brilliant technique by playing finger-exercises, but never gives aconcert.The typical literary product of such writers—and of their imitators, who possessno style—are so-called “mood-studies,” popular among today’s literati, which arelittle pieces conveying nothing but a certain mood. Such pieces are not anart-form, they are merely finger-exercises that never develop into art.[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 78; pb 96.]See also ART; FOCUS; IDENTITY; METAPHYSICS; PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY; SENSE of LIFE;STYLIZATION; SUBJECT (in ART). Stylization. “Stylized” means condensed to essential characteristics, which arechosen according to an artist’s view of man.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 67.] An artist does not fake reality—he stylizes it. He selects those aspects ofexistence which he regards as metaphysically significant—and by isolating andstressing them, by omitting the insignificant and accidental, he presents hisview of existence. His concepts are not divorced from the facts of reality—theyare concepts which integrate the facts and his metaphysical evaluation of thefacts.[“Art and Sense of Life,” RM, 46; pb 36.] The dance is the silent partner of music and participates in a division oflabor: music presents a stylized version of man’s consciousness in action—thedance presents a stylized version of man’s body in action.[“Art and Cognition,” RM, pb 66.]See also ART; DANCE; METAPHYSICAL VALUE-JUDGMENTS; PAINTING; STYLE.Subconscious. Your subconscious is like a computer—more complex a computer thanmen can build—and its main function is the integration of your ideas. Whoprograms it? Your conscious mind. If you default, if you don’t reach any firmconvictions, your subconscious is programmed by chance—and you deliver yourselfinto the power of ideas you do not know you have accepted. But one way or theother, your computer gives you print-outs, daily and hourly, in the form ofemotions—which are lightning-like estimates of the things around you, calculatedaccording to your values. If you programmed your computer by conscious thinking,you know the nature of your values and emotions. If you didn’t, you don’t.Many people, particularly today, claim that man cannot live by logic alone, thatthere’s the emotional element of his nature to consider, and that they rely onthe guidance of their emotions. Well, ... the joke is on ... them: man’s valuesand emotions are determined by his fundamental view of life. The ultimateprogrammer of his subconscious is philosophy —the science which, according tothe emotionalists, is impotent to affect or penetrate the murky mysteries oftheir feelings.The quality of a computer’s output is determined by the quality of its input. Ifyour subconscious is programmed by chance, its output will have a correspondingcharacter. You have probably heard the computer operators’ eloquent term“gigo”—which means: “Garbage in, garbage out.” The same formula applies to therelationship between a man’s thinking and his emotions.A man who is run by emotions is like a man who is run by a computer whoseprint-outs he cannot read. He does not know whether its programming is true orfalse, right or wrong, whether it’s set to lead him to success or destruction,whether it serves his goals or those of some evil, unknowable power. He is blindon two fronts: blind to the world around him and to his own inner world, unableto grasp reality or his own motives, and he is in chronic terror of both.Emotions are not tools of cognition. The men who are not interested inphilosophy need it most urgently: they are most helplessly in its power.[“Philosophy: Who Needs It,” PWNI, 7; pb 5.] The subconscious is an integrating mechanism. Man’s conscious mind observes andestablishes connections among his experiences; the subconscious integrates theconnections and makes them become automatic. For example, the skill of walkingis acquired, after many faltering attempts, by the automatization of countlessconnections controlling muscular movements; once he learns to walk, a childneeds no conscious awareness of such problems as posture, balance, length ofstep, etc.—the mere decision to walk brings the integrated total into hiscontrol.A mind’s cognitive development involves a continual process of automatization.For example, you cannot perceive a table as an infant perceives it—as amysterious object with four legs. You perceive it as a table, i.e., a man-madepiece of furniture, serving a certain purpose belonging to a human habitation,etc.; you cannot separate these attributes from your sight of the table, youexperience it as a single, indivisible percept—yet all you see is a four-leggedobject; the rest is an automatized integration of a vast amount of conceptualknowledge which, at one time, you had to learn bit by bit. The same is true ofeverything you perceive or experience; as an adult, you cannot perceive orexperience in a vacuum, you do it in a certain automatized context— and theefficiency of your mental operations depends on the kind of context yoursubconscious has automatized.“Learning to speak is a process of automatizing the use (i.e., the meaning andthe application) of concepts. And more: all learning involves a process ofautomatizing, i.e., of first acquiring knowledge by fully conscious, focusedattention and observation, then of establishing mental connections which makethat knowledge automatic (instantly available as a context), thus freeing man’smind to pursue further, more complex knowledge.” (Introduction to ObjectivistEpistemology.)The process of forming, integrating and using concepts is not an automatic, buta volitional process—i.e., a process which uses both new and automatizedmaterial, but which is directed volitionally. It is not an innate, but anacquired skill; it has to be learned—it is the most crucially important part oflearning—and all of man’s other capacities depend on how well or how badly helearns it.This skill does not pertain to the particular content of a man’s knowledge atany given age, but to the method by which he acquires and organizesknowledge—the method by which his mind deals with its content. The methodprograms his subconscious computer, determining how efficiently, lamely ordisastrously his cognitive processes will function. The programming of a man’ssubconscious consists of the kind of cognitive habits he acquires; these habitsconstitute his psycho-epistemology.It is a child’s early experiences, observations and subverbal conclusions thatdetermine this programming. Thereafter, the interaction of content and methodestablishes a certain reciprocity: the method of acquiring knowledge affects itscontent, which affects the further development of the method, and so on.[“The Comprachicos,” NL, 192.] Man’s values control his subconscious emotional mechanism that functions like acomputer adding up his desires, his experiences, his fulfillments andfrustrations—like a sensitive guardian watching and constantly assessing hisrelationship to reality. The key question which this computer is programmed toanswer, is: What is possible to me?...Man’s emotional mechanism works as the barometer of the efficacy or impotence ofhis actions.[“Our Cultural Value-Deprivation,” TO, April 1966, 3.] [Objectivism rejects the Freudian) theory of a dynamic unconscious—i.e., theunconscious as a mystic entity, with a will and purpose of its own unknown tothe conscious mind, like an inborn demon that continually raises Hell. Strictlyspeaking, Objectivism does not subscribe to the idea of an unconscious at all.We use the term “subconscious” instead—and that is simply a name for the contentof your mind that you are not focused on at any given moment. It is simply arepository for past information or conclusions that you were once conscious ofin some form, but that are now stored beneath the threshold of consciousness.There is nothing in the subconscious besides what you acquired by consciousmeans. The subconscious does perform automatically certain importantintegrations (sometimes these are correct, sometimes not), but the consciousmind is always able to know what these are (and to correct them, if necessary).The subconscious has no purposes or values of its own, and it does not engage indiabolical manipulations behind the scenes. In that sense, it is certainly not“dynamic.”[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976),question period, Lecture 12.]See also AUTOMATIZATION; CONSCIOUSNESS; CONTEXT; EMOTIONS; FREE WILL; FREUD;INTEGRATION (MENTAL); INTROSPECTION; LOGIC; PHILOSOPHY; PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLO(;Y;“PSYCHOLOGIZING”; PSYCHOLOGY; SENSE of LIFE; VALUES. Subject (in Art). Two distinct, but interrelated, elements of a work of art arethe crucial means of projecting its sense of life: the subject and thestyle—what an artist chooses to present and how he presents it.The subject of an art work expresses a view of man’s existence, while the styleexpresses a view of man’s consciousness. The subject reveals an artist’smetaphysics, the style reveals his psycho-epistemology.The choice of subject declares what aspects of existence the artist regards asimportant—as worthy of being re-created and contemplated. He may choose topresent heroic figures, as exponents of man’s nature —or he may choosestatistical composites of the average, the undistinguished, the mediocre—or hemay choose crawling specimens of depravity. He may present the triumph ofheroes, in fact or in spirit (Victor Hugo), or their struggle (Michelangelo), ortheir defeat (Shakespeare). He may present the folks next door: next door topalaces (Tolstoy), or to drugstores (Sinclair Lewis), or to kitchens (Vermeer),or to sewers (Zola). He may present monsters as objects of moral denunciation(Dostoevsky), or as objects of terror (Goya)—or he may demand sympathy for hismonsters, and thus crawl outside the limits of the realm of values, includingesthetic ones.Whatever the case may be, it is the subject (qualified by the theme) thatprojects an art work’s view of man’s place in the universe.[“Art and Sense of Life,” RM, 50; pb 40.] The subject is not the only attribute of art, but it is the fundamental one, itis the end to which all the others are the means. In most esthetic theories,however, the end—the subject—is omitted from consideration. and only the meansare regarded as esthetically relevant. Such theories set up a false dic hotomyand claim that a slob portrayed by the technical means of a genius is preferableto a goddess portrayed by the technique of an amateur. I hold that both areesthetically offensive; but while the second is merely esthetic incompetence,the first is an esthetic crime.There is no dichotomy, no necessary conflict between ends and means. The enddoes not justify the means—neither in ethics nor in esthetics. And neither dothe means justify the end: there is no esthetic justification for the spectacleof Remhrandt’s great artistic skill employed to portray a side of beef.That particular painting may be taken as a symbol of everything I am opposed toin art and in literature. At the age of seven, I could not understand why anyonewould wish to paint or to admire pictures of dead fish, garbage cans or fatpeasant women with triple chins. Today, I understand the psychological causes ofsuch esthetic phenomena—and the more I understand, the more I oppose them.In art. and in literature, the end and the means, or the subject and the style,must be worthy of each other.That which is not worth contemplating in life, is not worth re-creating in art.Misery, disease, disaster, evil, all the negatives of human existence, areproper subjects of study in life, for the purpose of understanding andcorrecting them—but are not proper subjects of contemplation for contemplation’ssake. In art, and in literature, these negatives are worth re-creating only inrelation to some positive, as a foil, as a contrast, as a means of stressing thepositive—but not as an end in themselves.[“The Goal of My Writing,” RM, 166; pb 166.]See also ART; LITERATURE; METAPHYSICS; PAINTING; PSYCHO EPISTEMOLOGY; SCULPTURE;SENSE OF LIFE; STYLE. Subjectivism. In Metaphysics and EpistemologySubjectivism is the belief that reality is not a firm absolute, but a fluid,plastic, indeterminate realm which can be altered, in whole or in part, by theconsciousness of the perceiver—i.e., by his feelings, wishes or whims. It is thedoctrine which holds that man—an entity of a specific nature, dealing with auniverse of a specific nature—can, somehow, live, act and achieve his goalsapart from and/or in contradiction to the facts of reality, i.e., apart fromand/or in contradiction to his own nature and the nature of the universe. (Thisis the “mixed,” moderate or middle-of-the-road version of subjectivism. Pure or“extreme” subjectivism does not recognize the concept of identity, i.e., thefact that man or the universe or anything possesses a specific nature.)[“Who Is the Final Authority in Ethics?” TON, Feb. 1965, 7.] The subjective means the arbitrary, the irrational, the blindly emotional.[“Art and Moral Treason,” RM, 148; pb 150.] In metaphysics, “subjectivism” is the view that reality (the “object”) isdependent on human consciousness (the “subject”). In epistemology, as a result,subjectivists hold that a man need not concern himself with the facts ofreality; instead, to arrive at knowledge or truth, he need merely turn hisattention inward, consulting the appropriate contents of consciousness, the oneswith the power to make reality conform to their dictates. According to the mostwidespread form of subjectivism, the elements which possess this power arefeelings.In essence, subjectivism is the doctrine that feelings are the creator of facts,and therefore men’s primary tool of cognition. If men feel it, declares thesubjectivist, that makes it so.The alternative to subjectivism is the advocacy of objectivity—an attitude whichrests on the view that reality exists independent of human consciousness; thatthe role of the subject is not to create the object, but to perceive it; andthat knowledge of reality can be acquired only by directing one’s attentionoutward to the facts.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 58; pb 62.] The subjectivist denies that there is any such thing as “the truth” on a givenquestion, the truth which corresponds to the facts. On his view, truth variesfrom consciousness to consciousness as the processes or contents ofconsciousness vary; the same statement may be true for one consciousness (or onetype of consciousness) and false for another. The virtually infallible sign ofthe subjectivist is his refusal to say, of a statement he accepts: “It is true”;instead, he says: “It is true—for me (or for us).” There is no truth, only truthrelative to an individual or a group —truth for me. for you, for him, for her,for us, for them.[Leonard Peikoff, “Nazism and Subjectivism,” TO, Jan. 1971,9.] Your teachers, the mystics of both schools, have reversed causality in theirconsciousness, then strive to reverse it in existence. They take their emotionsas a cause, and their mind as a passive effect. They make their emotions theirtool for perceiving reality. They hold their desires as an irreducible primary,as a fact superseding all facts. An honest man does not desire until he hasidentified the object of his desire. He says: “It is, therefore I want it.” Theysay: “I want it, therefore it is.”They want to cheat the axiom of existence and consciousness, they want theirconsciousness to be an instrument not of perceiving but of creating existence,and existence to be not the object but the subject of their consciousness—theywant to be that God they created in their image and likeness, who creates auniverse out of a void by means of an arbitrary whim. But reality is not to becheated. What they achieve is the opposite of their desire. They want anomnipotent power over existence ; instead, they lose the power of theirconsciousness. By refusing to know, they condemn themselves to the horror of aperpetual unknown.[GS, FNI, 187; pb 150.] There are two different kinds of subjectivism, distinguished by their answers tothe question: whose consciousness creates reality? Kant rejected the older ofthese two, which was the view that each man’s feelings create a private universefor him. Instead, Kant ushered in the era of social subjectivism—the view thatit is not the consciousness of individuals, but of groups, that creates reality.In Kant’s system, mankind as a whole is the decisive group; what creates thephenomenal world is not the idiosyncrasies of particular individuals, but themental structure common to all men.Later philosophers accepted Kant’s fundamental approach, but carried it a stepfurther. If, many claimed, the mind’s structure is a brute given, which cannotbe explained—as Kant had said—then there is no reason why all men should havethe same mental structure. There is no reason why mankind should not besplintered into competing groups, each defined by its own distinctive type ofconsciousness, each vying with the others to capture and control reality.The first world movement thus to pluralize the Kantian position was Marxism,which propounded a social subjectivism in terms of competing economic classes.On this issue, as on many others, the Nazis follow the Marxists, but substituterace for class.[Leonard Peikoff, OP, 59; ph 63.] In Ethics Today, as in the past, most philosophers agree that the ultimate standard ofethics is whim (they call it “arbitrary postulate” or “subjective choice” or“emotional commitment”)—and the battle is only over the question of whose whim:one’s own or society’s or the dictator’s or God’s. Whatever else they maydisagree about, today’s moralists agree that ethics is a subjective issue andthat the three things barred from its field are: reason—mind—reatity.If you wonder why the world is now collapsing to a lower and ever lower rung ofhell, this is the reason.If you want to save civilization, it is this premise of modern ethics—and of allethical history—that you must challenge.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 4; pb 15.] There are, in essence, three schools of thought on the nature of the good: theintrinsic, the subjective, and the objective.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 21.] The subjectivist theory holds that the good bears no relation to the facts ofreality, that it is the product of a man’s consciousness, created by hisfeelings, desires, “intuitions,” or whims, and that it is merely an “arbitrarypostulate” or an “emotional commitment.”The intrinsic theory holds that the good resides in some sort of reality,independent of man’s consciousness; the subjectivist theory holds that the goodresides in man’s consciousness, independent of reality.[Ibid.] Ethical subjectivism, which holds that a desire or a whim is an irreduciblemoral primary, that every man is entitled to any desire he might feel likeasserting, that all desires have equal moral validity, and that the only way mencan get along together is by giving in to anything and “compromising” withanyone. It is not hard to see who would profit and who would lose by such adoctrine.[“Doesn’t Life Require Compromise?” VOS, 86; pb 69.] The subjectivist theory of ethics is, strictly speaking, not a theory, but anegation of ethics. And more: it is a negation of reality, a negation not merelyof man’s existence, but of all existence. Only the concept of a fluid, plastic,indeterminate, Heraclitean universe could permit anyone to think or to preachthat man needs no objective principles of action—that reality gives him a blankcheck on values—that anything he cares to pick as the good or the evil, willdo—that a man’s whim is a valid moral standard, and that the only question ishow to get away with it. The existential monument to this theory is the presentstate of our culture.[“‘The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 34; ph 34.] In Esthetics A work of art is a specific entity which possesses a specific nature. If it doesnot, it is not a work of art. If it is merely a material object, it belongs tosome category of material objects—and if it does not belong to any particularcategory, it belongs to the one reserved for such phenomena : junk.“Something made by an artist” is not a definition of art. A heard and a vacantstare are not the defining characteristics of an artist.“Something in a frame hung on a wall” is not a definition of painting.“Something with a number of pages in a binding” is not a definition ofliterature.“Something piled together” is not a definition of sculpture.“Something made of sounds produced by anything” is not a definition of music.“Something glued on a flat surface” is not a definition of any art. There is noart that uses glue as a medium. Blades of grass glued on a sheet of paper torepresent grass might he good occupational therapy for retarded children—thoughI doubt it—but it is not art.“Because I felt like it” is not a definition or validation of anything.There is no place for whim in any human activity—if it is to be regarded ashuman. There is no place for the unknowable, the unintelligible, theundefinable, the non-objective in any human product.[“Art and Cognition,” RM. pb 78.] See also AMORALISM; ANARCHISM; ARBITRARY; ART; AXIOMS; CAUSALITY; CONSCIOUSNESS;EXISTENCE; GOD; IDENTITY; EMOTIONS; INTRINSIC THEORY of VALUES; KANT, IMMANUEL;“LIBERTARIANS”; MODERN ART; MORALITY; OBJECTIVE THEORY of VALUES; OBJECTIVISM;OBJECTIVITY; PRAGMATISM; PRIMACY of EXISTENCE vs. PRIMACY of CONSCIOUSNESS;PRIOR CERTAINTY of CONSCIOUSNESS; REASON; SKEPTICISM; WHIMS/WHIM-WORSHIP.Subjectivism (Psychological).

A psychological subjectivist is unable fully to identify hisvalues or to prove their objective validity, but he may be profoundly consistentand loyal to them in practice (though with terrible psycho-epistemologicaldifficulty).

But to help a man who has no virtues, to help him on theground of his suffering as such, to accept his faults, his need, as a claim—isto accept the mortgage of a zero on your values.[GS, FNI, 226; pb 180.]See also ALTRUISM; BENEVOLENT UNIVERSE PREMISE; COMPASSION; EMOTIONS; HAPPINESS;MALEVOLENT UNIVERSE PREMISE; MERCY; PLEASURE and PAIN; VIRTUE. Supernaturalism. What is meant by “the supernatural”? Supposedly, a realm thattranscends nature. What is nature? Nature is existence —the sum of that whichis. It is usually called “nature” when we think of it as a system ofinterconnected, interacting entities governed by law. So “nature” really meansthe universe of entities acting and interacting in accordance with theiridentities. What, then, is “super-nature”? Something beyond the universe, beyondentities, beyond identity. It would have to be: a form of existence beyondexistence—a kind of entity beyond anything man knows about entities—a somethingwhich contradicts everything man knows about the identity of that which is. Inshort, a contradiction of every metaphysical essential.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture2.] They claim that they perceive a mode of being superior to your existence on thisearth. The mystics of spirit call it “another dimension,” which consists ofdenying dimensions. The mystics of muscle call it “the future,” which consistsof denying the present. To exist is to possess identity. What identity are theyable to give to their superior realm? They keep telling you what it is not, butnever tell you what it is. All their identifications consist of negating: God isthat which no human mind can know, they say—and proceed to demand that youconsider it knowledge—God is non-man, heaven is non-earth, soul is non-body,virtue is non-profit, A is non-A, perception is non-sensory, knowledge isnon-reason. Their definitions are not acts of defining, but of wiping out. [GS, FNI, 184; pb 148.] There is no way to prove a “super-existence” by inference from existence ;supernaturalism can be accepted only on faith.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture2.]See also ATHEISM; CAUSALITY; DEFINITIONS; EXISTENCE; FAITH; GOD; IDENTITY;METAPHYSICS; MIRACLES; MYSTICISM; NATURE; REASON."},{"pageContent":"TTabula Rasa. Since man has no automatic knowledge, he can have no automaticvalues; since he has no innate ideas, he can have no innate value judgments.Man is born with an emotional mechanism, just as he is born with a cognitivemechanism; but, at birth, both are “tabula rasa.” It is man’s cognitive faculty,his mind, that determines the content of both.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 23; pb 28.] At birth, a child’s mind is tabula rasa; he has the potential of awareness—themechanism of a human consciousness—but no content. Speaking metaphorically, hehas a camera with an extremely sensitive, unexposed film (his conscious mind),and an extremely complex computer waiting to be programmed (his subconscious).Both are blank. He knows nothing of the external world. He faces an immensechaos which he must learn to perceive by means of the complex mechanism which hemust learn to operate.If, in any two years of adult life, men could learn as much as an infant learnsin his first two years, they would have the capacity of genius. To focus hiseyes (which is not an innate, but an acquired skill), to perceive the thingsaround him by integrating his sensations into percepts (which is not an innate,but an acquired skill), to coordinate his muscles for the task of crawling, thenstanding upright, then walking—and, ultimately, to grasp the process ofconcept-formation and learn to speak—these are some of an infant’s tasks andachievements whose magnitude is not equaled by most men in the rest of theirlives.[“‘The Comprachicos,” NL, 190.] No one is born with any kind of “talent” and, therefore, every skill has to beacquired.

Do not confuse appeasement with tactfulness or generosity.Appeasement is not consideration for the feelings of others, it is considerationfor and compliance with the unjust, irrational and evil feelings of others. Itis a policy of exempting the emotions of others from moral judgment, and ofwillingness to sacrifice innocent, virtuous victims to the evil malice of suchemotions.Tactfulness is consideration extended only to rational feelings. A tactful mandoes not stress his success or happiness in the presence of those who havesuffered failure, loss or unhappiness; not because he suspects them of envy, butbecause he realizes that the contrast can revive and sharpen their pain. He doesnot stress his virtues in anyone’s presence: he takes for granted that they arerecognized.[“The Age of Envy,” NL, 160.] See also APPEASEMENT; COMPROMISE; JUSTICE. Taxation. In a fully free society, taxation—or, to be exact, payment forgovernmental services—would be voLuntary. Since the proper services of agovernment—the police, the armed forces, the law courts—are demonstrably neededby individual citizens and affect their interests directly, the citizens would(and should) be willing to pay for such services, as they pay for insurance.The question of how to implement the principle of voluntary governmentfinancing—how to determine the best means of applying it in practice—is a verycomplex one and belongs to the field of the philosophy of law. The task ofpolitical philosophy is only to establish the nature of the principle and todemonstrate that it is practicable. The choice of a specific method ofimplementation is more than premature today—since the principle will bepracticable only in a fully free society, a society whose government has beenconstitutionally reduced to its proper, basic functions.[“Government Financing in a Free Society,” VOS, 157; pb 116.] Any program of voluntary government financing has to be regarded as a goal for adistant future.What the advocates of a fully free society have to know, at present, is only theprinciple by which that goal can be achieved.The principle of voluntary government financing rests on the following premises:that the government is not the owner of the citizens’ income and, therefore,cannot hold a blank check on that income—that the nature of the propergovernmental services must be constitutionally defined and delimited, leavingthe government no power to enlarge the scope of its services at its ownarbitrary discretion. Consequently, the principle of voluntary governmentfinancing regards the government as the servant, not the ruler, of thecitizens—as an agent who must be paid for his services, not as a benefactorwhose services are gratuitous, who dispenses something for nothing.[Ibid., 160; pb 118.] In view of what they hear from the experts, the people cannot be blamed fortheir ignorance and their helpless confusion. If an average housewife struggleswith her incomprehensibly shrinking budget and sees a tycoon in a resplendentlimousine, she might well think that just one of his diamond cuff links wouldsolve all her problems. She has no way of knowing that if all the personalluxuries of all the tycoons were expropriated, it would not feed her family—andmillions of other, similar families—for one week; and that the entire countrywould starve on the first morning of the week to follow.... How would she knowit, if all the voices she hears are telling her that we must soak the rich?No one tells her that higher taxes imposed on the rich (and the semi-rich) willnot come out of their consumption expenditures, but out of their investmentcapital (i.e., their savings); that such taxes will mean less investment, i.e.,less production, fewer jobs, higher prices for scarcer goods; and that by thetime the rich have to lower their standard of living, hers will be gone, alongwith her savings and her husband’s job—and no power in the world (no economicpower) will be able to revive the dead industries (there will be no such powerleft).[“The Inverted Moral Priorities,” ARL,, III, 21, 3.] See also CAPITALISM; DEFICIT FINANCING; FREEDOM; GOVERN MENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS;INFLATION; INVESTMENT; PHYSICAL FORCE; PROPERTY RIGHTS; “REDISTRIBUTION” ofWEALTH; SAVINGS. Technology. Technology is an applied science, i.e., it translates thediscoveries of theoretical science into practical application to man’s life. Assuch, technology is not the first step in the development of a given body ofknowledge, but the last; it is not the most difficult step, but it is theultimate step, the implicit purpose, of man’s quest for knowledge.[“Apollo 11,” TO, Sept. 1969, 9.] Nothing can raise a country’s productivity except technology, and technology isthe final product of a complex of sciences (including philosophy), each of themkept alive and moving by the achievements of a few independent minds.[“The Moratorium on Brains,” ARL, I, 3, 5.] The enemies of the Industrial Revolution—its displaced persons—were of the kindthat had fought human progress for centuries, by every means available. In theMiddle Ages, their weapon was the fear of God. In the nineteenth century, theystill invoked the fear of God—for instance, they opposed the use of anesthesiaon the grounds that it defies God’s will, since God intended men to suffer. Whenthis weapon wore out, they invoked the will of the collective, the group, thetribe. But since this weapon has collapsed in their hands, they are now reduced,like cornered animals, to baring their teeth and their souls, and to proclaimingthat man has no right to exist—by the divine will of inanimate matter.The demand to “restrict” technology is the demand to restrict man’s mind. It isnature—i.e., reality—that makes both these goals impossible to achieve.Technology can be destroyed, and the mind can be paralyzed, but neither can berestricted. Whenever and wherever such restrictions are attempted, it is themind—not the state—that withers away.[“The Anti-Industrial Revolution,” NL, 145.] If you consider, not merely the length, but the kind of life men have to lead inthe undeveloped parts of the world—“the quality of life,” to borrow, with fullmeaning, the ecologists’ meaningless catch phrase—if you consider the squalor,the misery, the helplessness, the fear, the unspeakably hard labor, thefestering diseases, the plagues, the starvation, you will begin to appreciatethe role of technology in man’s existence.Make no mistake about it: it is technology and progress that the nature-loversare out to destroy. To quote again from the Newsweek survey: “What worriesecologists is that people now upset about the environment may ultimately look totechnology to solve everything ...” This is repeated over and over again;technological solutions, they claim, will merely create new problems.[Ibid., 138.] Whom and what are [the ecological crusaders] attacking? It is not the luxuriesof the “idle rich,” but the availability of “luxuries” to the broad masses ofpeople. They are denouncing the fact that automobiles, air conditioners andtelevision sets are no longer toys of the rich, but are within the means of anaverage American worker—a beneficence that does not exist and is not fullybelieved anywhere else on earth.What do they regard as the proper life for working people? A life of unrelieveddrudgery, of endless, gray toil, with no rest, no travel, no pleasure—above all,no pleasure. Those drugged, fornicating hedonists do not know that man cannotlive by toil alone, that pleasure is a necessity, and that television hasbrought more enjoyment into more lives than all the public parks and settlementhouses combined.What do they regard as luxury? Anything above the “bare necessities” of physicalsurvival—with the explanation that men would not have to labor so hard if itwere not for the “artificial needs” created by “commercialism” and“materialism.” In reality, the opposite is true: the less the return on yourlabor, the harder the labor. It is much easier to acquire an automobile in NewYork City than a meal in the jungle. Without machines and technology, the taskof mere survival is a terrible, mind-and-body-wrecking ordeal. In “nature,” thestruggle for food, clothing and shelter consumes all of a man’s energy andspirit; it is a losing struggle—the winner is any flood, earthquake or swarm oflocusts. (Consider the 500,000 bodies left in the wake of a single flood inPakistan; they had been men who lived without technology.) To work only for barenecessities is a luxury that mankind cannot afford.[Ibid., 148.] See also ECOLOGY/ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT; ECONOMIC GROWTH; NEW LEFT; POLLUTION;SCIENCE; SOUL-BODY DICHOTOMY. Teleological Measurement. In regard to the concepts pertaining to evaluation(“value,” “emotion,” “feeling,” “desire,” etc.), the hierarchy involved is of adifferent kind and requires an entir;ely different type of measurement. It is atype applicable only to the psychological process of evaluation, and may bedesignated as “teleological measurement. ”Measurement is the identification of a relationship—a quantitative relationshipestablished by means of a standard that serves as a unit. Teleologicalmeasurement deals, not with cardinal, but with ordinal numbers—and the standardserves to establish a graded relationship of means to end.For instance, a moral code is a system of teleological measurement which gradesthe choices and actions open to man, according to the degree to which theyachieve or frustrate the code’s standard of value. The standard is the end, towhich man’s actions are the means.A moral code is a set of abstract principles; to practice it, an individual musttranslate it into the appropriate concretes—he must choose the particular goalsand values which he is to pursue. This requires that he define his particularhierarchy of values, in the order of their importance, and that he actaccordingly. Thus all his actions have to be guided by a process of teleologicalmeasurement. (The degree of uncertainty and contradictions in a man’s hierarchyof values is the degree to which he will be unable to perform such measurementsand will fail in his attempts at value calculations or at purposeful action.)Teleological measurement has to be performed in and against an enormous context:it consists of establishing the relationship of a given choice to all the otherpossible choices and to one’s hierarchy of values.The simplest example of this process, which all men practice (with variousdegrees of precision and success), may be seen in the realm of materialvalues—in the (implicit) principles that guide a man’s spending of money. On anylevel of income, a man’s money is a limited quantity; in spending it, he weighsthe value of his purchase against the value of every other purchase open to himfor the same amount of money, he weighs it against the hierarchy of all hisother goals, desires and needs, then makes the purchase or not accordingly.The same kind of measurement guides man’s actions in the wider realm of moral orspiritual values. (By “spiritual” I mean “pertaining to consciousness.” I say“wider” because it is man’s hierarchy of values in this realm that determineshis hierarchy of values in the material or economic realm.) But the currency ormedium of exchange is different. In the spiritual realm, the currency—whichexists in limited quantity and must be teleologically measured in the pursuit ofany value—is time, i.e., one’s life.[ITOE, 42.] See also CONSCIOUSNESS; LIFE; MEASUREMENT; MONEY; MORALITY; PRINCIPLES; STANDARDof VALUE; ULTIMATE VALUE; VALUES. Teleology. See Goal-Directed Action. Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is a typically American holiday. In spite of itsreligious form (giving thanks to God for a good harvest), its essential, secularmeaning is a celebration of successful production. It is a producers’ holiday.The lavish meal is a symbol of the fact that abundant consumption is the resultand reward of production. Abundance is (or was and ought to be) America’spride—just as it is the pride of American parents that their children need neverknow starvation.[“Cashing in on Hunger,” ARI,, III. 23, 1.]See also AMERICA; CHRISTMAS; PRODUCTION; RELIGION. Theme (Literary). The four essential attributes of a novel are:Theme—Plot—Characterization—Style.These are attributes, not separable parts. They can be isolated conceptually forpurposes of study, but one must always remember that they are interrelated andthat a novel is their sum. (If it is a good novel, it is an indivisible sum.)[“Basic Principles of Literature,” RM, 57; pb 80.] A theme is the summation of a novel’s abstract meaning. For instance, the themeof Atlas Shrugged is: “The role of the mind in man’s existence.” The theme ofVictor Hugo’s Les Misérables is: “The injustice of society toward its lowerclasses.” The theme of Gone With the Wind is: “The impact of the Civil War onSouthern society.”A theme may be specifically philosophical or it may be a narrowergeneralization. It may present a certain moral-philosophical position or apurely historical view, such as the portrayal of a certain society in a certainera. There are no rules or restrictions on the choice of a theme, provided it iscommunicable in the form of a novel. But if a novel has no discernible theme-ifits events add up to nothing—it is a bad novel; its flaw is lack of integration.Louis H. Sullivan’s famous principle of architecture, “Form follows function,”can be translated into: “Form follows purpose.” The theme of a novel defines itspurpose. The theme sets the writer’s standard of selection, directing theinnumerable choices he has to make and serving as the integrator of the novel.Since a novel is a re-cr-eatiorr of reality, its theme has to be dramatized,i.e., presented in terms of action. Life is a process of action. The entirecontent of man’s consciousness-thoughr, knowledge, ideas, values—has only oneultimate form of expression: in his actions; and only one ultimate purpose: toguide his actions. Since the theme of a novel is an idea about or pertaining tohuman existence, it is in terms of its effects on or expression in human actionsthat that idea has to be presented.[Ibid., 58; pb 81.] A cardinal principle of good fiction [is]: the theme and the plot of a novelmust be integrated—as thoroughly integrated as mind and body or thought andaction in a rational view of man.The link between the theme and the events of a novel is an element which I callthe plot-theme. It is the first step of the translation of an abstract themeinto a story, without which the construction of a plot would be impossible. A“plot-theme” is the central conflict or “situation” of a story—a conflict interms of action, corresponding to the theme and complex enough to create apurposeful progression of events.The theme of a novel is the core of its abstract meaning—the plot-theme is thecore of its events.[Ibid., 63; pb 85.]The theme of a novel can he conveyed only through the events of the plot, theevents of the plot depend on the characterization of the men who enact them—andthe characterization cannot be achieved except through the events of the plot,and the plot cannot be constructed without a theme.This is the kind of integration required by the nature of a novel. And this iswhy a good novel is an indivisible sum: every scene, sequence and passage of agood novel has to involve, contribute to and advance all three of its majorattributes: theme, plot, characterization.[Ibid., 74; pb 93.] Those who may be interested in the chronological development of my thinking ...may observe the progression from a political theme in We the Living to ametaphysical theme in Atlas Shrugged.[“Preface,” FNI, ii; pb viii.] [We the Living] was published in 1936 and reissued in 1959. Its theme is: theindividual against the state; the supreme value of a human life and the evil ofthe totalitarian state that claims the right to sacrifice it.[FNI. 69; pb 60.] [Anthem] was first published in England in 1938. Its theme is: the meaning ofman’s ego.[Ibid., 73; pb 64.] [The Fountainhead] was published in 1943. Its theme is: individualism versuscollectivism, not in politics, but in man’s soul; the psychological motivationsand the basic premises that produce the character of an individualist or acollectivist.[Ibid., 77; ph 68.] [Atlas Shrugged] was published in 1957. Its theme is: the role of the mind inman’s existence—and, as corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy:the morality of rational self-interest.[Ibid., 103; pb 88.] See also ART; CHARACTERIZATION; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); LITERATURE; PLOT; PLOTTHEME; SOUL-BODY DICHOTOMY; STYLE; SUBJECT (IN ART). Theory-Practice Dichotomy. [Consider the catch phrase:] “This may be good intheory, but it doesn’t work in practice.” What is a theory? It is a set ofabstract principles purporting to be either a correct description of reality ora set of guidelines for man’s actions. Correspondence to reality is the standardof value by which one estimates a theory. If a theory is inapplicable toreality, by what standard can it be estimated as “good”? If one were to acceptthat notion, it would mean: a. that the activity of man’s mind is unrelated toreality; b. that the purpose of thinking is neither to acquire knowledge nor toguide man’s actions. (The purpose of that catch phrase is to invalidate man’sconceptual faculty.)[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 17; pb 14.]See also PLATONIC REALISM; PRAGMATISM; PRINCIPLES; RATIONALISM vs. EMPIRICISM;SOUL-BODY DICHOTOMY. Thought/Thinking. The process of thinking ... is the process of definingidentity and discovering causal connections.[GS, FNI, 189; pb 152.] The faculty that works by means of concepts, is: reason. The process isthinking.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 12; pb 20.] All thinking is a process of identification and integration. Man perceives ablob of color; by integrating the evidence of his sight and his touch, he learnsto identify it as a solid object; he learns to identify the object as a table;he learns that the table is made of wood; he learns that the wood consists ofcells, that the cells consist of molecules, that the molecules consist of atoms.All through this process, the work of his mind consists of answers to a singlequestion: What is it? His means to establish the truth of his answers is logic,and logic rests on the axiom that existence exists. Logic is the art ofnon-contradictory identification. A contradiction cannot exist. An atom isitself, and so is the universe; neither can contradict its own identity; nor cana part contradict the whole. No concept man forms is valid unless he integratesit without contradiction into the total sum of his knowledge. To arrive at acontradiction is to confess an error in one’s thinking; to maintain acontradiction is to abdicate one’s mind and to evict oneself from the realm ofreality.[GS, FNI, 153; pb 125.] That which you call your soul or spirit is your consciousness, and that whichyou call “free will” is your mind’s freedom to think or not, the only will youhave, your only freedom, the choice that controls all the choices you make anddetermines your life and your character.[Ibid., 155; pb 127.]Thinking is not an automatic function. In any hour and issue of his life, man isfree to think or to evade that effort. Thinking requires a state of full,focused awareness. The act of focusing one’s consciousness is volitional.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 13; pb 20.] Psychologically, the choice “to think or not” is the choice “to focus or not.”Existentially, the choice “to focus or not” is the choice “to be conscious ornot.” Metaphysically, the choice “to be conscious or not” is the choice of lifeor death.[Ibid., 13; pb 21.] Thinking is man’s only basic virtue, from which all the others proceed. And hisbasic vice, the source of all his evils, is that nameless act which all of youpractice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, the willfulsuspension of one’s consciousness, the refusal to think-not blindness, but therefusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act ofunfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility ofjudgment-on the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuseto identify it, that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict“It is.” Non-thinking is an act of annihilation, a wish to negate existence, anattempt to wipe out reality. But existence exists; reality is not to be wipedout, it will merely wipe out the wiper. By refusing to say “It is,” you arerefusing to say “I am.” By suspending your judgment, you are negating yourperson. When a man declares: ‘Who am I to know?’—he is declaring: “Who am I tolive?”This, in every hour and every issue, is your basic moral choice: thinking ornon-thinking, existence or non-existence, A or non-A, entity or zero. [GS, FNI, 155; pb 127.] If devotion to truth is the hallmark of morality, then there is no greater,nobler, more heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes theresponsibility of thinking.[Ibid.] Thinking is a delicate, difficult process, which man cannot perform unlessknowledge is his goal, logic is his method, and the judgment of his mind is hisguiding absolute. Thought requires selfishness, the fundamental selfishness of arational faculty that places nothing above the integrity of its own function.A man cannot think if he places something-anything-above his perception ofreality. He cannot follow the evidence unswervingly or uphold his conclusionsintransigently, while regarding compliance with other men as his moralimperative, self-abasement as his highest virtue, and sacrifice as his primaryduty. He cannot use his brain while surrendering his sovereignty over it, i.e.,while accepting his neighbors as its owner and term-setter. [Leonard Peikoff, OP, 334; pb 308.] The concept “thought” is formed by retaining the distinguishing characteristicsof the psychological action (a purposefully directed process of cognition) andby omitting the particular contents as well as the degree of the intellectualeffort’s intensity.[ITOE, 41.] The intensity of a process of thought and of the intellectual effort requiredvaries according to the scope of its content; it varies when one grasps theconcept “table” or the concept “justice,” when one grasps that 2 + 2 = 4 or thate = mc2.[[bid., 40.] See also CAUSALITY; CONCEPT-FORMATION; CONCEPTS; CREATION ; EVASION; FOCUS; FREEWILL; IDENTITY; IMAGINATION; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); IRRATIONALITY; LOGIC;RATIONALITY; REASON ; SELFISHNESS; UNDERSTANDING; VIRTUE. Thrillers. “Thrillers” are detective, spy or adventure stories. Their basiccharacteristic is conflict, which means: a clash of goals, which means:purposeful action in pursuit of values. Thrillers are the product, the popularoffshoot, of the Romantic school of art that sees man, not as a helpless pawn offate, but as a being who possesses volition, whose life is directed by his ownvalue-choices. Romanticism is a value-oriented, morality-centered movement: itsmaterial is not journalistic minutiae, but the abstract, the essential, theuniversal principles of man’s nature -and its basic literary commandment is toportray man “as he might be and ought to be.”Thrillers are a simplified, elementary version of Romantic literature. They arenot concerned with a delineation of values, but, taking certain fundamentalvalues for granted, they are concerned with only one aspect of a moral being’sexistence: the battle of good against evil in terms of purposeful action-adramatized abstraction of the basic pattern of: choice, goal, conflict, danger,struggle, victory.Thrillers are the kindergarten arithmetic, of which the higher mathematics isthe greatest novels of world literature. Thrillers deal only with theskeleton-the plot structure—to which serious Romantic literature adds the Hesh,the blood, the mind. The plots in the novels of Victor Hugo or Dostoevsky arepure thriller-plots, unequaled and unsurpassed by the writers of thrillers....Thrillers are the last refuge of the qualities that have vanished from modernliterature: life, color, imagination; they are like a mirror still holding adistant reflection of man.[“Bootleg Romanticism,” RM, 124; pb 132.] Nobody takes thrillers literally, nor cares about their specific events, norharbors any frustrated desire to become a secret agent or a private eye.Thrillers are taken symbolically; they dramatize one of man’s widest and mostcrucial abstractions: the abstraction of moral conflict.What people seek in thrillers is the spectacle of man’s efficacy: of his abilityto fight for his values and to achieve them. What they see is a condensed,simplified pattern, reduced to its essentials: a man fighting for a vitalgoal—overcoming one obstacle after another-facing terrible dangers andrisks-persisting through an excruciating struggle-and winning.[Ibid., 133; pb 138.] What men find in the spectacle of the ultimate triumph of the good is theinspiration to fight for one’s own values in the moral conflicts of one’s ownlife.[Ibid., 134; pb 139.]See also LITERATURE; POPULAR LITERATURE; ROMANTICISM; VALUES. Time. Time is a measurement of motion; as such, it is a type of relationship.Time applies only within the universe, when you define a standard-such as themotion of the earth around the sun. If you take that as a unit, you can say:“This person has a certain relationship to that motion; he has existed for threerevolutions; he is three years old.” But when you get to the universe as awhole, obviously no standard is applicable. You cannot get outside the universe.The universe is eternal in the literal sense: non-temporal, out of time.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976),question period, Lecture 2.]See also EXISTENCE; MEASUREMENT; MOTION; SPACE; UNIVERSE. Trader Principle. The symbol of all relationships among [rational] men, themoral symbol of respect for human beings, is the trader. We, who live by values,not by loot, are traders, both in matter and in spirit. A trader is a man whoearns what he gets and does not give or take the undeserved. A trader does notask to be paid for his failures, nor does he ask to be loved for his flaws. Atrader does not squander his body as fodder or his soul as alms. Just as he doesnot give his work except in trade for material values, so he does not give thevalues of his spirit-his love, his friendship, his esteem-except in payment andin trade for human virtues, in payment for his own selfish pleasure, which hereceives from men he can respect. The mystic parasites who have, throughout theages, reviled the traders and held them in contempt, while honoring the beggarsand the looters, have known the secret motive of their sneers: a trader is theentity they dread-a man of justice.[GS, FNI, 163; pb 133.] There is no conflict of interests among men who do not desire the unearned, whodo not make sacrifices nor accept them, who deal with one another as traders,giving value for value.The principle of trade is the only rational ethical principle for all humanrelationships, personal and social, private and public, spiritual and material.It is the principle of justice.A trader is a man who earns what he gets and does not give or take theundeserved. He does not treat men as masters or slaves, but as independentequals. He deals with men by means of a free, voluntary, unforced, uncoercedexchange-an exchange which benefits both parties by their own independentjudgment. A trader does not expect to be paid for his defaults, only for hisachievements. He does not switch to others the burden of his failures, and hedoes not mortgage his life into bondage to the failures of others.In spiritual issues-(by “spiritual” I mean: “pertaining to man’s consciousness”)—the currency or medium of exchange is different, but the principle is the same.Love, friendship, respect, admiration are the emotional response of one man tothe virtues of another, the spiritual payment given in exchange for thepersonal, selfish pleasure which one man derives from the virtues of anotherman’s character. Only a brute or an altruist would claim that the appreciationof another person’s virtues is an act of selflessness, that as far as one’s ownselfish interest and pleasure are concerned, it makes no difference whether onedeals with a genius or a fool, whether one meets a hero or a thug, whether onemarries an ideal woman or a slut. In spiritual issues, a trader is a man whodoes not seek to be loved for his weaknesses or flaws, only for his virtues, andwho does not grant his love to the weaknesses or the flaws of others, only totheir virtues[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 28; pb 31.]The trader and the warrior have been fundamental antagonists throughout history.Trade does not flourish on battlefields, factories do not produce underbombardments, profits do not grow on rubble. Capitalism is a society oftraders—for which it has been denounced by every would-be gunman who regardstrade as “selfish” and conquest as “noble.”[“The Roots of War,” CUI, 38.]See also ALTRUISM CAPITALISM; ECONOMIC POWER vs. POLITICAL POWER; FREE MARKET ;FREEDOM; JUSTICE; LOVE; MARKET VALUE; PHYSICAL. FORCE; PURCHASING POWER;SELFISHNESS; SERVICE; SOUL-BODY DICHOTOMY; VALUES; WAR. Tradition. The “neo-conservatives” are now trying to tell us that America wasthe product of “faith in revealed truths” and of uncritical respect for thetraditions of the past (!).It is certainly irrational to use the “new” as a standard of value, to believethat an idea or a policy is good merely because it is new. But it is much morepreposterously irrational to use the “old” as a standard of value, to claim thatan idea or a policy is good merely because it is ancient. The “liberals” areconstantly asserting that they represent the future, that they are “new,”“progressive,” “forward-looking,” etc.-and they denounce the “conservatives” asold-fashioned representatives of a dead past. The “conservatives” concede it,and thus help the “liberals” to propagate one of today’s most grotesqueinversions: collectivism, the ancient, frozen, status society, is offered to usin the name of progress—while capitalism, the only free, dynamic, creativesociety ever devised, is defended in the name of stagnation .The plea to preserve “Tradition” as such, can appeal only to those who havegiven up or to those who never intended to achieve anything in life. It is aplea that appeals to the worst elements in men and rejects the best: it appealsto fear, sloth, cowardice, conformity, self-doubt-and rejects creativeness,originality, courage, independence, self-reliance. It is an outrageous plea toaddress to human beings anywhere, but particularly outrageous here, in America,the country based on the principle that man must stand on his own feet, live byhis own judgment, and move constantly forward as a productive, creativeinnovator.The argument that we must respect “tradition” as such, respect it merely becauseit is a “tradition,” means that we must accept the values other men have chosen,merely because other men have chosen them-with the necessary implication of: whoare we to change them? The affront to a man’s self-esteem, in such an argument,and the profound contempt for man’s nature are obvious.[“Conservatism: An Obituary,” CUI, 198.]America was created by men who broke with all political traditions and whooriginated a system unprecedented in history, relying on nothing but the“unaided” power of their own intellect.[ibid.] See also AMERICA; ANTI-CONCEPTUAL MENTALITY; “CONSERVATIVES ”; CULTURE;“ETHNICITY”; FAITH; HISTORY; INDIVIDUALISM; TRIBALISM. Tribal Premise (in Economics). The basic premise of crude, primitive tribalcollectivism [is] the notion that wealth belongs to the tribe or to society as awhole, and that every individual has the “right” to “participate” in it.[Review of Shirley Scheibla’s Poverty Is Where the Money Is, TO, Aug. 1969, 11.] The tribal premise underlies today’s political economy. That premise is sharedby the enemies and the champions of capitalism alike; it provides the formerwith a certain inner consistency, and disarms the latter by a subtle, yetdevastating aura of moral hypocrisy—as witness, their attempts to justifycapitalism on the ground of “the common good” or “service to the consumer” or“the best allocation of resources.” (Whose resources?)If capitalism is to be understood, it is this tribal premise that has to bechecked-and challenged.Mankind is not an entity, an organism, or a coral bush. The entity involved inproduction and trade is man. It is with the study of man-not of the looseaggregate known as a “community”—that any science of the humanities has tobegin.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 14.] Political economists-including the advocates of capitalism-defined their scienceas the study of the management or direction or organization or manipulation of a“community’s” or a nation’s “resources.” The nature of these “resources” was notdefined; their communal ownership was taken for granted-and the goal ofpolitical economy was assumed to be the study of how to utilize these“resources” for “the common good.”The fact that the principal “resource” involved was man himself, that he was anentity of a specific nature with specific capacities and requirements, was giventhe most superficial attention, if any. Man was regarded simply as one of thefactors of production, along with land, forests, or mines-as one of the lesssignificant factors, since more study was devoted to the influence and qualityof these others than to his role or quality.Political economy was, in effect, a science starting in midstream: it observedthat men were producing and trading, it took for granted that they had alwaysdone so and always would-it accepted this fact as the given, requiring nofurther consideration-and it addressed itself to the problem of how to devisethe best way for the “community” to dispose of human effort.[ibid., 12.] A great deal may be learned about society by studying man; but this processcannot be reversed: nothing can be learned about man by studying society-bystudying the inter-relationships of entities one has never identified ordefined. Yet that is the methodology adopted by most political economists. Theirattitude, in effect, amounts to the unstated, implicit postulate: “Man is thatwhich fits economic equations.” Since he obviously does not, this leads to thecurious fact that in spite of the practical nature of their science, politicaleconomists are oddly unable to relate their abstractions to the concretes ofactual existence.[Ibid., 15.] See also CAPITALISM; COLLECTIVISM; “COMMON GOOD”; INDIVIDUALISM ; MAN;PRODUCTION; “REDISTRIBUTION” of WEALTH; SERVICE; TRIBALISM. Tribalism. Tribalism (which is the best name to give to all the groupmanifestations of the anti-conceptual mentality) is a dominant element inEurope, as a reciprocally reinforcing cause and result of Europe’s long historyof caste systems, of national and local (provincial) chauvinism, of rule bybrute force and endless, bloody wars. As an example, observe the Balkan nations,which are perennially bent upon exterminating one another over minusculedifferences of tradition or language. Tribalism had no place in the UnitedStates-until recent decades. It could not take root here, its imported seedlingswere withering away and turning to slag in the melting pot whose fire was fed bytwo inexhaustible sources of energy: individual rights and objective law; thesetwo were the only protection man needed.[“The Missing Link,” PWNI, 51; pb 42.] What are the nature and the causes of modern tribalism? Philosophically,tribalism is the product of irrationalism and collectivism. It is a logicalconsequence of modern philosophy. If men accept the notion that reason is notvalid, what is to guide them and how are they to live? Obviously, they will seekto join some group-any group-which claims the ability to lead them and toprovide some sort of knowledge acquired by some sort of unspecified means. Ifmen accept the notion that the individual is helpless, intellectually andmorally, that he has no mind and no rights, that he is nothing, but the group isall, and his only moral significance lies in selfless service to the group-theywill be pulled obediently to join a group. But which group? Well, if you believethat you have no mind and no moral value, you cannot have the confidence to makechoices-so the only thing for you to do is to join an unchosen group, the groupinto which you were born, the group to which you were predestined to belong bythe sovereign, omnipotent, omniscient power of your body chemistry.This, of course, is racism. But if your group is small enough, it will not becalled “racism”: it will be called “ethnicity.”[“Global Balkanization,” pamphlet, 5.] A symptom of the tribal mentality’s self-arrested, perceptual level ofdevelopment may be observed in the tribalists’ position on language.Language is a conceptual tool—a code of visual-auditory symbols that denoteconcepts. To a person who understands the function of language, it makes nodifference what sounds are chosen to name things, provided these sounds refer toclearly defined aspects of reality. But to a tribalist, language is a mysticheritage, a string of sounds handed down from his ancestors and memorized, notunderstood. To him, the importance lies in the perceptual concrete, the souud ofa word, not its meaning. He would kill and die for the privilege of printing onevery postage stamp the word “postage” for the English-speaking and the word“postes” for the French-speaking citizens of his bilingual Canada. Since most ofthe ethnic languages are not full languages, but merely dialects or localcorruptions of a country’s language, the distinctions which the tribalists fightfor are not even as big as that.But, of course, it is not for their language that the tribalists are fighting :they are fighting to protect their level of awareness, their mental passivity,their obedience to the tribe, and their desire to ignore the existence ofoutsiders.[Ibid., 8.] It is obvious why the morality of altruism is a tribal phenomenon. Prehistoricalmen were physically unable to survive without clinging to a tribe for leadershipand protection against other tribes. The cause of altruism’s perpetuation intocivilized eras is not physical, but psycho-epistemological : the men ofself-arrested, perceptual mentality are unable to survive without triballeadership and “protection” against reality. The doctrine of self-sacrifice doesnot offend them: they have no sense of self or of personal value-they do notknow what it is that they are asked to sacrifice-they have no firsthand inklingof such things as intellectual integrity, love of truth, personally chosenvalues, or a passionate dedication to an idea. When they hear injunctionsagainst “selfishness,” they believe that what they must renounce is the brute,mindless whim-worship of a tribal lone wolf. But their leaders—the theoreticiansof altruism-know better. Immanuel Kant knew it; John Dewey knew it; B. F.Skinner knows it; John Rawls knows it. Observe that it is not the mindlessbrute, but reason, intelligence, ability, merit, self-confidence, self-esteemthat they are out to destroy.Today, we are seeing a ghastly spectacle: a magnificent scientific civilizationdominated by the morality of prehistorical savagery.[“Selfishness Without a Self,” PWNI, 61; pb 50.]See also ALTRUISM; AMERICA; AMORALISM; ANTI-CONCEPTUAL MENTALITY; COLLECTIVISM;“ETHNICITY”; INDIVIDUALISM; IRRATIONALISM; KANT, IMMANUEL; LANGUAGE;PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY; RACISM; REASON; SELF; SELF-ESTEEM; SELFISHNESS; STATISM. Truth. Truth is the recognition of reality; reason, man’s only means ofknowledge, is his only standard of truth.[GS, FNI, 154; pb 126.] Truth is the product of the recognition (i.e., identification) of the facts ofreality. Man identifies and integrates the facts of reality by means ofconcepts. He retains concepts in his mind by means of definitions. He organizesconcepts into propositions-and the truth or falsehood of his propositions rests,not only on their relation to the facts he asserts, but also on the truth orfalsehood of the definitions of the concepts he uses to assert them, which restson the truth or falsehood of his designations of essential characteristics.[ITOE, 63.] The truth or falsehood of all of man’s conclusions, inferences, thought andknowledge rests on the truth or falsehood of his definitions.[Ibid., 65.] Every truth about a given existent(s) reduces, in basic pattern, to: “X is: oneor more of the things which it is.” The predicate in such a case states somecharacteristic(s) of the subject; but since it is a characteristic of thesubject, the concept(s) designating the subject in fact includes the predicatefrom the outset. If one wishes to use the term “tautology” in this context, thenall truths are “tautological.” (And, by the same reasoning, all falsehoods areself-contradictions.)When making a statement about an existent, one has, ultimately, only twoalternatives: “X (which means X, the existent, including all itscharacteristics) is what it is”—or: “X is not what it is.” The choice betweentruth and falsehood is the choice between “tautology” (in the sense explained)and self-contradiction.In the realm of propositions, there is only one basic epistemologicaldistinction: truth vs. falsehood, and only one fundamental issue: By what methodis truth discovered and validated? To plant a dichotomy at the base of humanknowledge-to claim that there are opposite methods of validation and oppositetypes of truth [as do the advocates of the “analytic-synthetic” dichotomy] is aprocedure without grounds or justification.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,” ITOE, 136.] The existence of human volition cannot be used to justify the theory that thereis a dichotomy of propositions or of truths. Propositions about metaphysicalfacts, and propositions about man-made facts, do not have differentcharacteristics qua propositions. They differ merely in their subject matter,but then so do the propositions of astronomy and of immunology. Truths aboutmetaphysical and about man-made facts are learned and validated by the sameprocess: by observation; and, qua truths, both are equally necessary. Some factsare not necessary, but all truths are.Truth is the identification of a fact of reality. Whether the fact in questionis metaphysical or man-made, the fact determines the truth: if the fact exists,there is no alternative in regard to what is true. For instance, the fact thatthe U.S. has 50 states was not metaphysically necessary-but as long as this ismen’s choice, the proposition that “The U.S. has 50 states” is necessarily true.A true proposition must describe the facts as they are. In this sense, a“necessary truth” is a redundancy, and a “contingent truth” aself-contradiction.[Ibid., 150.] [Consider the catch phrase:] “It may be true for you, but it’s not true for me.”What is the meaning of the concept “truth”? Truth is the recognition of reality.(This is known as the correspondence theory of truth.) The same thing cannot betrue and untrue at the same time and in the same respect. That catch phrase,therefore, means: a. that the Law of Identity is invalid; b. that there is noobjectively perceivable reality, only some indeterminate flux which is nothingin particular, i.e., that there is no reality (in which case, there can be nosuch thing as truth); or c. that the two debaters perceive two differentuniverses (in which case, no debate is possible). (The purpose of the catchphrase is the destruction of objectivity.)[“Philosophical Detection,” PWNI, 16; pb 14.]See also ANALYTIC-SYNTHETIC DICHOTOMY; CONCEPTS; CONTRADICTIONS; DEFINITIONS;EXISTENCE; FALSEHOOD; HONESTY; IDENTITY; LOGIC; METAPHYSICAL vs. MAN-MADE;NECESSITY; OBJECTIVITY; PRIMACY of EXISTENCE vs. PRIMACY of CONSCIOUSNESS;PROPOSITIONS; REASON. Tyranny. Tyranny is any political system (whether absolute monarchy or fascismor communism) that does not recognize individual rights (which necessarilyinclude property rights). The overthrow of a political system by force isjustified only when it is directed against tyranny: it is an act of self-defenseagainst those who rule by force. For example, the American Revolution.[“From a Symposium,” NL, 96.]See also DICTATORSHIP; GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; PHYSICAL FORCE; POLITICS;PROPERTY RIGHTS; STATISM."},{"pageContent":"UUltimate Value. An ultimate value is that final goal or end to which all lessergoals are the means-and it sets the standard by which all lesser goals areevaluated. An organism’s life is its standard of value: that which furthers itslife is the good, that which threatens it is the evil.Without an ultimate goal or end, there can be no lesser goals or means: a seriesof means going off into an infinite progression toward a nonexistent end is ametaphysical and epistemological impossibility. It is only an ultimate goal, anend in itself, that makes the existence of values possible. Metaphysically, lifeis the only phenomenon that is an end in itself: a value gained and kept by aconstant process of action. Epistemologically, the concept of “value” isgenetically dependent upon and derived from the antecedent concept of “life.” Tospeak of “value” as apart from “life” is worse than a contradiction in terms.“It is only the concept of ‘Life’ that makes the concept of ‘Value’ possible.”[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 7; pb 17.] The maintenance of life and the pursuit of happiness are not two separateissues. To hold one’s own life as one’s ultimate value, and one’s own happinessas one’s highest purpose are two aspects of the same achievement. Existentially,the activity of pursuing rational goals is the activity of maintaining one’slife; psychologically, its result, reward and concomitant is an emotional stateof happiness. It is by experiencing happiness that one lives one’s life, in anyhour, year or the whole of it. And when one experiences the kind of purehappiness that is an end in itself-the kind that makes one think: “This is worthliving for”—what one is greeting and affirming in emotional terms is themetaphysical fact that life is an end in itself.[Ibid., 25; pb 29.] See also EMOTIONS; GOAL-DIRECTED ACTION; HAPPINESS; HIERARCHY of KNOWLEDGE;LIFE; METAPHYSICAL; STANDARD of VALUE; “STOLEN CONCEPT,” FALLACY of; VALUES. Understanding. To understand means to focus on the content of a given subject(as against the sensory-visual or auditory-form in which it is communicated), toisolate its essentials, to establish its relationship to the previously known,and to integrate it with the appropriate categories of other subjects.Integration is the essential part of understanding.The predominance of memorizing is proper only in the first few years of achild’s education, while he is observing and gathering perceptual material. Fromthe time he reaches the conceptual level (i.e., from the time he learns tospeak), his education requires a progressively larger scale of understanding andprogressively smaller amounts of memorizing.[“The Comprachicos,” NI 208.] See also CONCEPTS; EDUCATION; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); KNOWLEDGE; LEARNING;PERCEPTION; REASON. Unemployment. See Unions. Unions. The artificially high wages forced on the economy by compulsory unionismimposed economic hardships on other groups-particularly on non-union workers andon unskilled labor, which was being squeezed gradually out of the market.Today’s widespread unemployment is the result of organized labor’s privilegesand of allied measures, such as minimum wage laws. For years, the unionssupported these measures and sundry welfare legislation, apparently in thebelief that the costs would be paid by taxes imposed on the rich. The growth ofinflation has shown that the major victim of government spending and of taxationis the middle class. Organized labor is part of the middle class-and the actualvalue of labor’s forced “social gains” is now being wiped out.[“A Preview,” ARL, 1, 23, 2.] Organized labor has been much more sensitive to the danger of government powerand much more aware of ideological issues. Its spokesmen have fought thegovernment in proper, morally confident terms whenever they saw a threat totheir rights. (To name a few examples of such occasions: the attempt at laborconscription in World War II, the issue of U.S. contributions to theSoviet-dominated International Labor Organization, President Kennedy’s attemptto impose guidelines in the steel crisis of 1962.) Labor’s concern was arousedonly in defense of its rights; still, whoever defends his own rights defends therights of all. But labor was pursuing a contradictory policy, which could not bemaintained for long. In many issues-notably in its support of welfare-statelegislation - labor violated the rights of others and fertilized the growth ofthe government’s power. And, today, labor is in line to become the next majorvictim of advancing statism.It was business, not labor, that initiated the policy of government interventionin the economy (as long ago as the nineteenth century)— and business was thefirst victim. Labor adopted the same policy and will meet the same fate. He wholives by a legalized sword, will perish by a legalized sword.[“The Moratorium on Brains, ARL, I, 3, 2.] See also CAPITALISM; FREE MARKET; INFLATION; MIDDLE CLASS; MONEY: POVERTY. Unit. The ability to regard entities as units is man’s distinctive method ofcognition, which other living species are unable to follow.A unit is an existent regarded as a separate member of a group of two or moresimilar members. (Two stones are two units; so are two square feet of ground, ifregarded as distinct parts of a continuous stretch of ground.) Note that theconcept “unit” involves an act of consciousness (a selective focus, a certainway of regarding things), but that it is not an arbitrary creation ofconsciousness: it is a method of identification or classification according tothe attributes which a consciousness observes in reality. This method permitsany number of classifications and cross-classifications : one may classifythings according to their shape or color or weight or size or atomic structure;but the criterion of classification is not invented, it is perceived in reality.Thus the concept “unit” is a bridge between metaphysics and epistemology: unitsdo not exist qua units, what exists are things, but units are things viewed by aconsciousness in certain existing relationships.[ITOE, 7.] With the grasp of the (implicit) concept “unit,” man reaches the conceptuallevel of cognition which consists of two interrelated fields: the conceptual andthe mathematical. The process of concept-formation is, in large part, amathematical process.[Ibid., 8.] A “number” is a mental symbol that integrates units into a single larger unit(or subdivides a unit into fractions) with reference to the basic number of“one,” which is the basic mental symbol of “unit.” Thus “5” stands for | | | | |. (Metaphysically, the referents of ”5” are any five existents of a specifiedkind; epistemologically, they are represented by a single symbol.)[Ibid., 84.] See also CONCEPT-FORMATION; CONCEPTS; EPISTEMOLOGY; IMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE;INTEGRATION (MENTAL); MEASUREMENT; METAPHYSICS; NUMBER; UNIT-ECONOMY; WORDS.Unit-Economy. Since consciousness is a specific faculty, it has a specificnature or identity and, therefore, its range is limited: it cannot perceiveeverything at once; since awareness, on all its levels, requires an activeprocess, it cannot do everything at once. Whether the units with which one dealsare percepts or concepts, the range of what man can hold in the focus of hisconscious awareness at any given moment, is limited. The essence, therefore, ofman’s incomparable cognitive power is the ability to reduce a vast amount ofinformation to a minimal number of units-which is the task performed by hisconceptual faculty. And the principle of unit-economy is one of that faculty’sessential guiding principles.[ITOE, 83.] In any given moment, concepts enable man to hold in the focus of his consciousawareness much more than his purely perceptual capacity would permit. The rangeof man’s perceptual awareness-the number of percepts he can deal with at any onetime-is limited. He may be able to visualize four or five units-as, forinstance, five trees. He cannot visualize a hundred trees or a distance of tenlight-years. It is only his conceptual faculty that makes it possible for him todeal with knowledge of that kind.[“The Psycho-Epistemology of Art,” RM, 19; pb 17. ] Conceptualization is a method of expanding man’s consciousness by reducing thenumber of its content’s units-a systematic means to an unlimited integration ofcognitive data.A concept substitutes one symbol (one word) for the enormity of the perceptualaggregate of the concretes it subsumes. In order to perform its unit-reducingfunction, the symbol has to become automatized in a man’s consciousness, i.e.,the enormous sum of its referents must be instantly (implicitly) available tohis conscious mind whenever he uses that concept, without the need of perceptualvisualization or mental summarizing-in the same manner as the concept “5” doesnot require that he visualize five sticks every time he uses it.For example, if a man has fully grasped the concept “justice,” he does not needto recite to himself a long treatise on its meaning, while he listens to theevidence in a court case. The mere sentence “I must be just” holds that meaningin his mind automatically, and leaves his conscious attention free to grasp theevidence and to evaluate it according to a complex set of principles. (And, incase of doubt, the conscious recall of the precise meaning of “justice” provideshim with the guidelines he needs.)It is the principle of unit-economy that necessitates the definition of conceptsin terms of essential characteristics. If, when in doubt, a man recalls aconcept’s definition, the essential characteristic(s) will give him aninstantaneous grasp of the concept’s meaning, i.e., of the nature of itsreferents.[ITOE., 85.] See also AUTOMATIZATION; CONSCIOUSNESS; DEFINITIONS; IDENTITY; MEANING (ofCONCEPTS); PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY; “RAND’S RAZOR”; WORDS. United Nations. Psychologically, the U.N. has contributed a great deal to thegray swamp of demoralization—of cynicism, bitterness, hopelessness, fear andnameless guilt-which is swallowing the Western world. But the communist worldhas gained a moral sanction, a stamp of civilized respectability from theWestern world-it has gained the West’s assistance in deceiving its victims-ithas gained the status and prestige of an equal partner, thus establishing thenotion that the difference between human rights and mass slaughter is merely adifference of political opinion.The declared goal of the communist countries is the conquest of the world. Whatthey stand to gain from a collaboration with the (relatively) free countries isthe latter’s material, financial, scientific, and intellectual resources; thefree countries have nothing to gain from the communist countries. Therefore, theonly form of common policy or compromise possible between two such parties isthe policy of property owners who make piecemeal concessions to an armed thug inexchange for his promise not to rob them.The U.N. has delivered a larger part of the globe’s surface and population intothe power of Soviet Russia than Russia could ever hope to conquer by armedforce. The treatment accorded to Katanga versus the treatment accorded toHungary, is a sufficient example of U.N. policies. An institution allegedlyformed for the purpose of using the united might of the world to stop anaggressor, has become means of using the united might of the world to force thesurrender of one helpless country after another into the aggressor’s power.Who, but a concrete-bound epistemological savage, could have expected any otherresults from such an “experiment in collaboration”? What would you expect from acrime-fighting committee whose board of directors included the leading gangstersof the community?[“The Anatomy of Compromise,” CUI, 148.] When an institution reaches the degree of corruption, brazen cynicism anddishonor demonstrated by the U.N. in its shameful history, to discuss it atlength is to imply that its members and supporters may possibly be making aninnocent error about its nature-which is no longer possible. There is no marginfor error about a monstrosity that was created for the alleged purpose ofpreventing wars by uniting the world against any aggressor, but proceeded tounite it against any victim of aggression. The expulsion of a charter member,the Republic of China —an action forbidden by the U.N.’s own Charter—was a“moment of truth,” a naked display of the United Nations’ soul.What was Red China’s qualification for membership in the U.N.? ‘The fact thather government seized power by force, and has maintained it for twenty-two yearsby terror.

The universe is the total of that which exists-not merely the earth orthe stars or the galaxies, but everything. Obviously then there can be no suchthing as the “cause” of the universe....Is the universe then unlimited in size? No. Everything which exists is finite,including the universe. What then, you ask, is outside the universe, if it isfinite? This question is invalid. The phrase “outside the universe” has noreferent. The universe is everything. “Outside the universe” stands for “thatwhich is where everything isn’t.” There is no such place. There isn’t evennothing “out there”: there is no “out there.”[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976), Lecture2.] To grasp the axiom that existence exists, means to grasp the fact that nature,i.e., the universe as a whole, cannot be created or annihilated, that it cannotcome into or go out of existence. Whether its basic constituent elements areatoms, or subatomic particles, or some yet undiscovered forms of energy, it isnot ruled by a consciousness or by will or by chance, but by the Law ofIdentity. All the countless forms, motions, combinations and dissolutions ofelements within the universe-from a floating speck of dust to the formation of agalaxy to the emergence of life-are caused and determined by the identities ofthe elements involved. Nature is the metaphysically given—i.e., the nature ofnature is outside the power of any volition.[“The Metaphysical Versus the Man-Made,” PWNI, 30; pb 25.]See also CAUSALITY; EXISTENCE; IDENTITY; INFINITY; METAPHYSICAL vs. MAN-MADE;METAPHYSICS; NATURE; SPACE; TIME.U.S.S.R. See Soviet Russia. Utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is a union of hedonism and Christianity. Thefirst teaches man to love pleasure; the second, to love his neighbor. The unionconsists in teaching man to love his neighbor’s pleasure. To be exact, theUtilitarians teach that an action is moral if its result is to maximize pleasureamong men in general. This theory holds that man’s duty is to serve-according toa purely quantitative standard of value. He is to serve not the well-being ofthe nation or of the economic class, but “the greatest happiness of the greatestnumber,” regardless of who comprise it in any given issue. As to one’s ownhappiness, says [John Stuart] Mill, the individual must he “disinterested” and“strictly impartial”; he must remember that he is only one unit out of thedozens, or millions, of men affected by his actions. “All honor to those who canabnegate for themselves the personal enjoyment of life,” says Mill, “when bysuch renunciation they contribute worthily to increase the amount of happinessin the world.”[Leonard Peikoft, OP, 122; pb 119.] “The greatest good for the greatest number” is one of the most vicious slogansever foisted on humanity.This slogan has no concrete, specific meaning. There is no way to interpret itbenevolently, but a great many ways in which it can be used to justify the mostvicious actions.What is the definition of “the good” in this slogan? None, except: whatever isgood for the greatest number. Who, in any particular issue, decides what is goodfot the greatest number? Why, the greatest number.If you consider this moral, you would have to approve of the following examples,which are exact applications of this slogan in practice: fifty-one percent ofhumanity enslaving the other forty-nine; nine hungry cannibals eating the tenthone; a lynching mob murdering a man whom they consider dangerous to thecommunity.There were seventy million Germans in Germany and six hundred thousand Jews. Thegreatest number (the Germans) supported the Nazi government which told them thattheir greatest good would be served by exterminating the smaller number (theJews) and grabbing their property. This was the horror achieved in practice by avicious slogan accepted in theory.But, you might say, the majority in all these examples did not achieve any realgood for itself either? No. It didn’t. Because “the good” is not determined bycounting numbers and is not achieved by the sacrifice of anyone to anyone.[“Textbook of Americanism,” pamphlet, 10.]See also ALTRUISM; COLLECTIVISM; GOOD, the; HAPPINESS; HEDONISM; INDIVIDUALRIGHTS; MILL, JOHN STUART; MORALITY; PLEASURE and PAIN; SACRIFICE; SELFISHNESS."},{"pageContent":"VValidation. “Validation” in the broad sense includes any process of relatingmental contents to the facts of reality. Direct perception, the method ofvalidating axioms, is one such process. “Proof” designates another type ofvalidation. Proof is the process of deriving a conclusion logically fromantecedent knowledge.[Leonard Peikoff, “The Philosophy of Objectivism” lecture series (1976),question period, Lecture 3.]See also AXIOMS; COROLLARIES; EPISTEMOLOGY; INDUCTION and DEDUCTION; LOGIC;OBJECTIVITY; PROOF; SELF-EVIDENT. Values. To challenge the basic premise of any discipline, one must begin at thebeginning. In ethics, one must begin by asking: What are values? Why does manneed them?“Value” is that which one acts to gain and/or keep. The concept “value” is not aprimary; it presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and forwhat? It presupposes an entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the faceof an alternative. Where no alternative exists, no goals and no values arepossible.I quote from Galt’s speech: “There is only one fundamental alternative in theuniverse: existence or nonexistence-and it pertains to a single class ofentities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter isunconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course ofaction. Matter is indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease toexist. It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issueof life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generatedaction. If an organism fails in that action, it dies; its chemical elementsremain, but its life goes out of existence. It is only the concept of ‘Life’that makes the concept of ‘Value’ possible. It is only to a living entity thatthings can be good or evil.”To make this point fully clear, try to imagine an immortal, indestructiblerobot, an entity which moves and acts, but which cannot be affected by anything,which cannot be changed in any respect, which cannot be damaged, injured ordestroyed. Such an entity would not be able to have any values; it would havenothing to gain or to lose; it could not regard anything as for or against it,as serving or threatening its welfare, as fulfilling or frustrating itsinterests. It could have no interests and no goals.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 5; pb 15.]“Value” is that which one acts to gain and keep, “virtue” is the action by whichone gains and keeps it. “Value” presupposes an answer to the question: of valueto whom and for what? “Value” presupposes a standard, a purpose and thenecessity of action in the face of an alternative. Where there are noalternatives, no values are possible.[GS, FNI, 147; pb 121.] It is only an ultimate goal, an end in itself, that makes the existence ofvalues possible. Metaphysically, life is the only phenomenon that is an end initself: a value gained and kept by a constant process of action.Epistemologically, the concept of “value” is genetically dependent upon andderived from the antecedent concept of “life.” To speak of “value” as apart from“life” is worse than a contradiction in terms. “It is only the concept of ‘Life’that makes the concept of ‘Value’ possible.”In answer to those philosophers who claim that no relation can be establishedbetween ultimate ends or values and the facts of reality, let me stress that thefact that living entities exist and function necessitates the existence ofvalues and of an ultimate value which for any given living entity is its ownlife. Thus the validation of value judgments is to be achieved by reference tothe facts of reality. The fact that a living entity is, determines what it oughtto do. So much for the issue of the relation between “is” and “ought.”Now in what manner does a human being discover the concept of “value”? By whatmeans does he first become aware of the issue of “good or evil” in its simplestform? By means of the physical sensations of Pleasure or pain. Just assensations are the first step of the development of a human consciousness in therealm of cognition, so they are its first step in the realm of evaluation.The capacity to experience pleasure or pain is innate in a man’s body; it ispart of his nature, part of the kind of entity he is. He has no choice about it,and he has no choice about the standard that determines what will make himexperience the physical sensation of pleasure or of pain. What is that standard?His life.[“The Objectivist Ethics,” VOS, 7; pb 17.) Since a value is that which one acts to gain and/or keep, and the amount ofpossible action is limited by the duration of one’s lifespan, it is a part ofone’s life that one invests in everything one values. The years, months, days orhours of thought, of interest, of action devoted to a value are the currencywith which one pays for the enjoyment one receives from it.[ITOE, 44.]Material objects as such have neither value nor disvalue; they acquirevalue.-significance only in regard to a living being-particularly, in regard toserving or hindering man’s goals.[“From the Horse’s Mouth,” PWNI, 96; pb 79.] Values are the motivating power of man’s actions and a necessity of hissurvival, psychologically as well as physically.Man’s values control his subconscious emotional mechanism that functions like acomputer adding up his desires, his experiences, his fulfillments andfrustrations-like a sensitive guardian watching and constantly assessing hisrelationship to reality. The key question which this computer is programmed toanswer, is: What is possible to me?There is a certain similarity between the issue of sensory perception and theissue of values....If severe and prolonged enough, the absence of a norrnal, active flow of sensorystimuli may disintegrate the complex organization and the interdependentfunctions of man’s consciousness.Man’s emotional mechanism works as the barometer of the efficacy or impotence ofhis actions. If severe and prolonged enough, the absence of a normal, activeflow of value-experiences may disintegrate and paralyze man’s consciousness-bytelling him that no action is possible.The form in which man experiences the reality of his values is pleasure.[“Our Cultural Value-Deprivation,” TO, April 1966, 3.] The objective theory of values is the only moral theory incompatible with ruleby force. Capitalism is the only system based implicitly on an objective theoryof values-and the historic tragedy is that this has never been made explicit.If one knows that the good is objective—i.e., determined by the nature ofreality, but to be discovered by man’s mind-one knows that an attempt to achievethe good by physical force is a monstrous contradiction which negates moralityat its root by destroying man’s capacity to recognize the good, i.e., hiscapacity to value. Force invalidates and paralyzes a man’s judgment, demandingthat he act against it, thus rendering him morally impotent. A value which oneis forced to accept at the price of surrendering one’s mind, is not a value toanyone; the forcibly mindless can neither judge nor choose nor value. An attemptto achieve the good by force is like an attempt to provide a man with a picturegallery at the price of cutting out his eyes. Values cannot exist (cannot bevalued) outside the full context of a man’s life, needs, goals, and knowledge.[“What Is Capitalism?” CUI, 23.]See also AMBITION; CHARACTER; CYNICISM; “DUTY”; EMOTIONS; ENVY/HATRED of theGOOD for BEING the GOOD; EVIL; GOAL-DIRECTED ACTION; GOOD, the; HAPPINESS;“INSTINCT”; INTRINSIC THEORY of VALUES; “IS”-“OUGHT’ DICHOTOMY; LIFE; LOVE; MAN;MARKET VALUE; MORALITY; MOTIVATION; MOTIVATION by LOVE us. by FEAR; NORMATIVEABSTRACTIONS; OBJECTIVE THEORY of VALUES; PHYSICAL FORCE; PLEASURE and PAIN;PURPOSE; ROMANTICISM; SECOND-HANDERS; SELF-INTEREST; SELFISHNESS; SEX; STANDARDof VALUE; ”STOLEN CONCEPT,“ FALLACY of; SUBCONSCIOUS; SUBJECTIVISM; TELEOLOCICALMEASUREMENT; TRADER PRINCIPLE; ULTIMATE VALUE; VIRTUE.

Moral perfection is an unbreached rationality—not the degree of yourintelligence, but the full and relentless use of your mind, not the extent ofyour knowledge, but the acceptance of reason as an absolute.[Ibid., 224; pb 178.] My morality, the morality of reason, is contained in a single axiom: existenceexists-and in a single choice: to live. The rest proceeds from these. To live,man must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of his life:Reason-Purpose-Self-esteem. Reason, as his only tool of knowledge—Purpose, ashis choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve-Self-esteem,as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person isworthy of happiness, which means: is worthy of living. These three values implyand require all of man’s virtues, and all his virtues pertain to the relation ofexistence and consciousness: rationality, independence, integrity, honesty,justice, productiveness, pride.[Ibid., 156; pb 128.]Virtue is not an end in itself.

Visual Arts. The so-called visual arts (painting, sculpture, architecture)produce concrete, perceptually available entities and make them convey anabstract, conceptual meaning....The visual arts do not deal with the sensory field of awareness as such, butwith the sensory field as perceived by a conceptual consciousness.The sensory-perceptual awareness of an adult does not consist of mere sense data(as it did in his infancy), but of automatized integrations that combine sensedata with a vast context of conceptual knowledge. The visual arts refine anddirect the sensory elements of these integrations. By means of selectivity, ofemphasis and omission, these arts lead man’s sight to the conceptual contextintended by the artist. They teach man to see more precisely and to find deepermeaning in the field of his vision.It is a common experience to observe that a particular painting-for example, astill life of apples-makes its subject “more real than it is in reality.” Theapples seem brighter and firmer, they seem to possess an almost self-assertivecharacter, a kind of heightened reality which neither their real-life models norany color photograph can match. Yet if one examines them closely, one sees thatno real-life apple ever looked like that. What is it, then, that the artist hasdone? He has created a visual abstraction.He has performed the process of concept-formation-of isolating andintegrating—but in exclusively visual terms. He has isolated the essential,distinguishing characteristics of apples, and integrated them into a singlevisual unit. He has brought the conc-eptual method of functioning to theoperations of a single sense organ, the organ of sight.[“Art and Cognition.” RM, pb 47.] See also ABSTRACTION (PROCESS of); ART; ARTISTIC CREATION; CONCEPTS; DECORATIVEARTS; INTEGRATION (MENTAL); PAINTING; PERCEPTION; PHOTOGRAPHY; SCULPTURE;STYLIZATION.

The right to vote is a consequence, not a primary cause, of a freesocial system-and its value depends on the constitutional structure implementingand strictly delimiting the voters’ power; unlimited majority rule is aninstance of the principle of tyranny.[“The Lessons of Vietnam,” ARL, III, 24, 3.] A majority vote is not an epistemological validation of an idea. Voting ismerely a proper political device-within a strictly, constitutionally delimitedsphere of action-for choosing the practical means of implementing a society’sbasic principles. But those principles are not determined by vote.[“Who Is the Final Authority in Ethics?” TON, Feb. 1965, 8.] Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right tovote away the rights of a minority.[“Collectivized ‘Rights,’ VOS, 140; pb 104.] The citizens of a free nation may disagree about the specific legal proceduresor methods of implementing their rights (which is a complex problem, theprovince of political science and of the philosophy of law), but they agree onthe basic principle to be implemented: the principle of individual rights. Whena country’s constitution places individual rights outside the reach of publicauthorities, the sphere of political power is severely delimited—and thus thecitizens may, safely and properly, agree to abide by the decisions of a majorityvote in this delimited sphere. The lives and property of minorities ordissenters are not at stake, are not subject to vote and are not endangered byany majority decision; no man or group holds a blank check on power over others.[Ibid., 138; pb 103.]See also CONSTITUTION; DEMOCRACY; ECONOMIC POWER vs. POLITICAL POWER;GOVERNMENT; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT; REPUBLIC; STATISM;TYRANNY."},{"pageContent":"WWar. Wars are the second greatest evil that human societies can perpetrate. (Thefirst is dictatorship, the enslavement of their own citizens, which is the causeof wars.)[“The Wreckage of the Consensus,” CUI, 224.] Laissez-faire capitalism is the only social system based on the recognition ofindividual rights and, therefore, the only system that bans force from socialrelationships. By the nature of its basic principles and interests, it is theonly system fundamentally opposed to war.Men who are free to produce, have no incentive to loot; they have nothing togain from war and a great deal to lose. Ideologically, the principle ofindividual rights does not permit a man to seek his own livelihood at the pointof a gun, inside or outside his country. Economically, wars cost money; in afree economy, where wealth is privately owned, the costs of war come out of theincome of private citizens—there is no overblown public treasury to hide thatfact-and a citizen cannot hope to recoup his own financial losses (such as taxesor business dislocations or property destruction) by winning the war. Thus hisown economic interests are on the side of peace.In a statist economy, where wealth is “publicly owned,” a citizen has noeconomic interests to protect by preserving peace-he is only a drop in thecommon bucket—while war gives him the (fallacious) hope of larger handouts fromhis master. Ideologically, he is trained to regard men as sacrificial animals;he is one himself; he can have no concept of why foreigners should not besacrificed on the same public altar for the benefit of the same state.The trader and the warrior have been fundamental antagonists throughout history.Trade does not flourish on battlefields, factories do not produce underbombardments, profits do not grow on rubble. Capitalism is a society oftraders—for which it has been denounced by every would-be gunman who regardstrade as “selfish” and conquest as “noble.”Let those who are actually concerned with peace observe that capitalism gavemankind the longest period of peace in history-a period during which there wereno wars involving the entire civilized world-from the end of the Napoleonic warsin 1815 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914.[“The Roots of War,” CUl, 38.]Statism-in fact and in principle-is nothing more than gang rule. A dictatorshipis a gang devoted to looting the effort of the productive citizens of its owncountry. When a statist ruler exhausts his own country’s economy, he attacks hisneighbors. It is his only means of postponing internal collapse and prolonginghis rule. A country that violates the rights of its own citizens, will notrespect the rights of its neighbors. Those who do not recognize individualrights, will not recognize the rights of nations: a nation is only a number ofindividuals.Statism needs war; a free country does not. Statism survives by looting; a freecountry survives by production.Observe that the major wars of history were started by the more controlledeconomies of the time against the freer ones. For instance, World War I wasstarted by monarchist Germany and Czarist Russia, who dragged in their freerallies. World War II was started by the alliance of Nazi Germany with SovietRussia and their joint attack on Poland.Observe that in World War II, both Germany and Russia seized and dismantledentire factories in conquered countries, to ship them home —while the freest ofthe mixed economies, the semi-capitalistic United States, sent billions worth oflend-lease equipment, including entire factories, to its allies.Germany and Russia needed war; the United States did not and gained nothing. (Infact, the United States lost, economically, even though it won the war: it wasleft with an enormous national debt, augmented by the grotesquely futile policyof supporting former allies and enemies to this day.) Yet it is capitalism thattoday’s peace-lovers oppose and statism that they advocate—in the name of peace.[Ibid., 37.] If men want to oppose war, it is stalism that they must oppose. So long as theyhold the tribal notion that the individual is sacrificial fodder for thecollective, that some men have the right to rule others by force, and that some(any) alleged “good” can justify it-there can be no peace within a nation and nopeace among nations.[Ibid., 42.] Just as, in domestic affairs, all the evils caused by statism and governmentcontrols were blamed on capitalism and the free market—so, in foreign affairs,all the evils of statist policies were blamed on and ascribed to capitalism.Such myths as “capitalistic imperialism,” “war-profiteering,” or the notion thatcapitalism has to win “markets” by military conquest are examples of thesuperficiality or the unscrupulousness of statist commentators and historians.The essence of capitalism’s foreign policy is free trade—i.e., the abolition oftrade barriers, of protective tariffs, of special privileges-the opening of theworld’s trade routes to free international exchange and competition among theprivate citizens of all countries dealing directly with one another. During thenineteenth century, it was free trade that liberated the world, undercutting andwrecking the remnants of feudalism and the statist tyranny of absolutemonarchies.[Ibid., 38.] Capitalism wins and holds its markets by free competition, at home and abroad. Amarket conquered by war can be of value (temporarily) only to those advocates ofa mixed economy who seek to close it to international competition, imposerestrictive regulations, and thus acquire special privileges by force.[Ibid., 39.] Remember that private citizens-whether rich or poor, whether businessmen orworkers-have no power to start a war. That power is the exclusive prerogative ofa government. Which type of government is more likely to plunge a country intowar: a government of limited powers, bound by constitutional restrictions-or anunlimited government, open to the pressure of any group with warlike interestsor ideologies, a government able to command armies to march at the whim of asingle chief executive?[Ibid., 40.] It is true that nuclear weapons have made wars too horrible to contemplate. Butit makes no difference to a man whether he is killed by a nuclear bomb or adynamite bomb or an old-fashioned club. Nor does the number of other victims orthe scale of the destruction make any difference to him.[Ibid., 42.] If nuclear weapons are a dreadful threat and mankind cannot afford war anylonger, then mankind cannot afford statism any longer. Let no man of good willtake it upon his conscience to advocate the rule of force-outside or inside hisown country. Let all those who are actually concerned with peace—those who dolove man and do care about his survival-realize that if war is ever to beoutlawed, it is the use of force that has to be outlawed.[Ibid., 43.]See also CAPITALISM; DICTATORSHIP; DRAFT; FOREIGN POLICY; FREEDOM; GENOCIDE;NINETEENTH CENTURY; PEACE MOVEMENTS; PHSICAL FORCE; SOVIET RUSSIA; STATISM;TRADER PRINCIPLE; TRIBALISM; UNITED NATIONS. Welfare State. Since the things man needs for survival have to be produced, andnature does not guarantee the success of any human endeavor, there is not andcannot be any such thing as a guaranteed economic security. The employer whogives you a job, has no guarantee that his business will remain in existence,that his customers will continue to buy his products or services. The customershave no guarantee that they will always be able and willing to trade with him,no guarantee of what their needs, choices and incomes will be in the future. Ifyou retire to a self-sustaining farm, you have no guarantee to protect you fromwhat a Hood or a hurricane might do to your land and your crops. If yousurrender everything to the government and give it total power to plan the wholeeconomy, this will not guarantee your economic security, but it will guaranteethe descent of the entire nation to a level of miserable poverty-as thepractical results of every totalitarian economy, communist or fascist, havedemonstrated.Morally, the promise of an impossible “right” to economic security is aninfamous attempt to abrogate the concept of rights. It can and does mean onlyone thing: a promise to enslave the men who produce, for the benefit of thosewho don’t. “If some men are entitled by right to the products of the work ofothers, it means that those others are deprived of rights and condemned to slavelabor.” (“Man’s Rights” in Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.) There can be no suchthing as the right to enslave, i.e., the right to destroy rights.[“A Preview,” ARL, I, 22, 2.] It is true that the welfare-statists are not socialists, that they neveradvocated or intended the socialization of private property, that they want to“preserve” private property-with government control of its use and disposal. Butthat is the fundamental characteristic of fascism.[“The New Fascism: Rule by Consensus,” CUI, 211.] The gold standard is incompatible with chronic deficit spending (the hallmark ofthe welfare state). Stripped of its academic jargon, the welfare state isnothing more than a mechanism by which governments confiscate the wealth of theproductive members of a society to support a wide variety of welfare schemes....The financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for theowners of wealth to protect themselves.This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists’ tirades against gold. Deficitspending is simply a scheme for the “hidden” confiscation of wealth. Gold standsin the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of propertyrights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists’antagonism toward the gold standard.[Alan Greenspan. “Gold and Economic Freedom,” CUI, 100.] Morally and economically, the welfare state creates an ever acceleratingdownward pull. Morally, the chance to satisfy demands by force spreads thedemands wider and wider, with less and less pretense at justification.Economically, the forced demands of one group create hardships for all others,thus producing an inextricable mixture of actual victims and plain parasites.Since need, not achievement, is held as the criterion of rewards, the governmentnecessarily keeps sacrificing the more productive groups to the less productive,gradually chaining the top level of the economy, then the next level, then thenext. (How else are unachieved rewards to be provided?)There are two kinds of need involved in this process: the need of the groupmaking demands, which is openly proclaimed and serves as cover for another need,which is never mentioned-the need of the power-seekers, who require a group ofdependent favor-recipients in order to rise to power. Altruism feeds the firstneed, statism feeds the second, Pragmatism blinds everyone-including victims andprufiteers-not merely to the deadly nature of the process, but even to the factthat a process is going on.[“A Preview,” ARL, 1,23, 1.] [A] real turning point came when the welfare statists switched from economics tophysiology: they began to seek a new power base in deliberately fostered racism,the racism of minority groups, then in the hatreds and inferiority complexes ufwomen, of “the young,” etc. The significant aspect of this switch was thesevering of economic rewards from productive work. Physiology replaced theconditions of employment as the basis of social claims. The demands were nolonger for “just compensation,” but just for compensation, with no workrequired.So long as the power-seekers clung to the basic premises of the welfare state,holding need as the criterion of rewards, logic forced them, step by step, tochampion the interests of the less and less productive groups, until theyreached the ultimate dead end of turning from the role of champions of “honesttoil” to the role of champions of open parasitism, parasitism on principle,parasitism as a “right” (with their famous slogan turning into: “Who does nottoil, shall eat those who do”).[Ibid., 2.]In business, the rise of the welfare state froze the status quo, perpetuatingthe power of the big corporations of the pre-income-tax era, placing them beyondthe competition of the tax-strangled newcorners. A similar process took place inthe welfare state of the intellect. The results, in both fields, are the same.[“The Establishing of an Establishment,” PWNI, 207; pb 170.]See also ALTRUISM; CHARITY; COMPASSION; FASCISM and COMMUNISM /SOCIALISM; GOLDSTANDARD; INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS; INFLATION; INTERVENTIONISM (ECONOMIC); LOBBYING;MINORITY RIGHTS; PITY; POVERTY; PRAGMATISM; PRINCIPLES; PROPERTY RIGHTS; RACISM;“REDISTRIBUTION” of WEALTH; SACRIFICE; SELFISHNESS; STATISM; TAXATION.

It means that a man acts like a zombie,without any knowledge of what he deals with, what he wants to accomplish, orwhat motivates him. It means that a man acts in a state of temporary insanity.Is this what you call juicy or colorful? I think the only juice that can comeout of such a situation is blood. To act against the facts of reality can resultonly in destruction.[“Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” pamphlet, 6.] What is the nature of that superior world to which they sacrifice the world thatexists? The mystics of spirit curse matter, the mystics of muscle curse profit.The first wish men to profit by renouncing the earth, the second wish men toinherit the earth by renouncing all profit. Their non-material, non-profitworlds are realms where rivers run with milk and coffee, where wine spurts fromrocks at their command, where pastry drops on them from clouds at the price ofopening their mouth. On this material, profit-chasing earth, an enormousinvestment of virtue —of intelligence, integrity, energy, skill-is required toconstruct a railroad to carry them the distance of one mile; in theirnon-material, non-profit world, they travel from planet to planet at the cost ofa wish. If an honest person asks them: “How?”—they answer with righteous scornthat a “how” is the concept of vulgar realists; the concept of superior spiritsis “Somehow.” On this earth restricted by matter and profit, rewards areachieved by thought; in a world set free of such restrictions, rewards areachieved by wishing.And that is the whole of their shabby secret. The secret of all their esotericphilosophies, of all their dialectics and super-senses, of their evasive eyesand snarling words, the secret for which they destroy civilization, language,industries and lives, the secret for which they pierce their own eyes andeardrums, grind out their senses, blank out their minds, the purpose for whichthey dissolve the absolutes of reason, logic, matter, existence, reality-is toerect upon that plastic fog a single holy absolute: their Wish.[GS, FNI, 185; pb 149.]See also AMORALISM; EMOTIONS; FINAL CAUSATION; HEDONISM; IRRATIONALITY;MYSTICISM; RATIONALITY; SUBJECTIVISM. “Window Dressing.” The non-philosophical attitude of most rightists, whosurrendered the intellect to the leftists ... permitted the intellectuals toplay the game of “window dressing,” i.e., to preach political tolerance orimpartiality and to practice it, on suitable occasions, by featuring theweakest, most befuddled champion of capitalism as a representative of the right.(Which led people to the conclusion: “If this is the best that can be said forthe right, then the leftist position must be true.”)[“The Disfranchisemem of the Right,” ARL, 1, 6, 1.]See also CAPlTALISM; “CONSERVATIVES”; “CONSERVATIVES” vs. “LIBERALS”; RIGHTISTSvs. LEFTISTS. Words. In order to be used as a single unit, the enormous sum integrated by aconcept has to be given the form of a single, specific, perceptual concrete,which will differentiate it from all other concretes and from all otherconcepts. This is the function performed by language. Language is a code ofvisual-auditory symbols that serves the psycho-epistemological function ofconverting concepts into the mental equivalent of concretes. Language is theexclusive domain and tool of concepts. Every word we use (with the exception ofproper names) is a symbol that denotes a concept, i.e., that stands for anunlimited number of concretes of a certain kind.ITOE, 11.] The first words a child learns are words denoting visual objects, and he retainshis first concepts visually. Observe that the visual form he gives them isreduced to those essentials which distinguish the particular kind of entitiesfrom all others—for instance, the universal type of a child’s drawing of man inthe form of an oval for the torso, a circle for the head, four sticks forextremities, etc. Such drawings are a visual record of the process ofabstraction and concept-formation in a mind’s transition from the perceptuallevel to the full vocabulary of the concepmal level.There is evidence to suppose that written language originated in the form ofdrawings-as the pictographic writing of the Oriental peoples seems to indicate.With the growth of man’s knowledge and of his power of abstraction, a pictorialrepresentation of concepts could no longer be adequate to his conceptual range,and was replaced by a fully symbolic code.[Ibid., 15.] The process of forming a concept is not complete until its constituent unitshave been integrated into a single mental unit by means of a specific word. Thefirst concepts a child forms are concepts of perceptual entities; the firstwords he learns are words designating them. Even though a child does not have toperform the feat of genius performed by some mind or minds in the prehistoricalinfancy of the human race: the invention of language-every child has to performindependently the feat of grasping the nature of language, the process ofsymbolizing concepts by means of words.Even though a child does not (and need not) originate and form every concept onhis own, by observing every aspect of reality confronting him, he has to performthe process of differentiating and integrating perceptual concretes, in order tograsp the meaning of words. If a child’s brain is physically damaged and unableto perform that process, he does not learn to speak.Learning to speak does not consist of memorizing sounds—that is the process bywhich a parrot learns to “speak.” Learning consists of grasping meanings, i.e.,of grasping the referents of words, the kinds of existents that words denote inreality. In this respect, the learning of words is an invaluable accelerator ofa child’s cognitive development, but it is not a substitute for the process ofconcept-formation; nothing is.[Ibid., 24.] Words transform concepts into (mental) entities; definitions provide them withidentity. (Words without definitions are not language but inarticulate sounds.)[Ibid., 12.] It is often said that definitions state the meaning of words. This is true, butit is not exact. A word is merely a visual-auditory symbol used to represent aconcept : a word has no meaning other than that of the concept it symbolizes,and the meaning of a concept consists of its units. It is not words, butconcepts that man defines—by specifying their referents.[Ibid., 52.]See also COMMUNICATION; CONCEPT-FORMATION; CONCEPTS; DEFINITIONS; GRAMMAR;LANGUAGE; LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS; MEANING (of CONCEPTS); NOMINALISM; PERCEPTION;PSYCHO-EPISTEMOLOGY; UNIT; UNIT-ECONOMY."},{"pageContent":"XXenophobia.

A vulgar variant of concept stealing, prevalent amongavowed mystics and irrationalists, is a fallacy I call the Reification of theZero. It consists of regarding “nothing” as a thing, as a special, differentkind of existent. (For example, see Existentialism.) This fallacy breeds suchsymptoms as the notion that presence and absence, or being and non-being, aremetaphysical forces of equal power, and that being is the absence of non-being.E.g., “Nothingness is prior to being.” (Sartre)—“Human finitude is the presenceof the not in the being of man.” (William Barrett)—“Nothing is more real thannothing.” (Samuel Beckett)—“Das Nichts nichtet” or “Nothing noughts.”(Heidegger). “Consciousness, then, is not a stuff, but a negation. The subjectis not a thing, but a non-thing. ‘The subject carves its own world out of Beingby means of negative determinations. Sartre describes consciousness as a‘noughting nought’ (néant néantisant). It is a form of being other than its own:a mode ‘which has yet to be what it is, that is to say, which is what it is,that is to say, which is what it is not and which is not what it is.’ ” (HectorHawton, The Feast of Unreason, London: Watts & Co., 1952, p. 162.)(The motive? “Genuine utterances about the nothing must always remain unusual.It cannot be made common. It dissolves when it is placed in the cheap acid ofmere logical acumen.” Heidegger.)[ITOE, 80.]See also AXIOMATIC CONCEPTS; AXIOMS; EXISTENCE; IDENTITY; NON-EXISTENCE; “STOLENCONCEPT, FALLACY of."}]
