Not a single one of her stories pertained to Russi a, which she hated. It was something of a paradox to her, therefore, that she set her first novel in Soviet Russ ia. Part of the explanation is that, having finally escaped to the United State s, she had to get Ru ssia out of her syst em-by telling the world what was actually happening there. Her husband, Frank O' Connor, and his brother Nick urged her to write the novel. Bo th were horrified by her ex­ periences in Russia, and they convinced her that Americans had no idea of the truth. A young Russia n had said to her at a party in 1926, just before she left for America: \"When you get there, tell them that Russia is a huge cemetery and that we are all dying. \" We the Livin g to ld them. Her novel, Ayn Rand wrote on its completion, is \"the first story written by a Russian who knows the living conditions of the new Russia and who has actually lived under the So­ viets in the period described . .. the first one by a person who knows the facts and also [having esca ped] ca n tell them. \"! Another part of the explanation for a Russia n novel is that, being an immigrant and a beginner, Ayn Rand did not feel ready yet for anything else. She did have in mind the idea for a novel set in an airship orbiting the earth, and she debated between the two pro je cts. Bu t the Russ ian novel had a great advantage: no research was nece ssa ry for We the Livin g ; she already knew the background-whereas she did not know the conditions, the people, or the language well enough to do a story set in America (or in an airship). Further, since Ayn Rand was only twenty-five in 1930, when she started the book, \"I thought I was too young to write about adults. \"2 She was not yet ready to present her kind of hero or broad, philosophical theme-she had not de­ fined her ideas fully enough or acquired the nece ssa ry liter-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"vi INTRO DUCTI ON ary skill-and the story of We the Living did not require these developments. Although her theme here is political rather than philosoph­ ical, this is very much an Ayn Rand novel : as a thinking mind, she could not write about concretes apart from their meaning and implications. The theme of the nov el, accord­ ingly, is universal. \"We the Living, \" she writes in her 1958 Foreword, \"is not a novel 'about Soviet Russi a.' It is a novel about Man against the State .. .. It is a story about Dictator­ ship, any dictatorship, anywhere, at any time, whether it be Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, or-which this novel might do its share in helping to prevent-a socialist Americ a.\"3 The novel's original title was Airti'ght, the meaning being that under dictatorship man cannot survive. Dictatorship, she writes in her jo urnal , \"cr ush [es] [a] whole count ry and smother[s] every bit of life, action, and air .... [It] makes the atmosphere choking, airtight. ... \" The plot of the novel occurred to her initially as a tw ist on a standard plot, the story of the virtuous girl who sells herself to a villain in order to save the hero, whom she loves. Ayn Rand th ought: Wo uldn't it be inter esting if \"the man to whom [the girl] sells herself is not a villain but a hero-and the man for whom she makes her sacrifice is the villain in the end\" ? With this twist, the heroine's conflict deepens im­ measurably, while the final tragedy becomes in a sense even greater for the \"villain\" than for the other two.4 When she started to pro je ct the story, the first scene in Ayn Rand's mind was the arrest scene, when Andrei, the GPU agent who loves Kira, comes to take Leo away to ja il-and discovers that Kira is Leo's mistress. The drama of this kind of scene was Ayn Rand's personal motiva tion to do the novel. She then const ructed the story backward, by deciding what events had to be presented to lead to this climax. Several of the characters were suggested by people whom Ayn Rand had known in Russ ia. Kira, of course, though not intended as a self-portrait, is Ayn Rand intellectually and morally; she has all of Ayn Rand's ideas and values. Irina is based on her youngest sister, Nora, who drew the very same kind of caricatures. Uncle Va sili was taken, in es sence and appearance, from her own father. As to the two men, Andrei is a pure invention, but Leo is real; he is a romanticized ver­ sion of th e first man Ayn Rand ever loved, a student she had met in college at the age of seventeen and gone out with"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"INTR O DUCTI ON vii many times. His name was Leo. She disliked the name, but felt that she had no choice about us ing it: in her mind, the character was inseparable from the man. I have often heard people argue about who is superior: Andrei or Leo (Kira is superior to both). Despite the boo k's hero-villain plot twist, there is no doubt as to Ayn Rand 's an­ swer, which I heard her state on several occasions. Her favor­ ite was Leo, not only for the personal reason mentioned but also for a philosophical reason: the fact that Leo, by con­ scious premi ses, is an egoist, an individualist, a man of arro­ gant self -est eem who lives for his values. Andr ei, by contrast, is a man explicitly committed to the opposite ideas ; he accepts the principles of selfl essness and collect ivism as his moral ideal, and then acts on them, down to spilling all the blood they requir e. Given the plot twist, Ayn Rand worked hard to make Andrei as noble as possible; but his no­ bility exists basically on the subcon scious level. It lies in his soul, his unidentified individualistic premi ses, which are at war with his actions and conscious viewpoint. Ayn Rand ju dged people, es sentially, by these last. When Andrei discovers his error, he commits suicide ; he is totally honest. But the point is: what he discovers is that he gave his life to a lie. Leo knew better from the start (even if he breaks in the end). If Leo had been born in America, he would have become Fra ncisco D' Anconia of Atlas Shrugged; that is, the measure of his heroic potential. In Russia, however, he is crushed. To the extent that an individual is rational, independent, uncom­ pro mising, passiona te-to the extent that he tries to act ac­ cording to his own mind and value jud gments-his life under the rule of physical force becomes unendurable. The only an­ swer he sees to his questions and ambitions is the muzzle of a gun. In principle, such a man has three choices. One is to commit suicide. Thi s is the choice Andrei makes, when he grasps the depravity of his \"ide al.\" Another is to attempt to make the clash between mind and force endurable by nullifying one of the two clashing ele­ ments, the only one in the vict im's power: his own mind. This mea ns: drowning his mind, and thereby losing the abil­ ity to know or care any longer what is being done to him. This is Leo 's choi ce; it is living death, or drawn-out suicide, as against immediate self-destruction. In her jo urnal , Ayn Rand does not regard Leo 's choice as evil. Rather, she de-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"viii INT R O DUCTI ON scribes him as a man who is \"too strong to compromi se, but too weak to withstand the pressure, who cannot bend, but only break. \" The third choice is that of Kira-to flee abroad. In real life the attempt to flee might well be succe ssful, as it was in Ayn Rand 's own case. In the context of the novel, however, Kira had to die in the attempt. If the boo k's theme is tl].e fate of the living under the rule of killers , there is no place for the accident of esca pe. The essence of such a political syst em is destruction, whether the individual is within the borders or trying to run acr oss them . In her journal\" Ayn Rand summarized, in characterological terms, the three forms of destruction depicted in the novel : \"The higher and stronger [individual] is broken, but not con­ quered; she falls on the battlefield, still the same individual, untouched: Kira. The one with less resistance is broken and conquered; he disintegrates under an unbearable strain: Leo. And the best of those who believed in the ideal is broken by the realization of what that ideal really mea ns: Andr ei.\" Ayn Rand finished We the Living in 1933. The principal reaction of the manuscri pt's early readers, she wrote in a 1934 letter, \"is one of complete amazement at the revelation of Soviet life as it is actually lived. ,, 5 Almost sixt y years later, I cannot resist adding , the grandchildren of such read­ ers were still being amazed by Soviet life, this time as they watched it lead to the collapse of the entire Soviet structure. Ayn Rand knew that the American public did not under­ stand the nature of communi sm, but she did not know that she was trying to publish the truth at the start of the Red Decade, as it was later called. An anti-commu nist librarian had told her, when she was still working on the novel , that \"the communi sts have a tremendous influence \" on American intellectual s, \"and you will find a lot of people opposing you. \" \"I was indignant, \" Ayn Rand recalled yea rs later. \"I didn 't believe her. I thought that she is a typical Russia n and is, in effect, panic mongering .\"6 For nearly three years, We the Living was re jected by New York pub lishers . It was rejected by more than a dozen houses . A typical rejection said that the author did not under­ stand sociali sm. Gradually, Ayn Rand came to see how accu­ rate the librarian had been . By 1936, she herself was writing to a friend that \"New York is full of people sold bodies and souls to the Soviets .\"7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTRO DUCTI ON be At last the book came to Macmillan, whose editorial board was divided about it. One of the as soci ate edito rs, who fought against the book \"violent ly \" (Ayn Rand 's word), was Granville Hic ks. Several years later, Hicks admitted publicly that he had been a member of the Communist Party. After a bitter struggle Hicks was overruled by the owner of the com­ pany, an elderly gentleman who said that he did not know whether the book would make any money, but that it was im­ portant and ought to be published. (It is instructive to note that in 1957, the New Yo rk Times chose the same man, Gran­ ville Hicks, to review Atlas Shrugged for the Sunday Book Review.) We the Living did poorly at fi rst. A year after publication, however, in 1937, thanks to word of mouth, the novel started to take off. But it was too late: Macmillan had set the book from type, not plates, and had destroyed the type in the first mont hs. As a result, while the book was achieving great suc­ cess in England, Denmark, and Italy, it went out of print in America, and had to wait a quarter of a century to reach its audience. In 1958, after the triumph of Atlas Shrugged, a new American edition was finally brought out by Random Ho use; a year later, a mas s-market paperback was published by New American Library. By now We the Living has sold over two million copies in the United Stat es. To bring the book to a wider audience, Ayn Rand in 1939 turned it into a play, which opened on Broadway under the title of The Unconquer ed. She did not think the book was \"proper stage material ,\" she said later, but she tried her best to adapt it-under impossible circum­ stances, with a producer (George Abbott) who fought her ev­ ery step of the way, and a country full of acting talents afraid to come near anything so controversial. One famo us actr ess, Bette Dav is, read the script and declared that she loved it and would be honored to play the part of Kira. Her agent forbade her to do it, on the grounds that such an anti-communist role would destroy her career. This is a small indication of the country 's intellectual state at the time-and of what Ayn Rand was up again st. The play closed after five perfor­ man ces . During World War II, We the Living was pirated by an Italian film company, which produced a movie version and released it without the knowledge or consent of Ayn Rand. The movie starred Alida Valli as Kira and Rossano Brazzi"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"x INTRO DUCTION as Leo (Italy's top box office name, Fosco Giachetti, played Andrei). In general, the movie followed the book closely; in­ deed, it was shot using the book itself as a script. Because of its length, the picture was released in Italy, in 1942, as two separate movie s, Noi Vi vi (We the Living) and Addio, Kira (Farewell, Kira). Both were enormous popular succ esses. The fascist gov­ ernment had approved the movie on the grounds that it was anti-communist. But the public (like the director) understood at once that the movie was just as anti-f ascist as anti­ commu nist. People grasped Ayn Rand's theme-the evil of dictatorship as such-and embraced the two mov ies, in part as a way of protesting their oppr ession under Mus solini . In a takeoff on the titles, people began referring to themselves as Noi Morti (We the Dead), and to Muss olini 's economic policies as Addio, Lira. Five months after its release, the government figured out what everyone else knew, and banned the movie. (The Nazi s, too, were demanding that Italy ban it.) These events are el­ oquent proof of Ayn Rand's claim that the book is not merely \"about Soviet Russia.\" Over twenty years later, the negative of the movies was lo­ cated in Italy, purchased, and brought back to Ayn Rand for review. Apart from a few scen es, she was very favorably im­ pressed; she regarded Valli in particular as ideal casting. Under her super vision, the two movies were condensed into a single, tightly focused three-hour film. In 1986 (four years after her death) the new version, in black-and-white with En­ glish subtit les, was finally completed and began a successful run in the U.S. In my own opinion, the movie is superior to the much more famous Hollywood movie of The Fountain­ head. * In 1934, two years before the book was published, Ayn Rand showed the manuscript to H. L. Mencken, the well­ known individuali st, who liked it. Thanking him for his in­ terest, Ayn Rand wrote back on July.28: This book is only my first step and above all a means of acquiring a voice, of making myself heard.

I had not expected to be as proud of it as I am. Too many writers declare that they never succeed in ex­ pressing fully what they wished to express and that their work is only some sort of appro ximation . It is a viewpoint for which I have never had any sympathy and which I con­ sider excusa ble only when it is voiced by beginn ers, since no one is born with any kind of \"talent \" and, therefore, every skill has to be acquired. Writers are made, not born. To be exact, writers are self-made. It was mainly in regard to We the Living, my first novel (and, progr essively less, in regard to my work preceding The Fountainhead), that I had felt that my means were inadequate to my purpose and that I had not said what I wanted to say as well as I wished. Now, I am startled to discov er how well I did say it. We the Living is not a novel \"about Soviet Russia. \" It is a novel about Man against the State . Its basic theme is the sanctity of human life-u sing the word \"sanctity \" not in a my stical sense, but in the sense of \"supreme value.\" The es­ sence of my theme is contained in the words of Irina, a mi­ nor character of the story, a young girl who is sentenced to imprisonment in Siberia and kn ows that she will never re­ turn: \"There 's something I would like to understand. And I don't think anyone can explain it. ... There 's your life. You begin it, feeling that it's something so precious and rare, so beautiful that it's like a sacred treasure. Now it's over, and it doesn 't make any diff erence to anyone, and it isn 't that they are indif ferent, it's just that they don't know, they don't know what it mean s, that treasure of mine, and there 's some­ thing about it that they should understand. I don't understand it myself, but there 's something that should be understood by all of us. Only what is it? What? \" At the time, I knew a little more about this question than did Irina, but not much more. I knew that this attitude toward one's own life should be, but is not, shared by all people-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiv FOR EW OR D that it is the fundamental characteri stics of the best a m ong men-that its absence represents some enormous evil which had never been identified. I knew that this is the issue at the base of all dictatorship s, all collectivist theories and all hu­ man evils-and that political or economic issues are merely derivatives and consequences of this basic primary. At that time, I looked at any advocates of dictatorship and collectiv­ ism with an incredulous contempt: I could not understand how any man could be so brutalized as to claim the right to dispose of the lives of others, nor how any man could be so lacking in self-esteem as to grant to others the right to dis­ pose of his life. Today, the contempt has remained; the incre­ dulity is gone, since I know the answer. It was not until Atlas Shrugged that I reached the full answer to Irina's question. In Atlas Shrugged I explain the philosophical, psychological and moral meaning of the men who value their own lives and of the men who don't. I show that the first are the Prime Movers of mankind and that the second are metaphysical killers, working for an opportunity to become physical ones. In Atlas Shrugged, I show why men are motivated either by a life premise or a death premi se. In We the Living, I show only that they are. The ra pid epist emological degeneration of our present age-when men are being brought down to the level of concrete-bound animals who are incapable of perceiving ab­ stract ions, when men are taught that they must look at trees, but never at forests-makes it nece ssary for me to give the following warning to my readers: do not be misled by those who might tell you that We the Living is \"dated\" or no longer relevant to the present, since it deals with Soviet Russia in the nineteen-twentie s. Such a criticism is applicable only to the writers of the Natural ist school, and represents the view­ point of those who, having never discovered that any other school of literature can or did exist, are unable to distinguish the function of a novel from that of a Sunday supplement ar­ ticle. The Natural ist school of writing consists of substituting sta­ tistics for one's standard of value, then cataloguing minute, photographi c, journalistic details of a given country, region, city or back yard in a given decade, year, month or split­ second, on the over-all premise of: 'This is what men have done\" -as against the premise of: 'This is what men have cho­ sen and/or should choose to do.\" This last is the premise of the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"FOREW ORD xv Romantic school of writing, which deals, above all, with hu­ man values and, therefore, with the esse ntial and the universal in human actions, not with the statistical and the accidental. The Naturalist school records the choices which men happened to have made; the Romantic school projects the choices which men can and ought to make . I am a Romantic Rea list ­ distinguished from the Romantic tradition in that the values I deal with pertain to this earth and to the basic problems of this era. We the Living is not a story about Soviet Russia in 1925. It is a story about Dictatorship, any dictatorship, anywhere, at any time, whether it be Soviet Rus sia, Nazi Germany, or­ which this novel might do its share in helping to prevent-a socia list America. What the rule of brute force does to men and how it dest roys the best , will be the same in 1925, in 1955 or in 1975-whether the secret police is called G.P .U. or N.K.V .D., whether men eat millet or bread, whether they live in hovels or in housing pro jects, whether the rulers wear red shirts or brown ones, whether the head butcher kisses a Cambodian witch doctor or an American piani st. When, at the age of twelve, at the time of the Russia n rev­ olution, I first heard the Communi st principle that Man mu st exist for the sake of the State, I perceived that this was the essential issue, that this principle was evil, and that it could lead to nothing but evil, regar dless of any methods, deta ils, decrees, policies, promises and pious platitude s. This was the reason for my opposition to Commu nism then-and it is my reason now. I am still a little astonished, at times, that too many adult Americans do not understand the nature of the fight aga inst Commu nism as clearly as I understood it at the age of twelve: they continue to believe that only Communi st methods are evil, while Comm unist ideals are noble. All the victories of Communi sm since the yea r 1917 are due to that particular belief among the men who are still free. To those who might wonder whether the condition s of ex­ istence in Soviet Russia have changed in any esse ntial re­ spect since 1925, I will make a sugge stion : take a look through the files of the newspa pers . If you do, you will ob­ serve the following pattern: first, you will read glowing re­ ports about the happine ss, the prosper ity, the indu strial devel opment , the progr ess and the power of the Soviet Union, and that any statements to the contrary are the lies of prejudiced reactionaries; then, about five years later , you will"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xvi FOR EWORD read admi ssions that things were pretty miserable in the So­ viet Union five years ago, just about as bad as the prejudiced reactionaries had claimed, but now the problems are solved and the Soviet Union is a land of happ iness, prosperity, in­ dustrial development, progr ess and power; about five years later, you will read that Trotsky (or Zinoviev or Kamenev or Litvinov or the \"kulaks \" or the foreign imper ialists) had caused the miserable state of things five years ago, but now Stalin has purged them all and the Soviet Union has sur­ passed the decadent We st in happine ss, prosperity, industrial development, etc.; five years later, you will read that Stalin was a monster who had crushed the progress of the Soviet Union, but now it is a land of happine ss, prosperity, artistic freedom, educational perfection and scientif ic superiority over the whole world.

Under the clock, a crowd of pale faces and greasy overcoats waited for the train. Kira Argounova entered Petrograd on the threshold of a box car. She stood straight, motio nless, with the graceful in­ difference of a traveler on a luxurious ocean liner, with an old blue suit of faded cloth, with slender, sunburned legs and no stocking s. She had an old piece of plaid silk around her neck, and short tousled hair, and a stockingcap with a bright yellow tassel. She had a calm mouth and slightly widened eyes with the defiant, enraptured, solemnly and fearf ully ex­ pectant look of a warrior who is entering a strange city and is not quite sure whether he is entering it as a conqueror or a captive. Behind her was a car overloaded with a freight of humans and bund les. The bundles were wrapped in bed-sheets, news­ papers and flour sacks . The humans were bundled in ragged overcoats and shawls. The bundles had served as beds and had lost all shape. Dust had engraved wrinkles on the dry, cracked skin of faces that had lost all expr ession. Slowly, wearily, the train pulled to a stop, the last one of a long journey across the devastated plains of Russia. It had taken two weeks to make a three days' trip-from the Crimea to Petrograd. In 1922 the railroads, as well as ev ery­ thing else, had not as yet been organized. The civil war had come to an end. The last traces of the White Army had been wiped out. But as the hand of the Red rule was bridling the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 AYN RAND count ry, the net of steel rails and telegraph wires still hung limply, out of the hand's grasp . There were no schedu les, no time-ta bles . No one knew when a train would leave or arri ve. A vague rumor that it was corning rushed a mob of anxious travelers to the stations of every town along its way. They waited for hours, for days, afraid to leave the depot where the train could appear in a rninute--or a week. The littered floors of the waiting rooms smelt like their bodies; they put their bundles on the floors, and their bodies on the bundles, and slept. They munched pa­ tiently dry crusts of bread and sunflower see ds; they did not undr ess for weeks . When at last , snorting and groaning, the train rumbled in, men besieged it with fists and feet and fe­ rocious despair. Like barnacles, they clung to the steps, to the buffers, to the roofs. The y lost their luggage an d their chil­ dren; without bell or notice the train started suddenly, carry­ ing away tho se who had crawled aboard. Kira Argounova had not started the journey in a box car. At the start, she had had a choice seat: the little table at the window of a thir d-class passe nger coach ; the little table was the center of the compartment, and Kira-the center of the passengers ' attention. A young Soviet official admired the line that the silhouette of her b ody made against the light square of a broken window. A fat lady in a fur coat was in­ dignant that the girl's defiant posture somehow suggest ed a cabaret dancer perched among champagne glasses, but a dancer with a face of such severe, arrogant calm, that the lady wondered whether she was really thinking of a cabaret table or a pedestal. For many long miles, the travelers of that compartment watched the fields and prairies of Russia roll by as a background for a haughty profile with a mass of brown hair thrown off a high forehead by the wind that whistled . outside in the telegraph wir es. For lack of space Kira 's feet rested on her father's lap. Al­ exander Dirnitrievitch Argounov slumped wearily in his cor­ ner, his stomach a shelf for his folded hands, his red, puffed eyes half-closed, drowsing, jerking himself up with a sigh once in a while when he caught his mouth hanging open . He wore a patched khaki overcoat, high peasa nt boots with run­ down heels and a burlap shirt on the back of which one could still read: \"Ukrainian Potatoes. \" This was not an intentional disguise; it was all Alexander Dirnitrievitch possessed. But"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"WE THE LI VIN G 21 he was greatly worried lest someone should notice that the rim of his pince-nez was of real gold. Crushed against his elbow, Galina Petrovna, his wife, managed to hold her body erect and her book high to the tip of her nose. She had kept her book, but lost all her hairpins in the flight for seats, when her efforts had secured the fam­ ily's entrance into the car. She was careful not to let her fel­ low travelers observe that her book was French. Once in a while her foot felt cautiously under the seat to make certain that her best bundle was still there, the one wrapped in the cross-stitch embroidered table cloth. That bundle held the last remnants of her hand-made lace under­ wear, purchased in Vienna before the war, and the silverware with the Argounov family initials. She greatly resented, but could not prevent the fact that the bundle served as a pillow for a snoring soldier who slept under the bench, his boots protruding into the aisle. Lydia, the Argounovs' elder daughter, had to sit in the aisle, next to the boots, on a bundle; but she made it a point to let every passenger in the car understand that she was not used to such mode of traveling. Lydia did not condescend to hide outward signs of social superiority , of which she proudly displayed three : a jabot of tarnished gold lace on her faded velvet suit, a pair of meticulously darned silk gloves and a bottle of eau-de-cologne. She took the bottle out at rare intervals to rub a few drops on her carefully groomed hands, and hid it promptly, noticing the sidewise, yearning glance of her mother from behind the French novel. It had been four years since the Argounov family left Petrograd. Four years ago Argounov's textile factory on the outskirts of the capital was nationalized in the name of the people. In the name of the people the banks were declared national property. Argounov's safe-deposit boxes were bro­ ken open and emptied. The luminous collars of rubies and di­ amonds, which Galina Petrovna paraded proudly in sparkling ball-rooms and kept prudently locked afterwards, passed into unknown hands, never to be seen again. In the days when the shadow of a growing, nameless fear descended upon the city, hanging like a heavy mist on un­ lighted street comers, when sudden shots rang in the night, trucks bristling with bayonets rumbled down the cobble­ stones, and store windows crashed with a sonorous ringing of glass; when the members of the Argounovs' social set sud-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 AYN RAND denly melted away, like snow drops over a bonfire; when the Argounov fami ly found themselves in the halls of their stately granite ma nsion, with a consid erable sum of cash, a few last pieces of jewelry, and a constant terror at every sound of the door bell-a flight from the city stood before them as their only course of action . In those days the thunder of the revolutionary struggle had died in Petrograd, in the resigned hopele ssness of Red vic­ tory, but in the south of Russia it still roared on the fields of civil war. The south was in the hands of the White Army. That army was thrown in disjoined troops acr oss the vast country, divided by miles of broken railroad tracks and un­ kno wn, desolated village s; that army carried three-colored banners , an impatient, bewildered contempt of the enemy­ and no realization of his importance. The Argou novs left Petro grad for the Crimea, there to await the capi tal's liber ation from the Red yoke . Behind them, they left drawing rooms with tall mirrors reflecting blazing crystal chandeliers; perfumed furs and thoroughbred horses on sunny winter mornings; plat e-glass windows that opened on the avenue of stately mansio ns, the Kamenostrov­ sky, Petrograd 's exclusive thoroughfare. They met four years of crowded summer shacks where piercing Crimean winds whi stled through porous stone walls; of tea with saccharine, and onions fried in linseed oil; of nightly bombardments and fearful mornings when only the red flags or the three-colored banners in the streets announced into whose hands the town had pas sed. The Crimea changed hands six tim es. Nineteen twenty-one saw the end of the struggle. From the shores of the White Sea to those of the Bla ck, from the border of Poland to the yellow rivers of China, the red banner rose triumphantly to the sound of the \"Internationa le \" and the clicking of key s, as the wor ld's doors closed on Russia. The Argounovs had left Petrograd in autumn, calmly and almo st cheerfully. They had consid ered their trip an unpleas­ ant, but short annoyanc e. They had expected to be back in the spring . Galina Petrovn a had not allowed Alex ander Dimitrievitch to take a wint er fur coat alo ng. \"Why, he thinks it's going to last a yea r! \" she had laughed, referring to the Soviet government.

When they were in the train and the wheels screeched and tore forward for the first time , in that first jerk toward Petro grad, they looked at one another, but said noth ing. Galina Petrovna was thinking of their mansion on Kamenos­ trovsky and whether they could get it back; Lydia was think­ ing of the old church where she had knelt every Easter of her childhood, and that she would visit it on her first day in Petrograd; Alexander Dimitrievitch was not thinking; Kira remembered suddenly that when she went to the theater, her favorite moment was the one when the lights went out and the curtain shivered before rising; and she wondered why she was thinking of that moment. Kira 's table was between two wooden bench es. Ten heads faced one another-like two tense, hostile wall s, swaying as the train rocked-ten weary, dusty white spots in the semi­ darkne ss: Alexander Dimitrievitch and the faint glint of his gold pince-nez, Galina Petrovna, her face whiter than the white pages of her book, a young Soviet official with glim­ mers of light in his new leather brief case, a bearded peasant in a smelly sheepskin coat, who scratched himself continu­ ously , a hagga rd woman with sagging breasts , who was counting cons tantly, hysterically her packages and children; and facing them-two of the bare-footed, uncombed chil­ dren, and a soldier, his head bent, his yellow bast shoes rest­ ing on the alligator suitcase of a fat lady in a fur coat, the only passenger with a suitcase and with pink, glossy cheeks, and next to her the sallow, freckled face of a di ssatisfied woman with a man's jacket, bad teeth and a red kerchief on her hair. Through the broken window, a ray of light came in over Kira 's head. Dust danced in the ray and it stopped on three pairs of boots swinging down from the upper berth where three soldiers huddled together. Above them, high over the upper berth, a consumptive young fellow was curled on the baggage rack, his chest crushed against the ceiling, asleep, snoring raucously, breathing with effort. Under the travelers' feet the wheels knocked as if a load of rusty iron crashed and then splinters rolled, clattering down three steps, and another crash and splinters clattering, and another crash and splinters clattering, and over the travelers' heads a man's breath whis­ tled like air hissi ng out of a punctured balloon ; the man"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 AYN R A ND stopped at times to moan weak ly; the wheels went on clat­ tering. Kira was eighteen years old and she thought of Petrograd. The faces around her spoke of Petrograd. She did not know whether the sentences hissed into the dust y air were spoken in one hour, or one day, or through the two weeks in the rocking haze of dust, sweat and fear. She did not remember- because she did not listen. \"In Petrograd they have dried fi sh, citizens. \" \"And sunflower-seed oil. \" \"Sunflower-seed oil !

I haven 't tasted it for five years. Real ice-cream, cold, so cold it takes your breath away .... \" \"Yes ,\" said Kira, \"so cold it takes your breath away, but then you can walk faster, and there are lights. a long line of ligh ts, moving past you as you walk.\""},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 25 \"What are you talking about?\" asked Lydia. \"Why, about Petrograd.\" Kira 109ked at her, surprised. \"I thought you were talking about P.etrograd, and how cold it was there, weren't you?\" \"We were not. You're off-as usual.\" \"I was thinking about the streets. The streets of a big city where so much is possible and so many things can happen to you.\" Galina Petrovna remarked dryly: \"You're saying that quite happily, aren't you? I should think we'd all be quite tired of 'things happening,' by now. Haven't you had enough happen to you with the revolution, and all?\" \"Oh, yes, \" said Kira indifferently, \"the revolution.\" The woman in the red kerchief opened a package and pro­ duced a piece of dried fish, and said to the upper berth: \"Kindly take your boots away, citizen. I'm eating.\" The boots did not move. A voice answered: \"You don't eat with your nose.\" The woman bit into the fish and her elbow poked furiously into the fur coat of her neighbor, and she said: \"Sure, no con­ sideration for us proletarians. It's not like as if I had a fur coat on. Only I wouldn't be eating dried fish then. I'd be eat­ ing white bread.\" \"White bread?\" The lady in the fur coat was frightened. \"Why, citizen, who ever heard of white bread? Why, I have a nephew in the Red Army, citizen, and . .. and, why, I wouldn't dream of white bread!\" \"No? I bet you wouldn't eat dry fish, though. Want a piece?\" \"Why ... why, yes, thank you, citizen. I'm a little hungry and .... \" \"So? You are? I know you bourgeois. You're only too glad to get the last bite out of a toiler's mouth. But not out of my mouth, you don't!\" The car smelt of rotting wood, clothes that had not been changed for weeks and the odor coming from a little door open at the end of the coach. The lady in the fur coat got up and made her way timidly toward that door, stepping over the bodies in the aisle. \"Could you please step out for a moment, citizens?\" she asked humbly of the two gentlemen who were traveling com­ fortably in that little private compartment, one of them on the seat, the other stretched in the filth of the floor."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26 AYN RAND \"Certainly, citizen,\" the one who was sitting answered po­ litely and kicked the one on the floor to awaken him. Left alone where no one could watch her, the lady in the fur coat opened her handbag furtively and unwrapped a little bundle of oiled paper. She did not want anyone in the car to know that she had a whole boiled potato. She ate hurriedly in big, hysterical bites, choking, trying not to be heard be­ yond the closed door. When she came out, she found the two gentlemen waiting by the door to retrieve their seats. At night, two smoked lanterns trembled over the car, one at each end, over the doors, two shivering yellow spots in the darkness, with a gray night sky shaking in the squares of bro­ ken windows. Black figures, stiff and limp as dummies, swayed to the clatter of the wheels, asleep in sitting postures. Some snored. Some moaned. No one spoke. When they passed a station, a ray of light swept across the car, and against the light Kira's figure flashed for a second, bent, her face in her lap on folded arms, her hair hanging down, the light setting sparks in the hair, then dying again. Somewhere in the train, a soldier had an accordion. He sang, hour after hour, through the darkness, the wheels and the moans, dully, persistently, hopelessly. No one could tell whether his song was gay or sad, a j oke or an immortal mon­ ument; it was the first song of the revolution, risen from no­ where, gay, reckless, bitter, impudent, sung by millions of voices, echoing against train roofs, and village roads, and dark city pavements, some voices laughing, some voices wailing, a people laughing at its own sorrow, the song of the revolution, written on no banner, but in every weary throat, the \"Song of the Little Apple.\" \"Hey, little apple, Where are you rollin g ?\" \"Hey, little apple, where are you rolling? If you fall into German paws, you'll never come back .... Hey, little apple, where are you rolling? My sweetie's a White and I'm a Bol­ shevik. ...

Many times each night the door of the dark car was kicked open and a lantern burst in, held high in an unsteady hand,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"WE THE LI VING 27 and behind the lantern came gleaming steel bands, and khaki, and brass button s; bayonets and men with stem, imperious voices that ordered: \"Your documents !\" The lantern swam slowly, shaking, down the car, stopping on pale, startled faces with blinking eyes, and trembling hands with crumpled scraps of paper. Then Galina Petrovna smiled ingratiat ingly , repeating : \"Here you are, comrade. Here, comrade,\" thrusting at the lantern a piece of paper with a few typewritten lines which stated that a permi ssion for a trip to Petrograd had been granted the citizen Alexander Argounov with wife Galina and daughters: Lydia, 28, and Kira, 18. The men behind the lantern looked at the paper, and curtly handed it back, and walked farther, stepping over Lydi a's legs stretched acro ss the aisle. Sometimes some men threw a quick glance back at the girl who sat on the table. She was awake and her eyes followed them . Her eyes were not frightened; they were steady, curi­ ous, hostile. Then the men and the lantern were gone and somewhere in the train the soldier with the accordion wailed: \"And now there is no Russia, For Russia's all sprawled. Hey, little apple, Where have you rolled?\" Sometimes the train stopped at night. No one knew why it had stopped. There was no station, no sign of life in the bar­ ren waste of miles. An empty stretch of sky hung over an empty stretch of land; the sky had a few black spots of clouds; the land-a few black spots of bush es. A faint, red, quivering line divided the two; it looked like a storm or a distant fire. Whispers crawled down the long line of cars: ''The boiler exploded .... \" \"The bridge is blown up half a mile ahead .... \" \"They've found counter-revolutionaries on the train and they're going to shoot them right here, in the bushes .... \" \"If we stay much longer ... the bandits ... you know .... \" \"They say Makhno is right in this neighborho od.\" \"If he gets us, you know what that means, don't you? No"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 AYN RAND man leaves alive, but the women do and wish they didn't. ... \" \"Stop talking nonsense, citizen. You're making the women nervous.\" Searchlights darted into the clouds and died instantly and no one could say whether they were close by or miles away. And no one could tell whether the black spot that had seemed to move was a horseman or just a bush. The train started as suddenly as it had stopped. Sighs of relief greeted the screeching of wheels. No one ever learned why the train had stopped. Early one morning, some men rushed through the car. One of them had a Red Cross badge. There was the sound of a commotion outside. One of the passengers followed the men. When he came back his face made the travelers feel uneasy. \"It' s in the next car, \" he exp lained. \"A fool peasant woman. Traveled between the cars and tied her legs to the buffer so she wouldn't fall. Fell asleep at night, too tired, I guess, and slipped off. Le gs tied, it just dragged her with the train, under the car. Head cut off. Sorry I went to see.\" Halfway through the journe y, at a lonely little station that had a rotting platform and bright posters and unkempt sol­ diers on both platform and posters, it was found that the pas­ senger coach in which the Argounov family traveled, could go no farther. The cars had not been repaired or inspected for yea rs; when they suddenly and finally broke down, no re­ pairs could help. The occupants were requested to move out speedily. They had to squeeze themselves into the other over­ crowded cars-if they could. The Argounovs fought their way into a box car. Gratefully, Galina Petrovna and Lydia made the sign of the cross. The woman with the sagging breasts could not find room for all of her children. When the train pulled out, she was seen sitting on her bundle s, the bewildered children clinging to her skirt, watching the train with a dull, hopeless stare. Across prairies and marshes, the long line of cars crawled wearily, a veil of smoke floating and melting into white puffs behind it. Soldiers huddled in groups on the sloping, slippery roofs. Some of them had harmonicas. They played and sang about the little apple. The song trailed and melted away with the smoke. A crowd awaited the train in Petro grad. When the last panting of the engine reverberated through the terminal"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 29 vaults, Kira Argounova faced the mob that met every train. Under the folds of shapeless clothes, their bodies were driven by the tense, unnatural energy of a long struggle that had be­ come habitual; their faces were hard and worn. Behind them were tall, grilled windows; behind these was the city. Kira was pushed forward by impatient travelers. Alighting, she stopped for one short second of hesitation, as if feeling the significance of the step. Her foot was sunburned, and she wore a home-made wooden sandal with leather straps. For one short second the foot was held in the air. Then the wooden sandal touched the wooden boards of the platform: Kira Argounova was in Petrograd. II PROLETARI ANS OF THE WORLD, UNITE ! Kira looked at the words on the bare plaster walls of the station. The plaster had crumbled off in dark blotches that made the walls look skin-diseased. But fresh signs had been printed upon them. Red letters announced: LONG LIVE THE DICTATORS HIP OF THE PROLETARIAT ! WHO IS NOT WITH US-IS AGAINST US! The letters had been made by a smudge of red paint over a stencil. Some lines were crooked. Some letters had dried with long, thin streaks of red winding down the walls. A young fellow leaned against a wall under the signs. A crumpled lambskin hat was crushed over his pale hair that hung over his pale eyes. He stared aimlessly ahead and cracked sunflower seeds, spitting the shells out of the comer of his mouth. Between the train and the walls, a whirlpool of khaki and - red dragged Kira into the midst of soldiers' coats, red ker­ chiefs, unshaved faces, mouths that opened soundlessly, their screams swallowed in a roar of boots shuffling down the platform, beating against the high steel ceiling. An old barrel with rusty hoops and a tin cup attached on a chain bore a painted inscription: \"Boiled water\" and a huge sign: \"BE­ WARE OF CHOLERA. Do NOT DRINK RAW WATER.\" A stray dog with ribs like a skeleton's, its tail between its legs, was"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30 AYN RAND smelling the littered floor, searching for food. Two armed soldiers were fighting through the crowd, dragging a peasant woman who struggled and sob bed : \"Comrades! I didn 't! Brothers, where are you taking me? Comrades dear, so help me God, I didn't! \" From below, among the boots and swishing, mud-caked skirts, someone howled monotonously, not quite a human sound nor a barking: a woman was crawling on her knees, trying to gather a spilled sack of millet, sobbing, picking up the grain mixed with sunflower-seed shells and cigarette butts. Kira looked at the tall windows. She heard, from the out­ side, the old familiar sound of the piercing tramway bell. She smiled. At a door marked in red letters \"Commandant,\" a young soldier stood on guard. Kira looked at him. His eyes were austere and forbidding like caverns where a single flame burned under cold, gray vaults; there was an air of innate te­ merity in the lines of his tanned face, of the hand that grasped the bayonet, of the neck in the open shirt collar. Kira liked him. She looked straight into his eyes and smiled. She thought that he understood her, that he guessed the great ad­ venture beginning for her. The soldier looked at her coldly, indifferent ly, astonished. She turned away, a little disappointed, although she did not know just what she had expected. All the soldier noticed was that the strange girl in the child's stocking-cap had strange· eyes ; also that she wore a light suit and no brassiere, which fact he did not resent at all. \"Kira! \" Galina Petrovna 's voice pierced the roar of the sta­ tion. \"Kira! Where are you? Where are your parcels? How about your parcels? \" Kira returned to the box car where her family was strug­ gling with the luggage. She had forgotten that she had to carry three bundles, porters being a luxury out of reach. Galina Petrovna was fighting off these porters, husky loafers in ragged soldiers' coats, who seized luggage without being asked, insolently offering their services. Then, arms strained by the bundled remains of their for­ tune, the Argounov family descended upon the ground of Petrograd. A gold sickle and hammer rose over the stati on 's exit door.

The smell of carbolic acid rose higher than all the rest. Station buildings were disinfected against the diseases that poured into the city on every train. Like a breath from a hos­ pital window, the odor hung in the air as a warning and a grim reminder. The doors into Petrograd opened upon the Znamensky square. A sign on a post announced its new name: SQUARE OF UPRISING. A huge gray statue of Alexander III faced the sta­ tion, against a gray hotel building, against a gray sky . It was not raining heavily, but a few drops fell at long intervals, slowly, monotonously, as if the sky were leaking, as if it too were in need of repairs, like the rotted wooden paving where raindrops made silver sparks on dark puddles. The raised black tops of hansom cabs looked like patent leather, sway­ ing, quivering, wheels grunting in the mud with the sound of animals chewing. Old buildings watched the square with the dead eyes of abandoned shop s in whose dusty windows the cobwebs and faded newspapers had not been disturbed for five years. But one shop bore a cotton sign: PROVISION CENTER. A line waited at the door, stretching around the comer; a long line of feet in shoes swollen by the rain, of red, frozen hands, of raised collars that did not prevent the raindrops from rolling down many bac ks, for many heads were bent \"W ell ,\" said Alexander Dimitrievitch, \"we 're back.\" \"Isn't it wonderful! \" said Kira. \"Mud, as ever,\" said Lydia. \"W e'l l have to take a cab.

The horse jerked forward, sending a shower of mud on Kira 's legs, and turned into the Nevsky Prospect. The long, broad avenue lay before them, as straight as if it were the spine of the city. Far away, the slender gold spire of the Admiralty gleamed faintly in the gray mist, like a long arm raised in a solemn greeting."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 AYN RAND Petrograd had seen five years of revolution. Four of those years had closed its every artery and every store, when na­ tionalization smeared dust and cobwebs over the plate-glass windows; the last year had brought out soap and mops, new paint and new owners, as the state 's New Economic Policy had announced a \"temporary compromi se\" and allowed small private stores to re-open timidly. After a long sleep, Nevsky was opening its eyes slowly. The eyes were not used to the light; they had opened in a hurry and they stared, wide, frightened, incredulous. New signs were cotton strips with glaring, uneven letters. Old signs were mar­ ble obituaries of men long since gone. Gold letters spelled for­ gotten names on the windows of new owners, and bullet holes with sunburst cracks still decorated the gla ss. There were stores without signs and signs without stores. But between the windows and over closed doors, over bricks and boards and cracked plaster, the city wore a mantle of color bright as a patchwork: there were posters of red shirts, and yellow wheat, and red banners, and blue wheels, and red kerchiefs, and gray tractors, and red smokestacks; they were wet, transparent in the rain, showing layers of old posters underneath, growing­ unchecked, unrestricted-like the bright mildew of a city.

The cab stopped at the building where, four years ago, they had seen the Dunaevs in their magnificent apartment. One half of the imposing entrance door had a huge, square glass pane; the other half was filled in with unpainted boards hastily nailed together. The spacious lobby had had a soft carpet, Galina Petrovna remembered, and a hand-carved fireplace. The carpet was gone; the fireplace was still there, but there were penciled in­ scriptions on the white stomachs of its marble cupids and a long, diagonal crack in the large mirror above it. A sleepy janitor stuck his head out of the little booth under the stairs and withdrew it indifferently. They carried their bundles up the stairs. They stopped at a padded door; the black oilcloth was ripped and gray lumps of soiled cotton made a fringe around the door. \"I wonder, \" Lydia whispered, \"if they still have their mag­ nificent butler. \" Galina Petrovna pressed the bell. There were steps inside. A key turned. A cautious hand half opened the door, protected by a chain. Through the nar­ row crack, they saw an old woman's face cut by hanging gray hair, a stomach under a dirty towel tied as an apron, and one foot in a man's bedroom slipper. The woman looked at them silently, with hostile inquiry, with no intention of open­ ing the door farther. \"Is Maria Petrovna in?\" Galina Petrovna asked in a slightly unnatural voice. \"Who wants to know?\" asked the toothless mouth. \"I'm her sister, Galina Petrovna Argounov a. \" The woman did' not answer; she turned and yelled into the house: \"Maria Petrovna! Here's a mob that says them's your sister!\" A cough answered from the depths of the house, then slow steps; then a pale face peered over the old woman's shoulder and a mouth opened with a shriek: \"My Lo rd in Heaven!\" The door was thrown wide open. Two thin arms seized Galina Petrov na, crushing her against a trembling chest . \"Galina! Darling! It's you!\" \"Marussia!\" Galina Petrovna's lips sank into the powder on a flabby cheek and her nose into the thin, dry hair sprin­ kled with a perfume that smelled like vanilla.

She looked older than Galina Petrovna now. Her skin was the color of soiled linen ; her lips were not red enough, but her eyelids were too red. A door crashed open behind her and something came fly­ ing into the anteroom; something tall, tense, with a storm of hair and eyes like automob ile headlights ; and Galina Petrovna recognized Irina, her niece, a young girl of eighteen with the eyes of twenty-eight and the laughter of eight. Be­ hind her, Acia, her little sister, waddled in slowly and stood in the doorway, watching the newcomers sullen ly; she was eight years old, needed a haircut and one garter. Galina Petrovna kissed the girls; then she raised herself on tiptoe to pla nt a kiss on the cheek of her brother -in-la w, Va sili Ivanovitch. She tried not to look at him. His thick hair was white; his tall, powerful body stooped. Had she seen the Admiralty tower stooping, Galina Petrovna would have felt less alarmed. Vasili Ivanovitch spoke seldom. He said only : \"Is that my little friend Kira?\" The question was warmer than a kiss. His sunken eyes were like a fireplace where the last blaz­ ing coal s fought against slow , inev itable ash es. He said: \"Sorry Victor isn 't home . He 's at the Inst itute . The boy works so hard.\" His son's name acted like a strong breath that revived the coals for a moment. Bef ore the revolut ion, Va sili Ivanovitch Dunaev had owned a prosperous fur busin ess. He had started as a trapper in the wilde rness of Siberia, with a gun, a pair of boots, and two arms that could lift an ox. He wore the scar of a bear 's teeth on his thigh. Once, he was found buried in the snow ; he had been there for two days; his arms clutched the body of the most magnificent silver fox the frightened Siberian peasants had ever seen. His relatives heard no word from him for ten years. When he returned to St. Petersburg, he opened an office of which his relatives could not afford the door kno bs; and he bought silver horseshoes for the three horses that galloped with his carriage down Nevsky. His hands had provided the ermines that swept many mar­ ble stairways in the royal pala ces; the sables that embraced many shoulders white as marble. His muscles and the long hours of the frozen Siberian nights had paid for every hair of every fur that passed through his han ds."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 35 He was · sixty years old; his backbone had been as straight as his gun ; his spirit-as straight as his backbone. When Galina Petrovna raised a steaming spoonful of mil­ let to her lips in her sister 's dining room, she threw a furtive glance at Vasili Ivanovitch . She was afraid to study him openly; but she had seen the stooped backbone; she won­ dered about the spirit. She saw the changes in the dining room. The spoon she held was not the monogrammed silve rware she remembered; it was of heavy tin that gave a metallic taste to the mush. She remembered crystal and silver fruit vases on the buffet; one solitary jug of Ukrainian pottery adorned it now. Big rust y nails on the walls showed the places where old paintings had hung . Across the table, Maria Petrovna was talking with a ner­ vous, fluttering hurry, a strange caricature of the capricious manner that had charmed every drawing room she entered. Her words were strange to Galina Petrovna, words like mile­ stones of the years that had been parted and of what had hap­ pened in those years. \"Ration cards-th ey're for Soviet employees only.

Maria Petrovna had known the value of her han ds; she had leamed how to keep them in sight consta ntly, how to use them with the pliant grace of a ballerina. It was a habit she had not lost. Galina Petrovna wished she would lose it; the soft, fluttering gestures of those hands were only one more reminder. Va sili Ivanovitch was speaking suddenly. He had always been reticent in the expression of his feelings. But one sub­ ject aroused him and then his expressions were not re­ strained: \"All this is temporary. You all lose faith so easily .

As he stopped on the threshold, his eyes stopped on Kira; as she turned in her chair, they stopped on her legs. \"It 's little Kira, isn't it?\" were the first sounds of his strong, clear voice. \"It was, \" she answered. \"Well, well, what a surpri se !

Little flames flickered over the glazed abyss of darkness beyond the big, bare, curtainless windows; little sparks danced in the pol­ ished curves of the hand-carved furniture, leaving in shadows the torn brocade; golden spangles played in the heavy gold frame of the only picture in the room, leaving in shadows the picture itself: a painting of Maria Petrovna twenty years ago, with a delicate hand resting on an ivory shoulder, mocking the old knitted shawl which the living Maria Petrovna clutched convulsively over her trembling shoulders when she coughed."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40 AYN RAND The logs were damp; a fretful blue flame hissed feebly, dying and flaring up again in a burst of acrid smoke. Kira sat in the deep, silken fur of a white bear rug at the fireplace, her arm encircling affectionately the huge mon­ ster's ferocious head. It had been her favorite since child­ hood. When visiting her uncle, she had always asked for the story of how he had killed that bear, and she had laughed happily when he threatened that the bear would come back to life and bite disobedient little girls. \"W ell, \" said Maria Petrovna, her hands fluttering in the fire glow, \"well, here you are back in Petrograd.\" \"Yes, \" said Galina Petrovna, \"here we are.\" \"Oh, Saint Mother of God!\" sighed Maria Petr o vna. \"It makes it so hard sometimes to have a future to think about!\" \"It does, \" said Galina Petrovna. \"W ell, what are the plans for the girls?

The office had bare walls. They had served as towel to many a dirty hand, for traces left by five fingers zigzagged across the faded paint. In the old house now nationalized for government offices, it had been a washroom.

In that vast mansion Galina Petrovna had a boudoir where, at night, a maid in black fastened the clasps of her di­ amond necklaces; and a reception room where, her taffeta petticoats rustling solemnly, she entertained ladies with sa­ bles and lorgnettes. Children were not admitted into these rooms, and Galina Petrovna seldom appeared in any of the others. Kira had an English governess, a thoughtful young lady with a lovely smile. She liked her governess, but often pre­ ferred to be alone-and was left alone. When she refused to play with a crippled relative of whom the family 's compas­ sion had made a general idol-she was never asked to do it again. When she threw out of the window the first book she read about the good fairy rewarding an unselfish little girl­ the governess never brought another one of that kind. When she was taken to church and sneaked out alone in the middle of the services, to get lost in the streets and be brought home to her frantic family-in a police wagon-she was never taken to church again. The Argounov summer residence stood on a high hill over a river, alone in its spacious gardens, on the outskirts of a fashionable summer resort. The house turned its back upon the river and faced the grounds where the hill sloped down gracefully into a garden of lawns drawn with a ruler, bushes clipped into archways and marble fountains made by famous artists. The other side of the hill hung over the river like a mass of rock and earth disgorged by a volcano and frozen in its chaotic tangle. Rowing downstream, people expected a dino­ saur to stretch its head out of the black caves overgrown with wild ferns, between trees that grew horizontally into the air, huge roots, like spiders, grasping the rocks."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46 AYN RAND For many summers, while her parents were visiting Nice, Bia rritz and Vienna, Kira was left alone to spend her days in the wild freedom of the rocky hill, as its sole, undisputed sovereign in a tom blue skirt and a white shirt whose sleeves were always missing . The sharp sand cut her bare feet. She swung from rock to rock, gra!!ping a tree branch, throwing her body into space, the blue skirt flaring like a parachute. She made a raft of tree branches and, clutching a long pole, sailed down the river. There were many dangerous rocks and whirlpools on the way. The thrill of the struggle rose from her bare feet, that felt the stream pulsating under the frail raft, through her body tensed to meet the wind, the blue skirt beating against her legs like a sail . Branches bend­ ing over the river brushed her forehead. She swept past, leav­ ing threads of hair entwined in the leaves, and the trees leaving wild red berries caught in her hair. The first thing that Kira learned about life and the first thing that her elders learned, dismayed, about Kira, was the joy of being alone. * \"Born in 1904, eh?\" said the Soviet official . \"That makes you ... let's see ... eighteen.

In the evenings Lydia read avidly , blushing, books of del­ icate, sinful romance, which she hid from Galina Petrovna. Kira began reading one of these books; she fell asleep and did not finish it. She never began another. She saw no difference between weeds and flowers; she yawned when Lydia sighed at the beauty of a sunset over lonely hills. But she stood for an hour looking at the black silhouette of a tall young soldier against the roaring flame of a blazing oil well he had been posted to guard. She stopped suddenly, as they walked down a street in the evening, and pointed at a strange angle of white wall over battered roofs, luminous on a black sky in the glare of an old lantern, with a dark, barred window like that of a dungeon, and she whispered: \"How beautiful!\" \"What's beautiful about it? \" Lydia asked. \"Because it's so strange ... promising ... as if something could happen there .... \" \"Happen to whom?\" \"To me. \" Lydia seldom questioned Kira's emotions; they were not feeli ngs to her but only Kira's feeli ngs; and the family shrugged impatiently at what they called Kira's feelings.

She had the same feeling for white statues of an­ cient gods against black velvet in museums, and for steel shavings and rusty dust and hissing torches and muscles tense as electric wires in the iron roar of a building under construction. She seldom visited museums; but when they went out with Kira, her family avoided passing by any con­ struction works: houses, and particularly roads, and most par­ ticularly bridges. She was certain to stop and stand watching, for hours, red bricks and oaken bea ms and steel panels grow­ ing under the will of man.

At luncheon, girls sat at these tables in couples, in fours, in dozens. Kira always sat at a table in a comer­ alone. One day her class declared a boycott against a little freck­ led girl who had incurred the displeasure of her most popular classmate, a loud-voiced young lady who had a smile, a handshake and a command ready for everyone. That noon, at luncheon, the little table in the comer of the dining room was occupied by two students: Kira and the freckled girl. They were half through their bowls of buck­ wheat mush, when the indignant class leader approached them. \"Do you know what you're doing, Argounova?\" she asked, eyes blazing. \"Eating mush,\" answered Kira. \"Won't you sit down?\" \"Do you know what this girl here has done? \" \"I haven't the slightest idea. \" \"You haven't? Then why are you doing this for her?\" \"You're mistaken. I am not doing this fo r her, I am doing it against twenty-eight other girl s. \" \"So you think it's smart to go against the ma jority?\" \"I think that when in doubt about the truth of an issue, it's safer and in bette r taste to select the least numerous of the adversaries ....

She kept his picture on her dresser, with a single red rose in a thin crystal glass beside it. At the age of fifteen, she fell in love with Saint Francis of Assisi, who talked to the birds and helped the poor, and she dreamed of entering a convent. Kira had never been in love. The only hero she had known was a Viking whose story she had read as a child; a Viking whose eyes never looked farther than the point of his sword, but there was no boundary for the point of his sword; a Viking who walked through life, breaking barriers and reaping victories, who walked through ruins while the sun made a crown over his head, but he walked, light and straight, without noticing its weight; a Viking who laughed at kings, who laughed at priests, who looked at heaven only when he bent for a drink over a mountain brook and there, over-shadowing the sky, he saw his own picture; a Viking who lived but for the joy and the wonder and the glory of the god that was himself. Kira did not remember the books she read before that legend; she did not want to remember the ones she read after it. But through the years that followed, she remembered the end of the legend: when the Viking stood on a tower over a city he had conquered. The Vik­ ing smiled as men smile when they look up at heaven; but he was looking down. His right arm was one straight line with his lowered sword; his left arm , straight as the sword, raised a goblet of wine to the sky. The first rays of a coming sun, still unseen to the earth, struck the crystal goblet. It sparkled like a white torch. Its rays lighted the faces of those below. \"To a life,\" said the Viking, \"which is a reason unto itsel f. \" * \"So you're not a Union member, citizen?\" said the Soviet official. ''Too bad, too bad. The trade unions are the steel girders of our great state building, as said . . . well, one of our great leaders said. What's a citizen? Only a brick and of no use unless cemented to other bricks just like it.\" * Occupation: STUDENT. * From somewhere in the aristocratic Middle Ages, Kira had inherited the conviction that labor and effort were ignoble.

She sneaked out through a win­ dow when guests were expected, and she could not cook a po­ tato. She never went to church and seldom read a newspaper. But she had chosen a future of the hardest work and most demanding effort. She was to be an engineer. She had de­ cided it with her first thought about the vague thing called future. And that first thought had been quiet and reverent, for her future was consecrated, because it was her future. She had played with mechanical toys, which were not intended for girls, and had built ships and bridges and towers; she had watched rising steel and bricks and steam. Over Lydia's bed hung an ikon, over Kira's-the picture of an American sky­ scraper. Even though those who listened smiled incredu­ lously, she spoke about the houses she would build of glass and steel, about a white aluminum bridge across a blue river-\"but, Kira, you can't make a bridge of aluminum \"­ about men and wheels and cranes under her orders, about a sunrise on the steel skeleton of a skyscraper. She knew she had a life and that it was her life. She knew the work which she had chosen and which she expected of life. The other thing which she expected, she did not know, for it had no name, but it had been promised to her, promised in a memory of her childhood. When the summer sun sank behind the hills, Kira sat on a high cliff and watched the fashionable casino far down by the river. The tall spire of the music pavilion pierced the red sky. The slim, black shadows of women moved against the orange panels of the lighted glass doors. An orchestra played in the pavilion. It played gay, sparkling tunes from musical comedi es. It threw the fire of electric signs, of ringing glasses, of shining limousines, of nights in Europe's capi­ tals-into the dark evening sky over a silent river and a rocky hill with prehistorical trees. The light tunes of casinos and beer-gardens, sung all over Europe by girls with sparkling eyes and swaying hips, had a significance for Kira that no one else ever attached to them. She heard in them a profound joy of life, so profound that it could be as light as a dancer's feet. And because she wor­ shipped joy, Kira seldom laughed and did not go to see com­ edies in theaters. And because she felt a profound rebellion against the weighty, the tragic, the solemn, Kira had a sol­ emn reverence for those songs of defiant gaiety."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"WE TH E LIVIN G 51 They came from the strange world where grownups moved among colored lights and white tables, where there was so much that she could not understand and so much that was awaiting her. They came out of her future. She had selected one song as her, Kir a's, own : it was from an old operetta and was called ''The Song of Broken Gla ss.\" It had been introduced by a famous beauty of Vienna. There had been a balust rade on the stage, overlooking a drop with the twinkling lights of a big city, and a row of crystal goblets lined along the balustrade. The beauty sang the number and one by one, lightly, hardly touching them, kicked the crystal goblets and sent them flying in tingling, glittering splinters­ around the tight, sheer stockings on the most beautiful legs in Europe. . There were sharp little blows in the music, and waves of quick, fine notes that burst and rolled like the thin, clear ring­ ing of broken glass. There were slow notes, as if the cords of the violins trembled in hesitation, tense with the fullness of sound, taking a few measured steps before the leap into the explosion of laughter. The wind blew Kira's hair across her eyes and sent a cold breath at the toes of her bare feet hanging over the cliff's edge. In the twilight, the sky seemed to rise slowly to a greater height, growing darker, and the first star dropped into the river. A lonely little girl on a slippery rock listened to her own hymn and smiled at what it promised her. Such had been Kira's entrance into life. Some enter it from under gray temple vaults, with head bowed in awe, with the light of sacrificial candles in their hearts and eye s. Some en­ ter it with a heart like a pavement -tramped by many feet, and with a cold skin crying for the warmth of the herd. Kira Argounova entered it with the sword of a Viking pointing the way and an operetta tune for a battle march. * The Soviet official angrily wiped his pen with his check- ered handkerchief, for he had made an ink spot on the last page. \"Toil, comrade,\" he said, \"is the highest aim of our lives.

Across the top of the first page was printed the slogan: PROLETARI ANS OF THE WORLD, UNITE ! Under it was written the name: KIRA ARGOUNOVA IV Kira had blisters on her hands where the sharp string had rubbed too long. It was not easy to carry packages up four floors, eight flights of stone stairs that smelled of cats and felt cold through the thin soles of her shoes. Every time she hurried down for another load, skipping briskly over the steps, sliding down the bannist er, she met Lydia, climbing up slowly , heavily , clutching bundles to her breast, panting and sighing bitterly, steam blowing from her mouth with every word: \"Our Lord in Heaven! ... Saint Mother of God !\" The Argounovs had found an apartment. They had been congratulated as if it were a miracle. The miracle had been made possib le by a handshake between Al­ exander Dimitrievitch and the Upravdom-the manager-of that house, a handshake after which Alexander Dimitrie­ vitch's hand remained empty, but the Upravdom's did not. Three rooms and a kitchen were worth a little gratitude in an over-crowded city. \"A bath?\" the indignant Upravdom had repeated Galina Petrovna's timid question. \"Don't be foolish, citizen, don't be fooli sh. \" They needed furniture. Bravely, Galina Petrovna paid a visit to the gray granite mansion on Kamenostrovsky. Before the stately edifice ris ing to the sky, she stood for a few mo­ ments, gathering her faded coat with the shedding fur collar tightly around her thin body.

That which I don't use. It's in the coach house. Take it. We're not so hard-hearted. We know it's tough for all you citizens bourgeo is.\" Galina Petrovna threw a wistful glance at her old Venetian mirror whose onyx stand bore a bucket of paint, but she did not argue and went down to the coach house in the back yard. She found a few chairs with missing legs, a few price­ less pieces of antique porcelain, a wash stand, a rusty samo­ var, two beds, a chest of old clothe s, and Lydia's grand piano, all buried under a pile of books from their library, old boxes, wood shavings and rat dung. They hired a drayman to transfer these posses sions to the little flat on the fourth floor of an old brick house whose tur­ bid windows faced the turbid Moika stream. But they could not afford a drayman twice. They borrowed a wheelbarrow­ and Alexander Dimitrievitch, silently indifferent, carted the bundles left at the Dunaevs to their new home. The four of them carried the bundles up the stairs, past landings that al­ ternated grimy doors and broken windows; the \"black stair­ way\" it used to be called, the back entrance for servants. Their new home had no front entrance. It had no electrical connections; the plumbing was out of order; they had to carry water in pail s from the floor below. Yellow stains spread over the ceilings, bearing witness to past rains. \"It will be very cozy-with just a little work and artistic judgme nt,\" Galina Petrovna had said. Alexander Dimi­ trievitch had sighed. The grand piano stood in the dining room. On top of the grand piano, Galina Petrovna put a teapot without handle or nose, the only thing left of her pricele ss Sachs tea service. Shelves of unpainted boards carried an odd asso rtment of cracked dishes; Lydia's artistry decorated the shelves with borders of paper lace. A folded newspaper supported the shortest leg of the table. A wick floating in a saucer of lin­ seed oil threw a spot of light on the ceiling in the long, dark evenings; in the morning s, strands of soot, like cobwebs, swayed slowly in the draft, high under the ceiling. Galina Petrovna was the first one to get up in the morning."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"54 AY N RAN D She threw an old shawl over her s h oulders and, blowing hard to make the damp logs bum, cooked millet for breakf ast. After breakfast the family parted. Alexander Dimitrievitch shuffled two miles to his busi­ ness, the textile store he had opened. He never took a tram­ way ; long lines waited for every tramway and he had no hope of fighting his way aboard. The store had been a bakery shop . He could not afford new signs. He had stretched a piece of cotton with crooked letters by the door, over one of the old black glass plates bearing a gold pretzel. He had hung two kerchiefs and an apron in the window. He had scraped the bakery labels off the old boxes and stacked them neatly on empty shelve s. Then he sat all day, his freezing feet on a cast-iron stove, his arms folded on his stomach, drowsing. When a customer came in, he shuffled behind the counter and smiled affectionately: \"The best kerchiefs in town, citi­ zen. . . . Certainly, fast colors , as fast as foreign goods .... Wo uld I take lard, instead of money? Certainly, citizen peas­ ant, certainly .... For half a pound? You can have two ker­ chiefs, citizen, and a yard of calico for good measur e.\" Sm iling happily, he put the lard into the large drawer that served as cash regis ter, next to a pound of rye flour. Lydia wound an old knitted scarf around her throat, after breakfast, put a basket over her arm, sighed bitterly and went to the co-operative. She stood in line, watching the hand of the clock on a distant tower moving slowly around its face and she spent the time reciting mentally French poems she had learned as a child. . \"But I don't need soap, citizen,\" she protested when her turn came, at the unpainted counter insid e the store that smelled of dill pickles and people 's breath. \"And I don't need dried herri ng.\" \"All we' ve got today, citizen.

She could read the silent accusation in his sullen eyes: \"Bourgeois. Private trad­ ers.\" Kira had been admitted to the Te chnological Institute. She went there every morning, walking, whistling, her hands in the pockets of an old black coat with a high collar buttoned severely under her chin. At the Institute, she listened to lec­ tures, but spoke to few people. She noticed many red ker­ chiefs in the crowds of students and heard a great deal about Red builders, proletarian culture and young engineers in the vanguard of the world revolution. But she did not listen, for she was thinking about her latest mathematical problem. During the lectures, she smiled suddenly, once in a while, at no one in particular; smiled at a dim, wordless thought of her own. She felt as if her ended childhood had been a cold shower, gay, hard and invigorating, and now she was enter­ ing her morning, with her work before her, with so much to be done. At night, the Argounovs gathered around the wick on the dining room table. Galina Petrovna served lentils and millet. There was not much variety in their menus. The millet went fast; so did their savings. After dinner, Kira brought her books into the dining room, for they had but one oil wick . She sat, the book between her elbows on the table, her fingers buried in the hair over her temples, her eyes wide, engrossed in circles, cubes, triangles, as in a thrilling romance. Lydia sat embroidering a handkerchief and sighed bitterly: \"Oh, that Soviet light! Such a light! And to think that some­ one has invented electricit y!\" \"That 's right,\" Kira agreed, astonished, \"it 's not a very good light, is it? Funny. I never noticed it before .\" One night, Galina Petrovna found the millet too mildewed to cook. They had no dinner. Lydia sighed over her embroi­ dery: \"These Soviet menus! \" \"That's right,\" said Kira, \"we didn 't have any dinner to­ night, did we?\" \"Where 's your mind,\" Lydia raged, \"if any? Do you ever notice anything?\" Through the evenings, Galina Petrovna grumbled at inter­ vals: \"A woman engineer!

Kira slept on a mattr ess on the floor. They retired early, to save light. Tucked under a thin blan­ ket, with her coat thrown over it, Kira watched Lydi a's figure in a long nightgown, a white stain in the dark nes s, kneeling before her ikons in the comer. Lydia mumbled prayers fever­ ishly, trembling in the cold, making the sign of the cross with a hurried hand, bowing low to the little red light and the few glimmers of stem, bronze faces. From her comer on the floor, Kira could see the reddish­ gray sky in the window and the gold spire of the Admiralty far away in the cold, foggy dusk over Petrograd, the city where so much was pos sible. * Victor Dunaev had taken a sudden interest in the family of his cousins. He carne often, he bent over Galina Petrovna 's hand as if he were at a Court reception, and laughed cheer­ fully as if he were at the circus . In his honor, Galina Petrovna served her last precious bits of sugar, inst ead of saccharine, with the evening tea. He brought along his resplendent smile, and the latest political gossip, and the current anecdote s, and news of the latest for­ eign inventions, and quotations from the latest poems, and his opinions on the theory of reflexes and the theory of rel­ ativity and the social mission of proletarian literature. \"A man of culture,\" he explained, \"has to be, above al l, a man attuned to his century.\" He smiled at Alexander Dimitrievitch and hastily offered a light for his home- made cig arette s; he smiled at Galina Petrovna and rose hastily every time she rose ; he smiled at Lydia and listened earnestly to her discourses on the simple faith; but he always managed to sit next to Kira. On the evening of October tenth, Victor carne late. It was nine o'clock when the sound of the door bell made Lydia dash eagerly to the little anteroom. \"Sor ry. So terribly, terribly sorry,\" Victor apologized, smil­ ing, hurling his cold overcoat on a chair, raising Lydi a's hand to his lips and patting his unruly hair with a quick glance in the mirror, all within the space of one second. \"Detained at"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 57 the Institute.

Five huge shadows rose to the ceiling; the feeble glow drew a triangle of light under the five pairs of nostrils. Tea gleamed green through heavy glasses cut out of old bottles. \"I heard, Victor,\" Galina Petrovna whispered confiden­ tially, like a conspirator, \"I heard-on good authority-that this NEP of theirs is onl y the beginning of many changes.

Alexander Dimitrievitch poured himself another glass of tea; he looked at the sugar, hesitated, looked at Galina Petrovna, and drank his tea without sugar. He said sullenly: \"Times aren't any better. They've called their secret police G.P .V. instead of Cheka, but it's still the same thing. Do you know what I heard at the store today?

Something like the black silhouette of a windmill wavered down the si dewalk; over it-a sailor tottered unsteadily, waving his arms, spitting sunflower see ds.

Thi s is a time when they make it felt with particular ugline ss. Tha t's all .\" \"This is a rash, unscientific viewpoint, Kira,\" said Victor, and went on talking about the esthetic value of sculpture, about the modem ballet and about new poets whose works were published in pretty little books with glossy white paper covers; he always kept the latest poem on his desk along with the latest sociological treatise, \"for balance\" he explained; and he recited his favorite poem in the fashionable manner of an expr es sionle ss, nasal sing-song, slowly taking Kir a's hand. Kira withdrew her hand and looked at the street lights. The cab turned into the quay. She knew they were driving along a river, for on one side of them the black sky had fallen below the ground into a cold, damp void, and IDng bands of silver shimmered lazily across that void, streaming from lonely lights that hung in the dark ness somewhere very far away. On the other side of them, man sions fused into a black skyline of urns, stat ues, balust rade s. There were no lights in the ma nsio ns. The hor se's hoofs, pounding the cob­ blest one s, rolled in echoes through rows of empty chambers. Victor dismis sed the cab at the Su mmer Garde n.

Victor took out his handkerchief and wiped an old bench wet with dew. They sat down under the statue of a Greek godde ss whose nose was broken off. A leaf floated down slowly, fluttered around its head and settled in the curve of its handle ss arm . Victor 's arm slowly encircled Kira 's shoulders. She moved away. Victor bent close to her and whispered, sighing, that he had waited to see her alone, that he had known roma nces, yes, many romanc es, women had been too kind to him, but he had alway s been unhappy and lonely, searching for his ideal, that he could understand her, that her sensitive soul was bound by convent ions, unawakened to life-and love .

Lanterns smoked over locked gat es; through grilled peep­ holes, night-watchm en 's eyes followed the lonely girl. Militia­ men glanced at her sidewise, sleepily suspicious. A cab driver awakened at the sound of her steps to offer his servi ces. A sailor tried to follow her, but took one look at the expression of her face and changed his mind. A cat dived soundlessly into a broken basement window as she approached. It was long past midnight when she turned suddenly into a street that seemed alive in the heart of a dead city. She saw yellow, curtained squares of light breaking stern, bare wal ls; squares of light on the bare sidewalk at glass entrance doo rs ; dark roofs, far away, that seemed to meet in the black sky over that narrow crack of stone and light. Kira stopped. A gramophone was pla ying. The sound burst into the silence from a blazing window. It was ''The So ng of Broken Glas s.\" It was the song of a nam eless hope that fri ghtened her, for it promised so much, and she could not tell what it pr omised; she could not even say that it was a promi se; it was an emo­ tion, almost of pa in, that went through her whole body. Quick, fine notes exploded, as if the trembling chords could not hold them, as if a pair of defiant legs were kicking crystal goblets . And, in the gaps of ragged clouds above, the dark sky was sprinkled with a luminous powder that looked like splinters of broken gla ss. The music ended in someone 's loud laughter. A naked arm pulled a curtain over the window . Then Kira noticed that she was not alone . She saw women with lips painted scarlet on faces powdered snow-whit e, with red kerchiefs and short skirts, and legs squeezed by high shoes laced too tightly.

How can one be expected to study in this in­ fernal atmosphere? Oh, I do n't care. If I do n't pass the exam­ inations, there 'll be no bread cards for a certain family !\" The door banged louder as he went out. Kira sat watching Irina sketch. Irina studied Art; she de­ voted her time to solemn research into the ancient master­ pieces of the museu ms; but her quick hand and mischievous eyes produ ced the impudent art of the newspa pers . She sketched cartoons whenever she was supposed to, and at any other time. A drawing board on her lap, throwing her head and hair back once in a while for a swift glance at Acia through the smoke, she was sketching her little sister. On the paper, Acia was transformed into a goblin with huge ears and stomach, riding on the back of a snail . Va sili Ivanovitch came home from the market. He was smiling happily. He had stood at the market all day and had sold the chandelier from their drawing room. He had man­ aged to get a good price for it. His smile widened when he saw Kira and he nodded to her cheerfully. Maria Petrovna brought him a bowl of hot soup . . She asked timidly: \"Would you like some soup, Kira?\" \"No, thank you, Aunt Mar uss ia. I'v e just had my dinner.\" She knew that Maria Petrovna had but one bowl of soup le ft, sa ved for Va sili Ivanovitch; she knew that Maria Petrovna sighed with relief. Va sili Ivanovitch ate cheerfully, talking to Kira as if she were his personal guest; he spoke to so few of their guests that Maria Petrovna and Irina did not ob je ct, watching anx­ iously the rare sight of his smile . He chuckled: \"Look at Irina drawing. Here she is, daub­ ing, smudging all day long . Not bad, are they, Kira? The draw ings, I mean. How 's Victor at the Institute? Not one of the last, I bet ....

Europe is doing thing s. And it wo n't be long ... it wo n't be long now before ... \" Maria Petrovna coughed nervously. She was used to it; for five years she had list ened to what Va sili Ivanovitch read be­ tween the lines of the newspapers about the salvation coming from Europe, which never came. She sighed; she did not dare to argue. Va sili Ivanovitch was grinning hap pi ly: \" ... and when it happen s, I'm all set to start again where they 'v e in­ terrupted. It won 't be dif ficult. Of course, they 'v e cl osed my store and taken all the furniture away, but ... \" he leaned close to Kira, whispering, \"but I'v e watched it. I know where they 'v e taken it.

I'm not hungry. Come on to my of­ fi ce, Kira .\" There was no furniture left in Va sili Ivanovit ch's office but a de sk and one chair. He unlocked a desk drawer and took out a bundle wrapped in an old, yellowed handkerchief. He unf ast ened a tight knot and, smiling proudly, happily, straightening his stooped shoulders, showed Kira neatly tied piles of large, crisp currency bills of the Cza r's da ys. They were large pil es; they contained a fortune of many thou san ds. Kira gasped: \"But, Uncle Va sili, they 'r e ... they 'r e wor t h­ les s. Yo u'r e not allowed to use ... or even to keep them any more. It's ... dangerou s.\" He laughed: \"Sure, they 'r e worthless-now. But just wait and see. Wait till things chan ge.

Then, in the dining room, they heard a girl 's laughter that seemed cle arer, louder than the be ll. Va sili Ivanovitch fr owned. \"Here she is aga in,\" he said sullenly. \"Vava Milovskaia. A fri end of Victor.\" \"What 's the matter, Uncle Va sili? You don 't like her?\" He shrugged: \"Oh, sh e's all right, I suppo se. I don 't dis­ like her. Only there 's nothing in her to like . Just a sc atter­ brained little female. Not a girl like you, Kira.

Her dr ess was only chintz, but it was new, obviously exp ensive, and she wore a narrow diamond bracelet. \"Good evening, Va sili Ivanovitch !\" she sang. \"Good eve­ ning ! Good evening !\" She jumped up, her hands on hi s shoul­ ders, her pink skirt flaring, and planted a kiss on his stem for ehead. \"And this is-I know-Kira ! Kira Argounova. I'm so glad to see you, at last, Kira !\" . Victor came out of his room . Vava repeated persistently that she had come to see Irina, but he knew, as everybody knew, the real ob je ct of her visit. He watched her, smiling . He laughed happily, and teased her, and pulled Acia 's ear, and brought a warm shawl for Ma ria Petrovna when she coughed, and told anecdote s, and even fo rced Va sili Ivanovitch, who sat gloomily in a dark comer, to smile once at a jo ke . \"I 'v e br ought so mething to show you all ,\" Va va an­ nounced mysteriously, producing a little package from her handbag. \"S omething ... something marv elo us.

The sky hung clear and green, lus­ trous with cold glints of ice . Men walked slowly, awkwardly, like beginners learning to skate; they slipped, waving one helpless leg high in the air, grasping the nearest lamp post. Horses slipped on the glassy cobblestones; sparks flew from under the hoofs scratching the ice convulsively. Kira walked to the Institute. Through her thin soles, the frozen sidewalk sent a cold breath up her legs. She hurried uncertainly, her feet slipping at odd angles. She heard steps behind her, very firm, resolute steps that made her tum involuntarily. She looked at the tamed tiger with the scar on his forehead. Their eyes met. He smiled. And she smiled up at him. He touched the visor of his cap. \"Good morning, \" he said. \"Good morning, \" said Kira. She watched his tall figure walking on hurriedly, his shoulders erect in his leather jacket, his feet steady on the ice. Across from the Institute, he stopped suddenly and turned, waiting for her. She approached. The high sidewalk sloped down abruptly at a steep, frozen, dangerous angle. He of­ fered his arm to help her. Her feet slipped perilously. His strong hand closed over her arm and quickly, masterfully landed her on her feet. \"Thank you, \" she said. \"I thought you might need help. But then, \" he looked at her with a faint smile, \"I suppose you weren 't afrai d. \" \"On the contrary. I was very much afraid-this time, \" she said, and her smile was an answer of sudden understanding. He touched the visor of his cap and hurried away through the Institute gates, down a long corridor. Kira saw a boy she knew. She pointed at the disappearing figure in the leather jacket, and asked: \"Who is that?\""},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"WE THE LI VIN G 81 The boy looked and made a strange, warning noise with his lips. \"Be careful of that,\" he whispered and breathed three dreaded letters: \"G.P .U.\" \"Dh, is he?\" said Kira. \"Is he?\" sa id the boy with a long, indignant whistle for an answer. VI For a month Kira had . not approached the neighborhood of the mansion with a broken garden fe nce ; she had not thought of the garden, for she did not want to see it empty, even be­ fore her own closed ey es. But on November tenth she walked toward it calmly, evenly, without hurry, without doub ts. Darkne ss was coming , not from the gray, transparent sky, but from the corners of houses where sha dows sud denly grew thicker, as if without rea son. Sl ow whirls of smoke over chimneys were rusty in the rays of a cold, invisible sun­ set somewhere beyond the clouds. In store windows kerosene lamps stood on the sills, melting yellow circles on the huge, fro zen pane s, around little orange dots of trembling fire. It had snowed. Whipped into mud by horse s' hoofs, the first snow looked like a pale coffee with thin, melting splinters of sugar. It hushed the city into a soft, padded silenc e. Hoofs thumped through the mud with a clear, wet sound, as if someone were clicking his tongue loudly, rhythmically, and the sound rolled, dying, down long, darkening streets. Kira turned a corner; she saw the black lances bowing to the snow, and the trees gathering snatches of cotton in the bla ck net of ba re branche s. Then, for one second, she st opped, because she was suddenly afraid to look; then she looked into the garden. He stood on the steps of the ma nsion, his hands in his pock ets , his collar rai sed. She stopped to look at him. But he heard her and turned quickly. He walked to meet her. He smiled at her, his mouth a scornf ul arc. \"Allo, Kir a.\" . \"Good evening , Leo .\" Sh e pulled off a heavy black mitten; he held her hand for"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 AYN RAND a long moment in his cold, strong fingers .

But he said: \"L et's sit down .\" They sat down on the steps and she tapped her feet aga inst each other, knocking off the snow. He asked: \"So you want to know with whom I'm living? See? My coat is mended .\" \"Y es.\" \"A woman did that. A very nice woman who likes me very much .\" \"She sews well .\" \"Y es. But her eyesight is n't so good any more. And her hair 's gray.

But 1 do n't know whether I'l l thank you .\" They sa t side by side and talked and, as the dark ness ro se, their voices fell lower, for a militia-man was on guard, pass­ ing up and down the street behind the bowed lanc es. Snow squeaked under his boots like new leather. The houses were growing blue, dark blue aga inst a lighter sky, as if the night were ri sing from the pavemen ts. Ye llow stars trembled in fro sted wind ows. A street lamp flared up on the comer, be­ hind the tree s. It threw a triangle of pink marble veined by shadows of bare twigs on the blue snow of the garden, at their feet. Leo looked at his wristwatch, an expen sive, foreign watch under a frayed shirt cuff. He rose in one swift, supple move­ ment and she sa t looking up with admiration, as if hoping to see him repeat it. \"I have to go, Kira.\" \"Now?\" \"There 's a train to catch .\" \"So yo u'r e going aga in.\" \"Bu t I'm taking something with me-this time .\" \"A new sword?\" \"No. A shie ld.\" She got up.

December tenth .\" \"If yo u'r e still alive-and if you don 't. ... \" \"No . I'l l be alive-because I wo n't forge t.\" He took her hand before she could extend it, tore off the black mitten, raised the hand slowly to his lips and kissed her pa lm. Then he turned quickly and walked away. The snow creaked under his feet. The sound and the figure melted into the darkne ss, while she was still standing motion less, her hand outs tretched, until a little white flake fluttered onto her palm, onto the unseen treasure she was afraid to spill . * When Alexander Dimitrievit ch's store did good busin ess, he gave Kira money for carfare; when busin ess fe ll, she had"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 85 to walk to the Institute. But she walked every day and saved her carfare to buy a brief case. She went to the Alexandrovsky market to buy it; she could get a used one-and any article that people us ed or had used-at the Alexandrovsky market. She wa lked sl owly, caref ully stepping over the goods spread on the sidewalk. A little old lady with ivory hands on a black lace shawl looked at her eagerly, hopefully, as she stepped over a table cloth displaying silver forks, a blue plush album of faded photograph s, and three bronze ikon s. An old man with a black patch over one eye extended to her silently the picture of a young officer in a nicked gold fram e. A coughing young woman thrust forward a faded satin petti­ coat. Kira stopped suddenly. She saw broad shoulders towering over the long, hope less line on the edge of the sidewalk. Va sili Ivanovitch stood silent ly; he did not advertise his pur­ pose in standing there ; the delicate clock of bright Sa chs por­ celain held in two red, fro zen, glove less hands did it for him. The dark eyes under his heavy, graying brows were fixed, expr essi onl ess, on some point above the heads of the pass­ ersby. He sa w Kira before she had a chance to run and spare him, but he did not seem to mind; he called her, his grim face smiling happily, the strange, helple ss smile he had but for Kira, Victor and Irina. \"How are you, Kira? Glad to see you. Glad to see you .... Thi s? Just an old clock. Doesn 't mean much .... I bought it for Mar ussia on her birthday .. . her first birthday after we were married.

We 'll get along without it.\" He stopped to look hopefully at a fat peasant woman who was staring at the clock, scratching her neck. But when she met Va sili Ivanovitch 's ey es, she turned and hurried away, raising her heavy skirts high over felt boots . Va sili Ivanovitch whispered to Kira: \"You know, this is not a cheerful pla ce. I feel so sorry for all these people here, selling the last of their posses sions ; with nothing to expect of life.

The price could not buy ten pounds of bread . Va sili Ivanovitch hesitated; he looked wist fully at the sky turning red high above the house s; at the long line of shadows on the sidewalk, that peered eagerly, hopele ss ly into every passing face. \"Well ... \" he muttered. \"Why, citizen ,\" Kira whirled on the man, her voice sud­ denly sharp, querulous, like an indignant housewife, \"fifty millio ns?

He looked at Kira. \"Why, child, where did you learn that?\" She laughed. \"One can learn anything-in an emergency.\" Then they parted. Va sili Ivanovitch hurried home . Kira went on in search of the brief case. Va sili Ivanovitch walked to save carfare. It was getting dark . Snow flu ttered down slow ly, st eadily, as if sa ving speed for a long run. Thick white foam grew along the cur bs. On a comer, a pair of human eyes looked up at V asili Ivanovitch from the level of his stomach. The eyes were in a young , clean-shaven fac e; the legs of the body to which the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 87 face belonged seemed to have fallen through the sidewalk, up to above the kne es; it took Va sili Ivanovitch an effort to realize that the body had no legs, that it ended in two stumps wra pped in dirty rag s, in the snow. The rest of the body wore the neat, patched tunic of an officer of the Imperial army; one of its sleeves was empty ; in the other there was an arm and a hand ; the hand held out a newspa per, silently, level with the knees of passersby. In the lapel of the tunic Va sili Ivanovitch noticed a tiny black and orange band, the ribbon of the Cr oss of St. George. Va sili Ivanovitch stopped and bought a newspaper. The newspa per cost fifty th ousa nd rub les; he handed down a million-ruble bill . \"I 'm sorry, citizen ,\" the officer said in a soft, courteous voice, \"I have no change .\" Va sili Ivanovitch muttered gru ffly : \"Keep it. And I'l l still be your debtor.\" And he hurried away without looking back. * Kira was listening to a lecture at the Institute. The audito- rium was not heated; students kept on their overcoats and woolen mitten s; the auditorium was overcrowded; students sat on the floor in the aisle s. A hand opened the door cauti ously ; a ma n's head leaned in and threw a quick glance at the prof esso r's desk. Kira recog­ nized the scar on the right temple. It was a lecture for begin­ ners and he had never attended it. He had entered the auditorium by mistake. He was about to withdraw when he noticed Kira. He entered, closed the door noisele ssly and took off his cap. She watched him from the comer of her eye. There was room in the aisle by the door, but he walked softly toward her and sat down on the steps in the ai sle, at her feet. She could not resist the temptation of looking down at him. He bowed silently, with the faintest hint of a smile, and turned attentively toward the prof esso r's desk. He sat still, his legs cr os sed, one hand mot ionle ss on his kn ee. The hand seemed all bon es, skin and nerve s. She noticed how hollow his cheeks were, how sharp the ang les of his cheek bone s. His leather ja cket was more military than a gun, more communi s­ tic than a red flag . He did not look up at her once.

VII Alexander Dimitrievitch kept his savings sewn in his under­ shirt. He had developed the habit of raising hi s hand to his heart once in a while, as if he had gas pa ins; he felt the roll of bil ls; he liked the security under his fingert ip s. When he needed money, he cut the heavy seam of white thread and sighed as the load grew lighter. On November sixteenth, he cut the seam for the last time . The special tax on private traders for the purpose of reliev­ ing the famine on the Vo lga had to be paid, even though it closed the little textile store in the bakery shop. Another pri­ vate enterprise had fa iled. Alexander Dimitrievitch had expected it. They opened on every comer, fre sh and hopeful like mushrooms after a rain; and, like mush roo ms, they faded before their first morning was over. So me men were succes sful. He had seen them: men in resplendent new fur coats, with white, flabby cheeks that made him think of butter for breakfast, and eyes that made him raise his hand, nervously, to the roll over his heart. These men were seen in the front rows at the theater s; they were seen leaving the new confectioners' with round white cake boxes the price of which could keep a family for two mont hs; they were seen hiring taxis-and paying for them. Insolent street children called them \"Nepmen\" ; their cartoons adorned the pages of Red newspa pers-with scornful denun­ ciat ions of the new vultures of NEP; but their warm fur hats were seen in the windows of automobiles rocketing the high­ est Red off icials through the streets of Petrograd. Alexander Dimitrievitch wondered dully about their secrets . But the dre aded word \"s pecul ator\" gave him a cold shudder ; he lacked the talents of a racketeer.

He wore glasses and a soldier 's coat and he was not care­ ful about shav ing. But he rubbed his hands diffidently and he knew how to respect authority under all circumsta nc es. \"Tsk, tsk, tsk, Alexander Dimitrievitch, sir,\" he wailed. \"This is no life for you.

He bent over the steaming fum es, blinking, his shirt sleeves rolled above his elbow s, stirring the mixture with a wooden paddle. The kitchen door had to be kept open ; there was no other stove to heat the apartment. The bitter, musty odor of a factory basement ro se, with the whirling steam of a laundry, to the streaked ceiling . Galina Petrovna chopped the spoiled pork fat on the kitchen table, delicately crooking her little finger, clearing her throat noisily. Lydia played the piano. Lydia had always boasted of two accomplishments : her ll.1agnificent hair, which she brushed for half an hour every morning, and her music, which she practiced for three hours each day. Galina Petrovna asked for Chopin. Lydia played Cho pin. The wist ful music, delicate as rose petals falling slowly in the darkne ss of an old park, rang softly through the haze of soap fume s. Galina Petrovna did not know why tears dropped on her knife; she thought that the pork fat hurt her ey es. Kira sat at the table with a book.

She blushed; but no one could see it through the fume s. The soap came out in soft, soggy squares of a dirty brown. Alexander Dimitrievitch found an old brass button off his yachting ja cket and imprinted an anchor in the comer of each square. \"Great idea ! Trademark,\" said the unshaved bookkeeper. \"W e'l l call it 'Argounov 's Navy Soa p.' A good revolutionary name .\" A pound of soap cost Alexander Dimitrievitch more than it did on the market. \"That 's nothing,\" said his partner. \"That's better.

The program peddlers, livid, frozen shadow s, sc urri ed obsequiously thro ugh the free \"prof union\" audience, a wealthier, haughtier, better fed audi­ ence than the week-day paying guests. The theater smelt of old velvet, marble and moth ball s. Four balconies ro se high to a huge chandelier of crys tal chains that threw little rainbows on the distant ceiling . Five years of re volution had not touched the theater 's so lemn grandeur; they had left but one sign: the Imperial eagle was removed from over the huge central box which had belonged to the royal family. Kira remembered the long satin trains, and the bare white shoulders, and the diamonds that sparkled like the crystals of the chandelier, moving down the orange carpets of the wide ai sles. There were few diamonds now ; the dr esses were dark, sober, with high necklines and long sleev es. Slender, erect in her soft gray satin, she walked in as she had seen those ladies walk many years ago , her arm on that of a tall young man in a leather ja cket. . And when the curtain went up and music ro se in the dark, silent shaft of the theater, gr owing, swelling, thunderi ng against walls that could not hold it, something stopped in Kir a's throat and she opened her mouth to take a breath.

The fifty worker fami lies that clotted its three floors had fifty barrels in which to keep their water. When Andrei Taganov was born, a kindly neig hbor brought a barrel from the sta ir­ land ing ; the water was fro zen ; the neighbor broke the ice with an ax, and emptied the barr el. The pale, shivering hands of the young mother stuf fed an old pillow into the barr el . Such was Andr ei 's first bed. His mother bent over the barrel and laughed, laughed hap­ pily, hysterically, until tears fell into the dimples of the tiny, red hand s. His father did not hear of his birth for three da ys. His father had been away for a week and the neighbors spoke about it in whispers . In the year 1905, the neighbors did not need to whisper about the father any longer. He made no secret of the red flag he carried through the streets of St. Petersburg, nor of the lit­ tle white pamphlets he sowed into the dark soil of cro wds,"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"WE THE LI VI NG /05 nor of the words his powerful voice sent like a power ful wind to carry the seeds-the flaming words to the glory of Ru ssia's ftrst revolution. It was Andrei 's tenth year. He stood in a comer of the kitchen and looked at the brass buttons on the gendarm es' coats . The gendarmes had black moustaches and real guns. His father was putting his coat on slowly. His father kis sed him and kissed his mother. The genda rme s' boots grated the last paint off the kitchen floor. His mother 's arms clung to his fath er's shoulders like tenta cles. A strong hand tore her off. She fell acro ss the thre shold . They left the door open . Their steps rang down the stairs . His mother 's hair was spilled over the bricks of the stair-landing. Andrei wrote his mother 's letters. Neither of them had been taught to write, but Andrei had learned it by himself. The let ters went to his father and the addr ess bore , in Andrei 's big, awkward handwriting, the name of a town in Siberia. After a while his mother stopped dictating letters. His father never came back. Andrei carried the baskets with the laundry his mother washed. He could have hidden himself, head and toes, in one of the bask ets, but he was strong. In their new room in the basement there was a white, billowing , sour fo am, lik e clouds, in the wooden trough under his mother 's purple hand s and a white, billowing, sour steam, like clouds , under the ceili ng. They could not see that it was spring outside . But they could not have seen it, even without the steam: for the window opened upon the sidewalk and they could watch only the shiny new galoshes grunting through the mud of melting snow, and, once, someone dropped a young green leaf right by the window. Andrei was twelve years old when his mother died. So me said it was the wooden trough that had killed her, for it had always been too· full; and some said it was the kitchen cup­ board, for it had always been too empty. Andrei went to work in a factory. In the daytime, he stood at a machine and his eyes were cold as its steel , his hands steady as its levers, his nerves tense as its belts . At night, he crouched on the floor behind a barricade of empty boxes in the comer he rented; he needed the barricade because the three other comer tenants in the room ob jected to candle light when they wanted to sleep, and Agrafena Vlass ovna, the landlady, did not approve of book reading. So he kept the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106 AYN RAND candle on the floor, and he held the book to the cand le, and he read very slowly, and he wrapped his feet in newspapers because they were very cold; and the snow wailed battering the window, the three corn er tenants snored, Agrafena Vlassovna spat in her sleep, the candle dripped, and every­ body was asleep but Andrei and the cockroaches. He talked very little, smiled very slowly and never gave coins to beggars. Sometimes, on Sundays, he passed Pavel Syerov in the street. They knew each other, as all children did in the neigh­ borhood, but they did not talk often. Pavel did not like Andr ei's clothes. Pavel 's hair was greased neatly and his mother was taking him to church. Andrei never went to church. Pavel's father was a clerk in the corner dry-goods store and waxed his moustache six days a week. On Sundays , he drank and beat his wife. Little Pavel liked perfumed soap, when he could steal it from the apothecary shop; and he stud­ ied God's Law-his best white collar on-with the parish priest. In the year 1915, Andrei stood at the mac hine, and his eyes were colder than its steel, his hands steadier than its levers, his nerves colder and steadier than both. His skin was tanned by the fire of the furnace s; his muscles and the will behind his muscles were tempered like the metal he had han­ dled. And the little white pamphlets his father had sown, re­ appeared in the son's hands . But he did not throw them into crowds on the wings of fiery speeches; he passed them steal thily into stealthy hands and the words that went with them were whispers. His name was on the list of a party about which not many dared to whisper and he sent through the myster ious, unseen veins of the Putilovsky factory mes­ sages from a man named Lenin . Andrei Taganov was nineteen. He walked fast, talked slowly, never went to dances. He took orders and gave or­ ders, and had no friends. He looked at superintendents in fur coa�s and at beggars in felt boots , with the same level, un­ flinching eyes , and had no pity. Pavel Syerov was clerking in a haberdashery. On Sundays he ente rtained a noisy crowd of friends in the corner saloon , leaned back in his chair and swore at the waiter if service was too slow. He loaned money freely and n o one refused a loan to \"Pavlush a.\" He put on his patent leather shoes when"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"WE THE LIVING 107 he took a girl to a dance , and put eau-de-cologne on his handkerchief. He liked to hold the girl's waist and to say: \"We'r e not a commo ner, dearie . We're a gentleman .\" In the year 1916, Pavel Syerov lost his job in the haber­ dashery, owing to a fight over a girl. It was the third year of the war; prices were high; jobs were scarce. Pavel Syerov found himself trudging through the gates of the Putilovsky factory on winter mornings, when it was so dark and so early that the lights over the gate cut his puffed, sleepy eyes and he yawned into his raised collar. At first, he avoided his old crowd, for he was ashamed to admit where he was working. After a while, he avoided them because he was ashamed to admit they had been his friends. He circulated little white pamphle ts, made speeches at secret meetings and took orders from Andrei Taganov only because \"Andrei' s been in it longer, but wait till I catch up with him.\" The workers liked \"Pavlus ha.\" When he happened to meet one of his old friends , he passed by haughtily, as if he had inherited a title; and he spoke of the superiority of the proletariat over the paltry petty bourgeoisie, according to Karl Marx. In February of the year 1917, Andrei Taganov led crowds through the streets of Petrograd. He carried his first red flag, received his first wound and killed his first man-a gen­ darme. The only thing that impressed him was the flag. Pavel Syerov did not see the February Revolution rise, tri­ umphan t, from the city pavemen ts. He stayed at home: he had a cold. But in October, 1917, when the Party, whose membership cards Andrei and Pavel carried, reverently rose to seize the power, they were both in the streets. Andrei Taganov, his hair in the wind, fought at the siege of the Winter Palace . Pavel Syerov received credit for stopping -after most of the trea­ sures were gone-the looting of a Grand Duke's mansion. In the year 1918, Andrei Taganov, in the uniform of the Red Army, marched with rows of other uniforms, from shops and factories, through the streets of Petrograd, to the tune of the Internat ionale, to the depot , to the front of civil war. He marched solemnly, with silent triumph, as a man walks to his wedding. An d rei's hand carried a bayonet as it had fashioned steel; it pulled a trigger as it had pushed a lever. His body was young, supple, as a vine ripe in the sun, on the voluptuous couch of a trench 's mud. He smiled slowly and shot fast."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"10 8 AY N RA ND In the year 1920, Melitopol hung by a thread between the White Army and the Red . The thread broke on a dark spring night. It had been expected to break. The two armies held their last stand in a narrow, silent valley. On . the side of the White Army was a desperate desire to hold Melitopol, a di­ vision numbering five to one of their adversar ies, and a vague, grumbling resentment of the soldiers aga inst their of­ ficers , a sullen, secret sym pathy for the red flag in the trenches a few hundred feet away. On the side of the Red Army was an iron discipline and a desperate task. They stood still, a few hundred feet apart, two trenches of bayonets shimmering faintly, like water, under a dark sky, of men ready and silent, ten se, waitin g. Bla ck rocks rose to the sky in the north and black rocks rose to the sky in the south; but between them was a narrow valley, with a few blades of grass still left among the torn clots of earth, and enough space to shoot, to scream, to die-and to decide the fate of those beyond the rocks on both sid es. The bayonets in the trenches did not move . And the blades of gras s did not move, for there was no wind and no breath from the trenches to stir them. Andrei Taganov stood at attention, very straight, and asked the Commander 's permi ssion for the plan he had explained. The Commander said: \"It 's your death, ten to one, Comrade Tag anov. \" Andrei said: \"It does not matter, Comrade Commander.\" \"Are you sure you can do it?\" \"It has been done, Comrade Commander. They 're ripe. They need but one kick .\" \"The Proletariat thanks you, Comrade Tag anov.\" Then those in the other trenches saw him climb over the top . He raised his arms, aga inst the dark sky ; his body looked tall and slender. Then he walked, arms raised, toward the White trenc hes; his steps were steady and he did not hUrry. The blades of grass creaked, breaking under his feet, and the sound filled the valley. The Whites watched him and waited in silence. He stopped but a few steps from their trenche s. He could not see the many guns aimed at his breast; but he knew they were there. Swiftly, he took the holster at his belt and threw it to the ground. \"Brothers !\" he cried. \"I have no weapon s.

Andrei Taganov whirled and his arms circled against the sky, and he fe ll on the clotted earth. Then there were more shots and fire hissing down the White tre nch es, but it did not come from those on the other side . An off icer 's body was hurled out of the trench, and a soldier waved his arms to the Red soldiers , yelling : \"Com­ rad es !\" There were loud hurrahs, and feet stamping acro ss the vall ey, and red banners waving , and hands lifting Andr ei's body, his face white on the black earth, hi s che st hot and sticky.

Then he thoug ht that it was cold and that it was the cold which held him chained to the ground, with pain like pine needles through his every muscle. He sat up ; then he knew that it was not only the cold in his muscl es, but a dark hole and blood on his thigh; and blood on his right temple. He knew, also, that the white fog was not close to his che st; there was enough room under it for him to stand up ; it was far away in the sky and the red dawn was cutting a thin thread through it, far away. He stood up. The sound of his feet on the ground seemed too loud in a bottomless silence. He brushed the hair out of his eyes and thought that the white fog above was the fro zen breath of the men around him. But he knew that the men were not breathing any longer. Bl ood look ed purple and brown and he could not tell where bodi es ended and earth began, nor whether the white blotches were clots of fog or fac es. He saw a body under his feet and a canteen on its hip . The canteen was intact; the body was not. He bent and a red drop fell on the canteen from his temple. He drank. A voice said: \"Give me a drink, brother.\" What was left of a man was crawling toward him across a rut in the ground. It had no coat, but a shirt that had been white; and boots that followed the shirt, although there did not seem to be anything to make them follow. Andrei knew it was one of the Whit es. He held the ma n's head and forced the canteen between lips that were the color of the blood on the· ground. The ma n's chest gurgled and heaved convulsiv ely. No one else moved around them. Andrei did not know who had won last nigh t's battle; he did not know whether they had won the Crim ea; nor whether-more important to many of them-they had cap­ tured Captain Karsavin, one of the last names to fear in the White Army, a man who had taken many Red live s, a man whose head was worth a big price in Red money. Andrei would walk. Somewhere this silence must end. He would find men, somewhere; Red or White-he did not know, but he started walking toward the sunri se.

When we find men-it will be the end for either you or me .\" \"W e'l l take a cha nce,\" said the man . - \"W e'l l take a chan ce,\" said Andrei. So they walked together toward the sunr ise. High banks guarded the road, and shadows of dry bushes hung motion­ less over their hea ds, with thin branches like a skelet on 's fin­ gers spread wide apart, webbed by the fog. Roots wound across the road and their four feet crossed them slowly , with a silent effort. Ahead of them, the sky was burning the fog. There was a rosy shadow over Andrei 's forehead; on his left temple little beads of sweat were transparent as gla ss; on his right temple the beads were red. The other man breathed as if he were rattling dice deep insid e his chest. \"As long as one can walk-\" said Andrei. \"-one walks ,\" finished the man. Their eyes met as if to hold each other up. Little red drops followed their steps in the soft, damp earth-on the right side of the road and on the left. Then, the man fell. Andrei stopped. The man said: \"Go on.\" Andrei threw the ma n's arm ove r his shoulder and went on, staggering a little under the load. The man said: \"Y ou 're a fo ol.\" \"One doesn't leave a good soldier, no matter what color he's wearing,\" said Andrei. The man said: \"If it's my comrades that we come upon­ I'll see that they go easy on you.\" \" I'll see that you get off with a prison hospital and a good bed-if it's mine ,\" said Andrei. Then, Andrei walked carefully, because he could not allow himself to fall with hi:;; burden. And he listened attentively to the heart beating fe ebly against his back. The fog was gone and the sky blazed like a huge furnace where gold was not melted into liquid, but into burning air. Against the gold, they saw the piled black boxes of a village far away.

The man said strange ly: \"Leave me here .\" \"Don't be afrai d,\" said Andrei, \"we're not so hard on fel­ low soldiers .\" \"No,\" said the man, \"not on fellow soldiers.\" Then Andrei saw a tom coat sleeve hanging at the man's belt and on the sleeve the epaulet of a capta in. \"If you have pity,\" said the man, \"leave me here .\" But Andrei had brushed the man's sticky hair off his fore­ head and was looking attentively, for the first time, at a young, indomita ble face he had seen in photogra phs. \"No,\" said And rei, very slowly, \"I can't do that, Captain Karsa vin.\" \"I'm sure to die here,\" said the capta in. \"One doesn't take chance s,\" said Andrei, \"wit h enemies like you.\" \"No,\" said the captain, \"one doesn 't.\" He propped himself up on one hand, and his forehead, thrown back, was very white.

The boxes came in long sheets ; they had to be cut out and folded; they bore German inscriptions in green letters-\"Genuine German Saccharine\"; the other side of the sheet bore the bright colors of old Rus sian adverti se­ ments . \"S orry, it's too bad about your studie s, Kira ,\" Galina Petrovna said, \"but you'l l jus t have to help .

Bu t that code came back once, for an in­ stant, when she saw her skirt on the floor; then, in defiance, she regretted that her underwear was not silk, but only heavy cotton.

The giant took a list out of his pocket and held it under the captain 's beard; he pointed with his thumb, behind his shoulder, at Leo , and asked : \"Which one is him?\" Th e captain 's nose pointed to a name.

It will be warm for us by now.\" The door they entered bore the red seal of the G.P.V. The seal had been broken; two red scabs of wax remained, part­ ing to let them enter. They walked through a dark drawing room . The fireplace blazed, throwing a red glow on their feet and over their re­ flection in the mirror of a parquet floor. The apartment had been searched. There were papers strewn over the parquet, and overturned chairs . There were crystal vases on malachite stands ; one vase was broken; the splint ers sparkled on the floor in the dark ness, little red flames dancing and winking through them, as if live coals had rolled out of the fireplac e. In Leo's bedroom, a light was burning, a single lamp with a silver shade, over a black onyx fireplace. A last blue flame quivered on dying coals and made a purple glow on the sil­ ver bedspread. Leo threw his coa t in a comer. He unbuttoned her coat and took it off; without a word, he unbuttoned her dres s ; she stood still and let him undress her. He whispered into the little warm hollow under her chin: \"It was torture. Waiting. Three days-and three nights .\" He threw her across the bed. The purple glow quivered over her body. He did not undr ess. He did not tum out the light. * Kira looked at the ceiling ; it was a silve ry white far away. Light was coming in through the gray satin curtai ns. She sat up in bed, her br easts stiff in the cold. She said: \"I think it's already tomorrow.\" Leo was asleep, his head thrown back, one arm hanging over the edge of the bed. Her stockin gs were on the floor, her dress-on a bed post. Leo's eyelashes moved slowly ; he looked up and said: \"Good morning, Kira.\" She stretched her arms and crossed them behind her head, and threw her head back, shaking the hair off her face, and said: \"I don't think my family will like it. I think they 'll throw me out.\" \"You 're staying here .\" \"I'll go to say good-b ye.\" \"Why go back at all?\""},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"132 AYN RAND \"I suppose I must tell them someth ing.\" \"Well, go. But don't take long . I want you here .\" * They stood like three pilla rs, towering and silent, at the dining -room table. They had the red, puffed eyes of a sleep­ less night. Kira stood facing them, leaning again st the door, indifferent and patient. \"Well?\" said Galina Petrovna. \"Well what?\" said Kira. \"You won't tell us again that you were at Irina's.\" \"No .\" Galina Petrovna straightened her shoulders and her faded flannel bathrobe. \"I don't know how far your foolish inno­ cence can go. But do you realize that people might think that ... \" \"Certainly, I've slept with him.\" The cry came from Lydia. Galina Petrovna opened her mouth and closed it. Alexander Dim itrievit ch opened his mouth and it remained open. Galina Petrovna's arm point ed at the door. \"You'll leave my house,\" she said. \"And you'll neve r come back.\" \"All right,\" said Kira. \"How could you? A daughter of mine ! How can you stand there and stare at us? Have you no conception of the shame, the disgrace, the depraved ... \" \"We won't discuss that,\" said Kira. \"Did you stop to think it was a mortal sin? ...

Is it cold outside? Yo ur cheeks are frozen .\" \"It' s a little cold.\" \"I have some hot tea for you-in the drawing room .\" He had set a table by the fireplace. Little red tongues flick- ered in the old silver. A crystal chandelier hung aga inst the gray sky of a huge window. Across the street, a line stood at the door of a co-operative, heads bent; it was snowing . Kir a held her hands aga inst the hot silver teapot and rubbed them across her cheeks. She said: \"I'll have to gather that gla ss. And sweep the floor. And ... \" She stopped. She stood in the middle of the huge room. She spread her arms out, and threw her head back, and laughed. She laughed defiantly, rapturously, triumphantly. She cried: \"Leo ! ... \" He held her. She looked up into his face and felt as if she were a priest ess, her soul lost in the comers of a god's arro­ gant mouth; as if she were a priestess and a sacrificial offer­ ing, both and beyond both, shame less in her laug hter, choking, something rising within her, too hard to bear. Then his eyes looked at her, wide and dark, and he an­ swered a thought they had not spoken: \"Kira, think what we have against us.\" She bent her head a little to one shoulder, her eyes round, her lips soft, her face serene and confident as a chil d's; she looked at the window where, in the slanting mist of snow, men stood in line, motio nles s, hope less, broken. She shook her head. \"W e'll fight it, Leo. Together. We 'll fight all of it. The country. The century. The millio ns. We can stand it. We can do it.\" He said without hope: \"W e'll try.\""},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"XI The Revolution had come to a country that had lived three years of war. Three years and the Revolution had broken rail­ road tracks, and scorched fields, and blown smoke stacks into showers of bricks, and sent men to stand in line with their old baskets, waiting at the little trickle of life still dripping from provision centers . Fore sts stood in a silence of snow, but in the cities wood was a luxury ; kerosene was the only fuel to bum ; there was only one device to bum kerosene. The gifts of the Revolution were to come . But one-and the first-had been granted; that which in count less cities count­ less stomachs had learned to beg for the fire of their suste­ nance to keep the fire of their souls, the first badge of a new life, the first ruler of a free count ry: the PRIMU S. Kira knelt by the table and pumped the handle of the little bras s burner that bore the words: \"Genuine Primu s. Made in Sweden .\" She watched the thin jet of kerosene filling a cup; then she struck a match and set fire to the kerosene in the cup, and pumped, and pumped, her eyes very attentive, the fire licking the black tubes with a tongue of soot, sending the odor of kerosene into her nostrils, until something hissed in the tube s and a wreath of blue flames sprang up, tense and hissing like a blow-tor ch. She set a pot of millet over the blue flam es. Then , kn eeling by the fireplace, she gathered tiny logs, damp and slippery in her fingers, with an acrid odor of swamp and mildew ; she opened the lit tle door of the \"Bour­ geoise\" and stacked the logs inside, and stuffed crumpled news papers over them, and struck a match, blowing hard, bending low to the floor, her hair hanging over her eyes, whirl s of smoke blowing back at her, rising high to the white ceiling, the crystals of the chandelier sparkling through gray fumes, gray ashes fluttering into her nostrils, catching on her eyelash es. The \"Bourgeoise\" was a square iron box with long pipes that rose to the ceiling and turned at a straight angle into a hole cut over the fireplace. They had had to install a"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"WE THE LI VING 135 \"Bourgeoise\" in the drawing room, because they could not afford wood for the fireplace. The logs hissed in the box and, through the cracks in the corners , red flames danced and lit­ tle whiffs of smoke fluttered once in a while, and the iron walls blazed a dull, overheated red, smelling of burned paint. The new little stoves were called \"Bourge oise,\" for they had been born in the homes of those who could not afford fu ll­ sized logs to heat the ful l-sized stoves in their once luxurious hom es. Admiral Kova lensk y 's apartment had seven room s, but four of them had to be rented long ago. Admiral Kovalensky had had a partition built across a hall, which cut them off from the tenants. Now Leo owned three rooms, the bathroom and the front door; the tenants owned four rooms, the back door and the kitchen. Kira cooked on the Primus and washed dishes in the bathroom. At tim es, she heard steps and voices behind the partit ion, and a cat meow ing; three fami lies lived there, but she never had to meet them. When Leo got up in the morni ng, he found a table set in the dining room, with a snow-white cloth and hot tea steam­ ing, and Kira flit ting about the table, her cheeks glowing, her eyes laughi ng, light and unconcerned, as if these things had happened all by themselves . From their first day together in her new home, she had stated her ultimat um: \"When I cook- you'r e not to see me . When you see me- you'r e not to know that I'v e been cooki ng.\" She had alway s known that she was alive; she had never given much thought to the nece ssit y of keeping alive. She found suddenly that that mere fact of kee ping aliv e had grown into a compli cated problem which requir ed many hours of effort, the simple keeping alive which she had al­ ways haughtily, contemptuously taken for granted. She found that she could fight it only by keeping, fiercer than ever, that very contempt; the contempt which, once dropped, would bring all of life down to the little blue flame of the Primus slowly cooking millet for dinner. She found she could sacri­ fice all the hours the struggle required, if only it would never rise between Leo and her, if only life itself, the life that was Leo, were kept intact and untouched. Those wasted hours did not count; she would keep silent about them. She kept silent, a hidden spark in her eyes twinkling with the exhilaration of battle. It was a battle, the first blows of a vague, immense battle she could not name, but felt, the battle of the two of"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"136 AYN RAND them, alone, against something huge and namele ss, some­ thing rising, like a tide, around the walls of their house, something in those count less weary steps on the pavements outside, in those lines at the doors of co-operat ives, the something that invaded their home with the Primus and the \"Bourgeoi se,\" that held millet and damp logs and the hunger of millions of strange, distorted stomachs against two lives fighting for their right to their future. After breakfast Leo buttoned his overcoat and asked : \"Go- ing to the Institute today ?\" \"Yes.\" \"Need change?\" \"A little.\" \"Back for dinner?\" \"Yes.\" \"I'll be back at six.\" He went to the Univers ity, she went to the Institute. She ran, sliding along the frozen sidewalks, laughing at strangers, blowing at a red finger in the hole of her glove, jumping on tramways at full speed, disarming with a smile the husk y conductor esses who grow led: \"You oughta be fined, citizen . You'll get your legs cut off some day.\" She fidgeted at the lectures, and glanced at her neighbor 's wristwatch, when she could find a neighbor with a wristwatch. She was impatient to return home, as she had been when, a child in school, on her birthday s, she had known that presents awaited her at home. Nothing awaited her there now, but the Primus, and millet, and cabbage to chop for soup, and, when Leo returned, a voice that said behind the closed door: ''I'm home ,\" and she answ ered indif ferently: \"I'm busy,\" and laughed soundlessly, raptur ously, in the soup steam. After dinner he brought his books to the \"Bourgeoise\" and she brought hers. He was studying history and philosophy at the Petrograd State University. He also had a job. When, after two months, he returned to pick up the life his father 's execu­ tion had broken, he found the job still awaiting him. He was valuable to the \"Gossizda t\"-that State Publishing House. In the eveni ngs, over a fire crackling in the \"Bourgeoi se,\" he translated books from the English, German and French. He did not like the books. They were novels by foreign authors in which a poor, honest worker was always sent to jail for steal­ ing a loaf of bread to feed the starving mother of his pretty, young wife who had been raped by a capitalist and committed"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 137 suicide thereafter, for which the all-powerful capitalist fired her husband from the factory, so that their child had to beg on the streets and was run over by the capita list's limousine with sparkling fenders and a chauffeur in uniform.

Sometimes they were interrupted by the Upravdom. He came in, his hat on the back of his head, and demanded their share of the house collection for frozen pipe s, stuf fed chim­ ney s, electric bulbs for the stairs--\"and someone 's swiped 'em again \"-leaking roof, broken cella r ste ps, and the house 's voluntary subscription to the Red Air Fleet. When Kira and Leo spoke to each other, their words were brief, impersonal, their indiff erence exaggerated, their ex­ pressio nless faces guarding a secret they both remembered. But when they were alone in the gray and silver bedroom, they laughed together; their eyes , and their lips, and their bodies met hungrily. She did not know how many times they awa kened in the night; nor wh ere she felt his lips, nor whether his lips hurt her. She heard nothing in the silence but the sound of his breath. She crushed her body against his; then she laughed lazily and hid her face in the curve of her arm, and list ened to his breath on her neck, on the lashes of her closed eye s. Then she lay still, her teeth in a muscle of his arm, drunk on the smell of his skin. * Leo had no relatives in Petrograd. His mother had died before the revolution. He was an only son. His father had stood over vast wheat fields under a blue sky dropping into dark fore sts far away, and thought that some day these fields and the forests would be laid at the feet of a dark-haired, dark-eyed boy, and in his heart there was a glow brighter than the sun in the ripe wheat. Admiral Kovalensky seldom appeared at Court func tions;"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"138 AYN RAND the deck of a ship felt steadier under his feet than the parquet of the royal palace . But when he appeared, the eyes of stunned, eager, envious faces followed the wom an who moved slowly on his arm. His wife, born a count ess of an ancient name , had the beauty of centur ies gathered, line by line, in her perfect body. When she died, Admiral Kova lensk y noticed the first gray on his temples; but deep in his heart, in words he dared not utter, he thanked God that death had chosen to take his wife rather than his son. Admiral Kovalensk y had but one voice with which he is­ sued commands to his sailors and spoke to his son. Some said he was too kind with his sailors, and some said he was too stem with his son. But he worshipped the boy whose name foreign tutors had changed to \"Leo\" from the Russ ian \"Lev\"; and he was help less before the slight est flick er of a wish in the boy's dark, haughty eyes. The tutors, and the servants : and the guests looked at Leo as they looked at the statue of Apollo in the Admiral 's study, with the same reverent hopele ssness they felt from the white marble of a distant age. Leo smiled; it was the only order he had to give, the only excuse for any of his orders. When his young friends related, in whispers , the latest French stories, Leo quoted Spinoza and Nietz sche; he quoted Osca r Wilde at the prim gatherings of his stem aunt 's Ladies' Charity Club; he described the superiority of Western culture over that of Russia to the austere, gray -haired diploma ts, friends of his father, rabid Slavophiles, and he greeted them with an impudent foreign \"Allo\" ; once, when he sent to con­ fession, he made the old priest blush by revelati ons, at eigh­ teen, which that venerable digni tary had not learned in his seventy years . Resenting the portrait of the Czar in his father 's study and the Admiral 's unflinching, unreasoning loya lty, Leo attended a secret meeting of young revolutio nists. But when an un­ shaved young man made a speech about men 's brotherhood and called him \"comrade ,\" Leo whistled \"God Save the Czar,\" and went home . He spent his first night in a woma n's bed at the age of six­ teen. When he met her in sparkling drawing rooms, his face remained court eously expr essionless while he bent to kiss her hand ; and her stately, gray-haired husba nd did not sus­ pect what lessons the cold, disdainful beauty he owned was giving to that slender, dark-haired boy."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"WE THE LI VIN G /39 Many others followed.

Then she called on Irina. Maria Petrovna opened the door and muttered a greeti ng, conf used, frightened, stepping back uncertainly. The family was gathered in the dining room around a newly installed \"Bourgeoi se.\" Irina jumped up with a glowing smile and kissed her cousin, which she had never done before. \"Kira, I'm so glad to see you !

Vasili Ivanovitch did not answer; he did not look at her; he turned and left the room. A dark red flushed Irina's cheeks and she bit her lips. Ma­ ria Petrovna twisted a handkerchief.

He held her hand and looked into her eyes with a bold, mocking stare as if the two of them shared a secret. \"We didn't expect you, Kira.

Victor looked at his father with a bright glance of mutual unders tand ing. But Vasili Iva novit ch did not respond; he turned away deliberat ely; he had been avoiding Victor for many wee ks.

She waddled toward him slowly, cring ing, looking down at the tip of her nose, wiping her nose with her colla r. \"Acia, why are your school reports as bad as ever?\" Vasili Ivanovitch asked.

It was dark in the kitchen; the window pain was broken and the window had been covered wit h boar ds. Three narrow slits of light added three bright stripes to the long cracks of the floor.

But she smiled confidently up at Andrei Taga nov ; and pressed tightly against the wall of an empty auditorium at the Institute, her eyes radiant, her smile timid and trusting, like a child appealing to a guiding hand, she said: \"I'm happy, Andr ei.\" He had not seen her for many weeks .

Andrei took Kira to the Marinsky Theater and they saw Tc haik ovsk y's \"Sleeping Beauty\" ballet. He left her at the house on Moika and she took a tramway to her other home . A light snow melted on her face, like rain. Leo asked: \"How 's your Communi st boy friend?\" She asked: \"Have you been lonely ?\" He bru shed the hair off her forehead and looked at her lips, in the del iberate tension of refusing himself a kiss.

But the price made Kira hesit ate. \"Let's go to a railroad station ,\" she said to Leo . Railroad terminals were the cheapest and most dangerous markets of the city. There were strict rules aga inst private \"speculators\" who smuggled food from the villa ges. But the speculators in ragged overcoats dared long rides on roofs and buffers, miles on foot down slimy mud roa ds, lice and typhus on trains, and-on return-the vigila nce of government age nts. Food slinked into the city in dust y boots, in the lin­ ing s of vermin-infested coats, in bundles of soiled underwear. The starved city awaited every train. After its arrival, in the dark side streets around the depot, crystal goblets and lace chemis ettes were exchanged furtively for hunks of lard and mouldy sacks of flour. Arm in arm , Kira and Leo walked to the Nikolaevsk y sta­ tion . Drops tapped the sidewa lk. The sun dripped to the side­ walk with every drop. Leo bought a bunch of violets on a corner. He pinned it to Kir a's shoulder, a purple tuft, young and fragrant on her old black coat. She smiled happily and kicked an icicle in a puddle, splash ing water at the passe rsby, laughing . The train had arrived. They made their way through an eager crowd that push ed them aside and drove them forward, and stuck elbows into their stoma chs, and heels on their toe s. Soldiers watched the des cending pas senge rs, silent, alert, suspici ous. A man stepped down from the train. He had a peculiar nose; it was so short and turned up so sharply that his two wide, slanting nost rils were almo st vertical; under the nostr ils there was a wide space and a heavy mouth . His stomach shivered like gelatin as he stepped down . His coat seemed too ragged, his boots too dirty. Sold iers seized his arms. They were going to search him."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 149 He whined soft ly: \"Comrade s, brothers ! So help me God, you're wro ng.

Her arms were like a skeleton 's in the soldiers ' fists; gray hair hung over her eyes from under an old hat with a black feather; the shawl held on her sunken chest by an ancient mosa ic pin shook silently, convuls ively, a thin, ner vous shudder, like that of a window at the dist ant sound of an exp losion. She moaned , showing three yellow teeth in a dark mouth: \"Comrades .... It's my grandson .... I wasn 't going to sell .... It's for my grand- son .... Please, let me go, comrades ... my grandson-he 's got the scurvy .... Has to eat .... Please, comrades .... The scurvy .. , .. Please .... \" The soldiers dragged her away. Her hat was knocked off. They did not stop to pick it up. Someone stepped on the black feather. The man with the vertical nost rils watched them go. His wide red lips grinned . Then he turned and saw Kira looking at him. He winked myst erious ly, in understanding, and pointed with a j erk of his head to the exit. He went out; Kira and Leo followed him, puzzled. In a dark alley by the stat ion, he looked cautio usly, winked again and opened his coat. The ragged coat had a smoot h lin­ ing of heavy, expensive fur, with the suffocating odor of car­ nation oil used by all travelers of means as protection aga inst lice on trains. He unfastened some unseen hooks in the depth of the fur. His arm disa ppeared in the lining and returned with a loaf of bread and a smoked ham. He smiled. His lips and the lower part of his face smiled ; the upper part-the short nose, the light, narrow eyes-remained strangely im­ mobile, as if paralyzed. \"Here you are, citize ns,\" he said boastfully. \"Bread, ham, anything you wish.

See you Saturday night .\" Parties were rare in Petrograd in 1923. It was Kira's first. She decided to invite Andr ei . She was a little tired of the de­ ception, a little bewildered that it had gone so far. Leo knew all abo ut Andr ei; Andrei knew nothing about Leo . She had told Leo of her friendsh ip; he had not objected; he smiled disdainfully when she spoke of Andrei, and inquired about her \"Communi st boy friend .\" Andrei knew no one in Kir a's circle and no gossip had reached him. He never asked ques­ tions. He kept his promise and never called on her. They met at the Inst itute . They talked of mankind, and its future, and its leaders ; they talked of ballet, tramways and athei sm. By a silent agreement, they never spoke of Soviet Russia. It was as if an aby ss separated them, but their hands and their spirits were strong enough to clasp over the abyss. The grim lines of his tanned face were like an effi gy of a medieval saint; from the age of the Crusades he had inherited the ruthle ssness, the devot ion, and al so the austere chastity. She could not speak of love to him; she could not think of love in his presence ; not becau se she feared a stem condem­ nation ; but because she feared his sublime indi fference.

Her smile was radiant; her black eyes and black curl s spar­ kled like the patent leather of the narrow belt around her slim waistline ; and the delica te patent leather flowers on her should er-the latest Soviet fashion-sparkled like her eyes. The guests entered, logs of wood under their arms. A tall, stern maid in black, with stiff whit e apron and cap, silently received the logs. \"Kira ! Lyd ia! Darling s! So glad! How are you?\" Vava flut­ tered. \"I've heard so much about you, Leo, that I'm really fright­ ened ,\" she acknowledged the introduction, her hand in Leo's; even Lydia understood Leo's answe ring glance; as to Vava, she caught her breath and stepped back a little, and looked at Kira. But Kira paid no attention. To Andrei, Vava said: \"So you're a Comm unist? I think that's char ming.

They kept their arms pressed to their sides to hide the holes in their arm pits ; elbows motion less on their knees-to hide rubbed patche s; feet deep under chairs-to hide worn felt boo ts.

Many things were whispered about her. Her parents had been killed in the revolution . She had married a commander of the Red Army and divorced him two mo nths later.

Cost ly dishes of milky-white porcelain offered slices of black bread with a suspicion of butter, slices of dried fish, potato-skin cook ies, sauerkraut and tea with sticky brown candy instead of suga r. Vav a's mother smiled hospitably: \"Please take one of ev­ erything. Don 't be afrai d. There 's enough. I've counted them .\" Vava's father sat, beaming broadly, at the head of the ta­ ble. He was a doctor who specialized in gynecology. He had not been succes sful before the rev olution; after the revolu­ tion, two facts had helped his ri se: the fact that, as a doctor , he belonged to the \"Free Prof essions\" and was not consid­ ered an exploiter, and the fact that he performed certain not strictly legal operati ons . Within a couple of years he had found himself suddenly the most prosper ous member of his former circle and of many circles above. He sat, his two fists holding his lapels, leaning back com­ fortably, his round stomach bulging under a heavy gold cha in, costly watch-charms tinkling and shuddering with the muscles of his stomach . His narrow eyes disa ppeared in the thick folds of a white flesh. He smil ed warmly at his guests ; he was very proud of the rare, enviable posit ion of host, a host who could afford to offer food; he relish ed the feeling of a patron and benefactor to the children of tho se before whom he had bowed in the old day s, the children of the in­ dust rial magna te Argoun ov, of Admiral Kovalensky. He made a mental note to donate some more to the Red Air Fleet in the morning . His smile widened when the maid entered sullenly, carry­ ing a silver tray with six bott les of rare old wine-a token of gratitude from one of his influential pati ents. He poured, fill­ ing crystal glas ses, chucklin g amia bly : \"Good old stuff. Real prewar stuff. Bet you kids never tasted anything like it.\" The glas ses were passed down the long table, from hand to hand. Kira sat between Leo and Andre i. Andrei raised his glass gravely, steadily, like a warrior. \"Your health, Kir a,\" he said. Leo raised his glass lightly, gracefully, like a diplomat at a foreign bar. \"Since you're toasted by my class superior, Kira,\" he said, \"I'll drink to our charming hostes s.\" Vava answered with a warm, grateful smile . Leo raised his glass to her and drank looking at Rita."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"WE THE LIVING 159 When they returned to the drawing room, the dying fire had to be reviv ed. Lydia played aga in. A few couples danced lazily. Vava sang a song about a dead lady whose fingers smelt of inc ense. Kolya Smiatkin gave an impersonation of a dr unk. Victor told anecdotes. Other s follo wed his examp le; some of the anecdotes were politic al; cautious glanc es were thrown at Andr ei ; words stopped half way and the teller stam­ mered, blushing. At five A.M. everyone was exhausted; but no one could go home before dayligh t it was too dangerous. The city mil itia was helpl ess against bur glars and holdup men. No citizen dared to cross a street after mid night. Doctor Milo vsky and his wife retired, leaving the young guests to await the dawn. The stem, starched maid dragged into the drawing room mat tresses borrowed from all the ne ighbors. The mattresses were lined up against the wall . The maid left. Va va turned out the light. The guests settled down comfortably. in couples. Nothing pierced the darkness but a last gl ow of th e fireplace, a few red dots of cigarett es, a few whispers, a few suspicious sounds that were not whispers. The unwritten law of parties dictated that no one should be too curious in these last, weary and most exciting hour s of a party. Kira felt And rei 's hand on her arm. \"I think they have a balc ony,\" he whispered . \"L et's go ou t.\" Fo llowing him , Kira heard a sigh and someth ing that sounded lik e a very passi onate kiss from the co mer wher e Vava nestled in Vict or's arms. It was cold on the balc ony. The street lay silent lik e a tun­ nel under a vault slowly turning gray. Frozen puddles looked like spli nters of gla ss panes on the pavemen t. Wind ows looked like pud dles frozen on the walls. A milit ia-man lea ned against a lamp post. A flag bent over the street. The flag did not move ; neit her did the man. \"I t's fu nny,\" said Andrei. \"I nev er thought 1 would. but 1 do like dancin g.\" \"Andrei, I'm an gry at you .\" \" Wh y?\" \"This is the second time that you hav en't noti ced my best dres s.\" \"It's beautif ul.\" The door behind them squea led on its rusty hinges.

He asked : \"Is Kira nationalized state property, too?\" Andrei answered slowly : \"Sometimes I think it would be better for her if she wer e.\" \"Well, until the Party passes the proper resolut ion ,\" said Leo, \"she isn't.\" They returned into the warm dark ness of the drawing room . Leo drew Kira down on the mattre ss by his side ; he said noth ing ; she drowsed, her head on his shoulder. Rita moved away with a little shrug. Andrei stood by the balcony door, smoking . At eight A.M. the window curtains were pulled aside. A dull white sky spread over the roofs, like soapy water. Vava muttered good-byes to her guests at the door; she swa yed a little, weary circles under her eye s, one dark lock hanging to the tip of her nose, her lipst ick smeared over her chin. The guests divid ed into grou ps, to walk together in clust ers as long as possible. In the cold dawn, ice breaking under their feet, Andrei took Kira aside for a moment. He pointed at Leo, who was helping Lydia over a puddle a few steps ahead of them. \"Do you see him often?\" he asked. The quest ion told her that he had not learned the truth; the tone of the ques tion-that she would not tell him. Lights burned in the windows of barred, padlocked sho ps. Many doors carried a not ice: \"Comrade burglars, please don't bother. There 's nothing insid e.\" XIII In the summer, Petro grad was a furnace. The wood en bricks of the pavements cracked into black gashes, dry as an empty river bed. The wall s seemed to breathe of fever and the roofs smelt of burned paint. Through eyes hazy in a white glare, men looked hopele ssly for a tree in the city of stone . When they found a tree, they turned away : its motion less leaves were gray with parched dust. Hair stuck to forehe ads. Horses shook flies off their foaming"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 161 nost rils. The Neva lay still ; little drops of fire played lazily on the water, like clusters of span gles, and made the men on the bridges feel hotter. Whenever they could, Kira and Leo went away for a day in the country. They walked hand in hand in the stripes of sun and pine shad ows . Like columns of dark brick, like sinewy bodies sunburnt to bronze and peeling in strips of light bark, the pines gua rded the road and dropp ed, jealou sly, thro ugh a heavy tangle of malachite, a few ray s, a few strips of soft blue. On the green slopes of ditche s, little purple dots of vi­ olets bent to a patch of yellow sand; and only the crystal lust er of the sand showed water over it. Kira took off her shoes and stocking s. Soft dust and pine need les between her toes, she kicked the little black balls of fallen pine con es. Leo swung her slippers at the end of a dry branch, his white shirt unbuttoned, his sleeves rolled above his elbow s. Her bare feet pattered over the boards of an old bridge. Through the wide cracks, she saw sparks swi mming like fish scales down the stream and polliwogs wiggling in swarms of little black comm as. They sat alone in a meadow. Tall grass rose like a wall around them, over their heads ; a hot blue sky desce nded to the sharp, green tips; the sky seemed to smell of clover. A cricket droned like an electric engi ne. She sat on the ground ; Leo lay stretched, his head on her lap. He chewed the end of a long grass stem ; the movement of his hand, holding it, had the perf ection of a foreign cigarette ad. Once in a while, she bent down to kiss him. They sat on a huge tree root over a river. The spreading stars of ferns on the slope below looked like a jungle of dwarf palms. The white trunk of a birch tree sparkled in the sun, its leaves like a waterfall that streamed down, green drops remaining suspended in the air, trem bling, turning sil­ ver and white and green again, dropping once in a while to be swept away by the current. Kira leaped over the rocks, roots and ferns as swift, agile and joyous as an animal . Leo watched her. Her movements were sharp, angular, inexpr ess­ ibly graceful in that contradiction of all grace, not the soft, fluent movements of a woman, but the broken, jerking, pre­ cise, geom etrical movements of a futuri stic dancer . He watched her perched on a dead tree trunk, looking down into the water, her hands at straight angles to her arm s, her el-"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"162 AYN RAND bows at straight angles to her body, her body at a straight an­ gle to her legs, a wild, broken little figure, ten se, living, like a lightning in shape . Then he sprang up, and ran after her, and held her, braking the straight angles into a straight line crushed against him. The dead trunk hanging over the stream creaked perilousl y. She laughed, that strange laughter of hers which was too joyous to be gay, a laughter that held a chal­ lenge, and triumph, and ecst asy. Her lips were moi st, glisten­ ing . * When they returned to the city, the stifling dusk met them with post ers, and banners , and head lines, four letters flaming over the stree ts: U.S.S.R. The country had a new name and a new const itution . The All-Union Congre ss of Soviets had just decided so. Banners said: THE UNION OF SOCIALIST SOVIET REPUBLICS IS THE KERNEL FOR THE FUTURE GROWTH OF A WORLD STATE Demonstrations marched through the hot, dust y streets, red kerchiefs mopping swea ting forehead s. OUR POWER IS IN THE TIGHT WELDING OF THE COLLECTIVE ! A column of children, drums beating, marched into the sun­ set: a layer of bare legs, and a layer of blue trunks, and a layer of white shirts, and a layer of red ties; the kindergarten of the Party, the \"Pioneers .\" Their high, young voices sang : \"To the greedy bourgeois ' sorrow We shall light our fire tomorrow , Our world fire of blood .... \" * Once, Kira and Leo attempted to spend a night in the country. \"Certainly,\" said the landlady. \"Certainly, citizens, I can let you have a room for the night.

She taught sewing in a school for worke rs' children. She rocked through dust y miles in a tramway across the city to the factory dist rict; she watched little grimy hands fashioning shirts and aprons and, sometime s, letters on a red banner; she talked of the importance of needlework and of the Soviet governmen t's const ructive policy in the field of education . Alexander Dimitrievitch slept most of the day. When he was awake, he played solitaire on the ironing board in the kitch­ en-and mixed painstakingly an imitation milk of water, starch and saccharine for Plutarch, the cat he had found in a gutter. When Kira and Leo came to visit them, there was nothing to talk about. Galina Petrovna spoke too shrilly and too fast-about the education of the masses and the sacred call­ ing of the intel ligentsia in serving their less enl ightened brother s. Lydia talked about the things of the spir it. Alexan­ der Dimit rievitch said not hing. Galina Petrovna had long since dropped all hints related to the institution of marri age. Only Lydia was flust ered when Leo spoke to her; she blu shed, embarrassed and thril led. Kira visited them because Alexa nder Dimit rievit ch watched her silently when she came, with a feeble shadow of a smile as if, had it not been for a dull haze suddenly grown between him and the life around him, he would have been glad to see her. * Kira sat on a window sill and watched the first autumn rain on the sidewalk. Glass bubbles sprang up in an ink pud­ dle, a ring around each bubble, and floated for a brief sec­ ond, and burst help lessly like little volcanoe s. Rain drummed dully aga inst all the pavements of the city; it sounded like the distant purring of a slow engine with just one thin trickle of water through the rumble, like a faucet leaking somewhere close by.

Kira did not tum on the light. Leo found her in the dark­ ness by the window. He pr esse d his cheek to hers and asked : \"What 's the matter?\" She said softly : \"Noth ing. Just winter coming . A new year start ing. \" \"You're not afrai d, are you, Kira? We 've stood it so far. \" \"No ,\" said Kira. \"I'm not afrai d.\" * The new year was started by the Upravdom. \"It's like this, Citizen Kovalensky,\" he said, shifting from foot to foot, crumpling his cap in both hands and avoiding Leo 's eyes. \"It's on account of the Domicile Norm. There 's a law about as how it's illega l for two citizens to have three room s, on account of overcrowding conditions seeing as there are too many people in the city, and there are over­ crowding conditions and no place to live. The Gilotdel sent me a tenant with an order for a room, and he's a good pro­ letarian, and I got to give him one of your room s. He can take the dining room and you can keep the other two. Also, this ain't the time when people could live in seven rooms as some people used to.\" The new tenant was a meek, elderly little man who stam­ mered, wore glasses and worked as bookkeeper for the shoe factory \"Red Skoroh od.\" He left early in the morning and came home late at night. He cooked on his own Primus and never had any visitors . \"I won't be in the way, Citizen Argounov a,\" he had said . \"I won't be in the way at all. It's just only as regards the bathroom. If you 'll let me take a bath once a month-I 'll be most gratef ul. As to the other necessit ies, there 's a privy in the back yard, if you'll excuse the mention. I won't mind. I won't annoy a lady.\" They moved their furniture out of the dining room into their remaining qua rters and nailed the connecting door. When Kira cooked, in the drawing room, she asked Leo to remai n in the bedroom. \"Self-pre servation,\" she told him, \"for both of us.\" * Andrei had spent the summer on a Party mission in the vil- lages of the Vo lga.

They 've kept me cheerf ul.\" She looked at the grimne ss of his lips. \"What have they done to you, Andrei?\" \"Who?\" But he knew that she knew. He did not look at her, but he answered: \"Well, I guess everybody knows it. The villages-that 's the dark spot on our future. Th ey're not conquered . They 're not with us. They have a red flag over the local Soviet and a knife behind their backs . They bow, and they nod, and they snicker in their bear ds. They stick pictures of Lenin over the barns where they hide their grain from us. You 've read in the papers about the Clubhou se they burned and the three Commu nists they burned in it-alive.

On his desk stood two small plast er busts : of Lenin and Karl Marx. He wore a high-collared peasa nt blouse of expen sive black satin. He looked at his manicured fingernail s; then he looked at Leo . \"I feel certain, Comrade Kovalensky, that you will wel­ come this opportunity to do your duty in our great cultural drive, as we all do.\" Leo asked: \"What do you want?\" \"This orga niza tion has taken the honor ary post of 'Cultchef' to a division of the Baltfleet.

Then she took a plate from the shelf. As she was carry­ ing it to the table, she saw that the plate was trem bling . She stopped and, in the dusk, whispered, addre ssing herself for the ftrst time in her life, as if speaking to a person she had never met before : \"Now, Kira, you don't. You don't. You don't.\" She stood and held the plate over the table and stared down, all her will in her eyes, as if a great issue depended on the plate . Presently the plate stopped trembling. * When he had stood in line for an hour, he smoked a cig- arette. When he had stood for two hours , he began to feel that his legs were numb. When he had stood for three hours , he felt that the numb­ ness had risen to his throat, and he had to lean agai nst a wall . When his tum came, the editor looked at Leo and said: \"I don 't see how we can use you, citizen. Of course, our pub­ lica tion is strictly arti stic . But-Proletarian Art, 1 may re­ mind you.

She could use sunflower- seed oil. If she bought good oil it would leave no odor and it was cheaper.

You can go in now.\" The comrade editor leaned back in his chair; he held a bronze paper knife; the knife tapped the edge of a desk cal­ endar bearing a picture of Lunacharsky, People 's Commi ssar of Education and Art; the editor 's voice sounded like a knife cutting paper: \"No. No ope ning.

He did not look into the steady gray eyes acro ss the table, nor at the lips that smiled gently. He offered no complaint and no conso lation. Sometime s, for many long moment s, he stood before the crystal vase on the malachite stand, the one that had not been broken, and looked at it, his eyes expr essionl ess, his hands in his pock ets, a ciga rette hanging in the corner of his mouth ; he stood without moving, without blinki ng, the smoke alone stirring slowly , swaying. Then he smiled and the ciga rette fell to the floor, and burned, smoking, a dark ring widening on the parquet; but he did not notice it; and Kira did not no­ tice it, for her eyes were fixed, wide and frightened, on Leo 's icy, sardonic smile . \"Any past experience, citizen?\""},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING \"No.\" \"Party member?\" \"No .\" \"Sorry.

But Leo never smiled when he knew he should. And perhaps it would have been useles s. The office manager met him with a worried, apologetic look and avoided his eyes. \"So sorry, citizen . Yes, I promised you this job, but-you see, the big boss's cousin came from Moscow and she's un­ employed, and .... Unforeseen circums tances, citizen . You know-man proposes and God disposes ....

But when she sat in a long, cold room and listened to lec­ tures about steel, and bolts, and kilowat ts, she straightened her shoulders as if a wrench had tightened the wires of her nerve s. She looked at the man who sat beside her; at times she wondered whether those words about steel beams and girders were not about his bones and muscles, a man for whom steel had been created, or, perha ps, it was he that had been created for steel, and conc rete, and white heat; she had long since forgotten where Andrei Taganov 's life ended and that of engines began . When he quest ioned her solicit ously, she answered : \"Andr ei, any circles under my eyes are nothing but your own imaginat ion.

He stood among them, tall, straight, young, a god's form with lips that were still proud. A streetwalker pas sed by and stopp ed; and looked, star­ tled, at that man among the others ; and winked an invitation. He did not move, only turned his head away. XIV A house collapsed, early one after noon. The front wall crash ed, with . a shower of bric ks, in a white cloud of limey dust. Com ing back from work, the inhabitants saw their bed­ rooms exposed to the cold light of the street, like tiers of stage setting s; an upright piano, caught by a naked beam, hung precariously high ove r the pavement. There were a few weary moans, but no astonishment; hou ses, long since in need of repair, collapsed without warning all over the city. Old bricks were piled . high over the tram way rails and stopped traff ic. Leo got a job for two days, clea ring the street. He worked, bending and rising, bending and rising, through many hours , a numb ache in his spine, red dust on bleeding fingers stiff and raw in the cold. The Museum of the Revolution had an exhibition in honor of the visiting delegates of a Swedish Trade Union . Kira got a job lettering cardboard inscription s. She bent through four long evenings, eyes dull, hands trembling over a ruler, pain­ fully tracing even black letters that said: \" WORKERS STARV­ ING IN THE TENEMENTS OF THE CAPITALISTIC EXPLOITERS OF"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"WE THE LIVIN G 173 1910 ,\" \" WORKERS EXILED TO SIBERIA BY THE CZARIST GEN­ DARMES OF 1905.\" Snow grew in white drifts in the gutters , under basement window s. Leo shovelled snow for three nights, his breath fluttering in spurts of white vapor, icicles sparkling on the old scarf wound tightly around his neck. A citizen of no visible means of support, who owned an automob ile and a five-room apartment, and who held long, whispered conv ersations with officials of the Food Trust, de­ cided that his children had to speak French. Kira gave les­ sons twice a week, dully explaining the \"passe imparfait\" to two hagg ard brats who wiped their noses with their fingers, her voice hoars e, her head swimming, her eyes avoiding the buffet where glossy white muff ins sparkled with brown, well-but tered crusts. Leo helped a proletarian student who had an ex amination to pass. He expl ained slowly the laws of capital and interest to a sleepy fellow who scratched his knuck les, for he had the itch. Kira washed dishes two hours a day, bending over a greasy tub that smelt of old fish, in a private restaurant-until it failed. They disappeared for hours every day and when they came home they never asked each other in what lines they had stood, what streets they had trudged wearily to what doors closed brusquely before them. At night, Kira lighted the \"Bourgeoise\" and they sat silently, bent over their books . They still had th ings to study and one goal to remember, if all the others had to be forgotten: to graduate. \"It doesn 't matter,\" Kira had said. \"Nothing matters . We must n't think. We must n't think at all. We must remember only that we have to be ready and then ... maybe ... maybe we'll find a way to go abro .... \" She had not finished. She could not pro­ nounce the word . That word was like a silent, secret wound deep in both of them. Sometimes they read the newspape rs. Comrade Zinovi ev, president of the Petrograd Soviet, said: \"The world revolu­ tion is not a matter of years, comrade s, not a matter of mont hs, but a matter of days now. The flame of a Proletarian Uprising will sweep the Earth, wiping out forever the Curse of World Capitalism.\" There was also an interview with Comrade Biriuch in, third stoker on a Red battleship. Comrade Biriuchin said: \"Well,"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"174 AYN RAN D and then we gotta keep the machines oiled, and again we gotta look out for rust, seeing as how it's up to us to watch over the people 's engine s, and we being conscie ntious prole­ tarians, we do our share, on account of we do n't care for no nonsense outsid e of good, practical work, and again, there 's the foreign bourgeoi s watching us, and ... \" Sometimes they read the maga zines. \" ...

I am the new woman of a new day.' \" There was also poetry to read: \" ... My heart is a tractor raking the soil, My soul is smoke from the fa ctory oil .... \" Once they went to a motion picture . It was an American film. In the bright glare of showc ases, clust ers of shadows st ood gazing wist fully at the breath­ taking, incredible, fo reign stills; big snowflakes crashed into the glass; the eager faces smiled faintly, as if with the same thought, the thought that glas s-and more than gl a ss­ protected this distant, mira culous world from the hopeless Russia n winter. Kira and Leo waited, jammed in the crowd of the foyer. When a show ended and the doors were opened, the crowd tore forward, knocking aside those who tried to come out, squeezing in through the two narrow doors, painfully, furi­ ously, with a brutal despair, like meat ground through a tight grinder. The title of the picture shivered in huge white lette rs: \" THE GOLDEN OCTOPUS \" DIRECTED BY REGINALD MOORE CENSORED BY COMRADE M. ZAVADKOV The picture was puzz ling.

An English sign on the office wall was mis­ spelled. The office was that of an American Trade Union where a stem comrade entrusted the hero--a blondi sh, dark­ eyed young man-with the recovery of documents of vast importance to the Unio n, stolen by a capita list. \"Hell !\" whispered Leo. \"Do they also make pictures like that in Amer ica?\" Suddenly, as if a fog had lifted, the photography cleared. They could see the soft line of lipst ick and every hair of the long lashes of a beautiful, smiling leading lady. Men and women in magnificently foreign clothes moved gracefully through a story that made no sense. The subtitles did not match the action. The subtitles clamored in glaring white let­ ters about the suffering of \"our American brothers under the capita listic yoke.\" On the screen, gay people laughed hap­ pily, danced in sparkling halls, ran down sandy beache s, their hair in the wind, the muscles of their young arms taut, glis­ tening, monstrou sly healthy. A woman left her room wearing a white dress and emerged on the street in a black suit. The hero had suddenly grown taller, thinner, very blond and blue­ eyed. His trim full-dress suit was surpri sing on a toiling Trade Union member; and the papers he was seeking through the incoherent jumble of events seemed suspiciously close to something like a will for his uncle 's inheritance. A subtitle said: \"I hate you. You are a bloo d-sucking cap­ italistic exploit er. Get out of my room !\" On the screen , a man was bending over the hand of a del­ icate lady, pressing it slowly to his lips, while she looked at him sadly, and gently stroked his hair. The end of the picture was not shown. It finish ed abruptly, as if tom off. A subtitle conclu ded: \"Six months later the bloodthirsty capital ist met his death at the hands of striking workers. Our hero renounced the joys of a selfish love into which the bour geois siren had tried to lure him, and he ded­ icated his life to the cause of the World Revolut ion.\" \"I know,\" said Kira, when they were leaving the theater. \"I know what they 've done !

Tenants came bringing their own chairs and sat chewing sunflower seeds. Those who brought no chairs sat on the floor and chewed sunflower seeds. \"Seeing as how I'm the Upravdom,\" said the Upravdom, \"I declare this meeting of the tenants of the house Num­ ber-on Sergievskaia Street open .

Bread crumb s rolled down into their under­ wear and the bed sheets smelt of linseed oil. Leo's books were stacked on the dresser; Kira' s-under the bed. Leo whist led a fox-trot, arranging his books. Kira did not look at him. After some hesit ation, Marisha surrendered the painting of Leo's mother, which hung in the draw ing room.

She had a gramoph one. Late into the night, she played old records, of which her favorite was a song about Napoleon 's defeat in Russia -\"It roared, it flamed, the fire of Moscow.\" When she was tired of the gramophone, she played the \"Dog 's Waltz\" on the grand piano.

The Rabfacs were special worke rs' faculties with an aca­ demic program a little less exacting than that of the Univer­ sity, with a program of revolutionary sciences a great deal more exactin g, and with an ad mission on the stricte st prole­ tarian basis. Marisha dislik ed Kira, but spoke to Leo at times. She flung the door open so that her post ers rustled on the wall s, and yelled imperi ously: \"Citizen Koval ensk y, can you help me with this damn French history ? What century did they burn Martin Luther in? Or was that Germany? Or did they burn him?\" At other times she flung the door open and announced to no one in particular: \"I'm going to the Kom somol Club to meet ing.

It was only her old dress, but slowly, painfully, awkwardly, she managed to tum it inside out. The blue wool was smooth and silky on the inside; it looked almost fresh. It was to be a sur­ prise for Leo; she worked on it at night when he had gone to bed. She put a candle on the floor and opened the big mirror qoor of the wardrobe and used it as a screen, crouching on"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"184 AYN RAN D the floor behind it, by the candle . She had never learned how to sew. Her fingers moved slowly, helple ssly. She wiped drops of blood on her petti coat, when she pricked her finger with the needl e. Her eyes felt as if tiny needles pricked them continuously from behind the lids; and her lids felt so heavy that when she blinked they stayed closed and it took an effort to pull them open to the huge yellow glare of the candle. Somewhe re in the darkne ss, behind the yellow glare, Leo breathed heavi ly in his sleep. The dress was ready on the day when she met Vava in the street. Vava was smiling happily, myster iously once in a while, for no apparent reason, smiling at a secret thought of her own .

Vava opened a parcel carefully wrapped in tissue paper. She handled the objects ins ide with a frightened rever ence, with delica te, trembling fingers . The parcel contained two pairs of silk stockings and a black celluloid bracelet. Kira gasped. She extended her hand. She hesit ated. She touched a stocking with her finger tips, caressing it timidly, like the fur of a pricele ss animal. \"It's smuggled,\" Vava whispered. \"A lady-f ather 's patient-her husba nd's in the busines s-they smuggled it from Riga.

He did not take his coat off; he walked straight to the \"Bour geoise\" and stood, his blue hands extended to the fire, rubbing them furiously.

Everyth ing's ready. \" He sat down . He had looked at her several time s. He had not noticed. It was the same old blue dress; but she had trimmed it carefully with bands and button s of black oilcl oth which looked almost like patent leather. When she served the millet and he dipped his spoon hungrily into the steaming yellow mush, she stood by the table and, raising her skirt a little, swung her leg forward into the circle of light, watching happily the shimmerin g, tight silk.

He had worked in caissons for a bridge under const ruction, deep on the bottom of a river on the point of freezing. Kira had waited for him. She had kept a fire in the \"Bour­ geoi se.\" He came in, oil and mud on his coat, oil and sweat on his face, oil and blood on his hands. He swayed a little and held onto the door. A strand of hair was glued across his forehead . He went into the bathroom. He came out, asking: \"K ira, do I have any clean underwear?\" He was naked. His hands were swollen . His head drooped to one shoulder. His eyelids were blue. His body was white as marble and as hard and straight; the body of a god, she thought, that should climb a mounta inside at dawn, young grass under his feet, a morning mist on his muscles in a breath of homa ge. . The \"Bourgeoise\" was smoking . An acrid fog hung under the electric bulb . The gray rug under his feet smelt of kero­ sene . Black drops of soot fell slowly, with a soft thud, from a joint of the stove pipes to the gray rug. Kira stood before him. She could say nothin g. She took his hand and raised it to her lips. He swayed a little . He threw his head back and coughed. * Leo was late. He had been detained at a Unive rsity lecture . Kira waited, the Primus hissing feebly, keeping his dinner hot.

A long pink strand of froth hung on her lower lip. Her eyes were wide with a horror beyond all human dig­ nity. She was staring at Kira. She screamed: \"Kira ! I want to live ! I want to live !\" She fell back. Her hair jerked like snakes on the pillow and lay still. Her arm fell over the edge of the bed and lay still. A red bubble grew over her open mouth and burst in a spurt of something black and heavy, gurgling like the last drop through the clogged pipe . She did not move . Nothing moved on the bed but the black that slithered slowly down the skin of her throat. Kira stood still. Someone seized her hand . Va sili Ivanovitch buried his face in her hip and sobbed.

Then she staggered blindly, groping in the dark ness, into the bathroom. Her eyes wouldn 't open. She reached for the bathtub faucet; it had been running slowly , gurgling in the dark ness, . all night; it had to be left runn ing or the pipes would freeze . Eyes closed, she slapped cold water over her face with one hand; with the other, she leaned unsteadily on the edge of the bathtub, to keep from falling forward head first. Then her eyes opened and she pulled her nightgown off, steam rising from her wet arms in the frozen air, while she tried to smile, her teeth chattering, telling herself that she was awake now and the worst was over. She dressed and slipped back into the bedroom . She did not tum on the light. She could see the black silhouette of the Primus on the table against the dark blue of the window. She struck a match, her body shielding the bed from the little flare of light. She pumped the handle nervously. The Primus wouldn 't light. The clock ticked in the dark ness, the precious fleeting seconds hurrying her on. She pumped furiously, bit­ ing her lips. The blue flame sprang up at last. She put a pan of water over the flame . She drank tea with saccharine and chewed slowly a piece of dry bread .

Somewhere beyond the houses, a tramway shrieked like an early bird of prey. Kira bent forward, gathered her hands into her armpits, in a tight, shivering huddle against the wind . The cold caught her breath with a sharp pain in her nostrils. She ran, slipping on the frozen sidewalks, toward the distant - tramway. A line waited for the tramway. She stood, bent to the wind and silent as the others. When the tramway came, yellow squares of light in space , shaking toward them through the dark ness, the line broke. There was a swif t whirlpool at the narrow door, a rustle of crushed bodi es; the yellow squares of lighted windows filled speedily with shad ows presse d tightly together, and Kira was left outside as the bell rang and the tramway tore forward. There was half an hour to wait for the next one; she would be late; if she were late, she would be fired; she ran after the tramway, leaped, caught a brass handle; but there was no room on the steps; her feet were dragged down the frozen ground as the tramway gained speed; someone 's strong arm seized her shoulder blade and pulled her up; her one foot found space on the steps; a hoarse voice roared into her ear: \"You -insane, citizen ? That's how so many get killed !\" She hung in a clust er of men on the tramway steps, hold­ ing on with one hand and one foot, watching the streaked snow speed by on the ground, pressing herself with all her strength into the clust er of bodie s, when a passing truck came too close and threatened to grind her off the tramway steps.

There were post ers of workers and peasa nts shaking hands, of a worker and a peas ant woman, also of a peasant and a working woman, of work bench and plow, of smokestacks and wheat fields, \"Our future lies in the Clamping of City and Village !,\" \"Comrade s, strengthen the Clamping !,\" \"Comrade s, do your share for the Clamping !,\" \"Comrade s, what have you done for the Clamping?\" The posters rose like foam from the entrance door, up the stairway, to the office. In the office there were carved marble columns and partitions of unpainted wood; also--de sks, files, pictures of proletarian leaders and a typewri ter; also ­ Comrade Bitiuk, the office manager, and five office workers, among them Kira Argounov a. Comrade Bitiuk was a tall woman, thin, gray-haired, mil- . itary and in strict sympathy with the Soviet Government; her chief aim in life was to give const ant evid ence of how strict that sympathy was, even though she had graduated from a wom en's college and wore on her breast an old-f ashio ned watch on a bow of burnished silver. Her four office workers were : a tall girl with a long nose and a leather jacket, who was a Party member and could make Comrade Bitiuk shudder at her slighte st whim, and knew it; a young man with a bad complexion, who was not a Party member yet, but had made an application and was a candidate , and never missed a chance to mention it; and two young girls who worked merely because they needed the wages: Nina and Tina. Nina wore earrings and answered the telephone ; Tina powdered her nose and ran the typewriter. A habit which had sprung from nowhere and spread over the country, which even Party members could not check or resist, for which no one was responsible nor could be punished, re­ ferred to all products of local inefficiency as \"Sov iet\"; there were \"Sovi et matche s\" that did not light, \"Soviet kerchiefs\" that tore the first time worn, \"Soviet shoes\" with cardboard soles. Young women like Nina and Tina were called \"Soviet girls.\""},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"19 4 AY N RA ND There were many floors and many offices in the \"House of the Peasa nt.\" Many feet hurried up and down its many cor­ ridors in a steady drone of activity. Kira never learned just what that activity was, nor who worked in the building, be­ sides those in her office and the imposing Comrade Voronov whom she had seen once on her first day in the \"House of the Peasant .\" As Comrade Bitiuk reminded thcm const antly, the \"House of the Peasant\" was \"the heart of a gigantic net whose veins poured the beneficial light of the new Proletarian Culture into the darkest corners of our farthest villa ges.\" It repre­ sented the hospit able arms of the city open wide in welcome to all pcasant delegation s, all comr ades from the villages who came to the city.

Once, Kira saw Nina cracking something on her thumb nail. This morn ing, on her way up to the office. Kira stopped on the stair landing and looked at the Wall Newspa per. The \"House of the Peasant,\" like all institutions , had a Wall Newspa per written by the employees, edited by the local Communi st Cell, pasted in a prominent spot for all comrades to read ; the Wall Newspa pers were to \"stimula te the social spirit and the consciousne ss of collective activity\"; they were devoted to \"local news of social importance and const ructive proletarian criticism.\" The Wall Newspa per of the \"House of the Peas ant\" was a square meter of typewritten strips pasted on a blackboa rd with headl ines in red and blue pencil. There was a prominent editorial on \"What each one of us comrades here does for the Clamping,\" there was a humorou s article on \"How we'll puncture the foreign Imperiali st's belly,\" there was a poem by a local poet about \"The Rhythm of Toil,\" there was a car­ toon by a local artist, repre senting a fat man in a high silk hat sitting on a toilet.

No one dared to ignore the mighty pointing finger of the Wall News­ paper.

No one could save those branded as \"ant i-social element,\" not even Andrei Taganov. There had been talk of a reduction of staffs. Kira felt cold. She thought that Leo had had nothing but millet for dinner the night be­ fore. She thought of Leo's cough. At her desk, she watched the others in the room, wonder­ �ng who had reported her to the Wall Newspa per, who and why. She had been so very caref ul. She had never uttered a word of criticism again st the Soviets . She had been as loyal ly enthu siastic in her work as Comrade Bitiuk herself, or as nearly as she could imitate her. She had been careful neve r to argue, nor to answer sharply, nor to make an enemy of anyone. Her fingers counting rapidly volumes of the works of Karl Marx, she asked herself helple ssly, desperately : \"Am I still different? Am I different from them? How do they know I'm different? What have I done? What is it I haven 't done?\" When Comrade Bitiuk left the office, which happened fre­ quently, work stopped. The staff congregated around Tina 's typewriter. There were eager whispered conferences about the co-operative that gave the loveliest printed calico that made the loveliest blouses, about the Nepman 's stand in the market that sold cotton stock ings \"so thin it's just like silk,\" and about lovers, particularly Tina 's lovers . Tina was consid­ ered the prettiest in the office. and the most successf ul with men .

The girl with the leather jacket, being a Party member, was the undisputed leader and final authority in all their dis­ cussio ns; but in matters of romance, she conceded first rank to Tina.

I bet you say things that a serious citizen who is a Party candidate shouldn 't even hear.\" They giggled, flattered, and rewarded him with friendly glance s. Kira stayed at her desk and went on with her work, and did not listen . She never talked to anyone outsid e of business matters . If any glances were thrown at her occasi onally, they were not friendly. She wondered with a cold feeling of panic whether that was what they resented, whether that was her arrogant bour­ geois attitude. She needed this job. Leo needed this job. She had made up her mind to keep it. She would keep it. She rose and walked casu ally to Tina 's desk. The little group noticed her presence by a few cold, astonished glances and went on with their whispers . She waited for a pause and said suddenly, irrelevantly, forcing all of the artificial enthu siasm she had learned into her flat, unsteady voice : \"Funny thing happened last night.

She tried to believe the story she was inventing ; it was strange to think of the fantastic boy friend offered to those prying, hostile eyes, and of the Leo whom Irina had drawn naked as a god. \" ... and he bawled me out terribly .... \" \"Uh-huh ,\" sa id Nina. The girl in the leather jacket said nothing. \"In the Kouznetzky market,\" said Tina, \"I've seen them selling lipstick, the new Soviet lip stick of the Cosmetic Trust. Cheap, too. Only they say it's dangerous to use it. It's made from horse fat and the horses died of glanders .\" * At twelve-thir ty the office closed for lunch. At twe1ve- twenty -five, Comrade Bitiuk said: \"I shall remind you once more, comrade s, that at one-t hirty, instead of reporting back to the office, you are to report at the Smolny Institute to take part in the demonstration of all the workers of Petrog rad. in honor of the delegation of the British Trade Unions.

She stood m otion less, in a blank stupor; a movement or a thought seemed too far away, far in a world where she did not belong any longer. The locks of hair under her old hat were white with frost. She thought that somewhere beyond all these many things which did not count, was her life and Leo. She closed her eyes for one swift second of rest with nothing but his name .

A bitter little smile of understanding jerked one corner of his mouth . He walked to the bed and fell down . He lay so still, his head thrown back, one arm hanging to the floor, that she felt uncomfortable. Once in a while, she called softly: \"Leo,\" just to see him open his eyes.

Kira walked fast and listened to her own footsteps, lis­ tened blankly, without thought; she could think now, but after so many hours of such a tremendous effort not to think, not to think, to remember only not to think, thoughts seemed slow to return; she knew only that her steps were beating, fast, firm, precise, until their strength and their hope rose to her body, to her heart, to the throbbing haze in her temple s. She threw her head back, as if she were resting , swimming on her back, close under a clear black sky, with stars at the tip of her nose, and roof tops with snow clean in the frozen starlight like white virgin mountain peaks.

That apron of hers was filthy; it was loathsome; she could not let Leo see her wearing it another day; not another day. She crawled out of bed and slipped her coat over her night gown; it was too cold and she was too tired to dress.

At a bare table without table cloth, under a lamp without a shade, Vasili Ivanovitch sat reading an old volume of Che­ khov. Irina, her hair uncombed, sat drawing sensele ss figures on a huge sheet of paper. Acia slept, full dressed, curled in an annchair in a dark comer. A rusty \"Bourgeoise\" smoked. \"Allo ,\" said Irina, her lip s twisting . Kira had never seen her smile like that. \"Would you like some tea, Kira? Hot tea? Only ... only we have no saccharine left.\" \"No, thank you, Uncle Vasili, I've just had dinner.\" \"Well?\" said Irina. \"Why don't you say it? Expelled?\" Kira nodded. \"And Leo, too?\" Kira nodded. \"Well? Why don't you ask? Oh, I'll tell you myself: sure, I'm out. What could you expect? Daughter of the wealthy Court Furrier !\" \" And-Victor?\" Irina and Vasili Ivanovitch exchanged a glance, a strange glance. \"No,\" Irina answered slowly, \"Victor is not ex­ pelled .\" \"I'm glad, Uncle Vasili. That's good new s, isn't itT' She knew the best way to cheer her uncle : \"Vict or's such a tal­ ented young man, I'm glad they 've spared his future .\" \"Yes,\" Vasili Ivanovitch said slowly, bitterly. \"Victor is such a talented young man.\" \"She had a white lace gown,\" Irina said hysterically, \"and, really, she has a gorgeous voice-oh-I mean-I 'm speaking of the new production of 'La Traviata' at the Mikhailovsky Theater-and you've seen it, of course? Oh, well, you must see it. Old classics are ... old classics are ... \" \"Yes,\" said Vas iIi Ivanovitch, \"old classics are still the best.

Oh, hell!\" She threw her drawing board down with a crash that awakened Acia, who sat up staring, blink ing. \"You 'll hear it sooner or later: Victor has joined the Party !\" Kira was holding the book of Chekhov and it clattered down to the floor. \"He ... what?\" \"He joined the Party. The All-Union Communi st Party. With a red star, a Party ticket, a bread card, and his hand in all the blood spilled, in all the blood to come !\" \"Irina! How ... how could he get admitted?\" She was afraid to look at Vasili Ivanovit ch. She knew she should not ask question s, questions that were like knives turned in a wound ; but she could not resist it. \"Oh, it seems he had it planned for a long time. He's been maki ng friends-caref ully and judiciousl y. He's been a can­ didate for months-and we never knew it. Then-he got ad­ mitted. Oh, they accepted him all right-with the kind of sponso rs he had selected to vouch for his proletarian spirit, even though his father did sell furs to the Czar!\" \"Did he know this-the purge, I mean-was coming ?\" \"Oh, don't be silly. It isn't that. Of course, he didn't know that in advance. He's aiming higher than merely to keep his place at the Institute . Oh, my brother Victor is a brilliant young man. When he wants to climb-he knows the stepping stones:' \"Well,\" Kira tried to smile, to say for Vasili Ivanovit ch's sake, without looking at him, \"it's Vict or's busin ess. He knows what he wan ts. Is he ... is he still here?\" \"If it were up to me, he ... \" Irina checked herself abrupt- ly. \"Yes. The swine 's still here .\" \"Irina,\" Vasili Ivanovitch said wearily, \"he's your brother.\" Kira changed the subject; but it was not easy to keep up a conversati on. Half an hour later, Victor came in. The dig­ nity of his expr ession and the red star in his lapel were very much in evidenc e. \"Victor,\" Kira said. \"I hear you're a good Communist, now.\" \"I have had the honor of joining the All-Unio n Communi st Party,\" Victor answered, \"and I'll have it understood that the Party is not to be referred to lightly. \" \"Oh,\" said Kira. \"I se e.\""},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"216 AYN RAND But it happened that she did not see Vict or's extended hand when she was lea ving. At the door, in the lobby, Irina whispered to her: \"At first, I thought Father would throw him out. But ... with Mother gone ... and all ... and you know how he' s always been crazy about Victor . . . well, he thinks he'll try to be broadmi nded. I think it will break him .... For God's sake, Kira, come often. He likes you. \" * Be cause there was no future, they hung on to the present. There were days when Leo sat for hours reading a book, and hardly spoke to Kira, and when he spoke his s m ile held a bit­ ter, endless contempt for himself , for the world, for eternity. Once, she fo und him drunk, leaning against the table, staring intently at a broken glass on the floor. \"L eo ! Where did you get it?\" \"B orrowed it. Bo rrowed it from our dear neighbor Com­ rade Marisha. She always has plent y.\" \"L eo, why do you ?\" \"Why shouldn 't I? Why shoul dn 't I? Who in this whole damn world can tcll mc why I shouldn 't?\" But there were days when a new calm suddenl y cleared his eyes and his smile. He waited for Kira to come home from work and when she entered he drew her hastily int o his arms. They could sit through an evening without a word, their pres­ ence, a glance, the pressure of a hand drugging them into se­ curity, making them forget the coming morning, all the com ing morni ngs . Arm in arm, they walked through silent, luminous streets in the white nights of spring. The sky was like dull glass glowi ng with a sunless radiance from somewhere beyon d. They could look at each other, at the still, sleepless city, in the strange , milky light. He pressed her arm close to his. and when they were alone on a long street dawn-bright and em pty, he bent to kiss her. Kira's steps were steady. There were too many questions ahead; but here, beside her, were the things that gave her cer­ tainty: his straight, tense body, his long, thin hands, his ha ughty mouth with the arrogant smile that answered all que stions. And, sometim es, she felt pity for those countless na meless ones somewhere around them who, in a feverish qu est, were searching for some answer, and in their search crushed others, perhaps even her; but she could not be"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 217 crushed, for she had the answer. She did not wonder about the future. The future was Leo . * Leo was too pale and he was sile nt too often. The blue on his temples looked like veins in mar ble. He coughed, chok­ ing. He took cough med icine, which did not help, and re­ fused to see a doctor. Kira saw Andrei frequently. She had asked Leo if he minded it. \"Not at all,\" he had answe red, \"if he's your friend. Only-would you mind?--don 't bring him here. I'm not sure I can be polite ... to one of them .\" She did not bring Andrei to the hou se. She telephoned him on Sunday s and smiled cheerfully into the receiver: \"Feel like seeing me, Andrei? Two o'clock-Summer Garden-the quay entran ce.\" They sat on a bench, with the oak leaves fighting the glare of the sun above their hea ds, and they talked of philos ophy. She smiled sometime s when she realized that Andrei was the only one with whom she could think and talk about thoug hts. They had no reason for meeting each other. Yet they met, and made dates to meet again, and she felt strangely comfort­ able, and he laughed at her short summer dresses, and his laughter was strangely happy. Once, he invited her to spend a Sunday in the country. She had stayed in the city all summer; she could not refuse. Leo had found a job for Sunday : breaking the wooden br icks of pavements, with a gang repairing the street s. He did not ob­ ject to her excur sion. In the country, she found a smooth sea sparkling in the sun; and a golden sand wind-pleated into faint, even wav es; and the tall red candles of pines, their convulsed roots naked to the sand and wind, pine cones rolling to meet the sea shell s. Kira and Andrei had a swimming race, which she won . But when they raced down the beach in their bathing suits, sand flying from under their heel s, spurting sand and water at the peaceful Sunday tour ists, Andrei won. He caught her and they rolled down together, a whirl of legs, arms and mud, into the lunch basket of a matron who shrieked with terror. They disentangled themselves from each other and sat there screaming with laughter. And when the matron strug­ gled to her feet, gathered her lunch and waddled away, grum­ bling something about \"this vulgar modem yout h that can't keep their love- affairs to themselve s,\" they laughed louder."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"218 AYN RAN D They had dinner in a dirty little country restaurant, and Kira spoke English to the waiter who could not understand a word, but bowed low and stuttered and spilled water all over the table in his eagerne ss to serve the first comrade foreigner in their forgotten comer. When they were leaving, Andrei gave him twice the price of their dinner. The waiter bowed to the ground, convinced that he was dealing with genuine foreigners . Kira could not help looking a little startled. Andrei laughed when they went out: \"Why not? Might as well make a waiter happy. I make more money than I can spend on myself anyway.\" In the train, as it clattered into the evening and the smoke of the city, Andrei asked : \"Kira, when will I see you again?\" \"I'll call you.\" \"No . I want to know now.\" \"In a few days.\" \"No . I want a definite day. \" \"Well, then, Wednesday night?\" \"All right.\" \"After work, at five-thirty, at the Summer Gard en.\" \"All right .\" When she came home, she found Leo asleep in a chair, his hands dust-st reaked, smears of dust on his damp, flushed face, his dark lashes blond with dust, his body limp with ex­ haustion . She washed his face and helped him to undr ess. He coughed. The two evenings that followed were long, furious argu­ men ts, but Leo surrendered: He promised to visit a doctor on Wedn esday. * Vava Milovsk aia had a date with Victor for Wednesday night. Wednesday afternoon, Victor telephoned her, his voice impatiently apologet ic: he was detained on urgent business at the Institute and would not be able to see her. Urgent busi­ ness had detained him the last three times he had promised to come . Vava had heard rumors ; she had heard a name ; she knew what to suspect. In the evening, she dressed caref ully; she pulled a wide black patent leather belt tight around the slim waist of her best new white coat; she touched her lips faintly, caut ious ly, with her new foreign lipstick; she slipped on her foreign cel­ luloid bracelet.

She hesitated on the stair landing before Kira's apartment, and her hand trembled a little when she pressed the bell. The tenant opened the door. \"To see Citizen Argounova? This way, comrade,\" he told her. \"You have to pass through Citizen Lavr ova's room. This door here .\" Resolutely, Vava jerked the door open without knock ing. They were there-together -M arisha and Victor-bending over the gramophone that played \"The Fire of Moscow.\" Victor 's face was cold, silent fury. But Vava did not look at him . She tossed her head up and said to Marisha, as proudly, as dramatically as she could, in a shaking voice, swallowing tears: \"I beg your pardon, citizen, I'm just call­ ing on Citizen Argoun ova.\" Surprised and suspecting nothing, Ma risha point ed to Kira's door with her thumb . Head high, Vava walked acro ss the room. Mari sha could not understand why Victor left in such a hUrry. Kira was not at home, but Leo was. * Kira had had a restless day. Leo had promised to telephone her at the office and tell her the doctor 's diagn osis. He had not called . She telephoned him three times. There was no an­ swer. On her way home, she remembered that it was Wed nesday night and that she had a date with Andrei. She could not keep him waiting indefinitely at a public park gate. She would drop by the Sum mer Garden and te11 him that she couldn 't stay. She reached the Garden on time. Andrei was not there. She looked up and down the da r k­ ening quay. She peered into the trees and shadows of the gar­ den. She waited . Twice, she asked a militia-man what time it was. She waited. She could not understand it. He did not come . When she finally went home, she had waited for an hour. She clutched her hands angrily in her pock ets. She could not worry about Andrei when she thought of Leo, and the doctor, and of what she still had to hear. She hurried up the stairs . She darted through Mar isha's room and flung the door open. On the davenport, her white coat trailing to the floor, Vava was clasped in Leo's arms, their lips locked together. Kira stood looking at them calmly, an amazed question in her lifted eyebr ows."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"220 AYN RAND They jumped up. Leo was not very steady. He had been drinking again. He stood swaying, with his bitter, contemptu­ ous smile . Vava's face went a dark, purplish red. She opened her mouth, chok ing, without a sound. And as no one said a word, she screamed suddenly into the silence : \"You think it's terri­ ble, don't you? Well, I think so too! It's terrible, it's vile! Only I don't care ! I don't care what I do! I don't care any more ! I'm rotten? Well, I'm not the only one! Only I don't care ! I don't care ! I don't care !\" She burst into hysterical sobs and rushed out, slamming the door. The two others did not move. He sneered: \"Well, say it.\" She answered slow ly: \"I have nothing to say.\" \"Listen, you might as well get used to it. You might as well get used to it that you can't have me. Because you can't have me. You won't have me. You won't have me long .\" \"Leo, what did the doctor say?\" He laughed: \"Plenty.\" \"What is it you have ?\" \"Noth ing. Not a thing.\" \"Leo !\" \"Not a thing-yet. But I'm going to have it.

In a few weeks-it will be too late.\" \"In a few weeks-he 'll have-tuber culo sis?\" \"Tuber culosis is a serious disease, citizen. In Soviet Rus­ sia-it is a fatal disease. It is strongly advisable to prevent it. If you let it start-you will not be likely to stop it.\" \"What ... does he need?\" \"Rest. Plenty of it. Sunshine . Fresh air. Food. Human food.

You 'll have to send him south.\""},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"WE THE LIVING 221 She did not answer; but the doctor smiled ironically, for he heard the answer without words and he looked at the patches on her shoes. \"If that young man is dear to you,\" he said, \"send him sout h. If you have a human possi bility-or an inhuman one-send him south.\" * Kira was very calm when she walked home. When she came in, Leo was standing by the window. He turned slowly. His face was so profoundly, serenely tranquil that he looked younger; he looked as if he had had his first night of rest; he asked quiet ly: \"Where have you been, Kira?\" \"At the doctor 's.\" \"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't want you to know all that.\" \"He told me.\" \"Kira, I'm sorry about last night. About that little fool. I hope you didn 't think that I ... \" \"Of course, 1 didn't. I understand .\" \"I think it's because 1 was frightened. But I'm not-now. Everything seems so much simpler-when there 's a limit set. . . . The thing to do now, Kira, is not to talk about it. Don't let's think about it. There 's nothing we can do--as the doctor probably told you. We can still be toge ther-for a while . When it becomes contagious-well ... \" She was watching him. Such was his manner of accepting his death sente nce. She said, and her voice was hard: \"Nonsense, Leo. You're going south.\" * In the first State hospital she visited, the official in charge told her: \"A place in a sanatorium in the Crimea? He's not a member of the Party ? And he's not a member of a Trade Union? And he's not a State employee? You're joking, citizen.\" In the second hospital, the officia l said: \"We have hun­ dreds on our waiting list, citizen . Trade Union members. Ad­ vanced cases .... No, we cannot even register him .\" In the third hospital, the officia l refused to see her. There were lines to wait in, ghastly lines of deformed creature s, of scars, and slings, and crutches, and open sores, and green, mucous patches of eyes, and grunts, and gro.an s, \\and-over a line of the living -the smell of the morgue .. \\ There were State Medical headqu arters to visit, long hours of waiting in dim, damp corridors that smelt of carbolic acid"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"222 AYN RAND and soiled linen. There were secretaries who forgot appoint­ ments , and assistants who said: \"So sorry, citizen. Next, please\" ; there were young executives who were in a hurry, and attendants who groaned: \"I tell you he's gone, it's after office hours , we gotta close, you can't sit here all night. \" At the end of the first two weeks she learned, as firmly as if it were some mystic absolute, that if one had cons umption one had to be a member of a Trade Union and get a Trade Union despatchment to a Trade Union Sanatorium. There were officials to be seen, names mentioned, letters of recommendation offered, begging for an except ion. There were Trade Union heads to visit, who listened to her plea with startled, ironic glances. Some laughed ; some shrugged; some called their secretaries to escort the visitor out; one said he could and he would, but he named a sum she could not earn in a year. She was firm, erect, and her voice did not tremble, and she was not afraid to beg. It was her mission, her quest, her cru­ sade. She wondered sometimes why the words: \"But he's going to die,\" meant so little to them, and the words: \"But he's not a registered worker, \" meant so little to her, and why it seemed so hard to expla in. She made Leo do his share of inquir ies. He obeyed with­ out arguing, without complaining, without hope . She tried everything she could. She asked Victor for help . Victor said with dignity : \"My dear cousin, I want you to re­ alize that my Party membership is a sacred trust not to be used for purpo ses of personal advanta ge.\" She asked Mari sha. Marisha laughed . \"With all our sana­ toriums stuffed like herring-barr els, and waiting lists till the next generation, and comrade workers rotting alive waiting­ and here he's not even sick yet! You don't realize reality, Cit­ izen Argouno va.\" She could not call on Andrei. Andrei had failed her. For several days after the date he had missed, she called on Lydia with the same question : \"Has Andrei Taganov been here? Have you had any letters for me?\" The first day, Lydia said: \"No .\" The second day, she gig­ gled and wanted to know what was this, a romance? and she'd tell Leo, and with Leo so handsome ! and Kira inter­ rupted patient ly: \"Oh, stop this rubbish, Lydia! It's impor­ tant. Let me know the minute you hear from him, will you?\""},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 223 Lydia did not hear from him. One evening, at the Dunae vs', Kira asked Victor casua lly if he had seen Andrei Taganov at the Institute . \"Sur e,\" said Victor, \"he's there every day.\" She was hurt. She was angry. She was bewild ered. What had she done? For the first time, she questioned her own be­ havior. Had she acted foolishly that Sunday in the country? She tried to remember every word, every gesture. She could find no fault. He had seemed happier than ever before. After a while, she decided that she must trust their friendship and give him a chance to explain. She telephoned him. She heard the old landlady 's voice yelling into the house : \"Comrade Taganov !\" with a positive inflection that implied his presen ce; there was a long pause; the landlady returned and asked: \"Who 's calling him?\" and before she had pronounced the last sylla ble of her name, Kira heard the landlady barking : \"He ain't home !\" and slamming her receiver. Kira slammed hers, too. She decid ed to forget Andrei Taganov. * It took a month, but at the end of a month, she was con- vinced that the door of the State sanatoriums was locked to Leo and that she could not unlock it. There were private sanatoriums in the Crimea. Private san­ atoriums cost money. She would get the money. She made an appointment to see Comrade Voronov and asked for an advance on her salary, an advance of six months- just enough to start him off. Comrade Voronov smiled faintly and asked her how she could be certain that she would be working there another month, let alone six. She called on Doctor Milovsk y, Vava's father, her wealthi­ est acquaintance, whose bank account had been celebrated by many envious whispe rs. Doctor Milov sky's face got very red and his short, pudgy hands waved at Kira hysterically, as if shooing off a ghost: \"My dear little girl, why, my dear little girl, what on earth made you think that I was rich or somet hing? Heh-heh. Very funny indeed. A capital ist or someth 'i n A -heh-heh, Why, we're just existing , from hand to mouth, liv;ing b y my own toil like proletarians one would say, barely exi sting, as one would say-that 's it-from hand to mout h.\""},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"224 AYN RAND She knew her parents had nothi ng. She asked if they could try to help . Galina Petrovna cried. She asked Vasili Ivanovitch. He offered her his last posses­ sion-Maria Petrovn a's old fur jacket. The price of the jacket would not buy a ticket to the Crimea. She did not take it. She knew Leo would resent it, but she wrote to his aunt in Berlin. She said in her letter: \"I am writing, because I love him so much-to you, because I think you must love him a little.\" No answer came . Through myst erious, stealthy whispe rs, more mysterious and stealthy than the G.P.U. who watched them sharply, she learned that there was private money to be lent, secretly and on a high percentage, but there was. She learned a name and an addr ess. She went to the booth of a private trader in a market, where a fat man bent down to her nervously across a counter loaded with red kerchiefs and cotton stocki ngs. She whispered a name . She named a sum. \"Busi ness?\" he breathed. \"Speculation?\" She knew it best to say yes. Well, he told her, it could be arranged. The rates were twenty-five per cent a month . She nodded eagerly. What security did the citizen have to offer? Security ? Surely she knew they didn't lend it on her good looks? Furs or diamonds would do; good furs and any kind of diamond s. She had nothing to offer. The man turned away as if he had never spoken to her in his life. On her way back to the tramway, through the narrow, mud­ dy passages between the market stalls, she stopped, startled; in a little prosperous-looking booth, behind a counter heavy with fresh bread loave s, smoked hams, yellow circles of but­ ter, she saw a familiar face: a heavy red mouth under a short nose with wide, vertical nostr ils. She remembered the train speculator of the Nikolaevsky station, with the fur-lined coat and the smell of carnation oil. He had progr essed in life. He was smiling at the customers, from under a fringe of salami. On her way home, she remembered someone who had said: \"I make more money than I can spend on myself. \" Did anything really matter now? She would go to the Institute and try to see Andrei . She changed tramways for the Institute. She saw Andrei. She saw him coming down the corridor and he was looking straight at her, so that her lips moved in a smile of greeting; but he turned abruptly and slammed the door of an audito­ rium behind him."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 225 She stood frozen to the spot for a long time.

So you're writing letters ? Who asked you to write?\" On the table, she saw an envelope with a German stamp . It was addr essed to Leo. \"What does she say, Leo?\" \"You want to know?

When a reduction of staffs came to the \"House of the Peasant\" and she saw her name among those dismissed as \"anti-social element,\" she was not surpri sed. It made no dif­ ference now. She spent most of her last salary to buy eggs and milk for Leo, which he would not touch. * In the daytime, Kira was calm, with the calm of an empty face, an empty heart, a mind empty of all thoughts but one. She was not afraid: becau se she knew that Leo had to go south, and he would go, and she could not doubt it, and so she had nothing to fear. But there was the night.

Its trees are rare strangers, sickly foreigners in a climate of granite, forlorn and super fluous . Its parks are reluctant con­ cessio ns. In spring , a rare dande lion sticks a bright yellow head through the stones of its embankments, and men smile at it incred ulously and condescendingly as at an impudent child. Its spring does not rise from the soil; its first violets , and very red tulip s, and very blue hyacinths come in the hands of men, on street corners . Petrograd was not born; it was created. The will of a man raised it where men did not choose to settle. An implacable emperor commanded into being the city and the ground under the city. Men brought earth to fill a swamp where no living thing existed but mosquitoes. And like mosquitoes, men died and fell into the grunting mire. No willing hands came to build the new capital. It rose by the labor of soldiers, thousands of soldiers, regiments who took orders and could not refuse to face a deadly foe, a gun or a swamp.

A golden cross on a small golden cupola rises to the clouds halfway down Nevsky, over the Anichkovsky palace, a bare red cube slashed by bare gray window s. And further, beyond the palace, a chariot raises to the clouds the black heads of its rearing horses, their hoofs hanging high over the street, over the stately columns of the Alexandrinsky theater. The palace looks like a barra cks; the theater looks like a palace. At the foot of the palace, Nev sky is cut by a stream, and a bridge arches over its swirling, muddy water. Four black statues stand at the four comers of the bridge. They may be only an accident and an ornamen t; they may be the very spirit of Petrograd, the city raised by man again st the will of nature. Each statue is of a man and a horse.

Cities grow with a people, and fight for the place at the head of cities, and rise slowly up the steps of years. Petrograd did not rise. It came to be at the height. It was commanded to command. It was a capital before its first stone was laid. It was a monument to the spirit of man. Peo p les know nothing of the spirit of man, for peoples are only nature, and man is a word that has no plural . Petrograd is not of the people. It has no legend, no folklore; it is not glorified in name less songs down namele ss roads. It is a stranger, aloof , incompreh ensible, forbidding . No pilgrims ever traveled to its granite gates.

The service had stood there for mont hs; no one could afford to buy it. Windows sparkled with foreign imitation jewelry-strings of flowered wax beads, earrings of bright celluloid circle s, the latest fashion, protected by a stupendous price from the wist ful women who stopped to admire them. In a street off Nev sky, a foreign book store had been open ed; a window two floors high flaunted the glos sy, radi­ ant, incredible covers of volumes that had come from across the border. Bright awnings spread over Nevsk y's wide, dry sidewalks , and barometers sparkled in the sun with the clear, piercing fire of clean glass.

On street comers , in the sun, ragged men sold saccharine and plaster busts of Leni n. Sparrows chirped on telephone wires. Lines stood at the doors of co-op erati ves; women took off their jackets and, in short-sleeved, wrinkled blouses, of­ fered flabby white arms to the first heat of the summer sun. A post er hung high on a wall . On the post er, a huge worker swung a hammer toward the sky, and the shadow of the hammer fell like a huge black cross over the little build­ ings of the city under his boots . Kira Argounova stopped by the poster to light a ciga rette. She took a paper box from the pocket of her old coat and, with two straight fingers , swiftly, without look ing, swung a cigarette into her mouth . Then she opened her old handbag of imitation leather and took out an expe nsiv e foreign lighter ingraved with her initia ls. She flick ed a brief little flanle, hurled a jet of smoke from the comer of her mouth and slammed the bag shut over the lighter. She jerked the frayed cuff of her coat sleeve and glanced at a sparkling watch on a narrow gold band. She swung forward; the high heels of her slippers rang hurriedly, resonantly down the granite side­ walk. Her slippers were patched; her legs displayed the tight, sheer luster of foreign silk stocking s. She walked toward an old palace that bore a red, five-pointed star over the entrance and an inscription in gold letters : DISTRICT CLUB OF THE ALL-UNION COMM UNIST PARTY Its glass door was severely, i!ll maculately polished, but the latch on its garden gate was broken. Weeds grew over what had been gravelled walks, and cigarette stubs rocked softly in an abandoned fountain, around a de jected marble cupid with a greenish patch of rust acro ss its stomach, at the dry mouth of an urn. Kira hurried down deserted walks, through a thick, ne­ glected green tangle that drowned the clatter of tramways outside ; blue pigeons fluttered lazily into the branches at the sound of her steps, and a bee rocked on a heavy purple tuft of clover. A giant regiment of oaks stood with arms out­ stretched, hiding the palace from the eyes of the street. In the depths of the garden stood a small two-storied wing linked to the palace by the bridge of a short gallery.

But on a window sill of the second floor lay a pile of books . The heavy, hand-carved door was not locked. Kira went in and swung impatiently up the long stairway. It was a very long stairway. It rose to the �econd floor in a straight line, an endle ss flight of bare stone steps, cracked and crumbling in little trails of gravel. The stairway had had a magnificent white balustrade; but the balust rade was broken; empty holes gaped over the jagged stump s of marble columns and their white bodies still lay at the foot of the stairs . Hollow echoes rolled against the wall s, against the murals of graceful white swans on blue lakes, of rose garlands, of sensual nymphs fleeing from grinning satyrs ; the murals were faded and cut by gashes of peeling plaster. Kira knocked at the door on the top of the stairs . Andrei Taganov opened it and stepped back, astoni shed ; his eyes widened in the slow, incredulous glance of a man looking at a miracle that could not become habitual; he for­ got to move, he stood before her, the colla r of a white shirt thrown open at his sunburnt throat. \"Kira !\" She laughed, a clear, metallic laughter: \"How are you, Andrei?\" His hands closed slowly , softly over her shoulders, so softly that she could not feel his hand s, only their strength, their will holding her, bending her backward; but his lips on hers were brutal, uncontrollable. His eyes were closed; hers were open, looking indifferently up at the ceiling . \"Kira, I didn't expect ' you till tonight .\" \"I know. But you wo n't throw me out, will you? \" She stepped aside, preceding him through the dim little lobby into his room, throwing her bag on a chair, her hat on a table, with imperious familiarity. She alone knew why Andrei Taganov had had to econo­ mize, that winter; why he had given up his room and moved into an abandoned wing of the palace, which the Party Club could not use and had given to him free of rent.

His magnificent furniture was gone ; but the wall s, the fireplace and the ceiling remained. The walls were covered with a whit e broc ade hand­ embroidered in delica te little wreaths of blue and silver leav es. A marble row of cupids with garlands and cornuco­ pias spouting frozen white flowers encircled the cornice. A marble Leda reclined volupt uously in the embrace of white wings over the fireplace.

Here, I brought you something to cheer you up.\" She took a small toy from her pocket, a glass tube that ended in a bulb filled with a red liquid in which a little black figure floated, trem bling . \"What 's that?\" She held the bulb in her closed fist, but the little figure did not move . \"I can't do it. You try. Hold it this way. \" She closed his fingers over the bulb . No expr ession, no movement of his told it to her, but she knew that he was not indiff erent to the touch of her fingers on his, that all of the past winter had not made him accustomed and indifferent. The red liquid in the sealed tube spurted up suddenly in fu­ rious, boiling bubbl es; the little black, homed figure jumped ecstatically up and down through the storm. \"See? They call it American Resident. I bought it on a street comer. Cute, isn't it?\" He smiled and watched the imp danc ing. \"Very cute .... Kira, why can't you come tonight?\" \"It's ... some business that I have to attend. Nothing im­ portant. Do you mind?\" \"No . Not if it's inconvenient for you .

You insisted on a new dress.\" The dress was red, very plain, very short, trimmed in black patent leather: a belt, four button s, a flat round collar and a huge bow. She stood, leaning against the door, slouching a little, suddenly very fragile and young, a child 's dress cling­ ing to a body that looked as helple ss and innocent as a child 's, her tangled hair thrown back, her skirt high over slender legs pressed closely together, her eyes round and can­ did, but her smile mocking and confident, her lips moist, wide .

He sat in the deep niche of the window sill and she stood beside him, in the tight circle of his arms. His face was ex­ pressio nless, and only his eyes laughed soundles sly, cried to her sound lessly what he could not say. Then he was talking, his face buried in the red dress: \"You know, I'm glad you came now, instead of tonight. There were still so many hours to wait. ... I've never seen you like this ....

What's the matter?\" But he was smiling again: \"Why don't you want me to think of you? Remember, last time you were here, you told me about that book you read with a hero called Andrei and you said you thought of me? I've been repeating it to myself ever since, and I bought the book.

He made himself say lightly, gaily, as an escape, rising: \"I have some­ thing for you, Kira. It was for tonight.

It was a small, flat bottle of real French perfume. She gasped. She wanted to protest. But she looked at his smile and she could only laugh happily: \"Oh, Andrei !\" His hand moved slowly in the air, without touching her, following the line of her neck, her breast, her body, cau­ tiously, attentively, as if modeling a statue. \"What are you doing, Andrei ?\" ''Trying to remember.\" \"What?\""},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 249 \"Your body.

I want you to give me the first drop- yourself. \" She drew him down to her side, on the bed. She asked: \"Where will you put it?\" His finger tips moist with the bewildering fragrance from another world, he pressed them timidly into her hair. She laughed defiantly: \"Where else?\" His finger tips brushed her li ps. \"Where else?\" His hand drew a soft line down her throat, stopping abruptly at the black patent leather collar.

She spread it out on the gray, faded satin cover of the bed and knelt by its side, caref ully smoothing every wrinkle of the paper. It had four words: a word for every two months past; she wondered how many days she had paid for every letter, she did not try to think of how many hours and of what the hours had been. But she remembered how many times she had cried to her­ self: \"It doesn 't matter. He'll come back-save d.\" It had be­ come so simple and so easy: if one could reduce one's life to but one desire-life could be cold, clear and bearable. Per­ haps others still knew that there were people, streets, and feeling s; she didn't; she knew only that he would come back saved. It had been a drug and a disinfectant; it had burned everything out and left her icy, limpid, smiling . There had been her room-suddenly grown so empty that she wondered, bewildered, how four walls could hold such an enormous void. There had been mornings when she awak­ ened to stare at a day as dim and hopeless as the gray square of snow clouds in the window, and it took her a tortured ef­ fort to rise; days when each step across the room was a con­ quest of will, when all the objects around her, the Primus, the cupboard, the table, were enemies screaming to her of what they had shared with her, of what they had lost. But Leo was in the Crimea where every minute was a ray of sunlight, and every ray of sunligh t-a new drop of life. There had been days when she fled from her room to peo­ ple and voices, and fled from the people, for she found her­ self suddenly still lonelier, and she fled to wander through the streets, her hands in her pockets, her shoulders hunched, watching the sleigh runners, the sparrows, the snow around the lights, begging of them something she could not name . Then she returned home, and lighted the \"Bourge oise,\" and ate a half-cooked dinner on a bare table, lost in a dim room, crushed under the huge sound of the logs crackling, the clock ticking on a shelf, hoofs crunching snow beyond the window. But Leo drank milk and ate fruit with skins bursting into fresh, sparkling juice. There had been nights when she buried her head under the blanket and her face in the pillow , as if trying to escape from her own body, a body burning with the touch of a stranger 's hands-in the bed that had been Leo's. But Leo was lying on a beach by the sea and his body was growing suntanned."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"252 AYN RAND There had been moments when she saw, in sudden aston­ ishment, as if she had not grasped it befor e, just what she was doing to her own body ; then she closed her eyes, for be­ hind that thought was another one, more frightening, forbid­ den: of what she was doing to another man's soul. But Leo had gained five pounds and the doctors were pleased. There had been moments when she felt as if she were ac­ tually seeing the downward movement of a smiling mouth, the swift, peremptory wave of a long, thin hand, seeing them for a second briefer than lightning, and then her every mus­ cle screamed with pain, so that she thought that she was not alone to hear it. But Leo wrote to her. She read his letters, trying to remember the inflection of his voice as it would pronounce each word. She spread the letters around her and sat in the room as with a living presence. He was coming back, cured, strong, saved . She had lived eight months for one telegram. She had never looked beyond it. Beyond the telegram, there was no future. * The train from the Crimea was late. Kira stood on the platform, motion less, looking at the empty track, two long bands of steel that turned to brass far away, in the clear, summer sunset beyond the terminal vaults. She was afraid to look at the clock and learn that which she had feared: that the train was hop elessly, indefinitely late. The platform trembled under the grating whee ls of a heavy baggage truck.

Far down at the end of the street, the sky was a flat band of bright, pure, motionless yellow , like the spilled yoke of an egg, and the street looked brown and wide in a warm twi­ light. She walked away slowly. She saw a familjar comer, passed it, then came back and swerved into another direc tion, tow ard the house of the Dunaev s. She had an evening that had to be filled. Irina opened the door. Her hair was wild, uncombed, but she wore a new dress of black and white striped batiste, and her tired face was powdered neatly. \"Well, Kira! Of all people ! What a rare surpr ise! Come in. Take your coat off. I h ave something-someone-to show you. And how do you like my new dress?\" Kira was laughing suddenly. She took off her coat: she wore a new dress of black and white striped batiste. Irina gasped: \"Oh ... oh, hell!

Kira noticed a frightened, pleading look in Irina's eyes. It was late when Kira and Sasha rose to go. He lived far on the other side of the city, but he offered to escort her home, for the streets were dark. He wore an old coat and he walked fast, slouching. They hurried together through a soft, transparent twilight, through the city full of the fragrance of a warm earth somewhere far under the pavements and cobblestones. \"Irina isn't happy,\" he said suddenly. \"No,\" said Kira, \"she isn't.

The job consi sted of sitting at home and waiting for a call from the Excursion Center. When they called, she hurried to the Museum and led a group of bewil­ dered people through the halls of what had been the Winter Palace. She received a few rubles for each excursion ; she was list ed as a Soviet employee by the Upravdom of her house; it saved her from an exorbitant rent and from the sus­ picion of being bourge ois.

Then the Excursion Center called her; she had to go. The halls of the Winter Palace displayed faded photo­ graphs of revolutiona ry leaders, yellowed proclamat ions, maps, diagrams, models of Czari st prisons, rusty guns, splin­ ters of leg irons. Thirty workers were waiting in the Palace lobby for the \"comrade guide .\" They were on vacation, but their Educational Club had arranged the excursion and they could not ignore its command.

She raised her hand and glanced at her wristwatch; her hand froze in midair; she remembered whose gift it was; she took the watch off and threw it into a drawer. She curled in an armchair by the window and tried to read a newspape r; the newspaper slipped to the floor; she sat sti ll, her head on her arm. It was an hour later that she heard steps behind the door, and the door was thrown open without a knock. The first thing she saw was a dusty suitcase. Then she saw the smile, the drooping lips arched over very white teeth in a tanned face. Th en she stood with the back of her hand at her mouth and could not move. He said: \"Allo, Kira. \" She did not kiss him. Her hands fell on his shoulders and moved down his arms, all her weight in her fing ers, for she was sagging suddenly and her face was sliding slowly down his chest, down the cloth of his coat; and as he tried to lift her head , she pressed her mouth to his hand an d hel d it; her sho ulders jerked; she was · sobbing. \"K ira, you little fool !\" He was laughing softly; his fingers caressed her hair; the fi ngers were trembli ng.

His face was tanned, his arms were strong, his · cheeks were not hollow any longer; but she noticed something in his eyes that had not been cured; something that, perhap s, had grown beyond cure.

III In the afternoon, three days later, the door bell rang and Kira went to answer it. She threw the door half-open, protected by a chain . On the stair-landing stood a heavy woman in a smart, expen sive overcoat. Her face, slanting back from a prominent, pointed chin, was raised with a studied movement of graceful in­ quiry, revealing a stout, white neck; her full lips, smeared with a violent magenta, were half-open, revealing strong white teeth. Her hand poised on a broad expanse of green silk scarf, she drawled in a self-con sciously gracious voice : \"Does Leo Kovalensky live here?\" Kira looked incredulously at the diamond rings sparking on the short, white fingers . She answered: \"Why ... yes.\" She did not remove the chain ; she stood staring at the woman. The woman said with a little accent of gentle firm­ ness: \"I want to see him.\" Kira let her enter. The woman looked at Kira curiously, in­ quisit ively, narrowing her eyes. Leo rose with a surprised frown when they entered the room. The woman extended both hands to him in a dramatic greeting. \"Leo ! So delig htful to see you again ! I've remem­ bered my threat to find you. I really intend to be a nuisan ce!\" Leo did not smile in answer to her expectant giggle ; he bowed graciousl y; he said: \"Kira, this is Antonina Pavlovna Platoshkina -Kira Alexandrovna Argounov a.\" \"Oh! ... Agr ounova ? . .. Oh ... \" said Antonina Pavlovna, as if noting the fact that Kira's name was not Leo's; she"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"WE THE LIVIN G 263 sounded almost relieved. She extended her arm, in a straight line, her fingers drooping, as if she were giving her hand to a man and expecting him to kiss it. \"Antonina Pavlovna and I were neighbors in the sanato­ rium,\" Leo explained. \"And he was a perfectly ungracious neighbor, I must com­ plain ,\" Antonina Pavlovna laughed huskily. \"He wouldn 't wait for me-and I wanted so much to leave on the same train. And, Leo, you didn't give me your apartment number and I had a perfectly terrible time trying to get it out of the Upravdom. Upravdoms are one of the unavoidable nuisa nces of our era, and all we of the intelligentsia can do is bear with it with a sense of humor.\" She took off her coat. She wore a plain black dress of new, expensive silk in the latest fashion, and foreign earrings of green celluloid circles. Her hair was combed back severely off her forehead and two trim, sleek coils were flattened against her cheeks smeared with a very white powder. Her hair was an incredible orange, the color of a magnificent string of amber that swung like a pendulum, striking her stomach, when she moved. Her dress fitted tightly, slanting sharply from very wide hips down to heavy legs with very thin ankles and very small feet that seemed crushed under their disproportionate burden. She sat down and her stomach settled in a wide fold over her lap. \"When did you return, Tonia?\" Leo asked. \"Yesterday. And oh, what a trip!\" she sighed. \"These So­ viet trains! Really, I believe I lost everything I accomplished in the sanatorium. I was taking a rest cure for my nerve s,\" she explained, pointing her chin at Kira. \"And what sensit ive person isn't a nervous wreck these days? But the Crime a! That place saved my life.\" \"It was beautif ul,\" Leo agreed. \"But, really, it lost all its charm after you left, Leo. You know, he was the most charming patient in that dull sanato­ rium and everybody admired him so much-oh, purely pla­ tonically, my dear, if you're worried,\" she winked at Kira. \"I'm not,\" said Kira. \"Leo was so kind as to help me with my French lesso ns.

Who among them knows the deeper significance of the spirit or the real mean­ ing of our lives?\" Leo's slow, faint smile was not one of understanding; but he said: \"One could forget one's troubles in some engrossing activity-if it were permitted these days.\" \"How profoundly true! Of course, the modem woman of culture is organically incapable of remaining inactive. 1 have a tremendous program outlined for myself for this coming winter. I'm going to study. 1 propose to mast er ancient Egypt .\" \"What?\" asked Kira. \"Ancient Egypt,\" said Antonina Pavlovna. \"I want to re­ capture its spirit in all its entirety.

However, you must not think me old-fashioned. You mustn 't be surprised if 1 tell you that I'm studying political economy : \" \"You are, Tonia?

Jagged wa lls of red bri cks, new and raw, checkered by a net of fre sh, white cement, rose to a gray sky darkening slowly in an early twilight. High against the cloud s, workers knelt on the wa lls, and iron hammers knocked, ringing sono­ rou sly over the street, and engines roared hoarsely, and steam whi stled somewhere in a tangled forest of plan ks, bea ms, scaffoldings splattered with lime. She stood watching, her eyes wide, her lips smiling. A young man, with a tanned face and a pipe in the comer of his mouth, walked swiftly up the narrow planks in the per ilous framework. and the movements of his hands were brusque, pre cise, implacable like the blows of a hammer. She did not know how long she had been standing there. She had forg otten all but the work before her. Then, suddenly, her world returning to her with a jolt, in a blinding second of cle ar, sharp perception-as if new eyes"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"324 AYN RAND were taking a first glance at a new world and saw it as she had forgotten to see it-she wondered, astonished, why she was not there, on the scaffolding, giving orders like the man with the pipe, what reason could pos sibly keep her from her work, her life work, her only desire. It was one swif t second, so swif t that she felt it only after it was over; and after it was over, she saw the world again as she had grown accustomed to see it, and she remembered why she was not on the scaf­ folding, what reason had closed to her, forever, the only work she wa nted. And in her mind, four words filled the void she felt rising from somewhere in her breast: \"Perhaps ... Some day ... Abroad ... \" A hand touched her shoulder: \"What are you doing here, citizen?\" A militia- man was staring suspiciously down at her. He wore a peaked khaki cap, with a red star, over a low fore­ head. He squinted, opening sof t lips that had no shape, like pillow s: \"You have been standing here for half an hour, cit­ izen. What do you want?\" \"Nothin g,\" said Kira. \"Well, then, on your way, citizen .\" \"I was just looking ,\" said Kira. \"You,\" decreed the militia-man, opening lips shap eless as pillow s, \"have no business looking .\" She turned silently and walked away. Against her skin, sewn on to her skirt, a little pocket was growing thicker, slowly , week by week. She kept in it the money she managed to save from Leo 's reck less spendi ng. It was a foundation rising for their future and perhaps-some day-abroad .... She was retur ning home from a meeting of excursion guid es. There had been a political examination at the Excur­ sion Center. A man with a close- cropped head had sat at a broad desk, and trem bling, white-lipped guides had stood be­ fore him, one after the other, answering questions in jerking, unnaturally bright voice s. Kira had recited adequately the ap­ propriate sounds about the importance of historical excur­ sions for the political education and class -consciousness of the working mass es; she had been able to answer the ques­ tion about the state of the latest strike of textile workers in Great Britain; she had known all about the latest decree of the Commi ssa r of People 's Education in reg ard to the Schools for the Illiterates of the Turkestan; but she could not"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 325 name the latest amount of coal produced by the mines of the Don basin. \"Do n't you read the newspapers , comrade?\" the examining official had asked sternly. \"Yes, comrade .\" \"I would suggest that you read them more thoroughly. We do not need limited specia list s and old-fashioned academi­ cians who know nothing outside their narrow prof essio ns. Our modern educators must be politically enlig htened and show an active interest in our Soviet reality, in all th.e deta ils of our state const ruction .... Next !\" She might be dismissed, Kira thought indifferently, walk­ ing home . She would not worry. She could not worry any longer. She would not allow herself to reach the state of Comrade Nest erova, an elderly guide who had been a school teacher for thirty yea rs. Comrade Nest erova, between exc ur­ sions, school clas ses, clu bs, and coo king for a para lyzed mother, spent all her time reading the new spape rs, memoriz­ ing every item word for word, preparing herself for the ex­ amination. Comrade Nesterova needed her job badly. But when she had stood before the examiner, Comrade Nesterova had not been able to utter a word; she had opened her mouth senseless ly, without a sound, and collapsed suddenly, shriek­ ing, in hyst erical tea rs; she had had to be carried out of the room and a nurse had been called. Comrade Nest ero va's name had been crossed off the list of excursion guid es. Kira had forgotten the examination by the time she reached her house : she was thinking of Leo; she was wonder­ ing how she would find him that evening. The quest ion arose, with a small twi st of anxiety, every time she came home late and knew that she would find him there. He would leave in the morning, smiling and cheerful and brisk with en­ ergy; but she never knew what to expect at the end of the day. Sometime s she found him reading a foreign book, barely answering her greet ing, ref using to eat, chuc kling coldly once in a while at the bright lines of a world so far from their own . Sometimes she found him drunk, staggering acr oss the room, laughing bitterly, tearing banknotes before her eyes when she spoke of the money he had spent. Sometimes she found him disc ussi ng art with Antonina Pavlovna, yawning, talking as if he did not hear his own wor ds. Sometimes­ rarely-he smiled at her, his eyes young and clear as they had been long ago, on their first meet ings, and he pressed"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"326 AYN RAND money into her hand, whisper ing: \"Hide it from me .... For the escape . For Europe .... We 'll do it . .. some day ... if you can keep me from thinking ... until then .... If we can onl y keep from thinking .... \" She had learned to keep from think ing ; she remembered only that he was Leo and that she had no life beyond the sound of his voice, the movements of his hands, the lines of his body-and that she had to stand on guard between him and the something imme nse, unnameable which was moving slowly tow ard him, which had swallowed so many. She would stand on gua rd; nothing else matter ed; she never thought of the past; the future-no one around her thought of the future. She never thought of Andr ei; she never allowed herself to wonder what ihe days, perhaps the years, ahead of them would have to be. She knew that she had gone too far and could not retreat. She was wise enough to know that she could not leave him; she was brave enough not to attempt it. In averting a blow he would not be able to stand, she was paying him, si­ lently, for what she had done. Some day, she felt dimly, she would have to end the payment; the day when, perhaps, a pas­ sage abroad would open for Leo and her; then she would end it without hesit ation, since Leo would need her; then Leo would be safe; nothing else mattered. \"Kira?\" a gay voice called from the bathroom, when she entered their room. Leo came out, a towel in his hand, naked from the waist up, shaking drops of water off his face, throwing tangled hair off his forehead, smiling . ''I'm gla d you'r e back, Kira. I hate to come home and not find you her e.\" He looked as if he had just stepped out of a stream on a hot summer day, and one could almost see the sun sparkling in the drops of water on his shoulde rs. He moved as if his whole body were a living will, straight, arrogant, command­ ing, a will and a body that could never bend because both had been born without the capacity to conceive of bending . She stood still, afraid to approach him, afraid to shatter one of the rare moments when he looked what he could have been, what he was intended to be. He approached her and his hand closed over her throat and he jer ked her head back to hold her lips to his. There was a contempt uous tende rness in his movement, and a command,"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"WE THE LIV ING 327 and hunger; he was not a lover, but a slave owner. Her arms holding him, her mouth drinking the glist ening drops on his skin, she knew the answer, the motive for all her days, for all she had to bear and forget in those days, the only motive she need ed. * Irina came to visit Kira, once in a while, on the rare eve- nings she could spa re from her wor k at the Club . Irina laughed sonorou sly, and scattered cigarette ashes all over the room, and related the late st, most dangerous political anec­ dot es, and drew caricatures of all their acquaintances on the white table cloth. But on the evenings when Leo was busy at the store, when Kira and Irina sat alone at a lighted fireplace, Irina did not always laugh. Sometime s, she sat sile ntly for long minutes and when she raised her head and looked at Kira, her eyes were bewil dered, pleading for help . Then she whispe red, looking into the fire: \"Kira, I ... I'm afraid .... I don't know why, it's only at tim es, but I'm so afraid .... Wha t's going to happen to all of us?

It was a dark October evening and the little hand that seized his coat belt seemed to have shot suddenly out of no­ where. Then he distinguish ed a shawl thrown over a little head and a pair of eyes staring up at him, huge, unblinking, terrified. \"Citizen Chernov,\" the girl whispered, her trembling body pressed to his legs, stopping him, \"don 't go home .\" He recognized his neighbor 's daughter. He smiled and pat­ ted her head, but, instinctively, stepped aside, into the shadow of a wall . \"Wha t's the matter, KatiaT \"Mother said ... \" the girl gulped, \"mother said to tell you not to come home ....

He fro wned ; tomorrow the proclamations would have been dist ributed into countle ss hands in Petrograd 's factor ies. He jumped into a tramway and rode to another friend 's hou se. Turning the comer, he saw a black limous ine at the door. He hurried away. He rode to a railroad terminal and telephoned again, a dif­ ferent number. No one answe red. He walked , shuffling through a heavy slush, to another ad­ dress. He saw no light in the window of his friend 's room . But he saw the janitor 's wife at the back yard gate , whi sper­ ing excit edly to a neighbor. He did not approach the hou se. He blew at his frozen, glove less hand s. He hurried to one more addr ess. There was a light in the window for which he was looking . Bu t on the window sill stood a vase of peculia r shape and that had been the danger signal agreed upon . He took another tramway. It was late and the tramway was almost empty ; it was ligh ted too brightly. A man in a mili tary tunic entered at the next stop. Sasha got out. He leaned against a dark lamp post and wiped his fore­ head . His forehead was burning with a sweat colder than the melting snow drop s. He was hurrying down a dark street when he saw a man in an old derby hat strolling casually on the other side . Sasha turned a comer, and walked two blocks, and turned again, and walked a block, and turned once more. Then he looked cautiou sly over his shoulder. The man in the old derby was studying the window of an apothecary shop three hou ses be­ hind him. Sasha walked faster. A gray snow fluttered over yellow lights over closed gat es. The street was deserted. He heard no sound but that of his own steps crunching mud. But through the sounds, and through the dist ant grating of wheel s, and through the muffled, rumbling, rising knocks somewhere in his chest, he heard the shuffling , soft as a breath, of steps following him. He stopped short and looked back. The man in the derby was bending to tie a shoe lace. Sasha looked up. He was at the door of a house he knew well . It took the flash of a sec­ ond.

It was stretched, stuf fed full, bursting with crisp new bill s.

She looked at Kira and shook her head wisely , very sadly, and muttered: \"Thank you, child .... \" When she had gone, Kira tried on the wedding gown. It was long and plain as a medieval garment; its tight sleeves were low over the backs of her hand s; its tight colla r was high under her chin ; it was all lace with no ornaments of any kind. She stood before a tall mirror, her arms at her sid es, palms up, her head thrown back, her hair tumbling down on her white shoulders, her body sudde nly tall and too thin , frag ile in the long, solemn folds of a lace delica te as a cobweb . She loo ked at herself as at a strange figure from some where many centuries away. And her eyes seemed suddenly very large, very dark, frighten ed. She took the dress off and threw it into a comer of her wardrobe. Leo came home with Antonina Pavlovna. She wore a seal­ skin coat and a turban of violet satin.

He took Antonina Pavlov na's arm with a gest ure that be­ longed in a foreign film scene, and they left. When the door had closed behind them in Lavr ov's room, Kira hea rd Lavr ov's wife grunting: \"And they say private traders don 't make no money.\" \"Dictatorship of the Proletariat !\" Lavrov growled and spat loudly.

She saw him on ce, unexpectedly, at a Party meeting. He explained hurriedly that he could not come home with her, for he had to take the midnight train back to the con­ struction site. She said nothing, even though she knew that there was no midnight train. She had developed a tendency to be too silent. At the Komsomol meet ings, she made her reports in a strident, in­ different voice. When caught off guard, she sat staring va­ cantly ahead, her eyes puzz led. She was left alone in the big, empty rooms of the Dunaev apartment. Victor had talked intimately to a few influential officia ls, and no tenants had been ordered to occupy their va­ ca nt roo ms. But the silence of the apartment fri ghtened Marisha, so she spent her evenings with her family, in her old room, next to Kira' s. When Marisha appeared, her mother sighed and muttered some complaint about the rations at the co-operative, and bent silently over her mending. Her father said: \"Goo d eve­ ning,\" and gave no fu rther sign of noticing her presence. Her little brother said: \"You here again?\" She had nothing to say. She sat in a corner behind the grand piano, reading a book until late at night; then she said: \"Gue ss I'l l be going, \" and went home . One eveni ng, she saw Kira cr os sing the room hurriedly on her way out. Marisha leaped to her feet, smiling eagerly, hopefully, although she did not know why, nor what she hoped for, nor whether she had anything to say to Kim. She made a timid step forward and stopped: Kira had not noticed her and had gone out.

It grew by Petrograd 's sidewalks in craggy mountain ranges, veined with thin, black threads of soot, spotted with brown clods and ciga rette stub s and green­ ish, fading rags of newspapers . Bu t under the walls of the ho uses, snow grew slow ly, undis tur bed, sof t, white, bil­ lowing, pure as cotton, rising to the top panes of basement window s. Above the streets, window sills hung as white, overloaded she lves. Cornices sparkled, trimmed with the glass lace of long icicl es. Into an icy, summer-blue sky little billows of pink smoke rose slowly, melting like petals of apple blos­ soms . High on the roofs, snow gathered into menacing white walls behind iron raili ngs. Men in heavy mittens swung shovels high over the city and hurled huge, frozen white clods, as rocks, down to the pavements below ; they crashed wit h a dull thud and a thin white cloud . Sleighs whirled sharply to avoid them; hungr y sparr ows, their fe athers fluffed, scattered from under the muffled, thumping hoofs. On street comers, huge cauldrons stood encased in boxes of unpainted boards. Men with shovels swung the snow up into the cauldrons, and narr ow streams of dirty water gurgled from under the furnaces, running by the curb, long black threads cutting white streets. At night, the furnaces blazed open in the dark ness, little purplish-orange fires low over the ground, and ragged men slipped out of the night, bending to extend frozen hands into the red glow. Kira walked sound lessly through the palace garden.

Tree trunks stood bare, black and dead like telegraph pole s.

She rose slowly up the long marble stairway. There w,a s no light; her foot searched uncertainly for every fro zen, slippery step .

His head was propped on his elbow, his fingers on the nape of his broad neck; he had a glass in his other hand.

His stomach shook, and his rabbit fur colla r, and the sinews of his bare throat. He swayed a little and he held the letter in both hands. Then his laughter died down slowly, smoothly, like a gramophone rec­ ord unwinding, to a low, coughing chuckle on a single dry note.

The office was in a part of the G.P .V. headquart ers ' build­ ing which no visit ors ever approached and into which few employees were ever admitted. Those who were admitted spoke in low, respectful voices and never felt at ease. The executive sat at his desk. He wore a military tunic, tight breeche s, high boots and a gun on his hip. He had close-c ropped hair and a clean-shaved face that betrayed no age . When he smiled, he showed short teeth and very wide, brownish gums . His smile betrayed no mirth, no meaning; one knew it was a smile only beca use the muscles of his cheeks creased and his gums showed. He sa id : \"Comrade Taganov, I understand yo u'v e been conducting some investigations in a case which comes under the jurisdiction of the Economic Section .\" Andrei said : \"I have .\" \"Who gave you the authority to do it?\" Andrei said : \"My Party card .\" The executive smiled, showing his gums, and ask ed : \"What made you begin the investigation ?\" \"A piece of incriminating eviden ce.\" \"Aga inst a Party member?\" \"Y es.\" \"Why didn 't you tum it over to us?\" \"I wanted to have a complete case to report.\""},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"390 \"Have you?\" \"Yes.\" AY N RAN D \"You intend to report it to the chief of your department?\" \"Yes.\" The executive smiled and said: \"I suggest that you drop the entire matter.\" Andrei said: \"If this is an order, I'll remind you that you are not my chief.

The chief was a tall , thin man with a pointed blond beard and a gold pince-nez on a high, thin nose. He wore the expen­ sive, blondish-brown suit of a foreign tour ist; he had the long, knotty hands of a skeleton and the appearance of an un­ succe ssf ul college prof esso r. \"Sit down ,\" said the chief, and rose, and closed the door. Andrei sat down . \"Congratulations, Comrade Taganov,\" said the chief. Andrei inclined his head. \"You have done a valuable piece of work and rendered a great service to the Party, Comrade Taganov. You could not have chosen a better time for it. You have put into our hands just the case we needed.

A short, sharp move­ ment of Andrei 's hand, brusque and imperious as ' a lash, made one of the soldiers remain stationed at the door. The others followed Andrei into Leo 's room. Leo was alone. He sat in a deep armchair by the lighted fire place, in his shirt sleeve s, reading a book. The book was the first thing to move when the door was flung open ; it de­ scended slowly to the arm of the chair and a steady hand closed it. Then, Leo rose unhurriedly, the glow of the fire flickering on the white shirt on his straight shoulders. He said, smiling, his smile a scornful arc: \"W ell, Comrade Taganov, did n't you know that some day we would meet like this?\" Andrei 's face had no expr ession. It was set and motionless like a pas sport photograph; as if lines and mu scles were hardened into something which had no human mea ning, something which was a human face in shape only. He handed to Leo a paper bearing official stam ps; he said, in a voice which was a human voice only because it made sounds that wer e of the human alpha bet: \"Sea rch wa rran t, Cit izen Kovalensky. \" \"Go ahead,\" said Leo, bowing sternly, graciously, as if to a guest at a formal reception. \"You 're quite welcome .\" Two swift movements of Andrei 's hand sent one soldier to a chest of drawers and the other to the bed. Drawers clattered open; white stacks of underwear fell to the floor, from under huge, dark fists that dug swiftly, expertly and slammed the drawers shut with a bang, one afte r the other. A white pile grew on the floor, around black boots glist ening with melting snow. A quick hand ripped the satin cover off the bed, then the quilt and the sheets; the thrust of a bayonet split the mat­ tress open and two fists disa ppeared in the cut. Andrei opened the drawers of a desk. He went through them swif tly, mechanically, his thumb running the pages of books in a quick, fan-shaped whirl, with a swi shing rustle like the shuffling of a pack of car ds; he threw the books aside, gathering all notes and letters, shoving them into his brief case.

Thousands of human bodies marched gravely, flaming banners raised high in a last salute . Soldiers of the Red Army came as khaki ramparts, row af­ ter row of straight, husky shoulders, of boots firm and steady in the snow, of peaked caps with a red star on each for ehead, and over them-a red banner with gold letters : GLORY ETERNAL TO A FALLEN COMRADE"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"430 AYN RAND Wo rkers of the Putilovsky factory came in gray, unbroken ranks, moving slowly under a red banner held high in sturdy fi sts: HE CAME FROM THE WORKERS ' RANKS HE GAVE HIS LIFE TO THE WORKERS OF THE WORLD.

Snowflakes fluttered down lazily, once in a while, to melt on indif ferent, moving forehead s. An open coffin was carried at the head of the proce ssion. The coffin was red. A banner of scarlet, regal velvet was draped over a still body ; a white face lay motionless on a red pillow, a clear, sharp profile swimming slowly past the gray walls, black strands of hair scattered on the red cloth, black strands of hair hiding a dark little hole on the right temple. The face was calm. Snowflakes did not melt on the still, white forehead. Four honorary pall-bearers, his best Party comrades, carried the coffin on their shoulders. Four bowed heads were bared to the cold. The coffin seemed very red between the blond hair of Pavel Syerov and the black curls of Victor Dunaev. A military band followed the coffin. The big brass tubes were trimmed with bows of black crepe. The band played \"You fell as a victim.\" Many years ago, in secret cellars hidden from the eyes of the Czar's gendarmes, on the frozen roads of Siberian prison camps, a song had been born to the memory of those who had fallen in the fight for freedom. It was sung in muffled, breathl ess whispers to the clanking of chains, in honor of namel ess heroe s. It traveled down dark sidelane s; it had no author, and no copy of it had ever been printed. The Revo­ lution brought it into every music store window and into the roar of every band that followed a Communi st to his grave. The Revolution brought the \"Intemationale\" to its living and \"You fell as a victim\" to its dead . It became the official fu­ neral dirge of the new republic. The toilers of Leningrad sang solemnly, marching behind the open red coffin: \"Y ou fe ll as a victim In our fa tefu l fight, A victim of endless devotion. Yo u gave all you had to the people you loved, Yo ur honor, your lif e and your fre edom. \" The music began with the majesty of that hopele ssness which is beyond the need of hope.

Her hands hung limply by her sides; above the heavy woolen mitten s, her wrists were bare to the cold, frozen to a dark, purp lish red. Her face had no expr ession; her eyes had: they seemed astonished. Those marching around her paid no attention to her. But at the start of the demonst ration, someone had noticed her. Comrade Sonia, leading a detachment of women workers from the Zhenotdel, had hurried past to take her place at the head of the proce ssion, where she had to carry a banner; Comrade Sonia had stopped short and chuckled aloud: \"Re­ ally, Comrade Argounova, you-here?

Before the revolution, it had been called the Field of Mars and long ranks of gray uniforms had crossed it in military drills. The revolution had erected a small square of rose granite slabs, a little island lost in the center of the Field.

He came from the toilers' ranks. His childhood was spent at the proletarian work bench . He and I, we grew up together, and toget her we shared the long years of toil in the Putilovsky factory. We joined the Party together, long before the Revolution, in those dark days when a Party card was a ticket to Siberia or a mark for the Czar's hangman 's noose.

Thousands of us are gathered here to honor one man . But one man means nothing in the face of the mighty Proletarian Collective, no matter how worthy his achievements.

Then another face rose over the crowd, a thin, consumpt ive, unshaved face that wore glasses and opened a pale mouth wide, coughing words which no one could hear. Then another mouth spoke, and it could be heard far beyond the crowd, a mouth that bellowed sonorously through a thick, black beard. A freckled boy from the Comm unist Union of Youth spoke, stuttering, scratching his head. A tall spinster in a crumpled, old-fashioned hat spoke ferociously, opening her small mouth as if she were at the dent ist's, shaking her thin finger at the crowd as at a school-room of disobedient pupi ls. A tall sailor spoke, his fists on his hips, and those in the back rows laughed occasionally when they heard the front rows laughing, even though the words did not reach them. Thou sands stood, fidgeting nervously, knocking their heels together to keep them warm, burying their hands in their armpi ts, in their sleeve s, in their fur lapels, breathing little wet icicles on the old scarfs high under their noses.

The voice of the last speaker had died, smothered in the thick mist of frost which one could not see, but felt flowing down heavily from the dark ness above. The red coffin had been closed and had disappeared in the earth, and the grave had been filled, and a slab of red granite had risen over it.

She had several weeks to wait for an answer. Galina Petrovna moaned: \"It's insanity, Kira ! Sheer insan­ ity! In the first place, they won't give it to you. You have no reasons to show why you want to go abroad, and with your father 's socia l past and all .... And even if you do get the passp ort-then what? No foreign country will admit a Rus­ sian and I can't say that I blame them. And if they admit you-what are you doing to do? Have you thought of that?\" \"No,\" said Kira. \"You have no money. You have no profession.

He whispered: \"Kira ... don't .. . \" But she knew it was only a last convulsion and she said: \"I won't.\" He kissed her and her lips were soft and tender and yield­ ing to hi s. Then he went. * She had several weeks to wait. In the evening s, Alexander Dimitrievitch came home from work and shook snow off his galoshes in the lobby, and wiped them carefully with a special rag, for the galoshes were new and expen sive . After dinner, when he had no meeting to attend, he sat in a comer with an unpainted wooden screen frame and worked patiently, pasting match box labels on the fram e. He col­ lected the labels and guarded them jealously in a locked box . At night, he spread them cautiou sly on the table, and moved them slowly into patter ns, trying out color combinat ions. He had a whole panel completed, and he muttered, squinting at it apprai singly : \"It's a beauty. A beauty. I bet no one in Petrograd has anything like it. What do you think, Kira, shall I use two yellow ones and a green one in this comer, or just three yellow s?\" She answered quiet ly: \"The green one will be nice, Fa­ ther.\" Galina Petrovna thundered in, at night, and flung a heavy brief case on a chair in the lobby.

Oh, it doesn 't have to be a real steak, just papier-mache .. � .\" Galina Petrovna ate her dinner hurriedly, reading the eve­ ning paper. She jumped up, looking at the clock, before she had finished, dabbed a smear of powder on her nose and, seizing her brief case, rushed out again to a Council meeting. On the rare evenings when she stayed at home, she spread books and newspaper clippings over the dining-room table, and sat writing a thesis for her Marxist Club. She asked, rais­ ing her head, blinking absent-mindedly: \"Kira, do you hap­ pen to know, the Paris Commune, what year was that?\" \"Eighteen seventy-one, Mother,\" Kira answered quietly. Lydia worked at night. In the daytime, she practiced the \"Internationale\" and \"You fell as a victim\" and the Red Cav­ alry song on her old grand piano that had not been tuned for over a year. When she was asked to play the old classics she loved, she refused flatly, her mouth set in a thin, foolish, stubborn line. But once in a while, she sat down at the piano suddenly and played for hours , fiercely, violently, without stopping between piece s; she played Chopin and Bach and Tchaikovsky, and when her fingers were numb she cried, sobbing aloud in broken hiccoug hs, senseles sly, monoto­ nously , like a child. Galina Petrovna paid no attention to it, saying : \"Just another one of Lydia's fits.\" Kira was lying on her mattre ss on the floor, when Lydia came home from work. Lydia took a long time to undress and a longer time to whisper endless prayers before the ikons in her corner. Some evening s, she came over to Kira and sat down on the mattr ess, and shivering in the dark ness, in her long white nightgown, her hair falling in a thick braid down her back, whispered confidentially, a ray of the street lamp beyond the window falling on her tired face. with swollen eyes and dry little wrinkles in the corners of the mouth, on her dry, knotty hands that did not look young any longer: \"I had a vision again, Kira, a call from above.

Only through suf fering and long­ bearing patience shall we become worthy of the Kingdom of Heaven .\" Kira said quiet ly: \"I won't tell anyone, Lydia. And now you'd better go to bed, because you're tired and it's so cold her e.\" In the daytime, Kira led excursions through the Museum of the Rev olut ion. In the evening, she sat in the dining room and read old books . She spoke seldom . When anyone ad­ dressed her, she answered evenly, quietly. Her voice seemed frozen on a single note . Galina Petrovna wished, unco mfort­ ably, to see her angry, at least onc e; she did not see it.

But there was a flicker of life in her eyes when , on her way home from the Excursion Center, she stopped at the window of a foreign book store on Liteiny, and stood looking thoughtfully at the bright covers with gay, broken, fore ign letters, with chorus girls kicking long, glistening legs, with columns and searchlights and long, black automo biles. There was a jerk of life in her fingers when, every evening, as me­ thodically as a bookkeeper, with a dull little stub of a penc il, she crossed another date off an old calendar on the wall over her mattr ess. * The foreign passport was refused.

Vava Milovskaia came to buy the dresses. Vava waddled in, shuffling heavily in worn-out felt boots. Va va's dress had a greasy patch across the chest, and her matted hair looked un­ co mbed. Her face was puff ed, a coarse white powder had dried in patches on her nose , and her eyes were encircled in heavy blue bags. When she took off her clothes, slowly, awk­ wardly, to try on the dresses, Lydia noticed the swelling at her once slender waistline. \"Vava, darling !

She took it secretly to a tailor and ordered it made into a coat. The coat came out as a short jacket that did not reach down to her knees. She would need a white dress. She could not buy one. But she still had Galina Petr ovna 's white lace wedding gown. When she was alone at home, she took her old felt boots into the kitchen and painted them white with lime . She bought a pair of white mittens and a white woolen scarf. She bought a ticket to a town far out of the way, far from the Latvian bor­ der. When everything was ready, she sewed her little roll of money into the lining of the white fur jacket. She would need it there-if she crossed the border. On a gray winter afternoon , she left the house when no one was at home. She did not say good-b ye. She left no let­ ter. She walked down the stairs and out into the street as if she were going to the comer store . She wore an old coat with a matted fur collar. She carried a small suit case. The suitcase contained a white fur jacket, a wedding gown, a pair of boots, a pair of mittens, a scarf. She walked to the stat ion.

The wheels tapped like an iron clock ticking swif tly, knocking off seconds and minutes and mil es. Kira Argounova sat on a wooden bench by the window. She had her suitcase on her lap and held it with both hand s, her fingers spread wide apart. Her head leaned back against the wooden seat and trembled in a thin little shudder, like the dust y glass pane . Her lids drooped heavily over her eyes fixed on the window. She did not close her eyes . She sat for hours without moving, and her muscles did not feel the im­ mobility, or she did not feel her muscles any longer. Beyond the window, nothing moved in the end less stretches of snow but black smears of telegraph pole s, as if the train were suspended, stationa ry, between two slices of white and gray, and the wheel s shrieked as if grating in a void. Once in a while, a white blot on a white desert, a blot with black edges shaped as fir branches, sprang up suddenly beyond the window and whirled like lightning across the pane . When she remembered that she had not eaten for a long time, dimly uncertain whether it was hours or days, dimly conscious that she had to eat, even though she had forg otten hunger, she broke a chunk off a stale loaf of bread, which she had bought at the station, and chewed it slowly, with effort, her jaws moving monotonously, like a machine. Around her, men left the car, when the train stopped at sta­ tions, and came back with steaming tea kett les. Once, some­ one put a cup into her hand s, and she drank, the hot tin edge pressed to her lips.

She slept, sitting in her comer, her head on her arms, her arms on her suitcase. She tied the suitcase handle to her wrists, with a piece of string, at night. There were many moans around her about stolen luggage. She slept, her con­ sciousness frozen on a single thought-of her suitcase. She awakened with a jolt whenever the motion of the car made the suitcase slip a little. She had no thoughts left. She felt empty, clear and quiet, as if her body were only an image of her will, and her will­ only an arrow, tense and hard, pointing at a border that had to be crossed. The only living thing she felt was the suitcase on her lap. Her will was knocking with the wheels of the train. Her heart beat there, under the floor. She noticed dimly, once, on the bench before her, a woman pressed a cold white breast into a child's lips. There still were people and there still were lives. She was not dead. She was only waiting to be born. At night, she sat for hours, staring at the window. She could see nothing but the dim reflection of the candle-glow and benches and boarded walls shuddering in space, and the tousled shadow of her own head. There was no earth, no world beyond the window. Only far down, by the track, yel­ low squares of snow raced the train in the glow of the win­ dows, and black clots whirled past as long, thin streaks. Once in a while , a spark of light pierced the dark ness, somewhere far away, at the edge of the sky, and brought suddenly into existence a blue waste of snow beyond the glass. The light died and the earth went with it, leaving nothing in the win­ dow but the boarded walls and the candle and the tousled head. There were stations where she had to get out, and stand at a ticket window on a windswept platform, and buy a new ticket, and wait for another train to come rushing through the dusk, a black engine spewing showers of red sparks. Then there were wheels again, knocking under the floor, and another station, and another ticket, and another train. There were many days and nights, but she did not notice them. The men in khaki peaked caps, who examined the tick­ ets, could not know that the girl in the old coat with the mat­ ted fur collar was going toward the Latvian border. The last station, where she did not buy another ticket, was"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"454 AY N RA ND a dark little platform of rotted wooden planks, the last stop before the train's terminal, before the border town. It was getting dark. Brown wheel-tracks in the snow led far away into a glowing red patch. A few sleepy soldiers on the platform paid no attention to her. A large wicker hamper rattled as husky fists lowered it to the ground from a baggage car. At the station door, someone begged loudly for hot wa­ ter: Lights twinkled in the car window s. She walked away, clutching her suitcase, following the wheel tracks in the snow. She walked, a slender black figure, leaning faintly back­ ward, alone in a vast field rusty in the sunset. It was dark when she saw the village houses ahead and yel­ low dots of candles in windows low over the ground. She knocked at a door. A man opened it; his hair and beard were a bushy blond tangle from which two bright eyes peered in­ quisitively. She slipped a bill into his hand and tried to explain as fast as she could, in a choked whisper. She did not have to explain much. Those in the house knew and understood. Behind a low wooden partition, her feet in the straw where two pigs slept huddled together, she changed her cloth es, while those in the room sat around a table, as if she were not present, five blond hea ds, one of them in a blue kerchief. Wooden spoons knocked in the wooden bowls on the table, and the sound of another spoon came from the shelf of a brick stove in the comer, where a gray head bent, sighing, over a wooden bowl. A candle stood on the table, and three little red tongues flickered before a bronze triangle of ikons in a comer, little glimmers of red in the bronze halos. She put on the white boots and took off her dress; her na­ ked arms shuddered a little, even though the room was hot and stuffy. She put on the white wedding gown, and its long train rustled in the straw, and a pig opened one slit of an eye. She lifted the train and pinned it carefully to her waistline, with big safety -pins. She wound the white scarf tightly about her hair, and put on the white fur jacket. She felt cautiously the little lump in the lining over her left breast, where she had sewn the bills; it was the last and only weapon she would need.

Silently, the man put a steaming wooden bowl before the guest. \"No, thank you,\" she said. \"I'm not hungry.\" \"Eat,\" he ordered. \"You 'll need it.\" She ate obediently a thick cabbage soup that smelled of hot lard. The man said suddenly in the silence, without looking at her: \"It's pretty near a whole night 's walk.\" She nodded. \"Pretty young ,\" said the woman across the table, shaking her head, and sighed.

The sky hung low, in grayish patches, and black patches, and streaks of a blue that one could never remember in the daytime; and blots of something which was not a color and not quite a light ray, flowed from nowhere, trickling once in a while among the clouds, and she bent her head not to see it. There were no lights ahead; she knew that the lights be­ hind her had long since vanished, even though she did not look back.

She heard nothing but the rustle of the snow under her boots, and she tried to walk faster, not to listen beyond the sound of her feet, not to notice the slurred shadows of sounds hanging around her, floating from nowhere. She knew she had been walking for hours, that which she had once called hours .

She still had them-t hose two legs that could move-and something lost somewhere within her, that told them to move. She would not give up.

Long spirals of snow rose in the wind, brushing the low sky, far ahead. She saw strips of a shiny black above her and specks of bright dust twink ling at her from between the clouds .

She thought, suddenly, of a restaurant she had seen , for the flash of a second, in a German fi lm. It had a sign over the door, with plain, thin letters, nickel-plated letters, inso lent in their simplicit y, on dull white glas s-\"Ca fe Diggy­ Dagg y.\" They had no signs like that in the country she was leaving . They had no pavements lust rous as a ball -room floor. She repeated sensel essl y, without hearing the soun ds, as a charm, as a pra yer: \"Cafe Diggy-Da ggy ... Ca ... fe ... Dig ... gy ...

She thought the y were running. An instinct was driving her, the instinct of an animal, whipping her blindly into the battle of self-preservation. She was whispering through frozen lips: \"Y ou 're a good soldier, Kira Argounova, you 're a good soldier .... \" * Ahead of her, the blue snow billowed dimly against the sky. The waves did not change as she came closer; they stood out, sharper, harder, low hills undulating in the dar knes s. White cones rose to the sky, with black edges of branche s. Then she saw a black figure. The figure was moving . It was moving in a straight line acr oss the hill s, across the ho­ rizon. She saw the le gs, like scis sors , opening and closing. She saw a small black spike on his shoulder, and it gleamed sharply, onc e, against the sky. She fell down on her stomach. She felt, dimly, as through an anes thetic , snow biting the wrists under her sleeve s, ro lling into her boo ts. She lay still, her heart pounding against the snow. Then she raised her head a little and crawled slowly for­ ward, on her stomach. She stopped and lay still , watching the black figure in the distance, and crawled again, and stopped, and watche d, and crawled again. Citizen Ivan Ivanov was six feet tall. He had a wide mouth and a short nose, and when he was puzzled, he blinked, scratching hi s neck. Citizen Ivan Ivanov was born in the year 1900, in a base­ ment, in a side street of the town of Vitebsk. He was the ninth child of the fam ily. At the age of six, he started in as apprentice to a shoemaker. The shoemaker beat him with leather suspenders and fed him buckwheat gruel. At the age of ten, he made his first pair of shoe s, all by himself, and he wore them proudly down the street, the leather squeaking. That was the first day Citizen Ivan Ivanov remembered all through his life. At the age of fifteen, he lured the neighbor hood 's grocer 's daughter into a vacant lot and raped her. She was twelve years old, with a chest as flat as a bo y's, and she whined shrilly. He made her promise not to tell anyone, and he gave her fifteen kopeks and a pound of sugar candy. That was the second day he remembered.

That was the third day he remembered. There was a gay bunch of fellows around the shoemaker 's shop . They rose at dawn and they worked hard and their shirts stuck to their backs · with sweat, but they had a good time at night. There was a saloon on the comer of the street, and they sang gay son gs, their arms about one another 's shoulders. There was a house around the comer, where a wizened little man played the piano, and Ivan 's favorite was a fat blonde in a pink kimono; she was a foreigner called Gretchen. And those were the ni g hts Citizen Ivan Ivanov remembered. He served in the Red Army, and, shells roaring overhead, made bets on lice races with the soldiers in the bottom of the trench. He was wounded and told he would die. He stared dully at the wall, for it did not make any differen ce. He recovered and married a servant girl with round cheeks and round breasts, becau se he had gotten her in trouble. Their son was blond and husky, and they named him Ivan . They went to church on Sunda ys, and his wife cooked onions with roasted mutton, when they could get it. She raised her skirt high over her fat legs, and knelt, and scrubbed the white pine floor of their room. And she sent him to a public bath once every month. And Citizen Ivan Ivanov was happy. Then he was transferred to the border patr ols, and his wife went back to live with her parents in the village, and took their son with her. Citizen I van Ivanov had never learned to read. Citizen Ivan Ivanov was guarding the border of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republic s. He walke� slowly through the snow, his rifle on his shoul­ der, blowin g at his fro zen fingers, cursing the cold. He did not mind going down hill, but going up hill was hard, and he scrambled, groaning, to stand there alone on the summit, with the wind biting his nose, and not a living soul for miles around. Then, Citizen Ivan Ivanov saw something moving in the snow, far away. He was not sure it had moved. He peered into the dark­ ness, but the wind raised whirls of snow dust over the plain and he thought he might have been mistaken; only it had"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"460 AY N RA ND seemed as if something had moved, which was not snow dust. He yelled, cupping his hands over his mouth: \"Who goes there?\" Nothing answered. Nothing moved in the plain under the hill. He yelled: \"You 'd better come out or I'l l shoot !\" There was no answer. He hesitated, scratching his neck. He stared far out into the night. Bu t he had to be safe. Citizen Ivan Ivanov raised his rifle to his shoulder and fired. A blue flame streaked through the dark ness and a dull echo rolled in the distance, far away. There was no sound af­ ter the echo had died, no movement in the white plain under the hill. Citizen Iva n Ivanov scr atched his neck. He should go down there and investigate, he thought. Bu t it was too far, and the snow was too deep, and the wind was too cold. He waved his hand and turned away. \"Ju st a rabbit, mo st likely,\" he muttered, descending the hill to continue his route. Kira Argounova lay very still in the snow, on her stomach, her arms thrown forward, and only a lock of hair moved, fal ling from under the white scarf, and her eyes followed the black figure walking away across the hi lls, disa ppearing in the dist ance. She lay still for a long time, watching a red spot widening slowly under her in the snow. She thought, clearly, sharply, in words she could almost hear: \"W ell, I'm shot. We ll, that's how it fe els to be shot. It's not so fri ghtf ul, is it?\" She rose slowly to her kne es. She took off a mitten and slipped her hand into her ja cket to find the roll of bills over her left breast. She hoped the bullet had not gone through the bill s. It hadn 't. The little hole in the jacket was just under them. And her fingers felt something hot and sticky. It did not hurt much. It felt like a sharp little burn in her side, with less pain than in her tired le gs. She tried to stand up. She swayed a little, but she could stand. There was a dark patch on her ja cket and the fur w as drawn into red, warm clusters . It did not bleed much ; just a few drops she could feel slit hering down her skin. She could walk. She would keep her hand on it and it would not bleed. She was not far from the border now. Over there, beyond, she would have it bandaged. It was not serious and she could stand it. She had to go on.

She whispered to herself through lips that were turning blue: \"Of course, you 're wounded and you 're a little weak. Tha t's to be expected. Nothing to worry about.\" Swaying, her shoulders drooping forward, her hand at her side, she went on, through the snow, stumbling, her knees meeting, faltering as if she were drunk. She watched little dark drops falling off the hem of her lace gown, slowly, once in a while. Then the drops stopped fal ling . She smiled. She felt no pain. The last of her consciousness had gone into one will into two legs that were growing weaker and weaker. She had to go on. She had to get out. She had to get out. She whispered to herself, as if the sound of her voice were a living fluid giving her strength: \"You 're a good soldier, Kira Argounova, yo u'r e a good soldier and now 's the time to prove it. ... Now .... Just one effort .... One last eff ort. ... It's not so very bad yet, is it? ... You can make it. ... Just walk .... Please, walk .... You have to get out ... get out ... get out ... get out ... \" She pressed her hand to the roll of bills in her jacket. She could not lose that. She had to watch that. She could not see things clearly any l onger. She had to remember that. Her head was drooping forw ard. She closed her eye s, leav­ ing slits open between her lashes to watch her legs, her legs that should not stop . She opened her eyes suddenly to find herself lying in the snow. She raised her head slowly, wondering, for she did not remember having fallen. She must have fainted, she thought, wondering curiously how it felt to faint, for she did not remember. It took a long time to rise . She noticed a red spot in the snow where she had fal len. She must have lain there for some time . She staggered fo rward , then stopped, some thought forming itself slowly in her dull eye s, and she came back and covered the red spot with snow, with her foot. She went on, wondering dimly why the weather had be­ come so hot and wh y the snow did not melt when it was so hot, so hot that she could hardly breathe , and what if the snow did melt? She would have to swim, then, well, she was a good swimmer and that would be easier than walking, for her legs could rest, then. She went reeling forward. She did not know whether she was walking in the right direction. She had forg ott en that she"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"462 AYN RAND had to think of a direction. She remembered only that she had to walk. She did not notice that the hill ended sharply on the edge of a ravine, and she fell and rolled down the white slope in a whirl of leg s, arms and snow. She could move nothing but one hand, at first, to rub the wet snow off her face, off her lips, off her frozen lash es. She lay huddled in a white heap on the bottom of a white gulch. The time it took to rise again seemed like hou rs, like yea rs: just to draw her hands to her body, at first, palms down, to press her elbows to her body, tum her legs, push her feet out, then rise to her knee s, leaning on ten se, trembling arms, and breathe, with a breath like a knife inside, then rise a little fur­ ther, leaning on one hand, then tear that hand, too, off the snow, and rise, and stand erect, pantin g. She made a few steps. But she could not walk up the other side of the gulch. She fell and crawled up the hill on her hands and knee s, digging her burning face into the snow to cool her cheeks . She rose to her feet again on the top of the hill . She had lost her mitten s. She felt something in the comers of her mouth and she rubbed her lips and looked at her finge rs: her fingers were pink with froth. She felt too hot. She tore the white scarf off her hair and threw it down into the gulch. The wind was a relief, blowing her hair back in a straight, shivering line . She went on, raising her face to the wind. She felt too hot and it was so diff icult to breathe. She tore off her fur jacket and dropped it into the snow, and went on, wit hout looking back. In the sky, the clouds were rolling away in whirls of blue and gray and dark green. Ahead of her, above the snow, a pale line glowed, rising, and it was a transparent white, but above the snow it looked like a very pale green . She pitched forward and jerked back aga in, brushing the hair out of her eyes, and faltered, and went on, a trembling, swaying, reeling , drunken figure in a long wedding gown of lace white as the snow around her. The train was tom off her waist line and it dragged behind her, her legs getting tangled in the long lace. She staggered blindly, the wind waving her hair, her arms swinging, as if they, too, were loose in the wind. She leaned back and her breasts stood out under the white lace, and from under her"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"WE THE LI VIN G 463 left breast a little stream of red trickled down slowly , and long dark patches spread down to the train, and delicate flowers of lace were red on the white satin . And suddenly her dry lips, caked and sealed with froth, opened aga in, and she called softly, one name, as a plea for help from over there, from acr oss the border, as a car ess, her voice tender and almost joyous: \"Leo ! ... \" She repeated, louder and louder, without despair, as if the sound, that one sound in the world, were giving her life: \"Leo ! ... Leo ! ... Leo ! ... \" She was calling him, the Leo that could have been, that would have been had he lived there, where she was going, across the border. He was awaiting her there, and she had to go on. She had to walk. There, in that world, acr oss the bor­ der, a life was waiting for her to which she had been faithful her every livin g hour, her only banner that had never been lowered, that she had held high and straight, a life she could not betray, she would not betray now by stopping while she was still living, a life she could still serve, by walk ing, by walking forward a little longer, just a little longer. Then she heard a song, a tune not loud enough to be a hu­ man sound, a song as a last battle-march. And it was not a funeral dirge, it was not a hymn, it was not a prayer. It was a tune from an old operetta, the \"So ng of Broken Glas s.\" Little notes of music trembled in hesitat ion, and burst, and rolled in quick, fine wav es, like the thin, clear ringing of glass. Littl e notes leaped and exploded and laughed, laughed with a full, unconditional, consummate human joy. She did not know whether she was singing . Perhaps she was only hearing the music somewhere. But the music had been a promi se; a promise at the dawn of her life. That which had been promised then, could not be denied to her now. She had to go on. She went on, a fragile girl in the flowing, medieval gown of a priest ess, red stains spreading on the white lace . At dawn, she fell on the edge of the slope . She lay very still, for she knew that she could not rise again. Far down, below her, an end less snow plain stretched into the sunr ise. The sun had not come. A band of pink, pale and young, like the breath of a color, like the birth of a color, rose over the snow and glowed, trembling, flowing up into a pale blue, a blue immensity of sparks twinkling under a thin"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"464 AY N RAN D veil, like the faint, fading ghost of a lake in a summer sun, like the still surface of a lake with a sun drowned far in its dept hs. And the snow, at the rise of that liquid flame, seemed to quiver, breathing, glittering softly. Long bands stretched across the plain, shadows that seemed light itself, a heavier, bluer light with edges ready to burst into dancing fir es. A lonely little tree stood far away in the plain. It had no leave s. Its slim, rare twigs had ga thered no snow. It stretched, tense with the life of a future spring, thin black branche s, like arms, into the dawn rising over an endless earth where so much had been possi ble. She lay on the edge of a hill and looked down at the sky. One hand, white and still, hung over the edge, and little red drops rolled slowly in the snow, down the slope. She smiled. She knew she was dying. But it did not matter any longer. She had known something which no human words could ever tell and she knew it now. She had been awaiting it and she felt it, as if it had been, as if she had lived it. Life had been, if only because she had known it could be, and she felt it now as a hymn without sound, deep under the little hole that dripped red drops into the snow, deeper than that fro m which the red dro ps came. A moment or an etemity�id it matter? Life, undefeated, existed and could exist. She smiled, her last smile, to so much that had been pos­ sible. THE END"}]
