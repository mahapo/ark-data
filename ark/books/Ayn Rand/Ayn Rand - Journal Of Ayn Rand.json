What remains to bepublished are two lecture courses on writing, presently being edited, and herold film scripts.The Journals contains most of AR’s notes for her three main novels—along withsome early material, some notes made between The Fountainhead and AtlasShrugged, and some notes from her final decades. The early material includes,among other things, AR’s first philosophic musings on paper in English, writtenin her twenties. The middle section includes a fascinating transitionalstatement of her ethics, never finished, and also a vigorous essay on why theHouse Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 did not violate the civil rightsof the Hollywood Communists. The final section includes the notes for AR’s lastprojected novel, To Lorne Dieterling.Some pieces important to this volume have been lost. I refer to eight or tenscenarios for the silent screen, written in the twenties. These stories, severalpages apiece, featured strong heroes, a passionate love interest, and non-stopaction, often set in exotic locales; they exemplified an extravagant romanticismbubbling over with the excitement of living. I first came upon these scenariosin the eighties, after AR’s death. Had I been able to include them here, theywould have brought a sorely needed balance to some other items, such as TheLittle Street, a bitter novelette from the same period. Mysteriously, thesescenarios have disappeared from the Estate warehouse. If they should reappear, Ipromise to publish them.Aside from occasional pieces, identified by the editor, the AR material in thisbook was written for herself, for her own clarity. No one, apart from herhusband and a few associates, was ever shown any of this material, nor did ARintend to publish it. Obviously, therefore, nothing in the book may be taken asdefinitive of her ideas. On the contrary, most of these preliminary formulationswere dropped, and a few were even contradicted, in her published works. Inseveral cases, though hardly in all, the editor points out such discrepancies.“The art of writing,” AR wrote in a November 1944 note, “is the art of doingwhat you think you’re doing. This is not as simple as it sounds. It implies avery difficult undertaking: the necessity to think. And it implies therequirement to think out three separate, very hard problems: What is it you wantto say? How are you going to say it? Have you really said it?” It was to answerthese questions that most of the Journals was written. In other words, the notesare nothing more than AR preparing herself to write by thinking aloud onpaper—in random snatches, as and when she sought to clarify a point—withoutoutline, structure, continuous theme, or editorial polish.Despite its unedited character, however, the Journals is a treat to read,because it is the raw evidence of AR’s continuous growth across fifty years—hergrowth both as a philosopher and as an artist.One can see her growth as a philosopher in two ways: in her interests and in herideas, i.e., in regard both to depth and to truth.AR’s mind moved systematically from politics (as a youth) to ethics (in herthirties and forties) to epistemology and metaphysics (in her fifties andlater). This progression is not a mere change of interest, but a true organicdevelopment: the earlier stages increasingly exhibit the maturity of what is tocome, which in turn always remains faithful in principle to its youthfulorigins. One great pleasure in reading the book is to see hints of laterdiscoveries mentioned at first casually, even parenthetically. For instance, ifyou read AR’s first philosophic musings with an eye to Atlas Shrugged, you willobserve how much more you can see in her words now, thanks to her, than sheherself could see at the time. Her distinctive ideas were present from her startas a thinker; they were implicit in her fundamental approach at least from theage of twelve. It was only a matter of time and logic until she was able toidentify them explicitly.The best evidence of AR’s increasing depth is her unpublished manuscript TheMoral Basis of Individualism. It is there that we see her evolution from TheFountainhead’s stress on independence to Atlas Shrugged’s recognition that thebasic virtue is rationality, of which independence is but an aspect. We also seeher taking the historic step from ethics to the base of philosophy.Traditionally, philosophers started their books on ethics by asking: What is theproper moral code? AR started there, too—until something occurred to her one dayin mid-sentence: “Chapter 1 should begin by stating the [moral] axiom. Thendefine man’s nature. Then ask [these two words are deleted] Or—begin by askingwhether a moral code is necessary? Prove that it is—for a rational being. Whatis the rational? That which is true to facts....” In regard to this passage I amtempted to paraphrase the mystics: To those who understand, no explanation isnecessary; to those who do not, read Galt’s speech.In regard to the content of her ideas, AR also underwent an organic developmentas, step by step, she gained clarity about the full implications of herfundamental premises.AR’s first notes reveal an influence of Nietzsche, in the form of droplets ofsubjectivism, and of the idea that the heroes among men are innately great, asagainst the inherently corrupt masses, who deserve only bitterness anddomination from their superiors. None of this is stated as a connected position,but such ideas do show up here and there.It is instructive to watch these droplets—every one of them—evaporate withoutresidue, as AR’s own principles emerge into the sunshine of explicit statement;it is a perfect example of science (reason) functioning as a self-corrective.After she comes to define “reason,” subjectivism vanishes; after her analysis ofindividual rights, “domination” is gone; after she grasps the nature ofvolition, she says no more about “innate” stature.By her early thirties, AR had thought herself out of every Nietzschean element.With The Fountainhead, the only trace left is in the characters of Dominique andWynand, whose bitterness about the world Roark proves to be a cardinal error.After The Fountainhead, Nietzsche is not even an error to be refuted; there isnothing but pure Ayn Rand.Although AR’s vision of the ideal man remained constant through the decades, herview of his greatest enemy changed when the Nietzschean element was dropped. Asa youngster, the first enemy of Man whom she could identify was Communism, theomnipotent State. Then, as she grew beyond politics, the enemy, for a shortwhile, was taken to be the masses of average men as such, regardless of theirpolitical organization. One of the unique features of her mature hero-worship,by contrast, is her explicit benevolence towards the honest average man (asrepresented by Mike in The Fountainhead and Eddie Willers in Atlas Shrugged). Byher early thirties, AR had discovered the real enemy of the ideal (which is alsothe real corrupter of politics and of the masses): the intellectuals ofirrationalism. Thus, although AR’s passionate values never changed, the earlybitterness toward the commissars or the mob becomes in time the expose ofEllsworth Toohey, and then the damnation of Kant.One can see AR’s growth as an artist in regard to every facet of writing anovel, with the emphasis on plot and characterization.In regard to plot, we see the steps by which she learns to create it—we arethere when a dramatic event or scene first occurs to her, and we see what shefinally does with it and why. We see her continually restructure events so as toachieve an inexorable rise to a necessary but unpredictable climax. We see howseveral different lines of events (personal/emotional, economic, political,philosophical) are made to rise and climax at once, and how each of these lineshelps reshape the others. And we see her carry on the plot struggles until shereaches the desired result: a seamless complexity that will enter the reader’smind with the simplicity of the inevitable.In regard to characterization, we see her first concept of the cast (and herearliest names for the leads), then its simultaneous expansion and winnowingout. We see the sharpening focus on a character’s distinctive attributes, andher decisions as to what kinds of actions and relationships will convey theseobjectively. We learn everything about the heroes and the villains that ARherself needs to know, even though she cannot always use the information in thefinal book. We are there when eloquent lines of dialogue occur to her, andsometimes see her move them from one mouth to another. And we see how AR uses(or deliberately does not use) her knowledge of real people. This last willanswer such common questions as: Was Frank Lloyd Wright a model for Roark? OrWilliam Randolph Hearst for Wynand? It will also answer some uncommon questions,such as: What female suggested Lois Cook? What scientist Robert Stadler? Andwhat President Mr. Thompson?In reading the Journals, we also see AR’s methodical redefinition of a novel’stheme so as to include the broader integrations she is always making and theconcrete applications she is identifying. We see much of her research, fromarchitecture to railroads to steel mills and copper mining, and how she uses itto aid her in the development of plot, character, and theme. And, sometimes—inregard both to fiction and to nonfiction—we see the first draft of a section,followed by her own ruthless critique and revision.If the primary value of the Journals to us is the evidence it furnishes of AR’sgrowth, a second value is the evidence that her growth was a product ofthinking—in the art of which the Journals may serve as a textbook. The subtitleof this book really ought to be: How to Answer Your Own Questions.Implicit in the countless examples of fruitful thinking which make up the bookare dozens of practical guides to the art of clear thinking. Among other things,one can learn a great deal about the means of properly wording a question, theneed for factual data (and at what point enough have been gathered), the rolesof induction and deduction, the necessity and method of integration—then, as thefinal mopping up, the means of formulating a definitive proof of a conclusion.On first reading (which is all I have done so far), three principles of clearthinking seemed, above all others, to leap out of the pages at me:1. The need for intellectual honesty. For example, AR was troubled at one pointby a seeming contradiction in her views—which she hastened not to evade, but tostate forcefully. “[Now I shall consider] the hypothetical case of a monopoly(say, telephone) free to refuse services to an individual or a group of men or abranch of business. In this last case, it is obvious that the inventor’smonopoly has such an absolute right. Does it mean, however, that individualismthen degenerates into its opposite in practice, into collectivism? Has the sizeof an enterprise (made possible by the scope covered by modern inventions)anything to do with it? In other words, does invention such as the telephonegive the individual who controls it a collectivist’s power by the sheer size ofhis business? (No, I think.)...” (Sept. 30, 1944). AR raises, as a matter ofcourse, every objection to her views that occurs to her—and then answers themall. This is one reason why, when she finally endorses a conclusion, she iscertain of it.2. The need for precise formulation, even in private notes. For example: “Apossible definition of a right: a ‘right’ is that which it is morallypermissible to defend by force. Here I have to be very careful. This might betotally wrong. If carelessly handled, it could be used as justification for theright of a communist to murder an employer who does not give him a job. Again,’sins of omission’ come in. This is only a hint, a possible clue to be thoughtout very carefully, from every possible angle and in every possible application.It is no good—unless a total proof of it can be given....” (Oct. 26, 1944).3. The need for fresh writing. To put this point negatively, there are noclichés in the Journals, no numbing restatements even of AR’s own ideas. On thecontrary, the notes are replete with new angles, new connections, newdistinctions, new analogies, new wording—even in regard to issues which AR haddiscussed extensively in print. Most of this new material did not survive theJournals, despite its inherent interest; to her, it was merely steps on the roadto clarity, the first birth pangs of the books still to come. My point, however,is that the freshness of the writing is a corollary of the process she isengaged in: not rationalistic deduction nor recitation of the known, butpioneering thought.As a small example of the latter point, I offer the following note, never usedin print, on the question of reason and emotion: “Man cannot, [some people] say,be called a rational being because his actions are not motivated by his mind;his mind is like his Sunday clothes, kept in a dark closet and donnedreluctantly on rare occasions; and when donned, it makes him stiff,uncomfortable and unhappy, because it never fit him well in the first place.What man does on weekdays, they say, is to gallop about stark-naked, on allfours, because it reminds him of his mother who gave him a complex, and to whirlaround catching his own tail which he hasn’t got but feels he has; that is whathe does because it makes him happy. Reason? Reason, they say, is just somethinghe uses in such negligible, incidental matters as earning a living...” (July 30,1945).Too many of AR’s professed admirers in print are academics of the scholasticpersuasion. The Journals gives us the original, a purely Objectivist mind atwork—mostly right, sometimes wrong, but always, from start to finish,reality-oriented.In terms of cognitive value to the reader, the new material alone in this volumewarrants the price. It is new to me also. No matter how clear Objectivism is inmy mind, every time I read another Ayn Rand book, it becomes clearer. This bookis no exception.David Harriman has done an excellent editorial job. He has brought order todozens of large cardboard cartons filled with scattered papers and mementos. Hehas selected the best of the notes, organized them chronologically, offeredexplanations when these were available and helpful, and edited the wording,especially for grammar, of the early pages, when AR had not yet fully graspedEnglish. For all this work, I am grateful to David Harriman, as all fans of ARshould be.The final chapter of the Journals shows us AR near the end of her life. There isnothing to publish in regard to her work on mathematics or neurology, but someof her notes on psycho-epistemology have been included—along with every word shewrote for her last projected novel.To Lorne Dieterling was to be “the story of a woman [a dancer] who is totallymotivated by love for values—and how one maintains such a state when alone in anenemy world.” (This formulation is from November 1957, a month after AtlasShrugged was published.) The two basic “sense of life” music numbers to bedanced by the heroine in the novel are the Overture to La Traviata and “Will O’the Wisp,” one of AR’s favorite “tiddly wink” pieces.Verdi’s La Traviata Overture, she writes, is to be “the dance of rising, withoutever moving from one spot—done by means of her arms and body—ending on‘Dominique’s statue’ posture, as ’higher than raised arms,‘ as the achieved, asthe total surrender to a vision and, simultaneously, ’This is I.‘ (The open, thenaked, the ’without armor.‘)” As to “Will O’ the Wisp,” it represents “thetriumph—the tap dance and ballet combined—my total sense of life.... (Probablydanced in a low-grade dive, with Lome [the hero] present....”Such was the sense of life not only of a young immigrant in her twenties ho wasbrimming over with new ideas, but also of a philosopher in her sev enties, whohad lived consistently by every one of her ideas. Such was the sense of life ofan artist “alone in an enemy world,” who had already endured her greatestdisappointments—and created her greatest achievements.As David Harriman puts it in his eloquent conclusion:“Ayn Rand has come full circle. She returned at the end to [the] problem [ofirrational people] that had concerned her from the beginning.... At this stage,however, she knows the solution ...“It is fitting, therefore, that her last fiction notes are about a woman likeherself, who maintains such a [joyous and lighthearted] view of life to the end,even while those around her do not.”She did it—how? In essence, by means of these Journals (and their equivalentsthrough the decades). In other words, she did it in part through the knowledgeshe methodically struggled to gain, but above all through the intransigent willat the root of such a struggle: the will to think, in every issue and all herlife long.Whoever cares to match the price can reach the same result. As the firstpayment—I say this to those with their lives still ahead of them—I suggest thatyou read this book.Leonard PeikoffIrvine, CaliforniaOctober 1996"},{"pageContent":"EDITOR’S PREfACEIn a note to herself at the age of twenty-three, AR wrote: “From now on—nothought whatever about yourself, only about your work. You are only a writingengine. Don’t stop, until you really and honestly know that you cannot go on.”Throughout her long career, she remained true to this pledge—she was a “writingengine.” With the publication of her journals, we can now see the “writingbehind the writing” and appreciate fully the prodigious effort that went intoher published work.AR’s notes, typically handwritten, were spread among the numerous boxes ofpapers she left behind at her death in 1982. My editing of this material hasconsisted of selection, organization, line editing, and insertion of explanatorycomments.Selection. This book presents AR’s working journals—i.e., the notes in which shedeveloped her literary and philosophical ideas. Notes of a personal nature willbe included in a forthcoming authorized biography.Approximately three-quarters of the working journals are presented here. I haveincluded the material that I judge to be of interest to serious, philosophicaladmirers of AR’s novels and ideas. This standard is, in effect, a middle groundbetween the scholar who wants every note, and the casual fan who might besatisfied with a selection of notes on fiction.In most cases, I have described specific omissions in the chapter introductions.In general, notes have been omitted for the following reasons:1. Repetition with other notes. AR sometimes rewrote her notes, often for thepurpose of condensing and essentializing. I have included such later materialonly when it contains provocative new formulations.2. Repetition with published material. Lengthy notes that merely state what thereader of her published work already knows, such as final outlines for novels,have been omitted.3. Quotes or paraphrases of other authors. In her research, AR often quoted orparaphrased material she had read. I have usually included these notes only whenshe adds her own comments.4. Isolated, usually political, notes that are unrelated to the surroundingphilosophiclliterary material. For example, AR’s critique of President Truman’sdecision to fire General MacArthur was omitted because the only other notes fromthe period were on Atlas Shrugged.5. Cryptic notes. Some material was too cryptic to be intelligible. Since ARtypically wrote in complete sentences, such notes are rare.I have taken this opportunity to publish a few pieces that are not from AR’sjournals, but are closely related to her notes and of great interest to herfans. In Chapter 10, for example, I have included AR’s testimony before theHouse Un-American Activities Committee, which is followed by her notes on thehearings.Organization. The journals are presented chronologically, so the reader mayfollow the development of AR’s ideas. However, for the purpose of groupingtogether the notes on a particular topic, some departures from chronologicalorder have proved necessary. For example, the presentation of her architecturalresearch for The Fountainhead in a separate chapter required minor violations ofthe chronology. Also, her notes from 1947 dealing with collectivist propagandain the movies are presented before the Atlas Shrugged notes, which begin in1945. But in all such cases, the reason for my order is obvious.When a note is undated, I have made a guess at the approximate date, and placedit next to related notes written at about that time.The book divides naturally into five parts. As might be expected, the twolongest parts are the notes for The Fountainhead (Part 2) and Atlas Shrugged(Part 4). Part 3 pertains to projects she worked on in the years between thesenovels. Parts 1 and 5 are relatively short; they present respectively her notesfrom the years prior to The Fountainhead and from the post-Atlas Shruggedperiod. Within each part, the reasons for the chapter divisions are eitherobvious or explained in my introductions.Line editing. AR wrote her thoughts down as they occurred to her; she did notoutline material prior to writing the notes, and she did not edit the wordingafterwards.Even so, not a great deal of line editing was required. I found few grammaticalerrors, except in the early notes of Part 1, which were written before she hadmastered English. Most of my line editing was done to facilitate one’s reading.I broke up paragraphs and sentences that were too long, occasionally suppliedgrammar that was merely implied, and eliminated the distracting overuse ofparentheses, dashes and underlining. (Italics are used here to indicate herunderlining; boldface type indicates words that she underlined twice.)A certain amount of wordiness is endemic to journal writing. It isimpossible—even for AR—consistently to find concise formulations while thinkingaloud on paper. In many sentences, therefore, I have been able to eliminatewords without affecting the meaning. However, I typically made such changes onlywhen the original sentence was difficult to read. My restrained approach to theediting allows the journals to retain the spontaneous, informal character ofnotes to herself.It was occasionally necessary to insert my word(s) into a sentence when theformulation was potentially confusing. My insertions are always enclosed insquare brackets (not parentheses). When the editing of the book was complete, Idouble-checked all such changes against the original notes. I am confident thatmy insertions have not altered her intended meaning.I have indicated my omission of passages within the notes by ellipsis points insquare brackets; ellipsis points without the brackets are hers.Explanatory comments. In general, I thought it best to leave the reader alonewith the journals, and therefore I have kept my interruptions to a minimum. Manyof my comments simply introduce the topic. When I could and where it washelpful, I have identified people, ideas or events unfamiliar to the generalreader.Sometimes it was necessary to comment on a philosophical passage that is clearlyinconsistent with AR’s mature views. In such cases, I do not attempt to explainthe inconsistency; I simply cite the published work where the reader can findher definitive view.In certain places, I could not resist calling the reader’s attention to astriking aspect of a note. For example, I have identified a few notes in whichshe discusses a person or idea that later formed the basis for a character inThe Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged.The only other comments inserted in the journals are some quotations from thebiographical interviews given by AR in the early 1960s. During the interviews,she occasionally made remarks that offer special insight into the notespresented here.My goal in all these changes has been to present the journals in a form that iseasy to read, while intruding on her words as little as possible. I am satisfiedwith the result.I wish to thank Leonard Peikoff for giving me access to the journals and for hiscontinual editorial advice. Dr. Peikoff was particularly helpful in making mycomments more concise and in suggesting to me additional comments. Thanks alsoto Catherine Dickerson and Diane LeMont for their careful, accurate typing ofjournals that were often difficult to read, and to Dina Garmong for translatingthe Russian passages in the earliest journals.Finally, I owe a special debt to my wife, Barbara Belli, for her support andlove throughout this lengthy project. Thank you, Barbara, for being my emotionalfuel."},{"pageContent":"PART 1EARLY PROJECTS"},{"pageContent":"1THE HOLLYWOOD YEARSAR began her career in America by writing scenarios for the silent screen, workshe could do despite having only a rudimentary knowledge of English. A littlemore than a year after coming to America, at the age of twenty-two, she wasliving at the Hollywood Studio Club and working as a junior screenwriter forCecil B. DeMille.This chapter begins with material found in two composition notebooks dating fromthe summer of 1927. The books contain two complete scenarios and one fragment.Although these scenarios are not explicitly philosophical, the reader willrecognize in them characteristic features of AR. They are romantic adventurestories, which portray man as a heroic being capable of overcoming greatobstacles to achieve his goals. It is easy to recognize the author of TheFountainhead when, at the age of twenty-two, she writes: “Life isachievement.... Give yourself an aim, something you want to do, then go afterit, breaking through everything, with nothing in mind but your aim, all will,all concentration—and get it.”It is fascinating to see the seeds of her later work in these stories. In thefirst scenario, The Skyscraper, the hero is an architect named Howord Kanewho—despite being charged with a serious crime and threatened with a lengthyprison sentence—ends by standing triumphantly at the top of his greatestcreation, a New York skyscraper. The second scenario ends with the heroinerushing to the rescue of the hero, whom the villains hove left strapped to atorture machine. When AR had a good plot idea, she did not forget itJuly-September 1927[AR begins with notes on a book of short stories about railroad workers (Heldfor Orders by Frank H. Spearman).

He wants to see his former sweetheart, Hetty Brown, whom he had not seenfor some years.Hetty Brown is working in a department store on Broadway. She had not heard fromBill for many years and now she is engaged to another man, Dick Saunders. He isthe superintendent of a skyscraper that is being built across the street fromthe store where she works.But Hetty has not forgotten her first love. She is very excited when she getsthe letter announcing Bill’s coming to New York. She waits for him anxiously.Bill comes. It is a great shock for Hetty, when she sees the ragged,half-drunken, lazy bum he has become. All her dreams about him are shattered andshe tells him that there can be nothing between them and that she is engaged toDick Saunders.Bill is furious and leaves her. He does not want to show how unhappy he is. Hewalks through the streets of the big city, lonely, hungry and homeless, hatingeverybody and everything around him. He swears to revenge himself on DickSaunders.Bill goes to the skyscraper and gets a job as a steelworker, for long ago he hadbeen one in his native town. But he is unaccustomed to work and at the end ofthe first day is bawled out by the superintendent, Dick Saunders. Buddy O‘Brien,another worker, tries to help Bill out.Tom Webbs, the steel-foreman, notices Bill’s rage and hatred at Dick Saunders.After the work Webbs takes Bill to a shabby little restaurant, a bootlegger’sjoint, where he makes him drunk. While drinking, Bill boasts desperately that heis going to kill Dick Saunders at the first chance he gets. Webbs is verypleased. He is Dick’s enemy and he encourages Bill in his decision. Billexplains that he will do it when he is alone with Dick somewhere on top of thebuilding, where he can kill him and throw his body down, so that everybody willbelieve it was an accident.Bill starts work lazily the next day. But in spite of himself, the strength andenergy of the work [inspires] him. When the work stops at lunch time, DickSaunders praises Bill. It is something quite new to the bum and for the firsttime in his life he feels proud and satisfied with himself.Just then, Hetty Brown appears from her store across the street, coming to seeDick, as usual. She sees Bill. She is startled, for she did not expect him to beworking here. He looks at her mockingly and turns away when she wants to talk tohim. Hetty goes to Dick, who has not noticed the little scene.Bill comes back to work after lunch, with a tell-tale bottle in his pocket. Heis half-drunk with jealousy and the drinks he had. From his carelessness, anaccident occurs that almost costs the life of Buddy O‘Brien, his new friend.Buddy is saved only by Dick Saunders, who dashes up in time to rescue him. Inspite of himself, Bill admires his enemy.That night, going home, Bill gives his word to Buddy that he will never drinkagain.In two weeks’ time, the workers can hardly recognize the young bum. Bill’s wholeappearance has changed and his energy makes him one of the best workers. He isenthusiastic about his work. He cannot resist the influence of the skyscraper.Slowly, it makes a man out of him.From her store window, Hetty watches Bill’s tall, strong figure across thestreet and wonders whether her love for him is really dead.When Bill gets his first pay-check, Tom Webbs invites him to the joint. Billrefuses. He is proud of his earned money and he makes a confession to Webbs: onhis way to New York he committed his only real crime—he stole a wallet from apassenger on the train. He has not spent all the money. Now he asks Webbs totake it to the police station, for he does not dare to do it himself. Webbsagrees to do it. However, he keeps the wallet to himself.008 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_008_r1.jpg][The scenario stops here. In the following notes, AR begins another scenariowith the same title.

He is a young architect, who has won a bigcompetition arranged by a newspaper, and is now building a skyscraper that isexpected to be one of the highest and most unusual in the city. He is architectand superintendent of the construction. John Scott, a famous establishedarchitect, had hoped to win the competition. Now he is madly jealous of HowardKane, who had formerly been employed on his buildings, starting as a simpleworker at the very bottom.Howard is not popular among the workers. They resent his restless energy and thesevere discipline he has established on the building. Howard’s only friend isJimmy, a little newsboy who is selling evening papers near the structure and isvery proud of “our architect.”John Scott has one of his faithful men employed on Howard’s building: TomRiggins, the foreman of a steel-workers gang. Together they have a scheme toruin Howard’s success. Riggins is working on it. Scott’s construction company isinterested in preventing Howard, their brilliant new competitor, from finishingthe building.One summer morning Howard goes to the steel mills outside the city to look overcertain steel beams that are to be shipped to his building. As he is riding backon one of the steel-laden trucks, an elegant little roadster driven by a younggirl crashes into the truck. Howard helps the girl out of the wreck of her car.She is not hurt and he proposes to drive her home to the city. She arrives atthe door of a very fashionable hotel, riding gaily on the steel beams of a heavytruck. She gives Howard her name—Danny Day.When he returns to his building, Howard sees posters on the roof-cabaret next tohis structure, announcing the first appearance of the famous dancer Danny Day,returned from her European tour.The next evening, working a night shift, he watches from his building as Dannydances on the next roof. She sees him and waves gaily to him.Among the brilliant crowd that fills the roof-cabaret are John Scott, who is anold admirer of Danny, and Mr. Clark, owner of the newspaper that is building theskyscraper. After the performance, Danny asks Mr. Clark permission to visit hisbuilding. A group of guests goes to the structure. Howard is busy on top of it.Danny jumps into the cable loop of a hoist and goes up to him. As they are on anarrow girder, Danny misses a step. Howard has the time to catch her, but herwrap falls down. She remains almost naked in her follies costume. They arealone, a terrific height above the city. He kisses her.Danny Day is renowned for never having been in love. She does not want to admitthat she is now. She goes down, trying to look cold and angry.Howard leaves his work for the first time the next day, when he goes to seeDanny and ask her forgiveness. They go for a ride together. The public cheerswhen they recognize Howard Kane, the hero of the hour.Before leaving him, Danny admits that she loves him. He promises to come and seeher again that evening.Meanwhile, in Howard’s absence, John Scott has sneaked into the building. Hewatches Tom Riggins’ men carrying out his scheme: on a part of the building,they are riveting the steel girders in such a way that they will not be able tostand the pressure of the upper stories and the steel frame can collapse at anymoment.Late that evening Howard is ready to leave the building, when little Jimmy, thenewsboy, comes up to see him. A girder gives way under the child’s weight, andhe falls a story. He is not seriously hurt. Howard rushes to examine the girder,and he discovers the mistake that has been done on purpose. He sees that a wholepart of the skeleton is barely holding together and at any moment the steelgiant can crash down on the crowded street below.The workers are panic-stricken and want to run. Howard orders them to remain andsave the building by carefully removing the girders and riveting them again. Theworkers refuse, for it is very dangerous work. Howard seizes his revolver andorders them to work, threatening to shoot the first man who leaves the building.They work through the night, Howard’s will alone ruling the terrified, tremblingmob of workers.Danny is waiting for Howard. Time passes; he does not come. She is desperate atthe thought of being neglected by a man to whom she has admitted her love. ThenJohn Scott comes to see her. Her pride is so much hurt by Howard that when Scottstarts making love to her, she says “yes” to his proposal.With the first light of the morning, the work on the building finishes. Theskyscraper is saved. But several workers are seriously hurt.Howard Kane is arrested on a charge of criminal negligence and violence. At thetrial, Tom Riggins claims that he worked according to Howard’s instructions.Howard is sentenced to ten years in jail.On a Broadway comer, with tears in his eyes, Jimmy is selling extras with bigheadlines announcing this news.Using all his power and influence, Mr. Clark, the building’s owner, succeeds inreleasing Howard on bond—just to finish the skyscraper, for no one else can doit.Howard comes out of jail. New York is indignant at his being allowed to workagain. The public hates and despises its former hero. As he walks to hisbuilding, the boys on the streets throw stones and mud at him. Everybody laughsat the “convict-builder.”He comes to the skyscraper. The structure is in a state of perfect dejection. Nowork has been done without him. He gives orders. The old energy returns to theconstruction. He tells [the workers] that the steel frame must be finished thatnight.While working, Howard sees a party on the next roof. He sees Danny among theguests. He is happy. When he has a moment to spare, he goes to the cabaret. Hestands in a comer before approaching Danny. He hears the announcement of DannyDay’s engagement to John Scott—this is their engagement party. Howard approachesthe table. Danny did not know that he had been released already. She jumps toher feet, wants to run to him and stops, realizing her position. John Scott andthe guests laugh at Howard, the “convict-builder.” Howard does not say a wordand returns to his work.That evening when Howard leaves the building to take a short sleep, for he hasto work at night, the workers gather to talk over their indignation. They don’twant to work under a convict. They decide to strike. But Tom Riggins whispers tosome of his friends that he will get rid of Howard once and for all.When Howard is returning to the building, Tom Riggins waits for him on a darkcorner and shoots him. Then Riggins returns to work, so that there would be nosuspicion of him.Howard is lying on the sidewalk unconscious. An automobile passes by and stops.Danny is returning home alone and sees Howard. She takes him to her house. Shebandages his wound. When he opens his eyes, she tells him that she loves him,that she will break her engagement to John Scott.But Howard remembers that he has to spend ten years in jail. He does not want toruin Danny’s life. He struggles with himself. He forces himself to look cold andindifferent, and saying that he does not love her, he leaves Danny and returnsto his building.He appears strong and steady, hiding his suffering from the wound, calmly takingcommand of the work again. Tom Riggins is terrified. Howard does not pay anyattention to him. They work late into the night. The workers areexhausted—Howard is not. At last, their patience ends, they refuse to work forthe “damned convict.” They declare they are going to strike and ask for anothersuperintendent. The big mob of workers gathers on the lower floor of thebuilding. They order Howard to give up his job.Then, alone before the threatening mob, Howard tears open his shirt, tears offthe bandage and shows the wound on his breast. He tells them that he is notgoing to denounce the criminal, that he only asks them to work, to finish thebuilding, for he has sacrificed his whole life for his skyscraper.The workers are stricken with a respectful awe, when they realize that Howardhas been working wounded. They hesitate. Jimmy, who is present, throws himselfto the defense of his friend, shouting to the mob that they are a “bunch ofyellow guys.” Some workers take Howard’s side. The others refuse.Then some policemen, attracted by the tumult, appear at the building. They askHoward what happened. Tom Riggins trembles. The workers are silent. Howardanswers calmly that nothing happened.When the policemen leave, a roar of enthusiasm greets Howard. The workers pushaway Riggins and his little group. Cheering, they surround Howard Kane, theirleader. And the work starts again, with an enthusiasm such as never before.Under Howard’s direction the building seems to grow, to rise toward the sky.Danny Day is dancing on the cabaret roof. He tries not to look down. He thinksonly of his skyscraper now.010 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_010_r1.jpg]Howard Kane’s building is finished. Only the wooden scaffolding that surroundsit still remains to be removed. The proud skyscraper towers over Broadway,before the admiring eyes of the [people below].Howard must return to jail that evening, for his bond has expired with thecompletion of his work. Alone in the building, he is taking a last look at it.Danny Day is going to her wedding, for this is her wedding day. She is riding inan automobile through New York’s streets. She cannot tear her eyes from theautomobile’s window. Above the roofs of the small houses, she sees in thedistance Howard Kane’s skyscraper. It appears behind every corner, in everyopening between the houses. It seems to follow her. She cannot stand it. Shegets out of the car and runs. But the skyscraper is still there, before her. Sheloves the buildings of Broadway. She feels so small and helpless at their feet.She feels for the first time all the majesty of the world’s greatest structures.And she is drawn irresistibly toward Howard’s skyscraper.She comes to the building and meets Howard. Both cannot hide their love anylonger. But they have to part. Howard goes to Mr. Clark to say farewell.Mr. Clark, however, has another plan. He tells Howard that he is so grateful forhis work that he is willing to lose the bond money and he asks him to run away.Howard agrees.Meanwhile, John Scott calls Tom Riggins. He is furious that the building hasbeen finished on time. He bribes Riggins to set fire to the wooden scaffolding.And Riggins does it.Howard and Danny are riding away in an automobile. They hear the newsboy shoutabout the police searching for the escaped Howard Kane. Then suddenly they see ared glow that sets the sky aflame and they see the burning skyscraper. Howardwants to save it. Danny implores him not to give himself up and to run away. Buthe rushes to his building.The skyscraper is a blazing tower of flames. The firemen are unable to stop thefire. The water hoses are helpless before the 700-foot-high flaming monster. Animmense crowd is gathered before the tremendous spectacle.Policemen rush to Howard when they see him. But he runs to the building andstarts climbing up, through the flames, to the water tower on top. He risesthrough the fire, climbing, falling, climbing again. It seems that all of NewYork is watching him breathlessly.Meanwhile, Tom Riggins is arrested, for he is suspected. He is terrified andannounces that John Scott is guilty of the fire, as well as the firstcatastrophe at the building.Howard reaches the water tower at the top. He releases the water. The buildingis saved.Far below, the crowd is cheering wildly for Howard Kane, the hero. Theskyscraper rises in the night like a victorious white column. His clothes,hanging in rags, his body burned and bleeding, Howard Kane is standing on top ofhis building, his head thrown back—just a man looking at the sky.[DeMille did produce The Skyscraper in 1928, starring William Boyd and AlanHale.

In order not to give away thestory, I have omitted one page of plot notes.]THE SIEGEEllen Darrow, her millionaire father Mr. Darrow, and her fiancé Dick Saundersare paying their last visit to Peking. The American Consul, their friend,advises them to leave China as soon as possible, for it is dangerous forforeigners to stay there with all the disorders and insurrections.Ellen has been noticed by a Chinaman of bad reputation, Jung-Tzan, who had seenher in a restaurant. She has been saved from him by the two Americans, who werepresent there. Mr. Darrow is very nervous and promises the Consul that they willleave tomorrow.They return to their hotel to spend the last night there. This hotel is a strongbuilding, reminiscent of a Chinese castle. It is situated in a picturesque butlonely spot among rivers and woods, miles from Peking. The manager is a Europeanand the residents are all Americans and Europeans, a very exclusive crowd ofsociety people. The only Chinaman in the place is the janitor.That night, when the lights of the hotel go out, a young American, KennethHartley, slips into the building through an open window. He isn’t a resident ofthe place. He’s just a crook and his aim is the safe in Mr. Darrow’s room.He is opening the safe when Ellen, in her room upstairs, hears the noise. Sherushes downstairs, revolver in hand, and stops Kenneth just as he had opened thesafe. Mr. Darrow and Dick Saunders arrive at her call. Kenneth is disarmed. Dickis about to put handcuffs on him, when they hear shots outside and a loudknocking at the door.The hotel is surrounded by a mob of Chinese bandits led by Jung-Tzan, Ellen’senemy. The terrified hotel guests are in a mad panic. They don’t know what to doand are too frightened to act. The only man that realizes the position isKenneth.In a few moments he organizes the defense of the hotel. All of the doors arestrong iron and most of the windows have iron bars and shutters. The residentshave quite a big supply of firearms. Kenneth assigns a post to every man in theplace.The Chinese mob attacks the hotel and the attack is forced back by the hotelguests, under Kenneth’s orders. Knowing that they can’t hold for a long time,Jung-Tzan orders his bandits to remain around the building in a regular siege.He had previously cut off all the hotel’s telephone wires. There isn’t a livingsoul for miles around. He knows that the place is in his power, with all themoney, jewels, and women in it.A few days pass. Kenneth is the supreme chief and dictator of the besiegedhotel. He leads the defense and the helpless society people know that theirlives are in his hands. There is not much food nor many weapons in the place fora long siege and Kenneth manages it, spending as little as possible.Dick Saunders is very drunk and jealous, for he notices a growing friendshipbetween Ellen and Kenneth. After one of the Chinese attacks, Kenneth is slightlywounded and Ellen bandages his wound. During that battle Ellen has seen andrecognized the Chinese chief, and it adds to the anxiety of Mr. Darrow, herfather.That night, Kenneth is watching over the hotel and surveying the Chinese camp.All seems quiet, when he suddenly sees two Chinamen climbing up the old stonewall towards Ellen’s window. He rushes to Ellen’s room and enters itnoiselessly. Ellen is asleep. For a moment he looks at her, forgetting theenemies and everything. Then, mastering himself, he goes to the window andshoots at the Chinamen, just as they are approaching. One is killed; theother—Jung-Tzan—runs away.Ellen wakes up and runs to Kenneth in terror. Then she realizes that she is inhis arms and steps away from him, just as her father and Dick rush in.The next morning, Kenneth finds a strange letter in his room. It is fromJung-Tzan. The Chinese chief tells Kenneth that he is the only one they fear andoffers him a big sum of money for surrendering the place. Kenneth throws theletter away disdainfully, wondering how it got there.That day, while putting iron bars on the window in Ellen’s room, Kenneth seesEllen and, forgetting himself, tries to take her in his arms. She tears herselffrom him. She does not speak to him that day, and tries to be especially tenderto her fiancé, Dick Saunders, as though to convince herself that she still loveshim. Kenneth is dark and silent, tortured by jealousy.The hotel guests notice it all. It worries them, and their worry changes toterror when one of them finds Jung-Tzan’s letter in Kenneth’s room. They areafraid that Kenneth will betray them. They call Ellen. They ask her to pretendto love Kenneth, to prevent him from surrendering the hotel. Ellen is indignant.But they all plead with her, asking her sacrifice to save them from a terriblefate. Even Dick Saunders does not object to it.Ellen agrees at last. She tries to convince herself that her task is moredisagreeable to her than she really feels it is.Meanwhile, as a last hope, Mr. Darrow decides to send the Chinese janitor toPeking, hoping that he might be able to slip through the Chinese lines andinform the American Consul. The janitor is let out through a little side door.In a short time, Ellen has conquered Kenneth. And when she is in his arms, whenshe loves him, she is afraid that she is not playing a part. But she does notwant to admit it to herself.Kenneth asks her to marry him right away, for he wants her and they cannot besure of the future, with the terrible danger hanging over them. Ellen struggleswith herself, then agrees.Mr. Darrow has to agree, too. Kenneth is radiant with happiness and tells themthat he is going straight forever.There is a priest among the hotel residents. Everything is ready for thewedding. The ceremony is about to start when there is a knock at the littledoor. The janitor returns. He announces that he has informed the Consul andAmerican soldiers are on their way to the hotel: they will be there in a coupleof hours.A roar of enthusiasm greets the news. Dick Saunders stops the wedding, says thatEllen does not have to play the part anymore. Ellen wants to protest, butcannot, for Kenneth is stricken with the discovery of her deception.And the guests’ attitude toward Kenneth changes. They don’t need him anymore.They are mocking and disdainful. To them, he is the crook again. They even puthandcuffs on him, but Ellen takes them off. Kenneth is too stricken to protestor say anything.Some of the guests run to the roof of the building and fire their last bulletsinto the air, as a signal to the coming soldiers.Kenneth is alone in a dark comer when the janitor approaches him. The janitor islaughing triumphantly. He tells Kenneth that he is in Jung-Tzan’s service andthe news is a fake, nobody is coming to the rescue, but that Jung-Tzan’s offerto Kenneth is still good and maybe he will accept it, now that he sees how hispeople have treated him.Kenneth runs to the cellar; there is no food left and hardly any bullets. Hereturns to the janitor and tells him to bring Jung-Tzan in secretly through thelittle side door to discuss his offer.Jung-Tzan comes. Kenneth says that he will agree to open the doors to him, undertwo conditions: first, Kenneth will be the master and the Chinese will obey hisorders; second, the woman, Ellen Darrow, will belong to him. Jung-Tzanhesitates, but finally agrees.In the evening, the hotel guests are all dressed in their best evening clothes,waiting for the soldiers, when Kenneth opens the doors and lets the Chinese mobin. It is a terrible scene. At Kenneth’s orders the guests are all madeprisoners in a few moments. They are horrified at Kenneth’s betrayal, whichseems so hideous. Kenneth orders them all to be locked in the hotel’s cellar andthe key brought to him.Ellen is the only one that is not locked. He takes her to his room. Shestruggles desperately, but he drags her roughly up the stairs, while theChinamen laugh.When they are alone in his room, Kenneth tells her that he brought her here onlybecause he could not trust Jung-Tzan. He explains that this was the only way tosave them all. He is going to let them all escape, in two of the Chinese trucks,while he will remain here and keep the Chinese from following them.Ellen is horrified. She does not want him to remain. She tells him how much sheloves him and they have a sincere love scene this time. But Kenneth has toremain to save the others. While the wild Chinese mob is robbing the house,breaking the safes and drinking the remaining wine, Kenneth leads all theprisoners to two trucks, parked in a lonely, dark spot, and they speed away. Heremains.He does all he can to keep the Chinamen from going into the cellar. He drinkswith them and tries to amuse them. Then Jung-Tzan suggests that they mustprepare tortures for the prisoners. Kenneth tries to keep them at it as long aspossible, inventing more and more tortures, but knowing that he is the only oneon whom they will be used.Finally, they grow impatient. He tells them that he has lost the cellar key.They go downstairs, they break the door. The cellar is empty.They rush to Kenneth. He faces them with a calm [expression].The hotel guests reach Peking. Mr. Darrow asks for American soldiers to be sentto the hotel immediately. He and Ellen go back to the hotel with them.Taken by surprise, the Chinese mob in the hotel surrenders immediately. Ellenruns madly through the rooms, searching for Kenneth. She finds him at last, tiedto a torture machine, but still alive. circa February 1928In 1928, at the age of twenty-three, AR made her first attempt in English toplan a novel. The working title was The Little Street.Its theme is that humanity—warped by a corrupt philosophy—is destroying the bestin man for the sake of enshrining mediocrity. By far AR’s most malevolent story,it provides a sharp contrast to the “benevolent universe” of the earlierscenarios, in which the hero is victorious. Here she is bitterly denouncing aworld that seems to have no place for heroism.Later, AR emphatically rejected the “malevolent universe” premise that evil ispowerful and the good helpless. But the premise does dominate The Little Street.What kind of factors may have led her temporarily to accept it?She grew up in Russia, a man-made model of a malevolent universe (see We theLiving). Then, in America, she was astonished to discover that the sameanti-life ideas that had destroyed Russia were on the rise here. The resultseems to have been periods ofprofound indignation, when AR felt that the wholeworld was dominated by evil and that she was a metaphysical outcast. It is fromthis perspective that the story was conceived.In her mature writings, AR stressed that she advocated rational selfishness, notthe whim-worshipping subjectivism of the man who says: “The good is whatever Iwant. ” She regarded the whim-worshipper with particular contempt, arguing thatsuch a man entirely lacks the virtue of selfishness (see “Selfishness Without aSelf” in Philosophy: Who Needs It). But in the following notes, AR is focused ona single question: whether a man is motivated to act for himself or forothers—and not on the epistemological issue of whether he acts by reason orwhim. Consequently, she praises any expression of egoism, even when it seems tobe the pseudo-egoism she would soon begin to denounce.Furthermore, AR has not yet distinguished clearly between the independent manand the man who seeks power over others (e.g., between a man like Howard Roarkand one like Gail Wynand). She writes admiringly of the strong individual whowants to “command, ” rather than “obey. ” Later she recognized that such achoice is a false alternative: “The choice is not self-sacrifice or domination.The choice is independence or dependence. ” The notes for The Little Street werewritten nearly eight years before she began work on The Fountainhead.Occasionally, AR describes certain fundamental attitudes or character traits as“innate” “ (e.g., her hero’s innate egoism). These passages contradict heradvocacy of free-will; it might appear that AR believed in some form ofbiological determinism. In fact, even in these early notes, her dominant premiseis that men are responsible for the ideas they choose to accept and the actionsthey choose to take. For example, she cites the ideas that have led to the moralcorruption in the world, and her implication throughout is that men can chooseto accept these ideas or not. She is inconsistent in this story, because shedoes not yet see the contradiction between free-will and innate virtues.All of the above confusions reflect the influence on the early AR of FriedrichNietzsche, whom she had read and admired, especially for his eloquent expressionof a heroic sense of life. There are several references to him in these notes.In due course, however, she discarded all these Nietzschean elements, anddefined “heroism ” in rational terms, by reference to her own distinctivephilosophy of Objectivism. For her final view of Nietzsche, see the introductionto the twenty-fifth anniversary edition of The Fountainhead and the title essayin For the New Intellectual.Despite the flawed statements, it is easy to recognize AR as the author of thefollowing notes. Her trademark—the reverence with which she regards man’s life,her intense passion for values—comes through clearly. In its combination ofvalue-passion and moral indignation, The Little Street is similar to AR’s earlyscreenplay Ideal (see The Early Ayn Rand).The notes also include AR’s earliest formulations on several key topics: hersense of life; the unity of thought and feeling which is experienced by a “clearmind”; the effect of the morality of sacrifice on self-esteem and moralambition; moral compromise as an unmitigated evil; the motivation ofa soul whoinsists that the meaning of one’s life is to be found outside oneself.At the age of twenty-three, AR knew that she was not ready to portray her idealman. Her goal here is less ambitious; she wants only to project her ideal man’ssense of life. The protagonist, Danny Renahan, is an independent,uncompromising, nineteen-year-old boy with a passionate hunger for life. Some ofDanny’s characteristics are based on an actual nineteen-year-old boy, WilliamEdward Hickman, who was the defendant in a highly publicized murder trial thathad just taken place in Los Angeles. Hickman was accused of kidnapping andmurdering a young girl. He was found guilty and sentenced to death in Februaryof 1928; he was hanged on October 20, 1928.Judging from the newspaper accounts of the time, Hickman was articulate andarrogant, and seems to have enjoyed shocking people by rejecting conventionalviews. The public furor against him was unprecedented. For reasons given in thefollowing notes, AR concluded that the intensity of the public’s hatred wasprimarily “because of the man who committed the crime and not because of thecrime he committed. ” The mob hated Hickman for his independence; she chose himas a model for the same reason.Hickman served as a model for Danny only in strictly limited respects, which ARnames in her notes. Danny does commit a crime in the story, but it is nothinglike Hickman’s. To guard against any misinterpretation, I quote her ownstatement regarding the relationship between her hero and Hickman:[My hero is] very far from him, of course. The outside of Hickman, but not theinside. Much deeper and much more. A Hickman with a purpose. And without thedegeneracy. It is more exact to say that the model is not Hickman, but whatHickman suggested to me.The Little Street is not the only early work ofAR’s in which she chose acriminal to symbolize an independent man. In her first play, The Night ofJanuary 16th, the hero commits financial fraud on a grand scale and thenattempts to escape by faking his own death. She explains her use of the heroiccriminal in the introduction to the play, written in 1968. Her comments areapplicable here.Night of January 16th is not a philosophical, but a sense of life play....This means that its events are not to be taken literally; they dramatize certainfundamental psychological characteristics, deliberately isolated and emphasizedin order to convey a single abstraction: the characters’ attitude toward life.The events serve to feature the motives of the characters’ actions, regardlessof the particular forms of the actions—i.e., the motives, not their specificconcretization. The events feature the confrontation of two extremes, twoopposite ways of facing existence: passionate self-assertiveness,self-confidence, ambition, audacity, independence—versus conventionality,servility, envy, hatred, power-lust.I do not think, nor did I think when I wrote this play, that a swindler is aheroic character or that a respectable banker is a villain. But for the purposeof dramatizing the conflict of independence versus conformity, a criminal—asocial outcast—can be an eloquent symbol. This, incidentally, is the reason ofthe profound appeal of the “noble crook” in fiction. He is the symbol of therebel as such, regardless of the kind of society he rebels against, thesymbol—for most people—of their vague, undefined, unrealized groping toward aconcept, or a shadowy image, of man’s self-esteem.That a career of crime is not, in fact, the way to implement one’s self-esteem,is irrelevant in sense-of-life terms. A sense of life is concerned mainly withconsciousness, not with existence—or rather: with the way a man’s consciousnessfaces existence. It is concerned with a basic frame of mind, not with rules ofconduct.If this play’s sense of life were to be verbalized, it would say, in effect:‘Your life, your achievement, your happiness, your person are of paramountimportance. Live up to your highest vision of yourself no matter whatcircumstances you might encounter. An exalted view of self-esteem is a man’smost admirable quality.’ How one is to live up to this vision—how this frame ofmind is to be implemented in action and in reality—is a question that a sense oflife cannot answer: that is the task of philosophy.AR did not get far in planning The Little Street. The project was too alien toher deepest premises. The notes are undated, but it seems likely that they weremade over a short period when she was feeling particularly bitter toward theworld. This was not a novel that she could have written; to her, the purpose offiction writing is not to denounce that which one despises, but to exalt thatwhich one admires.THE LITTLE STREETThe world as it is.Show it all, calmly and indifferently, like an outsider who does not sharehumanity’s feelings or prejudices and can see it all “from the side.”Show all the filth, stupidity, and horror of the world, along with that which issupposed to atone for it. Show how insignificant, petty, and miserable the“good” in the world is, compared to the real horror it masks. Do not paint oneside of the world, the polite side, and be silent about the rest; paint a realpicture of the whole, good and bad at once, the “good” looking more horrid thanthe bad when seen together with the things it tolerates. Men see only one partof life at a time, the part they have before their eyes at the moment. Show themthe whole.Show that humanity is petty. That it’s small. That it’s dumb, with the heavy,hopeless stupidity of a man born feeble-minded, who does not understand, becausehe cannot understand, because he hasn’t the capacity to understand; like a manborn blind, who cannot see, because he has no organ for seeing.Show that the world is monstrously hypocritical. That humanity has noconvictions of any kind. That it does not know how to believe anything. That ithas never believed consistently and does not know how to be true to any idea orideal. That all the “high ” words of the world are a monstrous lie. That nobodybelieves in anything “high” and nobody wants to believe. That one cannot believeone thing and do another, for such a belief isn’t worth a nickel. And that’swhat humanity is doing.Show that humanity is utterly illogical, like an animal that cannot connecttogether the things it observes. Man realizes and connects much more than ananimal, but who can declare that his ability to connect things is perfect? Thefuture, higher type of man will have to perfect just this ability [to achieve]the clear vision. A clear mind sees things and the connections between them.Humanity is stumbling helplessly in a chaos of inconsistent ideas, actions, andfeelings that can’t be put together, without even realizing the contradictionsbetween them or their ultimate logical results.A perfect, clear understanding also means a feeling. It isn’t enough to realizea thing is true. The realization must be so clear that one feels this truth. Formen act on feelings, not on thoughts. Every thought should be part of yourself,your body, your nature, and every part of your nature should be a thought. Everyfeeling—a thought, every thought—a feeling. [This is AR ’s earliest statementregarding the harmony of reason and emotion that follows from a properintegration of mind and body.]Show the silent terror that is life at present, the silent terror that hangsover us, chokes us, that everybody feels and nobody can define, the namelessthing that is the atmosphere of humanity.Show that the mob determines life at present and show exactly who and what thatmob is. Show the things it breaks, the precious enemies that it ruins. Show thatall humanity and each little citizen is an octopus that consciously orunconsciously sucks the blood of the best on earth and strangles life with itscold, sticky tentacles.Show that the world is nothing but a little street. That this little street isits king and master, its essence and spirit. Show the little street and how itworks.Religion: show what it means when thought out consistently; what it does to man;who needs it; who defends it with all the ferocious despotism of a small,ambitious nature. The great poison of mankind.Morals (as connected with religion): the real reason for all hypocrisy. Thewrecking of man by teaching him ideals that are contrary to his nature; idealshe has to accept as his highest ambition, even though they are organicallyhateful and repulsive to him. And when he can’t doubt them, he doubts himself.He becomes low, sinful, imperfect in his own eyes; he does not aspire toanything high, when he knows that the high is inaccessible and alien to him.Humanity’s morals and ideals, its ideology, are the greatest of its crimes.(“Unselfishness” first of all.)Communism, democracy, socialism are the logical results of present-day humanity.The nameless horror of [these systems], both in their logical end and in theunconscious way that they already rule mankind.Family-life: the glorification of mediocrity. Elevating the “everyday” littleman’s existence into the highest ideal for mankind.Show that humanity has and wants to have: existence instead of life,satisfaction instead of joy, contentment instead of happiness, security insteadof power, vanity instead of pride, attachment instead of love, wish instead ofwill, yearning instead of passion, a glow-worm instead of a fire.All the “realistic” books have shown the bad side of life and, as good, haveshown the good of today. They have denounced that which is accepted as bad andset up as a relief or example that which is accepted as good. I want to showthat there is no good at present, that the “good” as it is now understood isworse than the bad, that it is only the result, the skin over a rotten insidethat rules and determines it. I want to show that all the conceptions of the“good,” all the high ideals, have to be changed, for now they are nothing butpuppets, slaves and accomplices to the horrible [stifling] of life. There aretoo many things that people just tolerate and don’t talk about. Show them thatit can’t be tolerated, for all their life is a rotten swamp, a sewer, a dumpingplace for more filth than they can ever realize.Show that the real God behind all their high words and sentiments, the realomnipotent power behind their culture and civilization, is the little street,just a small, filthy, shabby, common little street, such as exist around thecenter of every town in the world.Show them the real, one and only horror—the horror of mediocrity.THE CHARACTERSDanny Renahan. The boy.He is born with the spirit of Argon and the nature of a medieval feudal lord.Imperious. Impatient. Uncompromising. Untamable. Intolerant. Unadaptable.Passionate. Intensely proud. Superior to the mob and intensely, almost painfullyconscious of it. Restless. High-strung. An extreme “extremist.” A clear, strong,brilliant mind. An egoist, in the best sense of the word.He is born in a small town, into a poor, very average family. He grows uplonely, hating everybody and being hated by everybody. (?) Very unpopular inschool—for his imperious, masterful character. No love-affairs or drinks. Toostraightforward and too absolute for the rest of the boys. Dangerous, too.People don’t trust him, instinctively, feeling him to be an “outsider.”Show his battle with the world. He is too impatient to toil slowly through theyears for the things he wants. Too uncompromising to succeed in the way of thepopular young men who know how to get along with those in power. Too intolerantto “get along” with anybody. Too passionate not to burn with disgust for life ashe sees it and with humiliation at not being above the mob, crushing it underhis feet, giving it orders instead of trying to satisfy it, of crawling beforeit for its good graces. He is unable to understand how he can act and live as anequal with those he knows to be inferior to him, those he despises and has aright to despise. More passionate than strong. Daring and courageous; butwithout the patient courage that can fight through, slowly, against disgust. Aman that can slash with an [ax], but can’t saw patiently. Too brilliant andfiery a nature to be able to handle any “job” and make money. Crushed by astupid, ignoble poverty. Too restless and innately, unconsciously romantic to“make good” in the way of the model, average, hard-working young man.As a result, he is perfectly cynical. Stone-hard. Monstrously cruel. Brazenlydaring. No respect for anything or anyone.He is medium height and slender. Has strong, rather irregular features, asthough cut by quick, sharp blows. Not a beautiful face at all but fascinatingbecause of its strength. Deep, dark eyes, dark more through their expressionthan through the color, burning with the intense fire of a strong, restlesssoul. His gaze is piercing and threatening under two straight, severe eye-brows.Rather frightful eyes, that make people feel uneasy. He has a large mouth, likea wound slashed in his face. The lower lip is thicker than the upper. He has ahabit of an ugly grin that twists his mouth so that one comer only is raised andthe upper lip curled, as in a snarl, which gives him an expression of disgustedcruelty.He has a brilliant sense of humor. Rather a cruel, sardonic kind of humor. Beingconscious of his superiority to the rest of mankind, he cannot help seeing theirabsurd, ridiculous, idiotic smallness. He has no respect for anything; thereforehe can laugh at everything and approach all things lightly, with an attitude ofsuperior disdain. His mind is brilliant enough to see the ridiculous side ofeverything. He gets immense enjoyment from shocking people, amusing them withhis cynicism, [ridiculing] before their eyes the most sacred, venerated,established ideas. He takes a real delight in opposing people, in fighting andterrifying them. He has no ambition to be a benefactor or a popular hero formankind. [...] Subconsciously, this is the result of a noble feeling ofsuperiority, which knows that to be loved by the mob is an insult and that to behated is the highest compliment it can pay you.He is born with a wonderful, free, light consciousness—[resulting from] theabsolute lack of social instinct or herd feeling. He does not understand,because he has no organ for understanding, the necessity, meaning or importanceof other people. (One instance when it is blessed not to have an organ ofunderstanding.) Other people do not exist for him and he does not understand whythey should. He knows himself—and that is enough. Other people have no right, nohold, no interest or influence on him. And this is not affected or chosen—it’sinborn, absolute, it can’t be changed, he has “no organ” to be otherwise. Inthis respect, he has the true, innate psychology of a Superman. He can neverrealize and feel “other people.” (That’s what I meant by thoughts as feelings,as part of your nature.) (It is wisdom to be dumb about certain things.)[William Edward] Hickman said: “I am like the state: what is good for me isright.” That is this boy’s psychology. (The best and strongest expression of areal man’s psychology I ever heard.) The model for the boy is Hickman. Very farfrom him, of course. The outside of Hickman, but not the inside. Much deeper andmuch more. A Hickman with a purpose. And without the degeneracy. It is moreexact to say that the model is not Hickman, but what Hickman suggested to me.The boy is a perfectly straight being, unbending and uncompromising. He cannotbe a hypocrite. He shows how impossible it is for a genuinely beautiful soul tosucceed at present; for in all [aspects of] modern life, one has to be ahypocrite, to bend and tolerate. This boy wanted to command and smash awaythings and people he didn’t approve of. He could not compromise with that whichhe despised and knew he had a right to despise. All life is compromising, atpresent. A man that could not compromise.At the end, when his last appeal has been refused and the execution awaits him,he throws away all protective hypocrisy and shouts to his jailers and thenewspaper reporters what he thinks of the world. It must be the essence, thevery heart of the book: his wild, ferocious cry. It must be the strongest speechever uttered in condemnation of the world. It must strike people like a whipslapping them in the face. It must be scalding in its bloody suffering, like theyell of an animal with an open, torn wound.He has a wonderful “sense of living.” He realizes that he is living, heappreciates every minute of it, he wants to live every second, he is unable toexist as other men do. He doesn’t take life for granted and live as he happensto be living—just calm, satisfied, normal. For him, life [must be] strong, highemotion; he has to live “on top,” “breathing” life, tense, exalted, active. Hecannot spend eight hours each day on work he despises and does not need. Hecannot understand men spending their lives on some work and not liking thatwork, not doing with it what they please. He knows that he wants to live andthat the whole damn world hasn’t the right to deprive him of it!He doesn’t have people’s attitude toward life, that is, the general way ofexisting calmly day to day and [experiencing] something strong and exalting onlyonce in a while, as an exception. “Everyday life ”does not exist for him. Hisnormal state is to be exalted, all the time; he wants all of his life to behigh, supreme, full of meaning.All this is unconscious in him. He cannot reason it out and explain it. It’sunconscious, because it’s innate, it’s his natural state of mind, it’s organicin him, and he cannot realize it, because he cannot quite understand the commonattitude toward life, which is too monstrous for his Superman’s consciousness[to grasp].He half-consciously realizes that he possesses something sublime, and that he isgoing to be condemned for possessing it. From this—his tense, wild, ferociousattitude.Most people lack [the capacity for] reverence and “taking things seriously. ”They do not hold anything to be very serious or profound. There is nothing thatis sacred or immensely important to them. There is nothing—no idea, object,work, or person—that can inspire them with a profound, intense, andall-absorbing passion that reaches to the roots of their souls. They do not knowhow to value or desire. They cannot give themselves entirely to anything. Thereis nothing absolute about them. They take all things lightly, easily,pleasantly—almost indifferently, in that they can have it or not, they do notclaim it as their absolute necessity. Anything strong and intense, passionateand absolute, anything that can’t be taken with a snickering little “sense ofhumor”—is too big, too hard, too uncomfortable for them. They are too small andweak to feel with all their soul—and they disapprove of such feelings. They aretoo small and low for a loyal, profound reverence—and they disapprove of allsuch reverence. They are too small and profane themselves to know whatsacredness is—and they disapprove of anything being too sacred.The boy is just their opposite. He is all passion, will, and uncompro misedabsolutes. He takes everything seriously. Life is very serious and sacred tohim. And, as Nietzsche said: “The noble soul has reverence for itself.” He has aprofound reverence for himself, a determination to keep himself and his lifeclean, untouched, and beautiful, because they are the most sacred of all sacredthings. And when he wants something—he wants it.The tragedy of a man with the consciousness of a god, among a bunch ofsnickering, giggling, dirty-story-telling, good-timing, jolly, regular fellows.All this is quite unconscious in the boy. He does not and cannot recognize it.He is too much of an “outsider” to understand the “inside.” He understands onlyenough to hate and despise it, as only he can hate and despise.The boy has a marvelous, fascinating laugh. I must describe it in the beginningof the story, as Danny’s introduction: a clear, ringing laugh, the laugh of anunhesitating, unquestionable joy, the laugh of a sunny soul, the laugh of thereal life itself. That laugh must show more than anything else what that boy isand what they are destroying.The probable story: he is unjustly hurt and deeply insulted by a popular,“respectable” pastor, who is a condensed representative of the “little street.”[The injustice is such] that it damages, if not ruins, his life and career. Hemurders the pastor, as a revenge. The public is horrified, for the pastor was avery popular, “beloved” figure. The crime takes the aspect of a blow against thechurch, religion, civilization, humanity, etc. “The greatest crime ever...”The boy is alone against all of society. He is everybody’s personal, hatedenemy. He is caught, tried, and condemned to death. He escapes from jail. He isrecognized on the outskirts of the town by a sneaky little man with a shiny oldcoat, protruding chin, tobacco-stained yellow lips and bad teeth. He issurrounded by a mob and lynched. Torn to pieces, beaten to death on the pavementwith the water of the gutter running red.The story ends with Hetty, the girl who loved him, going to a grocery store on arainy November evening, sent by her mother to buy some hamburger and ten centsworth of chopped pickles.And the last cry of the story, as the girl looks at the little street:“I’m afraid, Mother, I’m afraid!” Hetty, the girl.A clear, straight soul. Like the “Prince-Flower.” [AR may be referring to aGrimms’ fairy tale, The Carnation, in which a beautiful girl is turnedtemporarily into a flower by a prince.] Very sensitive. Lonely. Not a strong,ambitious career woman, but—a woman. Bewildered by life. Unable to adapt herselfto things as they are. In the end, left aimless, with nothing to live for and aterror of living—showing how empty a place this world is for one who does notand cannot share its vices and vicious virtues.She is the only daughter of a stupid, indifferent father and a petty, [pushy],house-wife mother. The household is rather poor—it has too much to be shabby andnot enough to have any education or refinement.She loves the boy with a wilder passion than she can realize. She is usually toocalm, restrained and frail to think herself capable of such a primitive, rawfeeling, almost beast-like in its overwhelming [intensity]. She is the only onewho feels the Super-Being in the boy, feels it, without completely understandingit. She is frightened by him sometimes, but she is always ready to take his sideagainst everybody. She might sometimes think he is wrong, but she always feelshe is right. Her antagonism to common life, her infinite longing for somethingabove it, centers on him, as the only relief from it she has ever met. She isnot a strong, active, fighting enemy of that life. She does not even fullyrealize [the nature of] that life, because she is straight, honest, and “outsideof it.” But she feels, blindly and instinctively, the horror of that life andshe feels the boy is the only one who is so far and so high above it. Withouther realizing it, her love for him is her love for life—her religion, hope,ambition, pride, and future—all these things having no particular meaning toher, the intensity of her feeling centered on one thing: him.The whole of her tragedy is brought out in the last scene. He escapes from jailafter being sentenced to death, and comes to her because she is the only personhe can trust. But he is [forced to leave] her house; her mother is threateningto call the police and her father is expected to return home any moment andwould be sure to denounce the criminal who is loathed by all mankind. In thesemoments, when she sees herself alone against the world, when she sees herself solittle and helpless in facing the monster of humanity, when she sees the octopusthat has caught in its sucking [tentacles] the one who is sacred beyond allsacredness to her—then she understands life for the first time. (And so must myreaders.)(The model for the girl: the “Prince-Flower,” qua modem; and myself, quaweak—the idealistic, longing side of me.)She is medium height, very slim, rather frail. Not beautiful, but exquisite inher own way. Thin features. Brown hair. Gray eyes with long eyelashes. Afascinating smile that makes her look beautiful: a very feminine, delicate, andtempting smile.The boy is not in love with her. He has never been in love. But he knows thatshe loves him. And he feels something like love, although it is more physicaldesire in the last scene when he kisses her wildly; he is feeling the call oflife, when he is so near to losing it.Just as the boy [embodies] the perfect egoism and will to live—the girl[embodies] the perfect love, the kind of overwhelming, intense, absolute passionthat is so alien, so out-of-place on the “little street.” To her the so-calledlove problems have always been utterly impossible to understand. She doesn’tunderstand any tragedies of marriage, parents’ opposition, social obstacles andsuch. The love that she knows is something so immense, so dominant, sounquestionable, that she cannot see anything being considered beside it oropposed to it.As a relief for the whole book, the few moments that she spends with him when heis hiding in her house, when they kiss each other for the first and last time,must be trembling with the intensity, joy, and ecstasy of life. This scene mustshow what is possible and what is being destroyed by the little street. Thestronger the contrast, the better. The reader must feel an actual pain, and thewild desire to yell for something that can’t be explained in words—the life thatno one knows. The Pastor[An early version of Ellsworth Toohey in The Fountainhead.]He has everything that “the little street” has and nothing that it should have.A small soul choked with a poisonous ambition to dominate and crush everybodyand everything. Not the kind of passion for power that says: “I want to rulebecause I know that I am superior to others and I must dominate them”; but thekind that says: “I know that I am inferior and therefore I don’t want to letanything superior exist.” This is subconscious, of course, because one of thosemuddy souls would never admit it to itself. Consciously, it believes that “weare all equal” and defends that equality with all the jealous, greedy zeal of abulldog that has his teeth sunk into a piece of meat; the dull, despotic zeal ofmediocrity that is [concerned with] the equality of those above, which it wantsto pull down, and not with those below, which it [allegedly] wants to pull up.The pastor has no idea out of the ordinary, the common, the established and hedoes not want any such ideas to exist. He is not a clever hypocrite thatdespises the mob and only plays up to it to attain his own aim. He is thelowest, most poisonous, most dangerous type—the ambitious mediocrity. He wantsto believe that the mob he serves really is the ruler and the lord of the world.He has no aim outside of that mob. He wants to believe that the mob’s ideas arethe standards of the universe; that he is absolutely right in his petty, narrowlittle convictions; that everybody must not only obey these ideas, but actuallybelieve them.He knows how much of a blood brother he is to the mob. He also knows that thereare those who stand far above it, and he wants to drag them down to the level ofthe mob, where he is the master [because he is] the best, “condensed”representative of that mob. He’s a devastating picture of a dull, diseasedambition that has filled [an otherwise] empty soul. The ambition of a skunk thatknows the bad smell is his only strength and therefore makes it the highestprinciple of life on earth.His ideas are the means for “equality,” for bringing higher men down to hislevel. His thinking is muddy enough to [demand] an absolute obedience to theseideas from others, but not from himself. He isn’t above having filthy littlelove affairs, accepting money when doing so is quite safe although not quiteclean, and forgiving in his “friends” the sins for which he would destroy an“enemy” (i.e., an “outsider”).He is tall and rather flabby, although he gives the impression of being thin.Has a narrow, lined, yellowish face with the proud, austere expression of asaint. He has little, damp, lusty eyes and the thin, dry lips of a coldhypocrite. He has white hands with short, fat fingers and shapeless fingernailsthat are more wide than long. Likes to wear rings. Has thin, straight hair whichis beginning to gray, with a bald spot showing rosy and soft like the flesh of ababy. He has a deep, slow, dignified voice and a hee-hee-ing, indecent,insincere laugh.He is a very prominent figure. Especially popular among the semi-literate lowerclasses, the ones that are always ready to fall for religious preaching. Tosome, he is a beloved and respected “father”; others are rather indifferentthemselves, but will not tolerate any disrespect or disbelief of him and arealways ready to defend him furiously against anyone doubting his authority. Thebusiness magnates and such despise him and feel an instinctive disgust towardhim, but they have to tolerate and stay on good terms with him for fear of hisdark, “backstage” power.He hates all successful people. A successful man, in any line, is his personalenemy. He rejoices at every failure and at the fall of every idol.(The model for the pastor: the pastor of the Ku Klux Klan that I read about. Themovie censors. All “reformers.” An endless list of “little street‘ers” that Iwill note down as they come.) [Other Characters]A fat woman that has made her immense fortune by having bad houses [houses ofprostitution]. An influential, respectable citizen. Very proudly conscious ofher power. Ambitious to get or buy everything she wants. Convinced that there isnothing so high that she cannot get it. She marries a brilliant, aristocratic,divinely handsome young man, Eric “Goldenlocks.” Marries him because she “canafford to have a pretty boy in her bed” if she wants one.Eric is poor, ambitious, conceited and not very strong. He just sells himself,marrying her for her money, knowing all about her and the source of her fortune.He is tall, with blue eyes, golden hair and all the Siegfried like, fresh,sparkling beauty of a snow-covered Scandinavian mountain peak on a sunnymorning. He marries the woman. We see him later, with a heavy, flabby, ghastlywhite face, red eyelids, shiny nose, sagging double-chin, unkempt hair, muddled,expressionless eyes and the reputation of a chronic drunkard.He had been in love, before his marriage, with a charming, brilliant girl froman old family, now poor and barely keeping up a decent appearance to support thedignity of their name. His marriage to the woman is a terrible blow to the girl.A middle-aged nouveau riche, a heavy, common brute, had been courting her in hisambition to possess something he felt to be so above him, a woman of the realaristocracy. She marries him now—in despair. We see her later, overdressed in anexpensive and tasteless way, having for a lover a cheap, notorious“heartbreaker.” A little detail: before all this, a young college girl—romantic,sensitive, but not very attractive—has committed suicide over her hopeless lovefor the handsome Eric “Goldenlocks.”A genius gone wrong. A handsome, brilliant young actor with a fine mind and abeautiful soul. Famous and successful, but gone wrong in that he is genuinelyunhappy; his life is empty of desires or interests; he is cynical, tired,disgusted with everything—inside. Outside—he leads a wild life full of vice. Heis not clear to himself, there is a continual chaos in his mind, regardinghimself and the world. He does not know what he lives for or why he lives. Hedoes not care—in an immense sense. An example of a fine frame that the littlestreet has filled with its rotten content. Instinctively, he does not accept[the little street’s view of life], he revolts against it—but he has no other.And it is too late for another. He shows how empty the little street’s idealsare and what a wreck they make of an exceptional being. For they can’t fill sucha soul and they do not permit the [ideals] that could fill it. He is utterlycynical and does not believe in anything. He could not accept the littlestreet’s beliefs; they only killed in him all belief in believing.The boy of the story shows how the little street wrecks an existing exceptionalbeing. The actor shows how it wrecks such a being before he develops. The boy isan exceptional nature, and he is wrecked physically. The actor isn‘t, but couldhave been, and he is wrecked spiritually. The boy is a wonderful character, inspite of everything. The actor is not, but shows signs of what he might havebeen. The boy has his ego, his pride, his strength. The actor hasn’t anything.He does not even respect himself. He is despicable sometimes, and does not care.He is as empty of any high interest or feelings as a human being can be.A “philosophical” prostitute. A creature that lives for one thing only and doesnot want to see anything else. Perfectly satisfied and proud of herself. Shelooks at things straight, realizes her power and is proud. The femalerepresentative of the little street—to match with the pastor. Except that she ismore honest than the pastor. She sees the world as it is and laughs at all thehigh words and ideals. She knows their worth. She has no “high ideals.” She isopenly rotten and satisfied with it, for the world is rotten and she has a rightto say it. She is the voice of the little street when she says: that she is thereal queen of life; that “decent” women have to share their men with her and besatisfied with what she leaves; that men’s respect for their “respectable” womenisn’t worth a penny; that there is no man too high for her bed; that nothing ishigher for men than what she gives them; and so on. She is a filthy creature whospits on all the high ideals of humanity and has a right to do it. For she doesnot lie. She only looks at things as they are and states the facts that the“decent people” are hypocritical enough to overlook and tolerate.013 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_013_r1.jpg]THINGS THAT WILL HAVE TO BE SHOWN AND HAVE CHARACTERS TO REPRESENT THEMSex filth.

Everything must be taken from life. I do not want it to be my furiousprotest against humanity—made up in my imagination. It has to be true, just lifeas it is, which is far worse than I could ever invent. The only thing I can doin the story is to put it all together, to show the whole, to bring things alittle closer to each other, allowing people to see the close relation betweenthe “good” and the horror of their lives.THE HICKMAN CASEThe first thing that impresses me about the case is the ferocious rage of thewhole society against one man. No matter what the man did, there is alwayssomething loathsome in the “virtuous” indignation and mass-hatred of the“majority.” One always feels the stuffy, bloodthirsty emotion of a mob in anygreat public feeling of a large number of humans. It is repulsive to see allthose beings with worse sins and crimes in their own lives, virtuouslycondemning a criminal, proud and secure in their number, yelling furiously indefense of society.This is not just the case of a terrible crime. It is not the crime alone thathas raised that fury of public hatred. It is the case of a daring challenge tosociety. It is the fact that a crime has been committed by one man, alone; thatthis man knew it was against all laws of humanity and intended it that way; thathe does not want to recognize it as a crime and that he feels superior to all.It is the amazing picture of a man with no regard whatever for all that societyholds sacred, and with a consciousness all his own. A man who really standsalone, in action and in soul.A mob’s feeling of omnipotence is its most jealously guarded possession andtherefore a dangerous thing to wound. The mob can forgive any insult or crimeexcept one: [the act of] challenging its ultimate power. It can forgive acriminal who erred, but who is just one of itself, i.e., has the same soul andideas and bends to the same gods. But to see a man who has freed himself from itentirely, who has nothing in common with it, a man who does not need it and whoopenly disdains it—this is the one crime a mob can never forgive.It seems to me that the mob is more jealous to possess a man’s soul than hisbody. It is the spiritual despotism that is so dear to it. It does not carewhether it [physically] possesses a man, as long as the man acknowledges tohimself that he belongs to it. It cannot stand to see a man who does not belongand knows it. That tyrannical monster, the mob, feels the helpless fury ofimpotence in the presence of the one thing beyond its power, that it cannotconquer, the only thing that counts—a man’s own soul and consciousness. And whenthe mob sees one of these rare, free, clear spirits, over which it has nocontrol—then we have the [spectacle] of a roaring, passionate public hatred.Worse crimes than this have been committed. Not one has ever raised such furiousindignation. Why? Because of the man who committed the crime and not because ofthe crime he has committed. Because of Hickman’s brazenly challenging attitude.[It can be seen in] his strange letters, which are a little theatricallymelodramatic, but so boastful and self-confident, e.g.: “If you want helpagainst me, ask God, not men,” signed “The Fox.” [It can be seen in] his utterremorselessness; his pride in his criminal career and in things that areconsidered a “disgrace”; his boasting of more and more crimes and his open joyat shocking people, instead of trying to implore their sympathy; his utter lackof anything that is considered a “virtue”; his strength, as shown in hisunprecedented conduct during his trial and sentencing; his calm, superior,indifferent, disdainful countenance, which is like an open challenge tosociety—shouting to it that it cannot break him; his immense, explicit egoism—athing the mob never forgives; and his cleverness, which makes the mob feel thata superior mind can exist entirely outside of its established morals.No: [the reaction to] this case is not moral indignation at a terrible crime. Itis the mob’s murderous desire to revenge its hurt vanity against a man who daredto be alone. It is a case of “we” against “him.”And when we look at the other side of it—there is a brilliant, unusual,exceptional boy turned into a purposeless monster. By whom? By what? Is it notby that very society that is now yelling so virtuously in its role of innocentvictim? He had a brilliant mind, a romantic, adventurous, impatient soul and astraight, uncompromising, proud character. What had society to offer him? Awretched, insane family as the ideal home, a Y.M.C.A. club as social honor, anda bank-page job as ambition and career. And it is not the petty financial miseryof these that I have in mind. They are representative of all that society has tooffer: a high social standing and a million-dollar business position isessentially the same Y.M.C.A. club and bank-page job, merely more of the same.If he had any desires and ambitions—what was the way before him? A long, slow,soul-eating, heart-wrecking toil and struggle; a degrading, ignoble road ofsilent pain and loud compromises. Succeed? How could he succeed? How do mensucceed? By begging successfully for the good graces of the society they mustserve. And if he could not serve? If he didn’t know how to beg? It’s a long andtortuous road that an exceptional man must travel in this society. It requires asteel-strength that can overcome disgust, which is a worse enemy than fear, andalso a steel-hypocrisy, the patient art of hiding oneself when it is wise not tobe seen.A strong man can eventually trample society under his feet. That boy was notstrong enough. But is that his crime? Is it his crime that he was too impatient,fiery and proud to go that slow way? That he was not able to serve, when he feltworthy to rule; to obey, when he wanted to command? That boy could not get alongwith the men that society forgives and tolerates. He could not get along withthe majority. He could not lick boots—and one can’t succeed without lickingboots. He was superior and he wanted to live as such—and this is the one thingsociety does not permit.He was given [nothing with which] to fill his life. What was he offered to fillhis soul? The petty, narrow, inconsistent, hypocritical ideology of present-dayhumanity. All the criminal, ludicrous, tragic nonsense of Christianity and itsmorals, virtues, and consequences. Is it any wonder that he didn’t accept it?That it left his soul emptier than it had been before? That boy does not believein anything. But, oh! men, have you anything to believe in? Can you offeranything to be believed? He is a monster in his cruelty and disrespect of allthings. But is there anything to be respected? He does not know what love means.But what is it that is worthy of being loved?Yes, he is a monster—now. But the worse he is, the worst must be the cause thatdrove him to this. Isn’t it significant that society was not able to fill thelife of an exceptional, intelligent boy, to give him anything to out-balancecrime in his eyes? If society is horrified at his crime, it should be horrifiedat the crime’s ultimate cause: itself. The worse the crime—the greater itsguilt. What could society answer, if that boy were to say: “Yes, I’m a monstrouscriminal, but what are you?”This is what I think of the case. I am afraid that I idealize Hickman and thathe might not be this at all. In fact, he probably isn’t. But it does not makeany difference. If he isn‘t, he could be, and that’s enough. The reaction ofsociety would be the same, if not worse, toward the Hickman I have in mind. Thiscase showed me how society can wreck an exceptional being, and then murder himfor being the wreck that it itself has created. This will be the story of theboy in my book.FACTS AND DETAILS THAT WILL BE USEFUL TO METhe insistent efforts of the newspapers to represent Hickman as a coward, tobreak down the impression of his strength and daring. Immediately after hisarrest the papers were full of articles about his being “yellow,” his “breakingdown,” his “hysterical fear,” his “white face,” his appearance of being “a ratinstead of a Fox,” and so on, all insisting that even if he seems calm, hereally isn‘t, he must be in a deadly terror. This might or might not have beentrue. Probably not, judging from his later behavior. Perhaps he was pretendingto be insane. But the insistent way in which the papers shouted about his being“yellow” seemed to be a mad, furious attempt to degrade him, to take away anyheroic appearance he might have had, to make the public think that they hadsucceeded in breaking him, while they really had not. It was as though itinfuriated them to see strength, pride, and courage in this criminal and to seethat they could not break him; it seemed to be the mob’s subconscious fury atthe sight of such virtues in its enemy. To humiliate, to throw down—that is themob’s greatest delight. (It’s going to be so in the story, after the boy’sarrest.) The jury. Average, everyday, rather stupid looking citizens. Shabbily dressed,dried, worn looking little men. Fat, overdressed, very average, “dignified”housewives. How can they decide the fate of that boy? Or anyone’s fate? If a manhas to be judged, why can’t he be judged by his superiors, who alone would havea right to do it? Why does he have to be judged by “equals” (and what“equals”!)? (In the story, I must select my jurors very carefully. One or twowill have to be prominent characters whom the readers know very well, includingall sides of their natures and their own unpunished crimes against society.Several will have to be incidental “background” characters—with enough of themshown to see what “good citizens” they are. The rest will be described by theirlooks—which is plenty. The whole must make a nice picture of society’srepresentatives, who sit in judgment over the boy even though they are notworthy to lace his shoes.) Asa Keyes, the prosecutor. His [lack of] honesty and conviction was clearlydemonstrated in the shady, disgraceful case of Amy MacPherson. Shameful chargeswere directed at him immediately before the Hickman case. A fat,overindulgent-looking man, with an owl-like nose, narrow little eyes, a big,heavy face and double-chin, a grayish-yellow complexion, a balding head withgreasy hair, and the booming voice of a bully, giving an impression of a fatseal or a bull-dog. He made an unintelligent speech, full of common platitudes,showing a complete lack of any imagination or originality. He had the nerve tospeak in defense of the people, the country, the world and so on! And he had theright to yell about Hickman: “He is rotten, rotten!” All of this is a good example of my “little street” idea. I kept the clipping ofhis speech, as a wonderful example of how the little street talks, almostexaggeratedly good, couldn’t be better if I had written it for him.(In the story, the prosecutor will have to be a rather prominent character, witha shady case on his hands, right before the boy’s case, with all thecharacteristics of this one—and more!) The public who attended the trial. Average citizenry in all its full bloom.Women and girls—silly, homely, uninteresting and insignificant, over-rouged,just utterly blank in every way. Old-fashioned little women—shabbily dressed,wrinkled and shriveled. God knows from where and why here. “Fellows” with “theirgirls.” Men of all ages and of every profession, high and low, mostly low.Newspaper women with the conceited vanity and superior dignity of mediocrityfeeling its importance, of workers smaller than their jobs. The common womanwith ugly clothes, a fat, soft white face, and religious pins, a “kitchen-sink”type, who looked on everyday and declared that she had been to all the murdertrials. The barefooted, robed “hermit” with a white beard, “Prophet Jonas”written in white oil-paint on a band around his head, and a red banner ofprayers in his hand, who claimed that he was a messenger from Jesus Christ, sentto attend the trial. The fat, tall woman in brown with a mustache and asuspiciously kind voice and manner. The young man with the horse’s teeth, whowas “just curious.” And so on. These are the ones I saw. The list can beprolonged indefinitely. The circus show that the mob enjoys when it has aplaything that is going to be murdered.Harry Carr and his superb indignation at Hickman. (More about him later. I musthave a journalist like that in the story, a composite of Harry Carr, ArthurBrisbane, Adela Rogers St.-Johns and several others with newspaper columns.)Harry Carr’s friend, the perfect gentleman who suggested that the properpunishment for Hickman is that he be cut to pieces.Patsy Ruth Miller, the “big star” who “openly expressed her disapproval of theeffort to save Hickman,” and who has such a right to express it!Charlie Chaplin, who came to the door and went away claiming that “one look wasenough” and “he didn’t want to be seen here.” Such a clean, decent, virtuousman! [The sarcasm here was in part provoked by Chaplin’s support of communisn.]The prince of Sweden, the “royal presence,” a chap with protruding jaws and theblank expression of a half-wit.Richard Barthelmess who sat for hours in a place where he “could watch everyexpression on Hickman’s face.”Adela Rogers St.-Johns cleverly noted that Hickman is an extremist, a type thatcan either be very good or very bad. This is true and the idea of the“extremist” is splendid. We should have more extremists—then life wouldn’t bewhat it is. But she says that “an extremist is always dangerous” and we allshould be just in between, the “golden mean,” the balanced average. This is awonderful expression of the view exactly opposite from mine. What I want to showin my book is just the horror of that middle: the illogical, inconsistent, weak,tolerant, mediocre, loathsome middle. For if men were extremists they wouldfollow each idea and feeling to its end, they would be faithful to theirpurposes and to themselves, they would be clear, straight, and absolute ineverything. And they wouldn’t tolerate a lot of what is tolerated now. This isjust what we need.She says that Hickman could be either a very great man or a very great criminal.Well, it only shows that he is always great and the one thing impossible to himis pettiness. and mediocrity. For this reason I admire Hickman and everyextremist. [Later, AR identifies “extremism” as an “anti-concept”; see“Extremism, or the Art of Smearing” in Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.]She says that Hickman was always conscious of himself, always thinking of theeffect he produces, always centered on himself. This is one of those things thatisn’t worth arguing about; the opinion on egoism is organic in every person andcan’t be changed or argued.So she is afraid of men being too good or too bad? I think of the man who said:“Oh, that their best is so very small! Oh, that their worst is so very small!And oh, how horrid it is to be small!” [This is an approximate quote from ThusSpoke Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche. This is what my book is going to say.Extremist beyond all extreme is what we need!Agnes Christine Johnston said that Hickman is “surprisingly uncivilized.” Icongratulate her, although not quite in the way she would expect. Her idea isthat civilization is sympathy, i.e., a great sympathetic understanding andco-feeling with others. She is perfectly right; that is just what civilizationis. But is that progress, which is the meaning usually associated with the word“civilization”? Isn’t just that “sympathy” in civilization the greatest regress,the greatest danger, downfall and degeneracy of mankind? I know what Nietzscheand I think on this subject.Johnston says that Hickman has “an ugly soul,” that his mind is developed, buthis soul is neglected. Well, “ugly” is a relative expression. She concludes withthe responsibility of parents to develop their children’s souls and mentions her“own three little ones.”(Incidentally, this same Agnes Christine Johnston is the author of a silly playabout office-girls’ love, about a homely working girl who becomes beautiful, andso on. The play has the deep, significant title of “Funny Little Thing.” Imention this as an example of the ideology of those who speak so loudly about“civilization.”)V. M. declared, as though she were dictating a paragraph into my story, thatHickman’s greatest crime is the fact that he willingly [detached] himself from“humanity,” from the one and only thing that counts in the world—humanity andits progress. She claims that for this he should be killed and destroyed withoutpity. (She said this last part about destroying quite savagely, in a dark,threatening way that sounded so much like that typical, blind mob cruelty.) Shesays that the main thing in life is to feel that you are contributing to theprogress of humanity, or life, or things in general—to feel yourself a part ofsome vague immense universal progress. She says that she is perfectly satisfiedto feel herself a good average human being, and to believe that the other humanbeings are just as good—or bad—as she is; that the exceptional beings have touse their talent and intelligence to pull the average ones up, because kindnessis the greatest thing, the only thing in life; that you are so closely relatedto other people that you can’t tell where you end and they begin; that those whodare to stand alone always become insane.I put all this down as a good, clear outline of the little street’s high ideals.Her claim that Hickman’s greatest crime is his anti-socialness confirmed my ideaof the public’s attitude in this case—and explains my involuntary, irresistiblesympathy for him, which I cannot help feeling just because of this and in spiteof everything else.Hickman said: “I am like the state: what is good for me is right.” Even if hewasn’t big enough to live by that attitude, he deserves credit for saying it sobrilliantly. There is a lot that is purposelessly, senselessly horrible abouthim. But that does not interest me. I want to remember his actions andcharacteristics that will be useful for the boy in my story. His limitlessdaring and his frightful sense of humor, e.g., when he was playing the Victrolawhile policemen searched his apartment and he offered to help, asking if hecould do anything for them. His calm, defiant attitude at the trial. His almostinhuman strength in being able to joke about his death sentence: “The die iscast and the state wins by a neck.” His deliberate smiling when posing forphotographs after the sentence. His hard, cynical attitude toward everything, asshown in the little detail that he expressed his feelings after the sentence bysaying one obscene word. The fact that he looks like “a bad boy with a verywinning grin,” that he makes you like him the whole time you are in hispresence, that he has a personality that would have carried him far if he hadgone another way. His decision to die like a man and his promise to walk calmlyup the death-steps. His playing jazz records and asking for flowers even in thedeath cell.[The depravity of] the pastors who try to convert convicted murderers to theirreligion. Hickman has been baptized into the Catholic faith. So has Ruth Snyder.The horrible idea of “saving” a murderer’s “soul,” adding to the “glory” oftheir religion by demonstrating its power over fear-crazed convicts. Thehypocrisy of “saving a soul,” of turning a man to a religion of charity andforgiveness like Christianity—and then executing him. The mob tyranny Imentioned, shown in the desire to make a new slave, add a new follower to theherd, break an independent man into submission.The fact that right after his sentence Hickman was given a Bible by the jailer.I don’t know of anything more loathsome, hypocritical, low, and diabolical thangiving Bibles to men sentenced to death. It’s one of those things that’s comicalin its stupidity and horrid because of this lugubrious, gruesome comedy.The newsboy I saw on a crowded downtown corner, a heavy, unshaven young fellow,with a [sickly] complexion, fat lips, narrow forehead and spectacles, who wasyelling: “They’re gonna hang him!” when the first extras with the sentenceappeared. Other adult newsboys, yelling with a bloodthirsty delight: “Hickman tohang! Hickman to hang by the neck!”The drunken man who murdered his wife for no particular reason, and thenregretted it, was Hickman’s cell-mate in jail—and beat Hickman up, thinkinghimself superior.The twelve-year-old little girl, who wrote a letter to Hickman, asking him “toget religion so that little girls everywhere would stop being afraid of him.”Dale Budlong and other prisoners who “don’t want to be mixed” with Hickman,considering themselves so much better.The woman who wrote a letter to the authorities asking for permission to bepresent at Hickman’s hanging. A great number of other letters making the samerequest. (!) (The bloodthirsty, blind, carnivorous beast that is hidden beneaththe polished surface of our “civilized,” religious, respectable citizens!)All the dirty stories about Hickman. In this case they are probably true, buthow easily they could have been manufactured to throw dirt at the object of thepublic’s hatred (which will be the case in my book).OTHER EXAMPLES OF THE “LITTLE STREET”Gertrude Stein, when she stupidly said “It’s the little things that count!” Thisis the perfect expression of that despicable attitude of some people—theglorification of mediocrity, the mediocrity that not only doesn’t make anyeffort to rise toward something high, but idealizes its own smallness, glorifiesit, makes it the highest thing in life, the only thing “that counts.” Thepurposeful denial of high [ideals], the shameless, insolent sneering of theplebian who says: “I’m small, sure, but that’s the main thing—to be small. Youbig ones, you don’t mean anything, you don’t count!”That most repulsive of all things—the pride and vanity of the mediocre.V. M., when she said: “Original thoughts are dangerous.... If an originalthinker is anti-social, the more brilliant he is—the more dangerous he is, andtherefore original thinkers are to be condemned!” Doesn’t need any comment.She speaks also of being useful to posterity, to the whole human race and so on.This gives me the thought that fear of death may govern those who think too muchof the “future” and of “humanity.” It is as if they know that their own lifewill not be enough and they want to have something eternal to believe in outsideof it.Where can I find a man who knows that his own life will be so great and he willfill it with so much, that he doesn’t need any “high ideal” outside of it?Eternity itself doesn’t matter—to exist is glorious enough!Arthur Brisbane, who does not sympathize with Voronoff’s desire to produce aSuperman through heredity. He declares that this is just what humanity doesn’tneed; we don’t want Supermen, we want average, equal creatures, for Naturealways strives towards equality and balance. He proves [this latter claim] bydeep, significant examples such as tall men liking short girls and fat womenliking thin men. (And all the results of this poisonous, rotten,sewer-philosophy!)The thing I heard about Gilbert Roland (too horrid to write down).The parties at the studios with naked Negro girls dancing.The way stars make their careers. (The middle-aged woman with pull who can makethe careers of young men, or refuse to, telling them sincerely: “I’m sorry,you’re not my type!”)The different kinds of mind: the abstract and the “social” mind, the latterbeing considered the most important for success. And what is it but the art of“getting along” with human beings? (Men like Danny Renahan don’t get along.)I. L. [Ivan Lebedeff, a Russian-born actor whom AR knew in Hollywood], who saysthat he does things he despises just to lower himself, to feel he is doingsomething nasty, to get to the level of the mob, and mix into that mob. He isafraid to be above [the mob]; he cannot stand the tragedy of being alone on top,and the horror of what he sees under him and has to live with and tolerate.I don’t know if it’s quite so in his case, but the idea is very profound—thatthose who could be above willingly lower themselves, because “the little street”makes it super-humanly hard for a man to remain alone and keep his ideals.Another instance of how the little street works.The rotten swamp that sucks everything into it. And so it goes: a man has thepossibility to be high; he cannot stand it—other men and “society” are too muchfor him to fight against; he sinks down, to the mob’s level; and thus he becomesone of those who stops some other man who could be high. [...]INCIDENTS IN THE STORYCollege-life, the mob-reign par excellence. Danny—the most unpopular figure incollege. He doesn’t belong to any clubs, societies, or fraternities. He doesn’tallow any crazy tricks to be played on him when entering college. He doesn’ttake part in any sports, that is, any teamwork.Hetty is expelled from college for her attitude in the “Renahan case.”014 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_014_r1.jpg]Hetty is one of the defense’s star witnesses at the trial; she tries to saveDanny.Hetty implores the Governor to [pardon] Danny. She climbs into his house througha window when he refuses to see her. She pleads with real, human words againstthe stiff, official, blind answers of the Governor. She falls on her knees: “Youcan save him! Don’t destroy something you can never create again!” He orders herthrown out and advises her to be careful of the reputation she has alreadysoiled, or he may have to send her to a penitentiary to reform her “unnatural,degenerate tendencies!” [This scene is a precursor of one in We the Living, whenLeo is dying of tuberculosis and Kira pleads to Soviet officials to save him.]015 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_015_r1.jpg]Danny’s death. The little man who recognizes him and attracts the mob to him.The mob appears from everywhere, from every dark comer and alley, like swarmingcockroaches crawling out of their holes. The big drunken brute who strikes hisheavy, nail-soled foot into Danny’s breast, cracking the ribs. The quarter thatrolls out of Danny’s pocket into the pool of blood and is picked up by one ofthe men, who wipes it and takes it. The police find Danny’s body near thesidewalk, a horribly torn mass. Only his beautiful face is left untouched, nowimmobile, pale, with eyes closed and long shadows of the eyelashes on the whitecheeks; a head of marble, with one thin red stream, like a crack in the marble,on his temple; and only his hair moving slightly around the immobile face, movedby the water in the gutter that streams red.016 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_016_r1.jpg]Danny in jail. His perfect indifference to everything—visitors, family,everybody—except Hetty. He does not love her, but he sees, understands, andrespects her feeling for him.The only moment when Danny is afraid of death and wants to live. One night, whenhe looks out of his cell window and sees nothing but a dark, clear sky andstars, and one luminous spire from a tall building far away; when he does notsee the city and it seems to him that he is in some other world, on anotherplanet, where life is clear, pure and luminous like the sky he looks into. Andhe wants that life, he loves it with all the passion of his life-hungry soul.That is the only moment when he weakens, when he is horrified at the thought:“They are going to kill me! They have no right to kill me!”This episode will probably end with a guard passing by and seeing Danny’semotion instead of his usual calm, and snickering something about his beingbroken and yellow. Danny turns to him and answers with a horrible swear-word,something as obscene and contrasting with his former mood as the reality hefaces is filthy and contrasting with the world he saw for a moment. With thatone word, all his regrets are gone, he is back again in the life that makes himindifferent to death, he is again the hard, sneering, cynical convict,indifferent and disdainful of everything.017 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_017_r1.jpg]When Danny kills the pastor, he shoots him straight in the face, mad withloathing and the desire to destroy him. He then shoots the rest of the bulletsinto the body, in his hatred and fury to kill. After that—no regrets, no remorsewhatsoever. A clever and calm scheme to escape. He is found and arrested onlythrough the betrayal of a friend.018 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_018_r1.jpg]Danny becomes a criminal while he is scheming his vengeance. In one scene,another criminal dies in his arms while hiding from the police. The young man isunable to get help, preferring to die than to be discovered; he dies from bulletwounds, choking with blood. His beautiful last moments and words. The impressionit makes on Danny.019 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_019_r1.jpg]Danny’s “fan mail” in jail. The disgusting letters of hatred and the even moredisgusting letters of sympathy. Among the latter: declarations of love fromhalf-witted, hysterical old maids; religious preaching and propaganda; theconsolations and sympathy of “good Christians” for a “poor, erring sinner,” andso on. Danny orders the jailers to stop bringing him the mail and to instead“use it in the toilet.”020 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_020_r1.jpg][The Little Street ends here.

In 1930, at the age oftwenty-five, she began making notes for the novel in a bound compositionnotebook. The notebook, presented below in its entirety, contains descriptionsof the characters and the unbearable conditions of life in a totalitarian state.The remaining notes on the novel are unbound, undated, mostly unnumbered,handwritten pages; some are paper-clipped together, and all are collected in afolder. About one-third of this material is offered here. I have omitted herchapter-by-chapter outline because it does not depart in any significant wayfrom the novel. I have also omitted several pages listing known facts of Russianhistory in the 1920s. The only other material omitted was too cryptic to be ofgeneral interest.It may be surprising that AR made so few notes for her first novel. There aretwo main reasons. First no research was required for We the Living, since shealready knew the background. Second, AR chose this novel as her first partlybecause of its relative simplicity. She was not ready to attempt a complex themeor to present her ideal man, but she was ready to write about young people beingcrushed by a dictatorship.Since she had little difficulty with the plot, characters, or theme, she did notneed to make extensive notes.Circa 1930AIRTIGHTTHE CHARACTERSKIRA ARGOUNOVADominant trait: an intense, passionate hunger for life. Beautifully sensitive tothe real meaning and value of life—and crushed under the senseless, morbid,suffocating conditions of a miserable existence. Proud and definite.Unbreakable. One of the very few—and the only one in the book—who, as a person,is not in the least affected by the new conditions; who denies them and does notquite understand their right or reason for existence. She fightsthem—externally; and the fight is the more tragic because, internally, she isleft absolutely untouched and unaffected. A sane, healthy individual thrown intothe very depths of abnormal, inhuman conditions.Independent. Self-assured. Educated in a wealthy family by a mother who let hergrow up as she pleased, without any restraints or influences, and with plenty ofeverything she needed. As a result, she has a calm poise and the full, freestrength of her own unusual personality that has not accumulated any useless,alien inhibitions from any outside source. No religion whatsoever. Brilliantmind. Lots of courage and daring. Only her calm exterior poise hides hertempestuous emotional nature. A sort of graceful restraint under which one canfeel the storming fire.Rather cold and indifferent to everything that does not interest her deeply.Absolutely proof against all influences. Always alone and, to most people,aloof. Disliked by women. No girlfriends. No “beaux.” Indifferent to men. Dimlyconscious of her tremendous sexual power—if she wanted to use it. Men areattracted to her and afraid. Nothing flirting or “come hither” in her. The morepowerful, then, is her attraction for men with whom she condescended to be awoman, and who saw the woman in her: Andrei and Leo.Honest and straightforward—the honesty of pride and of superiority.Misunderstood. Hurt by it, sometimes, yet used to her loneliness, intelligentenough to realize that it is unavoidable. A strong determination and disdainfulpride—and sometimes, beneath it, an indefinable, charming, feminine weakness andhelplessness—something of the frightened child, which she is to a great extent.Always feminine in the best sense of that word, that is, graceful, aloof,charming. Never the masculine, “intellectual,” “rough and ready” type of woman[common] in politics, or the alleged “woman of brains.” Capable of being cruel.Sometimes conceited—at the feeling of her power.Her love for Leo—the concentrated strength of all her will to live. He is, toher, the symbol of everything she wants and the meaning of life as she sees it.Therefore, her indifference to others, the clarity of her mind that leaves hercool to many useless emotions and affections, her straightforwardness—these leadher to an all-absorbing passion, almost unbearable for a human being.ANDREI TAGANOVDominant trait: a born individualist and leader who never discovered it. A greatmind and a profound honesty. An iron will and unconquerable strength. A greatcalm and deliberation—the calm of a man who knows he is master of himself andhas learned long ago to have complete self-control. Occasional, very rareflashes of temper that show the real fire in him—a fire, however, that nevergets the best of the man.His father: a factory worker, mixed in politics and sent to Siberia during theRevolution of 1905; died in exile. His mother: died shortly afterwards ofpoverty and overwork. He, the only son, made his way through the hardest work[with an] iron determination, and a long toil that did not break him, but onlytaught him patience and hardened him. No school education; self-educated andself-made. Always lonely and aloof, aloof without realizing it. Never a goodmixer. Never a popular fellow. In his political career, he advanced through hisbrilliant ability and unquestionable honesty more than through popularity in theParty, where he is far from being popular. His comrades in the Party are alwayshis political friends, never his personal chums; this is not the result of anydeliberate attitude taken by him, but the natural behavior of a man who hasdevoted his entire life to his political ideals and sees only that.As to those ideals: they are the result of his early hatred of the existingsystem of society—not so much hatred, but rather a calm and cool determinationof long ago: to do away, someday, somehow, with the inhuman conditions that hewent through and in which he started his life. The people whose champion he isstand before his eyes as individuals, as men like himself, whose life is crushedby the senseless power of a society that has no right to a man’s life. In that,and more unconsciously than hers, his tragedy is the same as Kira’s. Both aresuperior individuals. Both have in their souls the sensitivity, theunderstanding, the hunger for the real life, as few men see it. Both rise tofight for their rights to that life; and both face the same enemy: society, thestate, the mass. She is stronger, in that she realizes the fight and the enemy.He is more tragic, because his fight is unconscious: the fight against societyof a man who stands as a champion of the most sociable ideals.He is a man that would have been a Napoleon—had he been born with lessconscience and idealism. He has an iron devotion to his ideals, the devotion ofa medieval martyr. Capable of anything, any cruelty, if convinced that his aimneeds it. Cruelty for the cause is, to him, a victory over himself; it gives himthe feeling of doing his duty against his sentiment.Yet a profound egoism lies under that devotion to his work, for it is his workand his aim that he is serving. His ideals have not been inspired by sympathyand compassion for the suffering of the masses. It is his suffering and hispride that made him take arms against society. This is subconscious, for it’snot his personal interests that he has in mind, it’s the victory of his idea—andhis idea is the uprising of fighters, individuals, strong men of the peoplecrushed under a senseless, ignoble system.The taste, manners, and tact of an aristocrat—but not conventional manners, justthe poise and dignity of a man with inborn good judgment. Instinctive,unconscious understanding of beauty and art; an untrained, but wise estheticfeeling, [which is] dormant, never given much attention or opportu nity.Delicate and sensitive to other people’s feelings—no violent hatred orprejudices against anyone. No religion.No conceit. One of the few people who is absolutely untouched by flattery,admiration, or any form of other people’s opinion. Not because of a prouddisdain, but because of a natural indifference to it. Subconsciously, he knowshis superiority and does not need any one’s endorsement. Consciously, he isinterested only in doing what he thinks is right; [he wants to be] satisfied inhis own eyes. A self-discipline learned long ago.A man who knows how to take serious things seriously. But with hidden beauty,sympathy, even tenderness, and an intelligent sense of humor.Sexual matters never interested him. Didn’t have the time. Accustomed to hardwork and making the most of his time, all concentrated in one line and aim.Never had an affair. Not because of a moral effort, asceticism, or self-imposedrenunciation, but because of a lack of interest and a slight disgust for sex ashe saw it around him. Yet a very strong sense of sensuality, unawakened.Kira is the first woman who ever attracted his attention. His instinctive senseof values and beauty sees in her what very few men see. Therefore, hispassion—unexpected, fierce, primitive, letting loose an energy longrestrained—overwhelms him with its intensity. He has sense enough not to attemptany struggle, nor to consider it as interfering with his aim and duty. He justsurrenders completely to what is for him a newly discovered beauty in life, thelife for which he has a profound instinct. It is characteristic that Kira is anaristocrat, a woman of the upper classes, and that, knowing her hatred of hisParty, he never resents it.LEO KOVALENSKY[This section was crossed out. While much of the following obviously applies tothe Leo in the novel, the character described here is more flawed.]Dominant trait: a man who should be more than he is. A brilliant, but notprofound, mind, and a very poor emotional nature. A mind witty, quick, sharp andclear, but not deepened by any great feeling. Very good-looking—more than that:beautiful. A face with the proud, haughty, aloof expression of a god, a facepromising a superior, profound, fascinating man; and the man not keeping thepromise. The greatest lack in him is the lack of any strong desire or ambition;therefore, also, the lack of will. Never had any profound love or hatred, neververy happy or despondent, no real interest or enthusiasm for anything. Noemotional extremes.He is brilliantly witty. A light, distinguished sense of humor; too much of itleads to his not taking anything very seriously. A love for paradoxes, for wittyridiculing of any high, serious, revered, or established ideas. Elegant,distinguished, aristocratic—mostly in manner and attitude, not in clothes or[conventional] psychology. His aristocratic [style] is personal, not theclass-bound [charade] of formal manners and high ancestry. Sophisticated, bored,slightly cynical. No moral feeling. Would not do anything low or ugly, but morefrom an esthetic than from an ethical feeling. Has a love for beauty, but mostlybeauty of form, beauty of the surface, not deeper.Likes everything new, exotic, extreme, effective, modernistic, eccentric,original, smart. Affects a modem European or American attitude. Has anaristocratic dislike for work and effort. Nothing can rouse him to any seriouseffort or struggle. Anything hard is distasteful to him. Lack of perseverance;takes everything easy, nonchalantly. No great ambition of any kind—not definiteor positive enough for that.He is very popular. Always the soul of the party, but not as a “good fellow,”rather as a perfectly charming, fascinating man of the world. Always knows howto say and do the right thing at the right time, and is at ease with everyone,everywhere.His convictions: none. Not even positive about that. Constant only in hisindifferent sophistication and skepticism toward everything. Alert and takesgreat mental interest—in everything new and startling. But no emotionalinterest.Religion: hasn’t any. Yet is not a decided atheist. Never made up his minddefinitely one way or the other. Can be both, according to the mood or effect ofthe moment.His political convictions are not definite. While not being in sympathy with thegovernment, he is not as indignantly opposed to it as most people in his circle.While ridiculing and resenting the conditions of life around him, he is nottheoretically opposed to communism; he is not [opposed] to anything modem—partof his sophisticated tolerance.Temperamentally, he does not like to display any emotions. Although he is not ofa very intense nature, yet he does get depressed, occasionally, and cannotalways hide it. Also, he does show happiness occasionally, but more seldom. Verybrave, disdainful of danger—sometimes; and sometimes loses his nerve.He had a profound affection for his parents and sister, who died.In regard to sexual matters, he is not highly virtuous; yet he is not oversexed.Has had affairs. Not vulgar or promiscuous about it, however. He is not toointerested in sex, and the occasional interest he has is more physical thanemotional. Is tremendously attractive to women. Women spoiled him. He isconceited and self-assured with them. Flirts with every woman he meets—rather,just has a flirting manner, highly flattering to women. Of course, he nevermeans it. It is a habit and light diversion for him.Conceited, but not concerned about it. Not susceptible to flattery—used to it.Has few real friends and none very close—he is not interested. But a vast numberof acquaintances. Cruel, in that he is perfectly indifferent to other people’sfeelings.He is capable of high emotions and beautiful actions, but seldom roused to them.Has the mind to understand high beauty—and could have been more than he is. Haseverything to be a great man. Ambition is all he lacks. Conditions around himsubconsciously killed all ambition in him, all real appetite for life. In othercircumstances, he would have developed into an outstanding and fascinating man.He is too much the aristocrat and not enough the male to stand up under anyconditions and fight his way through. Besides, he did not even have anything tofight for; life around him did not offer any stimulant to his ambitions at thetime they could have been formed. He is not the type that would bring his owndesires and ideas to life; he has to get them from life—and it did not give himany. While he does not oppose the conditions of life around him very much, theybreak him internally, without his even knowing it, break him by killing hisinterest in life.Kira saw in him “what he could have been.” Her romance with him is also herdesperate fight to “keep them from getting him.” As to Leo, his love for her wasthe best thing in his life. It was all of his higher sentiments and better self.The “man that could have been” understood Kira, saw the superior woman in her,and loved her more than he had ever loved anyone. He did not love her better[because] he was not capable of a better love. And as his better self slowlydies in him, so does his love for the only real woman in his life. It never diescompletely. Something indefinable, nameless, unconscious, remains. He is nothappy when he goes [south] to his new life, leaving Kira behind. In hisindifferent hopelessness a dull, secret pain always remains, as the scar of afeeling which he could never entirely forget—and which he had not been bigenough to keep. [End of deleted section.]ANTONINA PAVLOVNADominant trait: the condensed low female of all times. Selfish like a dumb,brutal monster. Vain. Conceited. Eager for everything that flatters her ego. Butmainly: a loose creature out to satisfy herself. Cheaply fashionable,“feminine,” “modern,” with some pretenses at being “cultured” and“intellectual.” “Misunderstood.” From a middle-class family, but always aspiresto more “aristocracy” and “culture” than is her right.She is oversexed and promiscuous. Vulgar in her sex affairs. She has many ofthem—some for profit, some for animal desire. The kept mistress of whiteofficers and Bolshevik commissars. Proud of her position and influence. She isalways trying to show her power and make that influence felt. Nothing is toosmall or too filthy for her.Her “love” for Leo: the vain female desire to “win” him. Also: the animal desireof an oversexed creature for the gorgeous male that he is.RITAA plain debauchee. She has no feelings or thoughts left. Nothing but loose,uncontrolled, sordid sexuality. She is from a good family, and was given a goodeducation. Divorced from a red commander. Only the thinnest outside cover ofsome culture left. A menacing specter, a symbol of what lies in the future forthe youth of the coming generation.More obvious, open and younger than Antonina Pavlovna. Not many “intellectual”pretenses.LYDIAAn average girl, nearing her thirties. Not too attractive nor intelligent. Shehas wasted her best years, becoming bitter and poisoned.(Representative of the older half of the younger generation.)VAVAA common, sheep-like nature. She is rather attractive, and from a wealthyfamily. Spoiled. Conceited. Marries, has a child soon, and does her best to livein the favor of the government. Becomes a typical, [lifeless] “soviet citizen.”(The alternative—Rita or Vava.)THE PICTUREA terrific machinery crushing the whole country and smothering every bit oflife, action, and air.A picture of the state, and those who are the state, strangling the individual.A picture of the masses showing who and what those masses are, their ideas, andtheir rise against the unusual and higher man.How is it done? By conditions of living unbearable to the higher individual. Andthe theme of the book—what these conditions are and how they work.The higher and stronger is broken, but not conquered; she falls on thebattlefield, still the same individual, untouched: Kira. The one with lessresistance is broken and conquered; he disintegrates under an unbearable strain:Leo. And the best of those who believed in the ideal is broken by therealization of what the ideal really means: Andrei.HOW IT IS DONE1. ECONOMIC CONDITIONSTerrific poverty. A general misery. People driven to the point where [obtaining]the most common necessities presents a big problem. The horrible, deadeningdullness of the hopeless drudgery, when all higher instincts and aspirationsslowly die out, stifled by the dumb, animal struggle for a pitiful existence.And the mental atmosphere furnished by the government: a glorifying of thedrudgery. A growing habit of considering all luxury—everything unnecessary andcharming—to be absolutely and hopelessly out of reach.Unemployment. The frightful lack of work. The humiliations, pull, and struggleone must endure to get employment. The unions. The idiotically cruel refusal ofeven the right to make a living for people with an aristocratic past. The newmerchants and the senseless persecution that follows them. The successful newrich and the grotesque irony of their gains, influence, and position in the“red” society—the class of men uglier even than the ideology of the ruling classthat allows them to exist. All the pathetic, tragic, and ridiculous efforts tomake a living. Divorces to keep a job. The “cutting off” of employees. Theeternal fear and uncertainty. Queer new professions and occupations.Physical discomforts. Hunger. Cold. No living space. Terrible transportation.Disease. Lice. Dirt.2. MENTAL CONDITIONSEverything centered around one idea—one propaganda—and that idea fed to thepeople until they mentally suffocate. Everything that does not belong to thispropaganda, all the natural instincts and ideas, everything that makes up theindividual life and the beauty of life—is thrown out and trampled. An unbearablepropaganda of an unbearable idea that makes the atmosphere choking, airtight,until people get to a state of mental scurvy. The idea itself and the method ofpropaganda are the very essence of commonplace ideology—intended for and createdby the “middle class of the spirit.” (When showing the ideas, always show thosewho create them and make them possible.) The great “average humanity”; show itsspirit and what it does to the ones above the average.Propaganda:In Education (schools and universities): students’ meetings, the political life,the arrests and exiles, the spies, the “cleaning” of the students, the exile ofthe old professors, teaching only propaganda, and in high school—the comingyouth and its mental mutilation.In Art: theaters, books, paintings, movies: censorship and the propagandaidea—the “proletarian art.”3. MORAL CONDITIONSAn existence where men turn into cornered animals. The perpetual fear, struggle,poverty, depression, and hopelessness. A general degradation—men turning smallerthan they usually appear, life turning into a shabby, petty, cheap routine.And the youth of the country starting out on their lives.The youth of the [former] classes faces a hopeless struggle: a long, tiresome,joyless path. Alternatively, they may sink down into real debauchery, all moralslet loose by the strain of the unusual times.The new youth [is characterized by a] loose morality and a superficial,“patriotic” arrogance.The older generation faces a hopeless old age.And the real human being—Kira—caught in the swamp and voicing the theme of thestory: “But there is a life, a life that I saw, that I was waiting for—and Ihave a right to it. Who is taking it away from me and why are they doing it?”[The material in the composition notebook ends here. The remaining notes weremade on unbound pages and collected in a folder.]Collectivism: its spirit, influence, ramifications.Desperate living conditions: the people’s attitude toward them, and thegovernment’s attitude—glorification.The new red culture: its hypocrisy, show-offishness, fear, boot-licking,nonsense (museums, schools, etc.).Propaganda: ever-present, at every step and moment. (Artificial enthusiasm.)Inefficiency: the stupid bureaucracy, red tape, bad quality in everything(Soviet matches, Soviet soap, etc.).TO SHOWECONOMICALFood: How it’s impossible to get: the cards, rations, speculators, standing inline, cooperatives. The monotonous, unhealthy diet: millet, dried fish, linseedoil. Everyday necessities considered as luxuries: butter, eggs, milk, whitebread. Excesses of hunger: fallen horse, acorns, coffee grounds.Clothes: The impossibility of getting new materials. Every new article ofclothing an event (particularly shoes). Endless altering of old clothes.Pathetic “styles”: patent-leather, celluloid jewelry, “batik” handkerchiefs.Worship of imported “foreign” clothes and silk stockings. Pathetic awe at thesight of “dressed” foreigners. Smuggling of stockings and cosmetics. The“Soviet” cosmetics (poisonous lipstick). No formal evening clothes. “Soviet”materials—everybody alike. The terrible inefficiency of everything “Soviet.”Houses: Crowded to the limit. Encounters with enforced tenants. Frozen waterpipes. Lack of wood. Six degrees [Celsius] in the house. “Bourgeoisie” stoves.Linseed oil lamps. Primuses. The house “parliament” and the Uprav dom. Dirt.Lice.Employment: The pathetic horror of “cuts” of employees. The vile, low,humiliating playing up to the “red” authorities. The time wasted on stupid,hypocritical “social activities.” The “enforced patriotism.” Constant propagandain connection with any work. Persecution of private traders and the unemployed.Impossibility of finding work. Odd forms of earning a living: street peddlersand their pathetic merchandise.POLITICAL AND CULTURALThe All-Pervading Propaganda: Its ridiculous, far-fetched connections. Itsintentionally vulgar, “popular” style and artificial bravado. Glorifying of thedrudgery and the “everyday.” Its main methods: employment—enforced meetings,“social activities,” demonstrations, enforced deductions of pay for “patriotic”enterprises; and schools—enforced study of unscientific “social sciences,” a“red” angle on all activities.Talk, talk, and talk. Endless, enforced talk without the right to say anything.The ever-present threat of the G.P.U.: secret arrests, executions, exiles.Art: Old theater—and next to it the awkward new “proletarian” dramas. Movies:the foreign ones cut, the red ones—(!). Literature (books and magazines): allpropaganda, and intentionally vulgar. Art: all “red.” “Ballet of the Toilers.”The pathetic intelligentsia: the operas, philharmonic concerts, futuristic bookcovers and china, “modern poets,” theatrical settings, foreign translations, andworship of foreign magazines. The pathetic “parties.”MORALITYHypocrisy at an unbelievable height. Nepmen and “red fighters” like Victor. [NEPwas Lenin’s New Economic Policy, which allowed some “private ” trading. “Nepmen” was the name for those who grew rich through this policy; they are representedin the novel by the character of Morozov.]CHARACTERSThe individual against society at a time when society is at its worst and makesitself felt most strongly. Therefore, show all the mass manifestations ofhumanity in general and of the Russian revolution in particular.Types who represent it:Kira—cannot be broken.Andrei—broken physically, broken life.Leo—broken spiritually.Pavel—“the best of the worst”; representative of those successfulwith the mob.Victor—same [as Pavel].Comrade Sonia—the “new woman,” mob womanhood at its mostdangerous.Dunaev—the best in the old world and its tragedy.Antonina Pavlovna—the worst.Nepman—the triumph of the new order.Stepan—the sailor, the fighting idealist.Lydia—the dying old world.Galina Petrovna—the accommodating “intelligent” [woman].Alexander Dimitrievitch—the dying old world.Marisha—the new “loose, red youth.”Sasha—the old fighting student.Irina—an average girl, caught by events.Acia—the “new child.”Maria Petrovna—a frightened “nothing.”Vava—a “flapper” of the old world.[AR made the following notes on revising Part 1.]CHAPTER IMore of Kira’s reaction—make Kira’s presence felt.Song of the “Apple”—twice.Incident of “official business”—? Out.CHAPTER IITheir arrival and the station—shorter.Shorter description of Nevsky.Read again carefully the talk with relatives. Insert some touch ofpropaganda—very little.CHAPTER IIIRevise: Place and date of birth, family position, union membership, occupation.Quicker, short examples and sentences. More of Kira, her spirit of adventure,and not in love only—her hunger for practical beauty, for dreams and realityunited. More distinct propaganda on the official’s part. Cut out unnecessary“cruelty” of Kira. Kira’s attitude toward sex and love.CHAPTER IVMore of Kira—of her idea of life and of her reaction. A little about theUniversity. More propaganda. Kira—the Viking—the “Song of the Broken Glass”against Soviet reality.Correct reference to Admiral Kovalensky.Shorter and sharper—Victor’s visit. His conversation—also in the cab—morepointed and typical—the “artist,” the “advanced, cultured, hard-working youngman,” the terrific egotism felt under it.Synopsize scene in Summer Garden.Conversation with Leo—more of Leo’s bitterness, masterful arrogance andunhappiness.CHAPTER VNot enough of Kira’s reaction to Leo.Cut out the “no” sequences—except house meeting.

February 2, 1936[An excerpt from an autobiographical note that AR sent to her publisher.]I have been asked why I wrote this novel. I think the answer is obvious. I haveseen Soviet life as few writers outside Russia have seen it. And while the worldat large is deluged to the saturation point with minute accounts of SovietRussia, including all the latest statistics up to every single tractor producedby the “great experiment,” very little has been said about actual life undercommunism, about living beings, not slogans and theories. Theories againstpractice—that’s something too often overlooked in every important questiontoday. With due apologies to good manners, I don’t give a damn about theories. Ido give a good deal about human beings. No, not all of them. Only those worthyof the name.Also, if one takes even the swiftest look at the world today, one cannot helpbut see the greatest, most urgent conflict of our times: the individual againstthe collective. That problem interests me above all others in my writing. Nocountry on earth offers such a startling and revealing view of that conflict asSoviet Russia. Hence—We the Living. The plot of my novel is entirely fictitious.The background and circumstances which make the plot possible—are entirely true."},{"pageContent":"3FIRST PHILOSOPHIC JOURNALAR WAS TWENTY-NINE WHEN SHE WROTE THE FOLLOWING NOTES IN A PHILOSOPHIC JOURNAL.These are the vague beginnings of an amateur philosopher. To be checked withwhat I learn when I master philosophy—then see how much of it has already beensaid, and whether I have anything new to say, or anything old to say better thanit has already been said. April 9, 1934The human race has only two unlimited capacities: for suffering and for lying.I want to fight religion as the root of all human lying and the only excuse forsuffering.I believe—and I want to gather all the facts to illustrate this—that the worstcurse on mankind is the ability to consider ideals as something quite abstractand detached from one’s everyday life. The ability to live and think quitedifferently, thus eliminating thinking from your actual life. This applied notto deliberate and conscious hypocrites, but to those more dangerous and hopelessones who, alone with themselves and to themselves, tolerate a complete breakbetween their convictions and their lives, and still believe that they haveconvictions. To them, either their ideals or their lives are worthless—andusually both.I hold religion mainly responsible for this. I want to prove that religionbreaks a character before it’s formed, in childhood, by teaching a child liesbefore he knows what a lie is, by breaking him of the habit of thinking beforehe has begun to think, by making him a hypocrite before he knows any otherpossible attitude toward life. If a child is taught ideals that he knows arecontrary to his own deepest instincts, [ideals] such as unselfishness, meekness,and self-sacrifice, if he is told he is a miserable sinner for not living up toideals he can never reach and doesn’t want to reach, then his natural reactionis to consider all ideals as out of his reach forever, as something theoreticaland quite apart from his own actual life. Thus the beginning of self-hypocrisy,the killing of all desire for a living ideal.024 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_024_r1.gif]Religion is also the first enemy of the ability to think. That ability is notused by men to one tenth of its possibility, yet before they learn to think theyare discouraged by being ordered to take things on faith. Faith is the worstcurse of mankind; it is the exact antithesis and enemy of thought. I want tolearn why men do not use logical reasoning to govern their lives and [solve]their problems. Is it impossible to them or has it been taught to them asimpossible?I believe this last. And the teacher is the church. Thought and reason are theonly weapons of mankind, the only possible bond of understanding among men.Anyone who demands that anything be taken on faith—or relies on anysuper-mental, super-logical instinct—denies all reason.Why are men so afraid of pure, logical reasoning? Why do they have a profound,ferocious hatred of it?Are instincts and emotions necessarily beyond the control of plain thinking? Orwere they trained to be? Why is a complete harmony between mind and emotionsimpossible? Isn’t it merely a matter of strict mental honesty? And who stands atthe very bottom of denying such honesty? Isn’t it the church?I want to be known as the greatest champion of reason and the greatest enemy ofreligion. May 9, 1934In regard to free will: Why is it used as an argument against freedom of thewill that it is motivated by a circumstance of the outside world? Is there anysuch thing as will without the content to which it is applied? Isn’t will a pureabstraction, not an object? Isn’t it a verb rather than a noun, and as suchmeaningless without that upon which it acts? The will does not have to bewithout reason, or motivation, in order to be free. One’s act may be motivatedby an outside reason, but the choice of that reason is our free will. An exampleof the determinists: if a man drinks a glass of water, he does it because he isthirsty, therefore his will isn’t free, it’s motivated by his physicalcondition. But he drinks the glass of water because he needs it and decides thathe wants to drink it. If his sweetheart’s life had depended on his not drinkingthat water, he probably would not have touched it, no matter what his thirst. Orif it were a question of his life or hers, he would have to select and make thedecision. In other words, he drinks because he’s thirsty, but it is not thethirst that determines his action, the thirst only motivates it. A motivation isnot a reason. (Has that anything to do with the question of free will?)Doesn’t the “free will” question come under the general question of humanreason—and its freedom? If an action is logical—does that mean it is not free?Or is logic considered a restriction? If so—upon what? Is there anythingconceivable beyond logic? Does a free action necessarily mean an unreasonableone? And if mind (or reason) depends on the outside world for its contents—is itreason any the less?Has anyone properly described logic and human reason?All philosophy is a set of thoughts. Thoughts are [governed] by certainimplacable rules. If we deny these rules—which are an integral part ofthoughts—we deny the thoughts. If we deny the thoughts—we deny the philosophy.So why bother at all? (In answer to all those who build transcendental,super-reasonable, super-logical philosophic systems.)Is there—or should there be—such a thing as emotion opposed to reason? Isn’t itmerely a form of undeveloped reason, a form of stupidity?How and why can will be considered apart from the mind? If thinking is free fromsubconscious influences—why not the will?And if, as according to [H. L.] Mencken, the question of “freedom of the will”has to be studied on the basis of psychology with all its dark complexes—thenwhat are we actually studying? Will as it is expressed in subnormal cases? Or innormal, average cases? Or in the highest instances of the human [mind]?Are we studying will as it is actually in the majority of cases—or as it can beessentially, as a human attribute?Do we judge all human terms as applied to existing humanity or to humanity’shighest possibility?If we are trying to form a general conception of a “stomach,” do we study ahundred diseased stomachs and form our general conception from them, so that“stomach” as such is something with a number of diseases attached to it—or do wefind the healthy stomach first, in order to learn what it is, and then judge theothers by comparison?Is ethics necessarily and basically a social conception? Have there been systemsof ethics written primarily on the basis of an individual? Can that be done?Are ethics at all a matter of history? Does it matter how and where theydeveloped? Is a history of ethics necessary? I believe only a system of ethicsis necessary, and it has to stand or fall on its own merits—not on any historyor far away beginning. For instance, when discussing the social instinct—does itmatter whether it had existed in the early savages? We do not judge the value ofan automobile by the first chariot ever used in the history of men. Supposingmen were born social (and even that is a question)—does it mean that they haveto remain so?“Social life,” said Kropotkin, “that is, we, not I, is the normal form of life(in man). It is life itself.” Good God Almighty!!!! [Petr Alekseevich Kropotkin(1842-1941) was a Russian socialist who advocated the revolt of the “workingclass. ”]This is exactly what I’m going to fight. For the exact opposite is true.If man started as a social animal—isn’t all progress and civilization directedtoward making him an individual? Isn’t that the only possible progress? If menare the highest of animals, isn’t man the next step? May 15, 1934In regard to The Revolt of the Masses [by José Ortega y Gasset]: Isn’t it aterrible generalization—that can be interpreted in too many different ways—tosay that a “noble” man strives to serve and obey, and the “mass” man to do as hepleases?If what is meant is the noble man’s servitude to his own standards and ideas—isthat to be called servitude? If the standards are his, isn’t he preciselyobeying himself and doing what he pleases? No truly noble man is going to obeystandards set for him by someone else. That is the action of the mass man. It isthe mass man who cannot do as he wishes, because he has no wishes; he has tohave his standards—or the nearest to that word that he can come—dictated to him.This leads me again to a question that is part of the general “free will”question. What exactly is freedom? Surely, freedom does not mean an empty blank.If a man obeys his own ideals—how can that be called servitude? If a man has noideals at all—why is that called freedom? How can any human quality, such asfreedom, be disconnected from its content? Isn’t there a terrible mistake ofabstraction here? Isn’t it as Nietzsche said: “Not freedom from what, butfreedom for what?”This leads to another question—my question of the “supreme egoism.” There existsthat body of ideas which represents all the so-called intellectual and spiritualvalues: ethics, philosophy, etc. (This requires a better definition andanalysis—which has to be done later.) My “supreme egoism” consists of the rightto apply these values to oneself and to live them. For example: if a man isconvinced that religion is wrong, he has to be and profess to be an atheist. Thevile, dangerous habit of today is to admit, for instance, that religion isvaluable to the majority and, therefore, go to church, profess to be religious,etc., in order to gain something by playing down to the masses. As aconsequence, the horrible paradox of our time is that intellectual values areleft only to the masses, that they become a special, exclusive privilege of themasses, who not only have no right to them, but lack completely even theelementary organ for anything approaching intellectual ideas. It is as if oneleft sight only as a privilege of the blind. The so-called “selfish” man oftoday uses “ideas” only as means to attain his own end. But what is that end?What is accomplished if the man attains power and prominence at the cost ofplaying down to the masses? It is not he that triumphs, it is not his ideas andstandards. It is only his physical frame. Essentially, he is only a slave tothose masses. [This idea was later to find dramatic expression in the characterof Gail Wynand in The Fountainhead.] This explains my meaning when I considerthe “selfish,” ambitious man of today as essentially unselfish, or ratherselfless. The true selfishness is that which demands the right to its own higherideas and values. The “supreme egoism” is that which claims things for theiressential, not their secondary values.An example from my own experience, which, at the present time, affects me most,is the fact that few men have the ability or the desire to judge literary workby its essential worth. To most men, that work becomes valuable only after ithas been recognized as such by someone else. They themselves do not have anystandards of their own (and they do not feel the lack). The same is true of anyother field of mental activity: scientific, philosophical, etc. This is thegreat unselfishness of today. As a matter of fact, unselfishness is merelyselflessness. The true, highest selfishness, the exalted egoism, is the right tohave one’s own theoretical values and then to apply them to practical reality.Without that self there are no values. Here again—ethics based on self, not onsociety, the mass, the collective, or any other form of selflessness.From this—to another question. There have been too many philosophicalabstractions, too much intellectual “algebra”—as is illustrated best by thatstatement from The Revolt of the Masses about the noble man’s servitude. It isan algebraic formula into which [are inserted] too many different arithmeticalcontents. What we need is an “arithmetic” of the spirit. Algebra—spiritually—istoo much of the mob, of the masses, the collective, being too general. Theindividual is the arithmetical quantity of the spirit. And in thingsspiritual—or intellectual (which is essentially the same)—it is only theindividual and the particular, concrete problem that counts. Algebraicconstructions are only a convenience. In practice, they have no use, unless theproper arithmetical content is inserted into the formula. But in the field ofphilosophy today there is this tendency of considering the algebraic formula asfinal, and therefore philosophy has no practical significance or application.Returning to what I said at the beginning of these notes, there is no need fortheory which cannot be applied in practice. More than that, such theory is notonly useless, but dangerous and fatal, for it lies at the bottom of thatfrightful phenomenon of believing one thing and living another. If by practicalreality I mean the actual living of an individual, then there is no need foranything which is not this practical reality, which is not actual living. Thisis a point which can and will be strongly debated, but it has to be thecornerstone of my philosophy—proving the supremacy of actual living over allother considerations, in fact proving that there are no other considerations. Asa result, my “arithmetic” of philosophy has to be philosophy brought up to therealm of actual living. (I say intentionally brought up to it, not down.) This—Iexpect—will be its vital strength. [We can see the first seeds of AR’s latertheory of concepts in her identification of the relation between abstractionsand concretes as similar to that between algebra and arithmetic. Her primaryconcern here is to reject the Platonic rationalism that detaches abstractionsfrom concretes, and affirm the Aristotelian premise that only concretes exist.However, her characterization of abstractions as “collective” and “only aconvenience ” conflicts with her mature views. For a full presentation of AR’stheory, see Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology.]That philosophical “algebra” is, to my mind, the greatest crime of metaphysics,if I understand that word correctly. It is the result of that underlying errorof human thinking—which forgets the distinction between abstraction and reality,thus denying reality. For abstractions are only a convenience, not a fact, ameans, not an end. This—for the basis of philosophy as a science. For scienceessentially deals with facts. The next step will be to define just what arefacts. Which will bring me to human reason as the basis of all facts, scientificor philosophical. More about that later.(All these things are only for my own use. They are pretty disjointed and not inany logical sequence. But what will [ultimately] come out of this is anarrangement of the whole in a logical system, proceeding from a few axioms in asuccession of logical theorems. The axioms will be necessary—even mathematicshas them—[because] you can’t build something on nothing. The end result will bemy “Mathematics of Philosophy.”)I have to study: philosophy, higher mathematics, physics, psychology.As to physics—learn why mind and reason are so decried as impotent when copingwith the universe. Isn’t there some huge mistake there?It may be considered strange, and denying my own supremacy of reason, that Istart with a set of ideas, then want to study in order to support them, and notvice versa, i.e., not study and derive my ideas from that. But these ideas, to agreat extent, are the result of a subconscious instinct, which is a form ofunrealized reason. All instincts are reason, essentially, or reason is instinctsmade conscious. The “unreasonable” instincts are diseased ones. This—for thestudy of psychology. For the base of the reconciliation of reason and emotions.As to psychology—learn whether the base of all psychology is really logic, andpsychology as a science is really pathology, the science of how thesepsychological processes depart from reason. This departure is the disease. Whatcaused it? Isn’t it faulty thinking, thinking not based on logic, [but on]faith, religion?All consciousness is reason. All reason is logic. Everything that comes betweenconsciousness and logic is a disease. Religion—the greatest disease of mankind.Some day I’ll find out whether I’m an unusual specimen of humanity in that myinstincts and reason are so inseparably one, with the reason ruling theinstincts. Am I unusual or merely normal and healthy? Am I trying to impose myown peculiarities as a philosophical system? Am I unusually intelligent ormerely unusually honest? I think this last. Unless—honesty is also a form ofsuperior intelligence. May 16, 1934A quotation about Russia, which may be useful, from While Rome Burns byAlexander Woollcott [American journalist and writer]:Then at noon the next day, the neat, bustling, inexcusably cheerful station atStolyce, Poland. The first cup of good coffee in weeks. Flagrantly trivialnewspapers to read. And a great buoyancy of one’s spirit. All returningtravelers mention this curious lifting of the sense of oppression-sometimesunnoticed until it does lift, just as you realize how foul the air of a room hasbeen only when you get a whiff from out-of-doors—this exhilarating relief whicheven one who has hugely enjoyed his stay in the Soviet Union does experience onquitting its territory.... There is nothing mysterious about it. Every man whowas ever demobilized remembers this sensation of a recovered freedom. Freedom tosit on a park bench and starve, perhaps. But freedom, brothers, freedom.The new conception of the State that I want to defend is the State as a means,not an end; a means for the convenience of the higher type of man. The State asthe only organization. Within it—all have to remain individuals. The State, notas a slave of the great numbers, but precisely the contrary, as the individual’sdefense against great numbers. To free man from the tyranny of numbers.The fault of liberal democracies: giving full rights to quantity (majorities),they forget the rights of quality, which are much higher rights. Prove thatdifferences of quality not only do exist inexorably, but also should exist. Thenext step—democracy of superiors only. This is not possible without a very highand powerful sense of honor. This, in turn, is not possible without a set ofvalues from which this honor is to be derived. The new set of values: [my]supreme egoism.025 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_025_r1.jpg]From The Revolt of the Masses by José Ortega y Gasset:[T]he apparent enthusiasm for the manual worker, for the afflicted and forsocial justice, serves as a mask to facilitate the refusal of all obligations,such as courtesy, truthfulness and, above all, respect or esteem for superiorindividuals. I know of quite a few who have entered the ranks of some labororganization or other merely in order to win for themselves the right to despiseintelligence and to avoid paying it any tribute. [In regard to] Dictatorship, wehave seen only too well how they flatter the mass-man, by trampling oneverything that appeared to be above the common level.May 21, 1934“Mankind? It is an abstraction. There are, have been, and always will be, menand only men.” (Johann Wolfgang von Goethe)I would change that to go one step further: man, only man.Has there ever been a history written from the viewpoint not of a nation’sdevelopment through its outstanding individuals, but of these individuals’desperate fight against their nations, for the sake of the development andadvancement for which the nation so noisily and arrogantly takes credit after ithas made a martyr of the “developer” and “advancer”? History as a deadly battleof the mass and the individual. A scientific task for me: to trace just how manyof mankind’s “geniuses” were recognized and honored in their own time. And sincethey were not—as most of them weren‘t—is there any ground for the conception ofany national cultures, histories and civilizations? If there is any such thingas culture and its growth—isn’t it the culture of great individuals, ofgeniuses, not of nations or any other conglomerations of human creatures? Andisn’t history the fight of mankind against advancement, not for it?"},{"pageContent":"PART 2THE FOUNTAINHEAD"},{"pageContent":"4THEME AND CHARACTERSAR’s working title for The Fountainhead was Second-Hand Lives.

December 4, 1935SECOND-HAND LIVESIt is not the works, but the belief which is here decisive and determines theorder of rank—to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deepermeaning—it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself,something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and perhaps, also, isnot to be lost. The noble soul has reverence for itself.FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, Beyond Good and Evil I. The first purpose of the book is a defense of egoism in its real meaning,egoism as a new faith. Therefore—a new definition of egoism and its livingexample. If egoism is the quality which makes one put oneself above all—well, inwhat manner? And—above what? If one goes ruthlessly after one’s aim—what is theaim? It is not what one does or how one does it, but why one does it. It is theultimate result, the last consequence, the essence and sum of sums whichdetermines the quality of egoism.One puts oneself above all and crushes everything in one’s way to get the bestfor oneself. Fine! But what is that best? Which leads to the question: aremorals, or ethics, or all higher values, a thing outside [oneself], i.e., God’slaw or society’s prescription, something related not to a man, but to othersaround him, an ultimatum forced upon man and essentially selfless and unselfish?Or [are these values] a man’s very own, his sacred, highest right, his bestinspiration, his real life and real self?And further: what is the self? Just the fact that one is born and conscious,just the “I” devoid of all definite content? Or—the “I” that values, selects andknows precisely the qualities which distinguish it from all other “I‘s,” whichhas reverence for itself for certain definite reasons, not merely because“I-am-what-I-am-and-don’t-know-just-what-I-am.” If one’s physical body is acertain definite body with a certain definite shape and features, not just abody—so one’s spirit is a certain definite spirit with definite features andqualities. A spirit without content is an abstraction that does not exist. Ifone is proud of one’s body for its beauty, created by certain lines and forms,so one is proud of one’s spirit for its beauty, or that which one considers itsbeauty. Without that—there can be no pride of spirit. Nor any spirit.If the higher values of life (such as all ethics, philosophy, esthetics,everything that results from a sense of valuation in the mental life of man)come from within, from man’s own spirit, then they are a right, a privilege anda necessity—not a duty. They are that which constitutes a man’s life, and if heis an egoist in the best sense of the word he will choose these higher valuesfor himself and for himself alone, i.e., for his own sake and satisfaction, notbecause of a duty to God, fellow-men, the State or any other fool abstractionoutside of himself. A man has a code of ethics primarily for his own sake, notfor anyone else’s. Consequently, an ethical man is essentially an egoist. Aselfless man cannot be ethical.To explain what may sound like a paradox: if by ethics we understand all sets ofvalues, all standards of conduct and thought (without specifying at present justwhat standards are to be considered ethical; i.e., taking merely the quality ofvaluing, without defining how one should value), then a man who does notconsider his values as his, but merely as prescribed to him, or who actsvirtuously because he has to, not because he wants to—that man can hardly beconsidered virtuous or ethical. The man to whom virtue, or that which heconsiders virtue, is a necessity, not a painful duty, is the truly ethical man.As example: if a man dies for his cause, because he hates to do it, but feelsthat some higher power—God or State—compels him to, he is a poor hero; if a mandies because it is his cause and he wishes no choice but to defend it at anycost—he is a hero.The question as to what constitutes a standard of values will come later. Theprimary question is only to establish such a thing as a standard of values andits necessity as part of a man’s own self—without which there is no such thingas self.Now, then, if a man is a ruthless egoist, just what form does his egoism take?Does he fight, struggle and claim for himself those higher values and his rightto follow them? Or—? ?—what? The generally accepted example of pure egoism is aruthless financier who crushes everything in order to obtain money and power—butcan he truly be considered an egoist? What does he do with the money? To whatpurpose does he use the power? Doesn’t he merely—and this is always the casewith the conventional type of egoist—give up all standards of value, thoseprescribed to him as well as his own, in order to get the money? Doesn’t he playdown to the mob in every sense and manner, encouraging its vices, sacrificinghis own opinions, serving others, always others, as a slave—to gain his ownends? Well then—what ends?Who is the true egoist: The man who crushes his own “I” to succeed with others,to fool them, betray them, kill them—but still live as they want him to live andconquer to the extent of a home, a yacht and a full stomach? Or—the man who putshis own “I,” his standard of values, above all things, and conquers to live ashe pleases, as he chooses and as he believes? If a dictator, such as Hitler, forinstance, has to play down to the mob in order to hold his influence andrule—does he rule? Or does he merely give orders as long as he gives the kind oforders the mob wants to obey? In which case—who rules whom? If [WilliamRandolph] Hearst has a great influence because he always sits on the fence andsays only that which is “box-office” —where is the influence? When and where canhe say what he wants and succeed in getting it? Isn’t he the greatest of slavesinstead of the greatest of powers?Is power the possibility to force others into doing what you want—or merely insitting on a high throne, in the full glare of the public light, executing whatothers want you to do? If a man who is not a Nazi pretends to be one and goes onpretending to the end of his days in order to have a soft job, money and food—ishe to be called an egoist? Or isn’t the true egoist the one who starves in exilefor the right to believe what he believes?A true egoist, therefore, places his ego and the claims of his ego in the realmof higher values. He demands these values because he wants them, and is utterlyselfish in his demand. If higher values are the meaning of life, if they arelife—well then, an egoist demands the highest. The man who sacrifices thesevalues for physical comforts does not demand very much. He is not anegoist—because the ego is absent.An egoist is a man who lives for himself. In this, I can agree with the worst ofChristian moralists. The questions are only: 1) what constitutes living foroneself? and 2) if the first is answered my way, i.e., living for one’s highestvalues, then isn’t living for oneself the highest type of living, the only realliving and the only ethical living possible?Consequently, my “egoism as a new faith” is a higher meaning and a higherexaltation of the word “I,” of that feeling which makes man say and feel “I.”Which brings me to the second point of the book. II. The thing which is most “wrong with the world” today is its absolute lack ofpositive values. [There is a lack] of moral standards (not merely theold-fashioned “Victorian morals,” but of anything approaching morals, anythingthat values, differentiates and says “yes” or “no”), a lack of honor, a lack offaith (in a philosophical, not a religious meaning, faith as a set of certainprinciples, as a goal, aim or inspiration, as a life-system). Here again, it isnot the absence of a certain type of values that I mean, but the very act andhabit of valuing and selecting in one’s mental life. Nothing is considered badand nothing is considered good. There is no enthusiasm for living, since thereis no enthusiasm for any part, mode or form of living.(Incidentally, this explains the tremendous popularity of communism among peoplewho are not communists at all, particularly the young people. Communism, atleast, offers a definite goal, inspiration and ideal, a positive faith. Nothingelse in modern life does. The old capitalism has nothing better to offer thanthe dreary, shop-worn, mildewed ideology of Christianity, outgrown by everyone,and long since past any practical usefulness it might have had, even for thecapitalistic system. Furthermore, that same Christianity, with its denial ofself and glorification of all men’s brotherhood, is the best possiblekindergarten of communism. Communism is at least consistent in its ideology.Capitalism is not; it preaches what communism actually wants to live.Consequently, if there are things in capitalism and democracy worth saving, anew faith is needed, a definite, positive set of new values and a newinterpretation of life, which is more opposed, more irreconcilable, more fatalto communism than its bastard weak-sister—Christianity.)Returning to the immediate purpose of the book: A new set of values is needed tocombat this modern dreariness, whether it be communism (which I may not includein the book) or the sterile, hopeless cynicism of the modern age. That new faithis Individualism in all its deepest meaning and implications, such as has neverbeen preached before: individualism of the spirit, of ethics, of philosophy, notmerely the good old “rugged individualism” of small shopkeepers. Individualismas a religion and a code, not merely as an economic practice. (What in hell isthe kind of “individualism” that allows a man merely to run his own grocery[store] instead of a government cooperative, but sends this same shopkeeper tochurch on Sunday to pray for “loving his neighbor as himself”?) A revival (orperhaps the first birth) of the word “I” as the holiest of holies and the reasonof reasons.Am I wrong? Well—let’s consider it. What we actually have today is anindividualistic (or at least so-called) form of economics with the most perfectcommunistic ideology that any Soviet could hope to achieve. In our economic lifethere still is a chance for the private initiative that made all moderntechnical progress possible—but it is absolutely absent from our spiritual life.Consequently, we have the appalling spectacle, decried by all, of a highlydeveloped technological civilization along with complete spiritual stagnation.We have developed technically—oh yes!—but spiritually we are far belowRenaissance Italy. In fact, we have no spiritual life in the grand manner, inthe sense it used to be understood.Is it the fault of machines? Is the twentieth century incapable and unfit for myspiritual exultation? Or—is it only that little word “I,” which, after twentycenturies of Christianity’s efforts, has been erased from human consciousness,and along with it took everything that was human consciousness?It is not the purpose of the book to prove theoretically, point by point, whythe morality of individualism is superior to that of collectivism, why it is, infact, the only morality worthy of the name. The purpose is only to show how bothof them work in real life: to show the ultimate consequences and results ofboth—brought to their logical conclusions. Perhaps, in doing so, the questionwill be answered of itself and the proof will be given. It is not a question ofindividualism versus collectivism; it is a question of egoism [versus]selflessness. The latter [alternative] is the psychological basis of the former,in concrete human forms. The purpose is to prove that the so-called “selfish”man of today is the true collectivist in spirit, the man who has [renounced] hisown “I” for the dictates of others, who has accepted society as his absoluteruler in the realm of spiritual values—and paid the price. As a contrast, as themoral, the theme of the book—[I show] a man who is a true egoist, the man whoreally “lives for himself.”III. What do I mean by “second-hand lives”?1. All men who have lost the ability to choose, value and pronounce judgment onall questions of spiritual standards. For there is no true judge outside ofone’s “I.” Everything accepted on faith or on someone else’s authority is only awarmed-over spiritual hash.2. All men who have reversed the process of “end” and “means” and to whom themeans have become the end. For instance, if an egoist struggles for power toachieve his ambitions and ideals—well and good. But if, in the struggle, hesacrifices his ideals merely to achieve the power, he is accepting a second-handsubstitute, a thing that has no meaning, that brings him no value whatever, buttakes his values away instead.3. All men who, by betraying their egos, actually live for others, not forthemselves, live only through others (this is the main point). For instance: ifa man struggles for power and achieves it by accepting and championing theideology of the masses, he himself knows that he has no real power, but he hasit only in the eyes of the mob. If a man is a crook and cheats to achieve hisends—he himself knows that he is dishonest, but will struggle and scramble topreserve a respectable appearance and reputation in the eyes of others. If a manwants to be a writer and hires a ghost to do his great epic, then bows andhappily accepts popular acclaim—he himself knows that he is a nonentity, butrejoices in being a genius in the eyes of others. All deceits prompted byvanity, all reaping of faked successes, are a second-hand acceptance ofsomething existing only in the minds of our neighbors, not in us, not in our ownreality. (Vanity as the most selfless of qualities.) If a man is praised forwriting a trashy movie scenario, and glories in the praise, knowing it wastrash, he accepts a second-hand achievement in which he himself does notbelieve. If a man does not create what he likes, but creates that which he knowsothers will admire—it is second-hand creation.In other words, when a man shifts the center of his life from his own ego to theopinions of others, when those others become the determining factor in all hishigher values, when his ideals are one and his actual existence another, when hecheats himself of all reality to create it in others, when higher values becomemerely a [possession of others to be used] by him for money or physical gain,while he is cheating himself of those higher values and of all life’s meaning—heis leading a second-hand life.Consequently—coming back to where I started—the “great selfishness” of theconventional opportunist is merely an immense betrayal of his self.026 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_026_r1.gif]December 22, 1935To add to what I have written: The great tragedy and problem of the modern ageis the absence of all values. The preachers and moralists yell that capitalisticselfishness is responsible for it, and all those idealistically inclined embracecommunism as the cure for this guilt of selfishness. Exactly the opposite istrue: the absence of values is caused by the absence of ego. As explainedbefore, no ethics of any sort are possible without a feeling of egoism. Unless aman wants to be honorable and takes pride in being honorable—he is not going tobe honorable. If humanity, for twenty dreary centuries, has been battered byChristianity into believing selflessness is a virtue and into considering asideals things which are inherently impossible to it—all idealism is gone. Allambition toward an ideal, that which makes men wish to attain the highestpossible, is gone, since that highest, as preached by Christianity, isunattainable.If all of life has been brought down to flattering the mob, if those who canplease the mob are the only ones to succeed—why should anyone feel any highaspirations and cherish any ideals? The capitalistic world is low, unprincipledand corrupt. But how can it have any incentive toward principles when itsideology has killed the only source of principles—man’s “I”? Christianity hassucceeded in eliminating “self” from the world of ethics, by declaring “ethics”and “self” as incompatible. But that self cannot be killed. It has onlydegenerated into the ugly modern struggle for material success at the cost ofall higher values, since these values have been outlawed by the church.Hence—the hopelessness, the colorless drabness, the dreariness and emptybrutality of our present day.The same would happen to humanity under communism—if it could ever succeed andtake the place now held by the church. As long as men live, their “self” cannotbe killed. But it can be distorted into a monstrosity, as any living organismcan if reared in improper conditions and under an unbearable strain.The consequence? Until man’s “self” regains its proper position, life will bewhat it is now: flat, gray, empty, lacking all beauty, all fire, all enthusiasm,all meaning, all creative urge. That is the ultimate theme of the book—HowardRoark as the remedy for all modern ills.The theme, then, goes like this: Howard Roark is what men should be. I show: howand why others are different from him; what forms that difference takes; whatreasons create it; what it does to its victims—their successes and theirultimate tragedies. And I show what life [is] to Howard Roark, how he succeedsand what his success means. An illustrated message to the twentiethcentury—without benefit of Marxism.Instead of preaching more collectivism, men must realize that it is preciselycollectivism, in its logical consequences—a subtle, unnamed, unofficial, butstill all-powerful collectivism—that is the cause of mankind’s tragedy. It maynot be the economic collectivism for which the communists clamor, but it is aperfect form of ethical collectivism, not theoretical, but actual, living,working. And since collective ethics are claimed to be necessary for collectiveeconomy—take a look, gentlemen, we have those ethics already. We have them andwe don’t like them; it is not a pretty picture.Either “man” is the unit and the final sovereign—or else “men” are. And “men”means the mob, the State, the nation, the Soviet—anything one wishes to call it,anything that implies a number of humans, a herd. Man must live for the State,claim the communists. Well, man is living for other men, for the mob, completelyand hopelessly, only we don’t say so. I will show what it means to live forothers—just exactly what it actually means and how it works. If it’s notpretty—well, then, where’s the mistake? The old Christian—communist denial of“self.” Proper life is possible only when man is allowed (and encouraged, andtaught, and practically forced) to live for himself.(Sideline: “But a communist State will do precisely that!” yell the communists.“It will give each individual a chance!” How? By inoculating them with a“collective ideology”? There it is, your collective ideology, perfect andlogical and working.)If—and no communist has yet gone this far—they claim that man’s higher valueswill come from his sense of honor before the mob (or his “brothers”), that hewill be taught to value popular approval and esteem as reward for his efforts onthe State’s behalf, that in this way his egoism will become spiritual instead ofmaterialistic—how are you going to teach a contradiction? If he is to value hispride, his feeling of achievement, his personal glory, as his, how can he putthem into the hands of the mob? How can he want to live for himself if all hisactual life, his work, his ambition, his relations with others have to be guidedand motivated by the “good of the State,” by collective interests and collectivegain? How—if he is asked to live for others—is he going to have an incentive forself-respect and for his own higher values? A collective form of life withindividualistic ethics and spirituality? That is as impossible as the “ruggedindividualism” of modern capitalistic society with a collectivist form of ethicsand ideals—which is what we have today. The communist utopia of a collectiviststate with individual morality would come to the same dreary mess—only it willnever come.To repeat: living for others, i.e., “second-hand living,” is exactly what wehave today—in actual reality. And if that’s wrong, if it doesn’t work, if itcreates a repulsive, hopeless chaos, then the solution is “living for oneself.”Capitalistic democracy has no ideology. That is what the book has to give it.027 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_027_r1.jpg]Nothing has ever been created except by the will of a creator. Civilization isnot a collective process, the work of many men working together. It is the workof many men working alone. Each did what he could and wanted to do. No commoncause ever tied them to one another.All civilization, all progress—ethical, esthetical, philosophical,scientific—has been accomplished not by a cooperation between an originator andhis followers, between man and the mob, but by a struggle between man and themob. The mob has always been against novelty, originality, everything new andforward moving. It was individual men who made the forward step in each case,only to pay for it, often with their lives, because the mob resented it. But theworld did move forward, because life belongs to the leaders and the exceptions.The others follow. They don’t want to. They have to. They contribute nothing toprogress, except the impediments.If the best part of life, the mental life, everything above mere materialexistence, is creation, it presupposes a sense of valuation. How can one createif one does not first estimate—value—one’s materials? (That applies to science,arts, ethics, and all mental endeavor.) How can there be valuing without thosewho value? A verb does not exist in a vacuum. A verb presupposes a noun. Thereis no such thing as an action without the one who acts. And who can do thevaluing except a man?A collective valuing would amount to this: one believes what others believe,because others believe it. If we have ten people and each one of them chooses tobelieve only what the nine others believe—just exactly who establishes thebelief, and how? Multiply it by millions, on a world scale, and it’s still thesame. The laws of mathematics work the same for dozens, and for hundreds, andfor billions. There has to be a cause of causes, a determining factor, a basicinitiative. If it is not taken by a man—by whom, then, is it taken? If a man isnot the one to weigh, value and decide—who decides?A “collective” mind does not exist. It is merely the sum of endless numbers ofindividual minds. If we have an endless number of individual minds who are weak,meek, submissive and impotent—who renounce their creative supremacy for the sakeof the “whole” and accept humbly that “whole‘s” verdict—we don’t get acollective super-brain. We get only a weak, meek, submissive and impotentcollective mind.If a man is the ultimate creator, the one who values, then the worst of allcrimes is the acceptance of the opinions of others. [The worst men are those whosay:] “A thing is good because others say it’s good”; they are the men who lackthe ability or the courage to value on their own.As a ridiculous and petty but clear example of this type: the movie producersand the Hollywood type of mentality. The movies have produced no great work ofart, no immortal masterpiece to compare with the masterpieces of other arts.Why? Because the movies are not an art? Rubbish! Because those in charge do notcreate what they think is good, but what they think others will think is good.Because those in charge have no values of their own (and refuse to have) butaccept blindly anything and everything approved by someone else—anyone else.The movies are the perfect example of collective ideology and of “living forothers.” Why did all the other arts reach heights the movies never attained? Whydid they prosper and survive in spite of the fact that they did not consider the“box-office,” the mob’s approval? Precisely because they did not consider themob’s approval. They created—and forced the mob to accept their creations. Butthe movies “live for others.” And—they do not live at all. Not as an achievementand an end in themselves. Those working in the movies work to make money, not towork in the movies. Fine, if that’s all they want. But what do they get out ofthe money? What do they get in exchange for giving up the reality of their workand of their lives? They spend their lives at a second-hand task, a tasksecondary to their real purpose, a task which is only a means to an end. What isthe end? Shouldn’t the end be precisely that at which they spend their lives?But—they’re only second-hand people with second-hand lives!This is an example which is clearer and plainer than any other form of activity.It applies to other professions as well. The principle is the same. The resultis the same. December 26, 1935An important thing to remember and bring out in the book: while Howard Roark, atfirst glance, is monstrously selfish and inconsiderate of others—one sees, inthe end, his great consideration for the rights of others (when they warrant it)and his ruthlessness only in major issues; while Peter Keating, at first glance,is unusually kind, thoughtful, considerate of others and unselfish—in the end,it is clear that he will sacrifice anyone and everyone to his own small ends,whether he has to or not. In other words, those who show too much concern forothers and not for themselves, have no true respect for either. Only the one whorespects himself can also respect others (and only as a secondary matter, afterhimself). No other neighbor-feeling is possible.While, at first glance, Howard Roark is a stern, austere, gloomy man, who doesnot laugh readily, who does not crack jokes and enjoy “comedy-relief,” he is[actually] the truly joyous man, full of a profound, exuberant joy of living, anearnest, reverent joy, a living power, a healthy, unquenchable vitality. While,at first glance, Peter Keating is cheerful, optimistic, the “life of the party,”the true “good fellow”—he is [actually] a sad, desolate man, empty, desperate inhis emptiness, without life, without joy, hope or aim, a bitter cynic hiding hiscynical despair under a superficial, forced gaiety.The truly joyous man does not laugh too much, because there is little to laughat in life as it is today. The truly joyous man takes himself very seriously,because there is no joy without self and pride in self. Those who preach andpractice “not taking anything seriously” are not the gay, light hearted ones.They are merely the empty-hearted. “Taking seriously” is the very essence oflife. If one does not “take oneself seriously,” one can take nothing seriously.And—“the noble soul has reverence for itself.” One does not revere with agiggle.Above all, bring out the noble, all-pervading, joyous energy that permeates thebeing of Howard Roark and his whole life and every action, even in his tragedy.And—the dreary hopelessness of Peter Keating.CAST OF CHARACTERSHoward Roark: The noble soul par excellence. The self-sufficient, self-confidentman—the end of ends, the reason unto himself, the joy of living personified.Above all—the man who lives for himself, as living for oneself should beunderstood. And who triumphs completely. A man who is what he should be.Peter Keating: The exact opposite of Howard Roark, and everything a man shouldnot be. A perfect example of a selfless man who is a ruthless, unprincipledegotist—in the accepted meaning of the word. A tremendous vanity and greed,which lead him to sacrifice all for the sake of a “brilliant career.” A mob manat heart, of the mob and for the mob. His triumph is his disaster. He is left anempty, bitter wreck—his “second-hand life” takes the form of sacrificing all forthe sake of a victory that has no meaning and gives him no satisfaction becausehis means become his end. He shows that a selfless man cannot be ethical. He hasno self and, therefore, cannot have any ethics. A man who never could be [man ashe should be]. And doesn’t know it. A great publisher (Gail Wynand): A man who rules the mob only as long as he sayswhat the mob wants him to say. What happens when he tries to say what he wants.A man who could have been. A preacher (?): A man who tries to save the worldwith an outworn ideology. Show that his ideals are actually in working existenceand that they precisely are what the world has to be saved from. A movieproducer: A man who has no opinions and no values, save those of others. An actress (Vesta Dunning): A woman who accepts greatness in other people’seyes, rather than in her own. A woman who could have been. [Vesta Dunning wascut from the novel after the first draft of Part 1 was written. The main sceneswith Vesta have been published in The Early Ayn Rand.]Dominique Wynand: The woman for a man like Howard Roark. The perfect priestess.John Eric Snyte: The real ghost-writer-hirer. A man who glories in appropriatingthe achievements of others.Ellsworth Monkton Toohey: Noted economist, critic and liberal. “Noted” anythingand everything Great “humanitarian” and “man of integrity.” He glorifies allforms of collectivism because he knows that only under such forms will he, asthe best representative of the mass, attain prominence and distinction, which isimpossible to him on his own (non-existent) merits. The idol-crusher parexcellence. Born, organic enemy of all things heroic. He has a positive geniusfor the commonplace. The worst of all possible rats. A man who never couldbe—and knows it.January 15, 1936One more variation of “second-hand lives”: those who put any secondaryconsiderations before true values. Example: a man who gives a job to a friend,because he is a friend, rather than to the most deserving applicant, even thoughthe latter is what the business requires. A critic who praises the workaccording to his relations with the author, rather than according to the valueof the work. A secondary substitute. A “second-hand” way of living.This may sound naive. But—is our life ever to have any reality? Are we evergoing to live on the level? Or is life always to be something else, somethingdifferent from what it should be? A real life, simple and sincere, and evennaive, is the only life where all the potential grandeur and beauty of humanexistence can really be found. Are there real reasons for accepting thesubstitute, that which we have today? No one has shown [today‘s] life, as itreally is, with its real meaning and its reasons. I’m going to show it. If it’snot a pretty picture—well, what is the [alternative]? July 14, 1937[AR often rewrote sections of her journals, essentializing and condensing thematerial. As a rule, I have omitted these repetitions. However, I include thefollowing summary of the preceding journals, as an example of her method ofrewriting. This summary is presented out of chronological order; it was writtena year and a half after the original notes.]MAIN POINTS OF PLAN1. Defense of egoism in its real meaning.Demand the best for oneself. What is the best? Why? An ethical man isessentially an egoist. The selflessness of sacrificing one’s best for secondaryends, such as money or power, which cannot be used as he wishes. Conventionalselfishness—an immense betrayal of one’s very self.2. The thing most wrong with the world—lack of all values.Reason for the appeal of communism. Individualism as a complete new faith. Theactual spiritual collectivism of our modem life—and the root of all its evils.Egoism and selflessness presented in all their consequences. Howard Roark as thesalvation of mankind. (Our achievements in technique—where individualism reigns.Our degeneration in cultural matters—which have always been collective inAmerica.)The lack of principle in capitalism drives men to communism as the cure.Precisely the opposite is true. The evil is not too much selfishness, but notenough of it; not lack of collectivism, but too much of it. The cure—not thedestruction of individualism, but the creation of it. Christianity as the hatredof all ideals. Show clearly what real collectivism would actually mean. (On thebasis of what it means already today.)3. The meaning of “second-hand lives. ”All those who shift the center of their lives from their own egos to theopinions of others. When those others become the determining factor. When a mancheats himself of all reality in order to create it in others. Types of“second-handedness”: 1) Those who have lost the ability to value for themselvesand accept on faith or on someone’s authority the opinions of others. 2) Thosewho reverse the process of “end” and “means,” and to whom the means become theend. (Like money and power for their own sake.) 3) Those who actually exist onlyin the eyes of others, not in their own. (A crook who tries to be consideredrespectable. A writer who hires a ghost. An artist pandering to the box-office.The deceits of vanity—the most selfless, second-hand of all qualities.) 4) Thosewho put secondary considerations before actual ones (like giving a job to afriend, in preference to a man of real ability).“Second-handedness” destroys the reality of living. Our life is always not whatit appears to be. Our higher values have no existence in reality. Let us bereal.4. The theme condensed.Howard Roark is what men should be. I show: what he is, how and why others aredifferent from him, what forms that difference takes, what reasons create it,what it does to its victims—their successes and their ultimate tragedies. And Ishow what life [is] to Howard Roark, what hell he has to go through and why, howhe succeeds and what his success means.5. All progress as the work of individuals.Not a cooperation between man and mob, but a struggle of man against mob. Lifebelongs to the leader. The others follow. They don’t want to. They have to. Theycontribute nothing to progress, except the impediments.6. The difference in the attitudes of Roark and Keating (sub-issue).Those who show too much concern for others and not for themselves, have no truerespect for either. Only the man who respects himself can also respect others(and only as a secondary matter, after himself). No other neighbor-feeling ispossible.The truly joyous man takes himself very seriously, because there is no joywithout self and pride in self. Those who preach and practice “not takinganything seriously” are not the gay, light-hearted ones. They are merelyempty-hearted. One does not reverence with a giggle. Above all, bring out theall-pervading feeling of joy in the being of Howard Roark, and the drearyhopelessness of Peter Keating.CASTHoward Roark: The man who can be and is.Gail Wynand: The man who could have been.Peter Keating: The man who never could be and doesn’t know it.

[Earlier, this was AR’s description ofJohn Eric Snyte, who instead became the eclectic.]February 9, 1936HOWARD ROARKTall, slender. Somewhat angular—straight lines, straight angles, hard muscles.Walks swiftly, easily, too easily, slouching a little, a loose kind of ease inmotion, as if movement requires no effort whatever, a body to which movement isas natural as immobility, without a definite line to divide them, a light,flowing, lazy ease of motion, an energy so complete that it assumes the ease oflaziness. Large, long hands—prominent joints and knuckles and wrist-bones, withhard, prominent veins on the backs of the hands; hands that look neither youngor old, but exceedingly strong. His clothes always disheveled, disarranged,loose and suggesting an unknown. No awkwardness, but a certain savage unfitnessfor clothes. Definitely red, loose, straight hair, always disheveled.A hard, forbidding face, not in the least attractive according to conventionalstandards. More liable to be considered homely than handsome. Very prominentcheekbones. A sharp, straight nose. A large mouth—long and narrow, with a thinupper lip and a rather prominent lower one, which gives him the appearance of aneternal, frozen half-smile, an ironic, hard, uncomfortable smile, mocking andcontemptuous. Wrinkles or dimples or slightly prominent muscles, all of that andnone definitely, around the comers of his mouth. A rather pale face, withoutcolor on the cheeks and with freckles over the bridge of the nose and thecheekbones. Dark red eyebrows, straight and thin. Dark gray, steady,expressionless eyes—eyes that refuse to show expression, to be exact. Very long,straight, dark red eyelashes—the only soft, gentle touch of the whole face—asurprising touch in his grim expression. And when he laughs—which happensseldom—his mouth opens wide, with a complete, loose kind of abandon. A low,hard, throaty voice—not rasping, but rather blurred in its tone, though distinctin its sound, with the same soft, lazy fluency as his movements, neither onebeing soft or lazy. Attitude toward life. He has learned long ago, with his first consciousness, twothings which dominate his entire attitude toward life: his own superiority andthe utter worthlessness of the world. He knows what he wants and what he thinks.He needs no other reasons, standards or considerations. His complete selfishnessis as natural to him as breathing. He did not acquire it. He did not come to itthrough any logical deductions. He was born with it. He never questions itbecause even the possibility of questioning it never occurs to him. It is anaxiom to him as much as the fact of his being alive is an axiom. He is a manborn with the perfect consciousness of a man. [This passage conflicts with AR’srejection of innate ideas—see John Galt’s speech in Atlas Shrugged.]He is not even militant or defiant about his utter selfishness. No more than hecould be defiant about the right to breathe and eat. He has the quiet, complete,irrevocable calm of an iron conviction. No dramatics, no hysteria, nosensitiveness about it—because there are no doubts. A quiet, almost indifferentacceptance of an irrevocable fact.A quick, sharp mind, courageous and not afraid to be hurt, has long sincegrasped and understood completely that the world is not what he is.Consequently, he can no longer be hurt. The world has no painful surprise forhim, since he has accepted long ago just what he can expect from it.Indifference and an infinite, calm contempt is all he feels for the world andfor other men who are not like him. He understands men thoroughly. And,understanding them, he dismisses the whole subject. He knows what he wants andhe knows the work he wants. That is all he expects of life. Being thoroughly a“reason unto himself,” he does not long for others of his kind, forcompanionship and understanding.He also knows that the world will not give him the right to his work easily. Hedoes not expect it to be given. He enters life prepared to find it a struggle.And although he is a warrior above all, he does not consider himself such. Thestate of strife and battle is natural to him as a synonym of life. He does notthink of himself as “Howard Roark, a soldier.” He thinks: “A soldier, because heis Howard Roark.”Consequently, there is no danger of suffering. He does not suffer, because hedoes not believe in suffering. Defeat or disappointment are merely a part of thebattle. Nothing can really touch him. He is concerned only with what he does.Not how he feels. How he feels is entirely a matter of his own, which cannot beinfluenced by anything and anyone on the outside. His feeling is a steady,unruffled flame, deep and hidden, a profound joy of living and of knowing hispower, a joy that is not even conscious of being joy, because it is so steady,natural and unchangeable. If outside life brings him disappointment—well, it ismerely a detail of the battle. He will have to struggle harder—that’s all. Theworld becomes merely a place to act in. But not to feel in. The feeling—thewhole [realm] of emotions—is in his [power] alone. He is a reason unto himself.He cannot feel differently. He was born that way.His whole attitude toward himself, life and other men is completely clear tohim. He does not even have to ponder about it—it is his very nature to be clear,consistent and logical about everything. His main policy in life is to refuse,completely and uncompromisingly, any surrender to the thoughts and desires ofothers. He wants to be an architect. He knows what he thinks of his work andwhat and how he will create. He expects others to accept his creation. Notbecause he needs their acceptance, but merely because they will be the ones tolive in and use his buildings. He does not consider his work as concerned withthe benefit and convenience of others. They are merely a convenience for hiswork. He does not build for people. People live for his buildings. He does notexpect or wish admiration: he merely expects a humble bow to his superior spiritand its creation—because such is the nature of things and mere justice.If he cannot get the right to do the work as he wants it done—well, then, he’lltake a fifteen-dollar job as a common worker, and wait and work for his chance.Because the rewards of success as such—money, ease and fame—mean nothingwhatever to him; his life has to be real, his life is his work, he will do hiswork as he wants it done, the only way he can enjoy it—or not at all, and perishin the battle. Because the second-hand consolations most people get out of lifehave no meaning for him, he will not compromise by building inferior buildings,nor by pretending adherence to the prejudices of those in power to gain theirfavors and their jobs. He will be himself at any cost—the only thing he reallywants of life. And, deep inside of him, he knows that he has the ability to winthe right to be himself. Consequently, his life is clear, simple, satisfying andjoyous—even if very hard outwardly.He is in conflict with the world in every possible way—and at complete peacewith himself. And his chief difference from the rest of the world is that he wasborn without the ability to consider others. As a matter of form and necessityon the way, as one meets fellow travelers—yes. As a matter of basic, primaryconsideration—no. And the whole tone of his life is set by that one idea, onefeeling—he is “a reason unto himself.”If he chooses the harder way, it is not through stupidity, stubbornness or adesire to be a martyr; it is merely because he knows he can make his way in themanner he pleases and will make it, and because he prefers his manner of makingit. He has a tremendous, unshatterable conviction that he can and will force mento accept him, not beg and cheat them into it. He will take the place he wants,not receive it from others. Consequently, the profound serenity, joy, grandeurof his entire life and whole being.His emotions are entirely controlled by his logic. Or rather—they are one andinseparable, with the emotions following the logic. (Show how this is possible.)His whole philosophy: pride in oneself, confidence in oneself, placing one’slife and fate above all, but only the kind of life one wishes. Religion—none. Not a speck of it. Born without any “religious brain center.”Does not understand or even conceive of the instinct for bowing and submission.His whole capacity for reverence is centered on himself. Needs no mystical“consolation,” no other life. Thinks too much of this world to expect or desireany other. Politics—interested only in not being interested in politics. Society as suchdoes not exist for him. Other people do not interest him. He recognizes only theright of the exceptional [man] (and by that he means and knows only himself) tocreate, and order, and command. The others are to bow. [Here we see a remnant ofthe Nietzscheanism prominent in The Little Street. For AR’s mature view, see“Man’s Rights ” in the Virtue of Selfishness.] Ethics—only a code of his own, and only because he wants it. Doesn’t know whatthe word “duty” means. Plays straight—because he would feel contempt for himselfif he were to sneak and lie. Says what he means—whether others like it or not.He is not concerned with their liking it. They will have to accept it. His lifeand work come above all—nothing and no one can interfere, or even be consideredbeside it. Sex—sensuous in the manner of a healthy animal. But not greatly interested inthe subject. Can never lose himself in love. Even his great and onlylove—Dominique Wynand—is not an all-absorbing, selfless passion. It is merelythe pride of a possessor. If he could not have her, it would not break him oraffect him very deeply. He might suffer—in his own indifferent way, a sufferingthat can never reach deep enough to obscure life.His attitude toward Dominique is not: “I love you and I am yours.” It’s: “I loveyou and you are mine.” It is primarily a feeling of wanting her and getting her,without great concern for the question of whether she wants it. Were itnecessary, he could rape her and feel perfectly justified. Needless to say, itis she who worships him, and loves him much more than he loves her. He is thegod. He can never become a priest. She has to be the priestess. Until hismeeting with Dominique, he has had affairs with women, perfectly cold,emotionless affairs, without the slightest pretense at love. Merely satisfying aphysical need and recognized by his mistresses as such. Ambition—see life. His whole being. Not even recognized by him as ambition.Merely his natural behavior, the only way he could be and act.His manner is one of profound, inexorable calm. A strong kind of calm. Nothingcan really arouse him—at least not outwardly. A slow, deliberate manner ofspeaking. Precise, unhurried movements. Laughs seldom. Does not joke. When hedoes—it is merely a quiet, indifferent kind of sarcasm. A man so far above menthat nothing can really reach him. Never an emotional outbreak. Never losescontrol of himself.And yet—a flaming intensity of feeling for his work and creation. And for lifein general. A flame reserved only for himself. No one is ever to see, guess orwitness it. And yet—its radiance is ever-present, in his indifferent calmitself, a radiance felt by all. Suffering makes him merely tenser and harder. Agreat deal of cruelty toward himself. And consequently toward others. Does notrecognize suffering as such, or grant it any privileges and considerations. Bythe same token, he will never inflict unnecessary suffering or cruelty uponothers. But when necessary, he will do it without even noticing it, without ashudder or a hint of hesitation. The book is the story of Howard Roark’s triumph. It has to show what the man is,what he wants and how he gets it. It has to be a triumphant epic of man’sspirit, a hymn glorifying a man’s “I.” It has to show every conceivable hardshipand obstacle on his way—and how he triumphs over them, why he has to triumph.These obstacles, of course, can come from only one source: other men. It issociety, with its boggled chaos of selflessness, compromise, servility and lies,that stands in the way of Howard Roark. It is every conceivable form of“second-hand living” that fights him, that tries to crush him as only a mob cancrush—and fails in the attempt. To every second-hand creature he stands as acontrast, a reproach and a lesson.We follow him from graduation as an architect to his ultimate, highest, completevictory. On the way, there are three main obstacles to face him: professional,economical, emotional. Professionally, it is the natural opposition of the mobto genius: total lack of understanding of his ideas, petty jealousies,resentment of the strange and the new, the stubborn stupidity of conservatism,the “social” angle of refusing opportunity to one who so totally lacks thesocial [ability of] boot-licking. As a consequence, [he endures] economicalhardships, years of struggle with obscure jobs, poverty, silent, grim,relentless work. Every economical humiliation that society knows how to inflict.Emotionally, his first love is thwarted and denied—because of hisunconventional, uncompromising attitude (Vesta). February II, 1936PETER KEATINGMedium height, slender, graceful. Too graceful, with the studied, perfect, toosoft and fluent grace of a ballet dancer. Carries himself erect, a deliberateerectness that seems a living illustration of the good, conventional “chin up”motto. Very pretty hands, always perfectly groomed. Always well dressed, wellgroomed and suggesting the manner of a fashion-plate, even in cheap clothes. Along, rather small, oval-shaped head, with a certain classical perfection in theshape of the skull. Long, narrow, pale face and attractive, almost femininesmooth skin, with a delicate, wax-like, transparent and milky texture. Long,thin nose and a very small mouth, delicate, flower-like and pretty, inclined topout in a “bee-stung” manner, a mouth that would be small and pretty even on agirl. Dark, well-shaped eyes, alive, alert and softly lustrous. Obviously smarteyes, not deep or intelligent, but smart. Well-shaped eyebrows. Rather small,but well-shaped and pale forehead. Very black hair, set in a perfect, naturalwave with soft, small ringlets in front. A rather high-pitched voice, softenedby a studied, deliberate touch of kindly, velvet smoothness. An unnatural smile,soft, kindly, gentle and too friendly, considered fascinating and charming byall but the most discriminating ones. An unpleasant, insincere laughter, pitchedon a high, oily, blurred hiccough sound, inclined to run into giggling. Attitude toward life. Vanity grown out of all proportions. A vanity expressed inonly one manner: to convince others of his superiority. Never a thought given tohow he himself feels about things or values them; always—what others will thinkof him; and an overwhelming, burning anxiety to have them feel envy. All thisnever thought out or realized; just a blind, compelling instinct. This instincthas trained him to perfection in the ability to seize upon every thought andcircumstance as helpful or detrimental to his main end. A lightning-like,instinctive, unreasoning ability to seize upon every possible advantage to hisgoal, long before his mind points out to him just where and what that advantagemay be.No philosophy of life ever thought out. No feeling of need for one. Never givento much abstract thinking. No such thing as peace with himself, since even theidea of any “self” to consider has never occurred to him. No internal strife toconsider for a long time, and when it does come it is too late, since the strifeand the realization of its possibility both come at the same time.Consequently, no convictions of any kind on any subject whatever. A blind,stubborn idea that convictions are useless and unnecessary. Fooled himself longago, before he could realize that he was fooling himself, into the belief thathis superiority lay precisely in his freedom from the bounds of convictions.Only an instinctive, subconscious resentment and impatient annoyance with thosehe considers to be “idealists,” left in him as a reminder of his unrealized, butsubconsciously felt inferiority. This drives him, in self-protection, into abitter, vicious resentment of men “with ideas.”His main principle: “don’t take anything seriously.” A cheap cynicism andiconoclastic fury against everything high, noble and exceptional parade underthe cloak of a “sense of humor,” “practical common sense,” and “keeping yourfeet on the ground.” Defending as “reality” all that he wishes reality to be. February 12, 1936[Peter Keating has] an invisible habit of belittling, mocking and dragging downeverything high. He greatly enjoys “debunking” biographies of famous men andeverything that tends to prove that great men were “only human.” Loves to insistthat “we’re all brothers under the skin.” Has accepted as a faith, withoutthought or conviction behind it, the glorification of the so-called “humanelement”: the equality of men, the average good fellow, kindness, patience,tolerance, good neighborly feelings, love of children, home, family, etc. (Suchconvictions are not dangerous to his vanity, since they belong to the inferiorman.) Doesn’t really mean or believe it, but is convinced that he believes it.Abstractly, of course. His “convictions” and his actions are things quite apartand the incongruity never occurs to him or bothers him.He is as dishonest with himself as he is with others. His great motto: “Ifanyone has a car, I want two cars. If anyone has two cars, I want three cars.And I want to be sure they know it.” Has selected architecture merely because hethinks it will give him a great chance at his kind of “success.” No real love ortalent for the work. Would have selected street-cleaning or shoe-mending with anequal pleasure, if it promised more advancement. Attitude toward men. A mob man at heart. Completely gregarious. Has nosatisfaction or interest in himself, consequently cannot stand to be alone.Prefers and selects inferior people among whom he can shine. Talks a great dealabout the “communal spirit,” but sees to it that he is always the leader of any“commune.” Always plays up to others and revels in his great popularity. Neverexpresses a definite opinion on any subject, even the weather. Always sits onthe fence. Calls it diplomacy. Acts as if each new man he meets is his greatestfriend and the most interesting person in the world. Listens with immenseinterest to everyone else’s troubles. Never remembers a word of it. Always readyand delighted to help others—and says so. Never forgets to mention past favorshe has rendered. Loves to take credit for the achievements of those he hashelped. Fools himself with believing that he is sincere in his altruism. Doesn’trealize that it is caused by the subconscious instinct that tells him thisaltruism will help him a great deal in his cause, his vanity, in the opinions ofothers. But he will never lift a finger if helping another would really cost himanything or if there is no glory in such helping. And he would not hesitate tocut [others‘] throats, even unnecessarily, if he thinks it will help him.Loves movies and popular plays and vaudeville and, occasionally, magazines ofthe “Liberty” kind. Loves best-selling novels, particularly the “human interest”ones. Feels genuine respect for anything that has proved popular or has mademoney, no matter what he himself may have thought about it. Prefers storiesabout mothers, children, and dogs. Loves animals and declares them superior tomen. Donates to orphan asylums and societies for the prevention of cruelty toanimals. Shrugs at old classics, particularly those of the heroic type, as beingold-fashioned hokum—as opposed to wholesome, “modern” humanness. Loves andenjoys everything that gives him a patronizing feeling of superiority: the weak,the helpless, the meek and sentimental. Dismisses everything high with acontemptuous accusation of “high hat.” Announces for all to hear that he wouldlove nothing better than a home and children, particularly children, but doesnothing to satisfy his desire.His manner is soft, friendly, graceful. Extremely popular. The “soul of theparty,” the “regular fellow,” the “dream lover” of many a female. Judiciouslymixes seriousness and jokes. Talks in nothing but platitudes. Always has to havefriends and “best pals.” Philosophy—none. Religion—none to speak of as far as sincerity is concerned. But a great deal oftalk about the high principles of Christianity, the simple faith and theinevitable necessity of religion. Makes a show of going to church whenadvisable. Talks of the “Spirit” and of a “Superior Power” or “UniversalPrinciple.” At heart—a dumb, superstitious fear and a vague admittance ofsomething “Above.” Refuses to believe that there is “nothing after death” anddreads the whole subject. Politics—interested only as much as it can help him. Joins whatever party isadvisable at the moment. Member of every fraternity, club, lodge and order it ispossible for him to join. Ethics—none. No conception of the idea. But a great deal of talk about it in thegood, accepted, middle-class manner. Sex—highly sexed and completely “dual-personality” on the subject. On the onehand—preaches home, love, marriage, purity and respectability. Considersphysical sex low and dirty. Proclaims pure, spiritual love as the perfect ideal.Cries over love stories. On the other hand—loves his physical sex and his women.Dissipates wildly but judiciously. Patronizes whorehouses. But is alwaysdiscreet—very discreet. Ambition—overwhelming, but in one line only, on the line of his vanity. Alwaysbelittles his ambition and all ambitions, but never misses a chance to mentionhis achievements.He acts servile with superiors and overbearing with inferiors. Goes out of hisway to humiliate those under him, with nothing to gain for himself, except afeeling of superiority.April 21, 1936028 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_028_r1.gif]February 22, 1937ELLSWORTH MONKTON TOOHEYThe non-creative “second-hand” man par excellence. The critic, expressing andmolding the voice of public opinion; the average man condensed, representing theaverage man’s qualities plus the peculiar qualities which make him the naturalleader of average men.Theme-song: a vicious, ingrown vanity coupled with an insane will to power, alust for superiority that can be expressed only through others, whom, therefore,he has to dominate; a natural inferiority complex that subconsciously leads to[the desire to] bring everything down into inferiority. A tremendous ego—withoutcontent. No reasons for his egotism—“I am I,” that’s all, without concern forwhat this “I” really is.Important trait to emphasize as a social implication: this type is the one who,once in a position of power, subconsciously, but with an unerring instinct,surrounds himself with his moral and intellectual equals, works to fill otherpositions of power with his own kind, closing all doors he can to genuine talentand superiority, since this last would be too great a threat for him. None of itis conscious—just an innate instinct of self-preservation.Here is the place to emphasize that genuinely superior beings are tooindividualistic [in social matters], in the sense that they achieve their ownpositions and are not concerned with the propagation and advancement of theirown kind. It is only the inferior men that have collective instincts—becausethey need them. But since the superior men live in society, they have toorganize for their own protection—a kind of class brotherhood of talent—if theyare to survive at all. The only kind of “unselfishness” permissible to the greatman is unselfishness to the cause of that superior form of living which herepresents, and which has to be protected in the persons of other individualslike him. (Social instinct as the weapon and protection of the inferior.)Toohey’s physical appearance: medium height, rather on the shortish side,skinny, anemic, concave-chested, spindly, slightly bow-legged, ridiculous andoffensive in a bathing suit. A glaring lack of vitality—compensated, so hethinks, by his intellectual achievements. Long, narrow face, slightly recedingchin, protruding upper teeth, in a sharp, circular, rodent fashion—not too gooda set of teeth, nor too clean. Narrow, sharp black eyes, set close together,bright and “intellectual” between slightly puffed, heavy lids. A Hitler-likesmall black mustache—carefully trimmed. Luxurious hair—black, lustrous andfaintly suggesting a wave—thoroughly well groomed, leaving just the faintestdoubt between natural carelessness or very deliberate, retouched, marcelledpicturesqueness. Not a mane, but somehow suggesting a mane—seeming too large forhis light frame, making him vaguely top-heavy—more in impression than in fact.Thin, expressive hands and small feet, with a mincing, uncertain, unsteady,nervous walk.He has a magnificent voice—a true achievement. Deep, low, well-modulated, clear,precise and expressive. Perhaps a little offensive to some people, because ofits smug perfection—but to a very few people. He has made a thorough study ofvoice-culture, but does not like to mention it—prefers to let people think it isnatural. Shrugs deprecatingly when complimented on his voice, but never missesor forgets the compliments.Went into “intellectualism” in a big way. Two reasons: first, a subconsciousrevenge for his obvious physical inferiority, a means to a power his body couldnever give him; second (and primary), a cunning perception that only mentalcontrol over others is true control, that if he can rule them mentally he isindeed their total ruler. His vanity is not passive like that of Peter, who isconcerned with other people only as mirrors for his vanity; Toohey is very muchconcerned with other people in the sense of an overwhelming desire to dominatethem. This is the lust for power, but it is a “second-hand” power. It ismotivated not by some deep conviction of his own to be imposed upon others, whowould thus be secondary to him and his conviction, but by subconsciouslyadopting the convictions of others in order to rule them and thus acquire hisown grandeur through the number of people he dominates, deriving hisself-satisfaction from them. They are actually the prime factor and he a“second-hand” creature devoid of all personal significance but that given to himby others.In contrast to Peter, Toohey does believe strongly and earnestly in ideals andconvictions, but they must be the ideals he has accepted. He is intolerant,impatient and sarcastic to all intellectual opposition. He believes in“principles,” realizing subconsciously that a strict adherence to a set ofprinciples delivers men into his hands when he is the chief proponent of theseprinciples. He is the loud defender of the “intellect,” of “brain over brawn” or“mind over matter.” Such words as “culture,” “civilization,” “progress,” “thespiritual heritage of centuries,” “ethics,” “esthetics,” and “philosophy” arehis favorites, to the point where he has become convinced that he is theirliving embodiment.Now as to his convictions. [As a consequence of] his basic lust for power—a“second-hand” power not expressed in any concrete ideal of his own—hisconvictions are all those which are expedient to his attainment of such power.He has realized ahead of many others the tremendous power of the masses, which,for the first time, are acquiring real significance in all (even theintellectual) aspects of life. In this sense, he is the man of the century, thegenius of modern democracy in its worst meaning.The first cornerstone of his convictions is equality—his greatest passion. Thisincludes the idea that, as two-legged human creatures, all possess certainintrinsic value by the mere fact of having been born in the shape of men, notapes. Any concrete, mental content inside the human shape does not matter. Agreat brain or a great talent or a magnificent character are of no importance ascompared to that intrinsic value all possess as men—whatever that may be. He isnever clear on what that may be and rather annoyed when the question is raised.He avoids it by running to meet it and by silencing the issue with a great dealof talk. He talks of the “human spirit,” the “spark of God in all of us,” the“man created in God’s own image,” the “best in the worst of us,” etc.His talk is on a grand scale, staggering, magnificent, its bromides well-hiddenunder the latest scientific terms, the whole worked out brilliantly on theformula of saying things that sound profound until one stops to think of whatexactly they mean and finds that they mean nothing. Inasmuch as beliefs areimportant to him only as a means to an end, and that is the extent of his beliefin beliefs, he is not bothered by his inconsistencies, by the vagueness andillogic of his convictions. They are efficient and effective to secure the endshe is seeking. They work—and that is all they’re for.Once the equality of men is established, the advantages to his type are obvious.It discredits the superior type of man whom he hates, dreads and envies. Itminimizes, through a metaphysical, “humanitarian” hocus-pocus, the qualities andvirtues which the superior type possesses and which he lacks. It deniessuperiority and subordinates it to that vague “humanness” which he can claimalong with everyone else. But, mainly, it assures him of superiority—his brandof it. Deeply and subconsciously he knows that he is a second-rater and arepresentative of the average. That [knowledge], aided by a certain amount ofbrains, puts him in the category of “upper-class average”; but he is devoid ofall individuality and creative power, which dooms him hopelessly to the average(in other words, he is a plain average man spiritually, but slightly above themob mentally, in the facile sense of cunning, not wisdom). [Hence] he becomesthe true representative, leader and condensation of the average. Once the [menat the top] are removed or discredited, he is the top. As the bestrepresentative of the masses, he can attain the prominence, distinction andpower [which would be] impossible to him on his own personal merits. In anindividualistic society, where men have to stand or fall by what they really arein themselves, where they are valued as single men and by no other standard—heis nothing. In a collective mass society, where quantity stands above quality(another unreal, “second-hand” substitution)—he is everything. Hence hisprofound urge toward equality and collectivism, or his “social conscience,” ashe calls it.This “social conscience” is an outstanding, dominant trait in him. He has aninstinctive interest in everything concerning others. He is the born spiritualmeddler, reformer, and “social worker.” Societies, clubs, lodges, organizationsof any kind attract him irresistibly. His is not the cruder interest of Peter,who joins for what he can get out of it for himself. Toohey joins to take anactive part, for what he can do to others. In everything he joins he soonbecomes the leading voice and the influence. He is no rank-and-file member,ever; he is always on the committee or the board of directors. He is not afteradvancing his own career; he is after molding the lives of others, which is hiscareer. (The monstrosity of “selfless” egotism.) One will always find him on thestationery of “Slum Clearance Leagues,” “Mass Education Leagues,” “ModernEducation Leagues,” “Recreation for the Poor Leagues,” “Social FoundationLeagues,” and prize-giving “Art Leagues.”Toohey is a “humanitarian” and a “radical.” He is a humanitarian because hisgreat love for and eternal preoccupation with humanity gives him the standingand prestige he does not possess as a man; it fills the void [caused by a lack]of all individual creativity, the void in a man who has nothing to offer inhimself, only in, through and for others. (A “second-hand” man par excellence.Only those who have nothing in themselves are too concerned with others.) He isa radical because the theory of the triumphant, totalitarian mass is still a newone in the world, particularly in its spiritual implications and sources, whichhe realizes full-well, but never mentions explicitly. Up to the twentiethcentury and Soviet Russia, the world [had offered some degree] of recognitionfor individual achievement, recognition of leaders and exceptions as opposed tothe masses; the trend of “liberalism” and the idea of “freedom” was freedom for“a man” and the fight for the individual rights of “a man.” When humanityachieved that freedom after the Industrial Revolution, or came as near tofreedom and general equality before the law as it had ever come, one thingbecame apparent to the deluded idealists who, in fighting for the “rights ofman,” included all men, presumed all men to be equal, or at least potentiallyequal given equal opportunities. Whether under modern capitalism the best menalways won (and undoubtedly they often did not) was not as important as the factthat capitalistic democracy showed plainly that there is a best. And that thebest [among men] are opposed to the rest of humanity.The liberals and humanitarians are now faced with a choice: either admit thatthere are differences among men more profound and irrefutable than those ofmoney or aristocratic birth, and therefore fight for the rights and the freedomof the best among men, rights and freedom which the average men do not want, donot understand and cannot use or protect, and stop the damnable preoccupationwith the “poor” as such, the poor who have no distinction beyond their poverty;or—deny these ideals and, keeping only the philosophical zeal for all humanity,bring mankind down to the level of the masses, deny to the few the rights whichendanger the masses, benefit the masses by destroying their eternal enemy—theexceptional man, and instead of fighting for the individual rights which havehitherto been known as “human” rights, reverse the process, fight against theserights, for these rights are the enemy, not the liberation of the masses. [By“masses” AR refers here to second-handers who wish to live by exploiting bettermen. For evidence of her respect for honest men of average ability, see thecharacters of Mike Donnigan in The Fountainhead and Eddie Willers in AtlasShrugged.]Communism, the Soviet variety particularly, is not merely an economic theory. Itdoes not demand economic equality and security in order to set each individualfree to rise as he chooses. Communism is, above all, a spiritual theory whichdenies the individual, not merely as an economic power, but in every respect. Itdemands spiritual subordination to the mass in every way conceivable—economic,intellectual, artistic; it allows individuals to rise only as servants of themasses, only as mouthpieces for the great average. It places Ellsworth MonktonToohey at the top of the human pyramid.Hence, Toohey’s natural “radicalism.” In it, he is subtler, deeper and moreconsistent than many a modem communist. If some communists come to a spiritualcollectivism somewhat reluctantly, as a necessity for achieving economiccollectivism, Toohey reverses the process, much more logically. He embracesspiritual collectivism first; economic collectivism is only a means to thatultimate end.When and if the mob is enthroned as the supreme arbiter of all life, EllsworthMonkton Toohey will rule the earth. As a voice of the mob, to be sure; but to a“second-hand” man this does not matter. What if he is only the servantspiritually—when there is nothing in his spirit that may wish to rule, noideals, no convictions, no creative power strictly his own? Spiritual servilityis not abhorrent to a man devoid of spirituality, in the only sense in whichspirituality exists—in the powerful, self-contained, self-reverent ego. Inactual, material life—devoid of all spiritual content, as a collective life mustbe when the only source of spirt, the ego, is removed—he will be the ruler. Hewill have no fear of competition from his spiritual superiors, since they willbe destroyed, or if any are still born they will have no chance against him,[because they] lack his power of mob appeal when the mob is supreme. And theonly danger to his power—the spiritual or mental life of humanity—will be takencare of by an all-pervading propaganda for the ideals that made his risepossible, the ideals of mob supremacy, a smoke-screen to fill the emptiness ofthe human spirit, a spirit castrated, denied and offered its own denial tosatisfy its hunger.Such is Toohey’s secret dream and Utopia. He knows all the possible approachesto it and his convictions derive from that, have that dream as a motivation.Everything that proceeds from the individual and the exception is bad;everything that proceeds from the masses and the average is good. He takes agreat interest in folklore, in anonymous legends and songs, as opposed toindividual creations of artists. He proclaims the supremacy of “folk art” overany other art. He adopted the Marxist theory easily and naturally, primarilybecause it discredits the significance of individuals in history in favor of theeconomic significance of the masses; also, in subordinating the spiritual to theeconomic, in proclaiming the dependence of the spirit upon the material, itgives men like Toohey a great weapon against their enemy, the spirit: just takecontrol of humanity’s economics—[which is] concrete and accessible—and you can(hope to) control humanity’s spirit.In opposing the existing order of society, it is not the big capitalists andtheir money that Toohey opposes; he opposes the faint conceptions ofindividualism still existing in that society, and the privileged few as itsmaterial symbols. He says that he is fighting Rockefeller and Morgan; he isfighting Beethoven and Shakespeare. He says he is fighting for a comfortablehome with a bathroom for every financially disinherited factory hand; he isfighting for a comfortable throne and a halo for every spiritually disinheritedToohey. Hence his great preoccupation with the poor and the lower classes. He isknown as a great, unselfish crusader in unselfish causes; his crusade isthoroughly selfish in the [sense of the] perverted selfless selfishness of the“second-hander.”It is not surprising, therefore, to find him with a reputation of “daring,”“progressiveness” and “originality.” He is all of that, in the sense that thetotal supremacy of the masses is a new idea in the world and he, as its apostle,may be considered daring or original. In that sense, he is the champion ofeverything “new,” particularly if it helps in the fight against theindividualism of the old. He is a great champion of the Art Moderne. He is thedefender and publicizer for Gertrude Stein in literature, the “surrealists” inpainting, the cacophony of “new” music, and the factory-made standardized modernhouse in architecture. He knows, half-subconsciously, that all these phony fakesare easy for anyone and deny the true originality, genius and rarity of greatartists.In his chosen profession as an Art and Architecture Critic, he defends, aboveall, a standard. He is all for the old academic eclecticism, where it imposesrules, restraints and precedents on individual creation; he started as a rabiddefender of eclecticism (“We cannot improve upon the masters of the past,accepted and recognized by whole nations and whole centuries of nations”) untilhe discovered a new standardization in the factory-made “moderne,” this lastmove in keeping with his social theories and his general reputation forradicalism. Before the spread of the “moderne,” he was opposed to modemarchitecture. And he has been opposed and is forever opposed to Howard Roark.Peter Keating is his true disciple and protégé, and Peter switches with Tooheyfrom conservative eclecticism to extreme, mechanical, unoriginal modernism.(When convenient. But still continues with his “classic orders”—whenconvenient.) In the early stages of modern architecture, Toohey decried it anddefended the old—on a typical ground: “Why force individual eccentricity andidiosyncrasy on the will and taste of the people expressed in their preferencefor conventional homes?” With the growth of the philosophy of mob supremacy andthe emergence of modernism in set mass-forms, a modernism as stiff and frozenand unoriginal as the old traditions—he switched to it easily and naturally.He realized, on that example, that to be the true “voice of the people” he hadto become a radical opposed to the majority sentiment at present—for the sake ofan ultimate, complete triumph for real majority sentiment. The mob had not yetbeen taught to openly and consistently worship itself as a mob; it still hadvestiges of respect for individualism ground into it by centuries ofaristocracy; it is the duty of Toohey to teach the mob exactly what to believein order to inherit the earth; it is his job to awaken the mob to its own power.He can be—and it is only [an apparent] paradox—an exception and a rebel againstpresent society, which, after all, is not yet collectivized spiritually—in orderto establish conditions which will make him the true and complete “voice ofsociety.”Toohey studies voraciously. He has a magnificent memory for facts andstatistics; he is known as a “walking encyclopedia.” This is natural—since hehas no creative mind, only a repeating, aping, absorbing “second-handed” one. Hehas nothing new to create, but can acquire importance by absorbing the works andachievements of others. He is a sponge, not a fresh spring. His passivelyretentive memory has always made him a good scholar; he was a brilliant pupil inschool—the kind who always knew his lessons, had the neatest copy-books,preferred his homework to athletic games (in which he would have no chance),wore glasses, often had head-colds, and his mother had to watch his diet. Anintellectual child with a delicate stomach.Since his scholastic achievements took a great deal of painstaking, meticulouswork, he has always resented his quick, brilliant classmates to whom study wasno effort. Hence, his great defense of hard work as the key to everything(“perspiration is inspiration”), the conviction that hard work can accomplishanything, that talent does not count for so much, because a hard worker canequal and even beat any of “your geniuses.” He was not so good at mathematics inschool, but great at history, literature, psychology, and penmanship. He went toSunday School, because of a religious lower-middle-class mother (“ChristianScience”).His great asset is the fact that he is by no means dull. He has nothing new tooffer, but he is perfect at the old and he can do the conventional better thananyone else—the secret and key to his success. He sells pills of bromides, buthe can devise brand new coatings for them—the sure way to popular acclaim. He isgenuinely witty—[usually] in a sharp, insidiously sarcastic way. His sarcasm,for which he is famous, is an art: it is subtle, elaborately polite, personal,“deadly” according to those in his frame of mind. Elaborate politeness isanother of his specialties. His manners are impeccable. He speaks with a fainttouch of the broad “a”—just faint enough to be considered charming anddistinguished. “Distinguished” is his favorite adjective to apply to himself.Sarcasm is his pet weapon—as natural to him as smell to the skunk—as a method ofoffense and defense. He is magnificently, maliciously catty. He does not fighthis opponents by straight argument or logical refutation—he disqualifies themfrom the game, dismisses them by mockery. Perhaps he has no refutation to offer,but that does not matter for his purpose. He communicates to his audience thefeeling of his superiority over his opponents, the impression that he does notanswer them because they are not even worth answering. With an intelligentaudience this does not work so well, but then he is not after an intelligentaudience. With the rest—the vast majority, the pseudo-intellectualsparticularly—the trick works like magic. He convinces them and wins them to hispoint of view by a snappy crack and a superior shrug at the right time.Individualism, of course, and everything connected with it, is the great butt ofhis cracks. Everything heroic is dismissed with a: “My dear fellow, this isutter, childish rot. Very pretty, but one must grow up, you know.” He goes in abig way for the “scientific spirit” and uses all the latest scientific terms,all the phony, complicated “isms,” coining a few of his own, when necessary. Hispet convenience is vague generalizations, the terms devoid of all concretereality, the kind that take volumes to interpret and that can be used nicely tomuddle up an issue, while giving the appearance of great scientific precision.The inferiority complex thus created in the audience, which is not so gliblyfamiliar with the terms, is also a great help in making converts and winning hispoint.“Above all, let us be modern” is his pet slogan—with “modernity” given his owninterpretation. With the help of his erudition, it is easy to point out that thewhole process of history has been leading in his direction, has been but aprelude to the “modern” ideas which he represents and which are, as he canprove, the goal, culmination and apotheosis of all human progress. There is alsothe little trick of astounding and confusing his opponents with his stunts ofmemory: he can quote, without a second’s hesitation, the date of any battle inancient Greece, of the birth and death of any pharaoh of Egypt or anyparliamentary leader of England, along with the date, number of workers andfinancial damage in dollars and cents of any strike. If his opponent doesn’tknow as much—who, ladies and gentlemen of the audience, is obviously the moreeducated man and obviously in the right?Naturally, his sympathies are always to the Left. But he does not assume thepose or appearance of a soap-box proletarian. He is friendly to them, butfaintly superior. After all, as he likes to refer to himself, he is “a gentlemanand a scholar.” He may defend the lower classes, but his consuming vanity willnever let him appear as one of them in a society where they are still recognizedas the lower classes. As long as things are as they are, he will preserve allthe outward symbols of superiority as it is commonly understood around him, and,above all, he will be accepted as a superior in his social intercourse. Hence,his immaculate appearance, his exquisite grooming, not too foppish, onlyslightly so, not too startling, only quietly, conservatively elegant. He likesto think of his “conservative good taste,” where personal appearance isconcerned. The same applies to his voice and to his style of writing—smooth,elegant, well-rounded, just spiced with his exquisite sarcasm.His manner with people is quiet, so polite, very faintly effeminate—and“brilliant.” He is a “brilliant” conversationalist and storyteller. He is anaddition to any party and a favorite with hostesses, particularly intellectualones. He is never offensive; if he wishes to insult someone with his sarcasm—itis done so exquisitely that the insulted one seems offensive. His manner isfriendly in a cool, impersonal, slightly patronizing way. He is never emotionaland has never lost his perfect poise. If, sometimes, he chooses to make hisvoice tremble with intense feeling, it is done artistically, like a gentleman,and one gets the impression of great emotion hidden under a perfectself-control, which creates in his listeners admiration and a conviction of hisutter sincerity. His pose is eternal and immutable; it is the same in a drawingroom, on a lecture platform, in a bathroom or during sexual intercourse : cool,self-possessed, faintly patronizing.He loves to address an audience—the larger, the better—and never misses a chanceto do so. Is perfectly at home on the speaker’s platform. He loves and devourspublicity—the “dignified” kind, but does not talk about this. (“My dear, I neverread my clippings—haven’t the faintest idea what they say about me.” He knowsevery word of every clipping by heart.)He has an attractive, colorful style, with a great deal of merit in form, if notin content, which makes him easy to read or to hear. Wins great popular successthrough this. He is adept at coining phrases, epigrams and “mots justes”; heloves to know that he is quoted.When talking beautifully of the proletariat, he never visualizes himself as oneof them. He is the superior benefactor, the teacher and leader, the benevolentfather of his flock. [He views himself as] “a shepherd,” along with theconception of others as sheep. Spiritually, he is very much the condensation ofthe worst features of a pedagogue. He started life as a teacher; he is now acollege professor of esthetics, with art and architecture as specialty. Theexperience of molding the lives and destinies of young pupils gave the impetusto his absorbing desire to mold the lives and destinies of all men. On the side,as a pet hobby, he is a vocational advisor. He thinks of himself and demands tobe considered as the final authority on every subject. He is pettily impatientand intolerant of opposition, of any refusal to take his word as the finalproof.Extremely fastidious in his clothes and his living room, although his bedroomand study are inclined to be somewhat dusty and sloppy. His daily routine istimed to the second and unbroken. He cannot be interrupted during his writing,even if it be a long distance phone call from his dying mother. His meals areeaten on time and his calories scientifically counted, his food rations beingweighed on apothecaries’ scales. His daily cold shower is timed with a stopwatch. The room where he receives visitors is exquisitely simple and modern, itsfew ornaments consisting of rare and precious art objects and old editions. Heis a connoisseur of wines and never orders less than the best, which he cannotafford often. (“What’s not good enough for Morgan is not good enough for me.”)He proclaims the supremacy and “rhythm” of toil, but his hardest physicalexertion is to brush his teeth. (“After all, mental labor is the hardestlabor.”)The “friend of humanity” has no friends. A great many admirers and fans,particularly women-fans who write him passionate letters after every lecture orradio-broadcast. But no real “pals.” His cold pose forbids it. He does not feelany lack from it. Loving all humanity as he does, he has never loved a singlehuman being. When approached for help or money, he refuses, but makes the personwho asked feel guilty and cruel at having imposed on his better feelings. “Mydear, I am refusing for your own good. Believe me, it is harder for me than itis for you. But it is against my principles. It will destroy your feeling ofself-reliance.” Intent on saving mankind, he has never helped a man. He does notdo favors. When he stuffs choice positions with his protégés, it is done for hisown sake and for the sake of his principles, never for the protégé. He prideshimself on the epi thets : “impartial,” “fair,” “objective” and “incorruptible.”The question of sex is a touchy one to him. Here, as in everything else, hecraves superiority. He is no great power as a male and he is very conscious thathis sexual organs are rather inadequate. He makes up for it by the mostexquisite and varied perversions. (“My dear, we must be modern.”) Has a greatcollection of the most unusual aphrodisiacs (all the “happy boxes” and thensome). Loves to think of himself as a great lover and as irresistible to women.(“For the life of me, I don’t see what attracts women to my unprepossessingself, God knows I’m no Apollo, and you’d never think that intellectual appealcounts in sex, would you?”) He has had mistresses—more than one at a time—butnever a love affair. Visits whorehouses when necessary. Is very fastidious abouthis mistresses—they must be, above all, beautiful and feminine. Doesn’t go forintellectual women. His mistresses are seldom the pick of the chorus, but a goodsecond best. He will not be seen with an unattractive woman. Makes a point ofthis. (He will have nothing but the best.)Is naturally liberal in his sexual views, contending that the family is abourgeois institution, but does not go for the subject of sex much. Too physicaland consequently unimportant. After all, he is concerned with the purelyintellectual aspects of life.Although raised with religion and having undergone a mild attack of religioushysteria in his adolescence, he is now an agnostic, rather prone to frown onreligion. After all, religion is a sort of individual refuge and as such it isdangerous. His insatiable lust for spiritual power would rather focus allemotion on the earthly collective, because the earthly collective—“c‘est moi.”He is not a member of the Communist Party, because that Party is stillconsidered lower class. (“Besides, I am a man of science, not a politician.”) Heis not an open supporter of Soviet Russia. (“After all, I am an impartialobserver.”) But his sympathies are with both—fervently, but always“objectively.”He is a man so completely poisoned spiritually, that his puny physicalappearance seems to be a walking testimonial to the spiritual pus filling hisblood vessels. 1937 [After writing her character description of Toohey, AR attended two lectures bya prominent British socialist, Harold Laski (1893-1950). During an interview in1961, she recalled:Laski was the soul of Ellsworth Toohey in the flesh. After seeing Laski, I justhad to remember how he lectured—his mannerisms, the pseudo-intellectualsnideness, the whole manner of speaking on important subjects with inappropriatesarcasm as his only weapon, acting as if he were a charming scholar in a drawingroom, but you could sense the bared teeth behind the smile, you could feelsomething evil—and I would know how Toohey would act in any circumstance; itgave me the complete sense of life of that type. Toohey is larger scale thanLaski, who was a cheap little snide socialist, but Laski projected Toohey’sessential characteristics . Even his appearance was ideal. I drew a sketchduring the lecture, with the narrow cadaverous face and glasses and big ears,and I gave it all to Toohey.The following notes are from the second of the Laski lectures.]Extremely well-dressed women (not too young, typically around forty and over)with a vapid and aggressive look—hatred of [the intellect] and insistentlytrying to acquire it. Only one I saw to be fairly attractive. A good type: awoman nearing fifty, medium height, slender, very well groomed; long, narrowface, mainly nose, pleasantly smiling, upturned lips (smiling too easily, withsuch a set, rehearsed, partly patronizing pleasantness), no eyes—all you see isthe yellow-white lids and you have the uncomfortable feeling that the face hasno focus and no opening, a face with no person behind it; a beige coat of smoothbrown fur, a Russian-looking, fancy hat of the same cloth and fur; and—mostprominent, the first thing you notice—glasses with a heavy black ribbon hangingostentatiously from the corner of her eye.Also a great many shabby, old-maid-librarian types of middle-aged women, mostunbecomingly dressed; the first thing jumping off from them, hitting you in theface, is the fact that you simply cannot imagine a man [making love to] them.Also—aggressive house-wife types, with old-fashioned hats and dirty-lookingcomplexions.Also—a great many homely young girls, poorly dressed, of all degrees ofhomeliness, amazing variations of it, all of them with flat shoes and veryunkempt, uncombed hair. A sad look of defensive aggressiveness, unconvincingassurance, and that awful feeling of “we’re miscarriages physically, but we’remaking up for it intellectually.”Most of the audience are women. Few men comparatively and these better lookingthan the women, more prosperous, less freaky. Most of the men seem a littlesheepish, quite a few seeming like good Babbitts dragged here by theirwives—just as they are dragged to the play of their wives’ choice.Single most unpleasant characterization of this audience—the mouths. There ismore meekness and insincerity in the mouth than in any other part of the face.Is that the most expressive and most betraying organ?Above all impressions—the horrible [spectacle] of intellectual vulgarity. Acrowd of this same mental caliber going to a dance hall or saloon is much moreattractive, honest and bearable than this phony search for intel lectuality. Apretense of brains should not be allowed to anyone except those who have brains.What horrible, horrible things can be done with the mind, through, with and forhalf-brains! How much better no brain is than half a brain!A woman with horrible piano legs sitting right in the front row on the stage,facing the audience, with a short skirt, her legs crossed and lisle stockings !Well-dressed and flaunting the stockings; also diamonds on her fingers quite[prominently] displayed.It’s the aggressive, imperious expressions that are awful—on these people whoare supposed to stand for equality, freedom, kindness, justice, etc. Isn’t thatsignificant? Think of the implications, beyond the obvious ones.Here comes Toohey [i.e., Laski]:He starts with explanations and “advice.” The audience laughs before any pointis made.“The great world”—“The grim reality”—always using important words sarcastically.“A sovereign state is an anachronism”—“When the pound sterling falls, the heartof the secretary of the U.S. Treasury beats faster.”Wears glasses. Long neck, sloping shoulders, too narrow chin, wide temples,large ears.“The white man’s burden has been borne by the black.”“It would be possible to show—if it weren’t impolite to show ...”The audience laughs every time he says “simple-minded.”He looks terribly at ease, a little weary, a little bored—not offensively so,just gracefully so. (He leans limply sidewise against the stand.)Simplicity and clarity of sentences—yet a few “exquisite” words.“A stick to beat Mr. Chambers with—and let me say the bigger the stick the morehonorable the purpose—” (Note the “witty” asides.)“The limits of euphemism are infinite.”“The poor, the lame, the halt ...”“The government—whose discomfort at public discussion I can wholly understand—”(The gals on the stage are yawning—the one with the lisle stockings, too.)“It’s pure accident, it just happened that way”—[in regard to] something hequite definitely means was not an accident.“I made up my mind twenty-five years ago to be a rank-and-file [member] of theLabour Party.” March 15, 1937An agency for writers has on its office wall a huge photograph of a mob (withmob faces) and the big letters: “Don’t forget whom you’re writing for.”(! ) March 27, 1937A typical instance of the rising power of the masses—the open arrogance ofinferiors who no longer try to imitate their superiors, but boldly flaunt theirinferiority, their [mediocrity], their “popular appeal.” A state of affairswhere quality is no longer of any importance, and where it is coming to beshunned, avoided, even despised. The paradox of the dregs of humanity actuallyfeeling contempt for their betters, because they are better. Quantity aloneconsidered important—quality no longer even considered. The masses triumphant.Example of this: the head of a “charm school,” a contemptible racket, havingbeen attacked by a “high brow” magazine, states haughtily: “Why should I worry?In all the years they’ve been in existence, they have only a hundred thousandcirculation. I have a million customers in a year!”March 28, 1937More about Toohey.He is vociferously rational while doing his best to deny reason. Basically, heis all for the heart above the mind, emotion above thought. [Superficially], heis strictly scientific, rational, materialistic, with only a few lapses intotalk about the “soul.” His trick is the same as that of Christian Science. Herealizes subconsciously that reason is the enemy of all “heart hokum” and of allspiritual rackets. Consequently, he destroys it by appearing to support it. Hedefends reason loudly, but [substitutes] for reason his own preposterous brandof pseudo-science. He betrays himself occasionally by his talk about the “purein heart,” the “universal spirit” and other such mystic-Christian-communisticcatch-words."},{"pageContent":"5RCHITECTURAL RESEARCHBefore Ayn Rand could work out the plot of The Fountainhead and begin writing,she needed to know more about the profession of architecture. She asked the NewYork Public Library to recommend a list of books for her research. She read mostof them in 1937, making extensive notes in her journal.More than half of her notes are presented in this chapter. I have includednearly all of the notes in which she comments on her reading, or relates thematerial to The Fountainhead.I have omitted many quotes that she copied with little or no comment. I havealso omitted passages in which she simply paraphrased factual material, withoutevaluation. For instance, AR made lengthy notes on Skyscrapers and the Men WhoBuild Them by W. A. Starrett concerning such topics as: the methods and problemsof constructing large buildings; the division of responsibility amongarchitects, engineers, and contractors; the time required to design, contract,and build skyscrapers; the financing of large buildings and the types ofbuilding contracts; the typical problems that arise with contractors and laborunions. Also omitted here are some notes on the training of architects, takenfrom The ABC of Architecture by Matlock Price, and notes on building codes andzoning laws in New York.AR found aspects of The Fountainhead’s theme and characters everywhere in theactual profession of architecture. Ellsworth Toohey’s manner of combiningarchitectural criticism with collectivist propaganda was taken in part from thewritings of Lewis Mumford and Bruno Tout. She identified the second-handednessof Peter Keating in the work and writings of architect Thomas Hastings. As todeeper issues, she even recognized the central importance of the concept “unit”while considering the planned design of cities versus individual buildings.These notes are a record of AR’s unique philosophic perspective on architecture.March 13, 1936[AR made the following notes on two great innovators in modern architecture:Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. Louis Sullivan (1856- 1924) is widelyregarded as the father of modern architecture and particularly of theskyscraper. He seems to have served as the concrete inspiration for thecharacter of Henry Cameron. Frank Lloyd Wright (1869-1959) is famous for hisstrikingly original designs, done in a style he referred to as “organicarchitecture.” In his basic architectural principles and in his fight for modernarchitecture against tradition, Wright served as a model for Howard Roark.]LOUIS SULLIVANFight against eclecticism and classicism for an original, creative style.Ousted by inability to conform to the prevailing mode, the majority.Started as draftsman. Then—partner. Then—independent.Incident of church “corrected” by cheap architect. Neglect of civilities. Lackof commissions. Smaller firms appreciated him more than large ones.Lack of social ability to get jobs. Arrogance with customers. Refusal to complywith their tastes.FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT[AR made the following notes on Wright’s autobiography.]Apprenticeship in architects’ offices. Originality and insubordination.Resented by his fellow-beginners. Resentment against his originality,independence, lack of “social” qualities, and boss’ favor, as well as obvioustalent. Slander, ridicule, interference with work. Attempts to get him out.Incident with [Daniel H.] Burnham. Attempt to bribe [Wright] into submission toprevailing styles and commercial success—on the very basis of the originality ofhis talent.Opening his own office—big wish.“American Institute of Architects,” The A.I.A. (Check up on this and on allarchitectural associations and publications.)Compromise on a house for money’s sake. Subsequent shame at hearing the housepraised.First building praised, admired—and ridiculed. Requests for more houses like the“compromise” and his attempts to talk clients out of it.Office taken with another architect—but not as partners.Incident with Cecil [Corwin]—who quit because of envy for Wright’s superiortalent.Speeches at clubs. Editorial comments. Antagonism of professionals.Ridicule—and yet notice and inept copying, distorting of his ideas.Gradual growth and development of his own individual style.His principles in house building: simplicity, elimination of unnecessary detailsand trimmings; real fireplaces, flat roofs, abundance of windows, light,spaciousness. Elimination of different materials in favor of one. Flat, parallelplanes. Straight, geometrical lines. “Organic” architecture. Antagonism to andridicule of these houses. Calling them “heresy.” Misunderstanding and confusionof his work with established eclectic styles.Interior—spaciousness. Eliminating unnecessary walls and doors—“boxes withinboxes.”“Plasticity”—building as a harmonious whole.Engineers could not help with this structural continuity. Emphasis on the natureand individual qualities of building materials. New materials: steel, glass,concrete.Reactions of public to these new buildings: Bankers refused to finance them.Mill men refused to work for them. Contractors misunderstood the plans. Some ofthem went broke. The worst type of contractor appeared on the scene. Interiordecorators refused to work for owners—because architect had to okay everything.Refused steadily to enter a competition. [He held that] the world has gained nobuilding worth having by a competition because:1. The jury is necessarily a hand-picked average. Some “constituency” must agreeupon the “jury.”2. Therefore the first thing this average jury does is go through all thedesigns and throw out the best ones and the worst ones. This is necessary inorder that the average may average upon something average.3. Therefore any architectural competition will be an average upon an average inbehalf of the average.4. The net result is a building that is well behind the times before it isbuilt.Every architect entering a competition does so to win a prize. So he aims atwhat he conceives to be the common prejudices and predilections of the “jury.”Invariably, the man who does this most accurately wins the competition.Committee decisions, too, are seldom above mediocre unless the committee is“run” by some strong individual.One such individual gave the commission for the Unity Temple to Wright.[Wright:] “Why not, then, build a temple, not to God in that way—moresentimental than sense—but build a temple to man, appropriate to his uses as ameeting place, in which to study man himself for his God’s sake?”All artistic creation has a philosophy. The first condition of creation.Hard work on coordinating minor features with the whole. (This coordination ofdetails to the whole—isn’t that the same as plot construction in accordance withyour theme?)Interiors expressed in exteriors—“the living motif of the architecture.”Hardest of an architect’s trials: to show his work, first time, to anyone notentirely competent, perhaps unsympathetic....At this moment the creative architect is distinctly at a disadvantage ascompared with his obsequious brother of the “styles.” His brother can show hispattern-book of “styles,” speak glibly of St. Marks at Venice and of CapellaPalatine, impress the no less craven clients by a brave show of eruditeauthorities—abash them.But the architect with the ideal of an organic architecture at stake can talkonly principle and sense. His only appeal must be made to the independentthought and judgment of his client. The client, too, must know how to think fromgenerals to particulars. How rare it is to go into court where that quality ofmind is on the bench! This architect has learned to dread personalidiosyncrasy—offered him three times out of five as substitute for suchintelligence.Fight to persuade the committee. One dumbbell with stupid criticisms,objections, and doubts is always present and dissenting.Contractors bid after the plans are approved. Most of them refuse—because it istoo new, too much of a risk. Those that do bid charge twice too much. No onereally wants it. A contractor is needed to “rescue ideas, to participate increation.”Congratulations after the Temple opened.[Wright] does not believe in ancient traditional church building—becausetraditional religion itself is dead. (This is important for architecture as areflection of the architect’s philosophy.)He gets a commission because the clients saw in his houses “the countenances ofprinciple.”Lack of general response to his work after a period of intensive labor, day andnight.Architect calls in sculptors and artists. Architect—the master of them all. Hesometimes slept “on a pile of shavings” right at the construction works.A female model posing for sculptors right in a shanty on the building site.Unions interfering and stopping construction on frequent occasions, on sillypretexts.Cheap additions, such as a glowing electric sign, that ruin the architect’sidea. [...][Wright:] “Equivocal conduct hurts ten times more those who practice it thanthose it is practiced upon.”The “eternal triangle”—architect, owner, contractor. Owner often takescontractor’s side against the architect.Owner decides to build and make changes without consulting architect.Usually it is necessary to defeat the contractor’s advice to the client.He had no real organization. “My office is me.”“I don’t know why houses have so much grief concealed in them, if they try to beanything at all and try to live as themselves. But they do. Like people in thisI suppose.”“The greater the idea, the greater the banker animosity.”Owner choosing contractor and insisting on him.The architect has to defend the construction of his building continually.“Where creative effort is involved there are no trivial circumstances. The mosttrivial of them may ruin the whole issue. Eternal vigilance is the onlycondition of creation in architecture.”Sullivan—ruined by provincial prejudice against his personal habits. “A genius?That term damned him as it was intended to.”The rarest and most fortunate occurrence in any architect’s life: opportunity,ideal site, and a man who understands.Dangers of construction: building settling because of too great a weight.Foreign exhibit of photographs, drawings, models. Lectures. Dinners given inarchitect’s honor.Remark about the worthlessness of courthouse in Milwaukee. Storm in the press.Furious enmity. Even attempts at arrest on trumped-up charge. But big lectureand enthusiastic audience nevertheless.Speaks at Architect’s dinner in New York. Alone and against the majority ofspeakers. Obvious resentment of others.[Wright] gets his houses accepted by convincing the client that he (thearchitect) is right, by explaining the truth clearly.Other architects try to make Wright out as “difficult,” because he does not“stay in line with them,” even though he has had no troubles with his clients.Work came to him, instead of his going out after work. He “stayed in line” withhis principles, not with salesmanship.“Eclectics haven’t much artist-conscience and what little they have is guilty.”His ideals: The importance of interior space expressed in the exterior, “inside”and “outside” as one. The use of glass to this end. Open buildings as contrastto the “caves” of ancient architecture. “Freedom” substituted for “fear.” Steelconstruction and “plasticity” unknown to ancient architecture. A variety of newmaterials—each to determine the style of the building it is used on. “Organic”ornament to express the meaning of the whole, not merely for looks and trimmingeffects.No more buildings of one material to imitate another (such as: steel made tolook like masonry, etc.).Buildings, just as airplanes, steamships and automobiles, should look like whatthey are, be what they are. February 23, 1937Lewis Mumford, Sticks and Stones.Rather strained attempts to connect architecture with sociology, particularly inexplaining the prevalence of certain styles at certain times by economicconditions, à la Marx. (The classic style in America because of its “imperial”atmosphere is in keeping with the “imperial” mood of the rising capitalists.)Good for Toohey. February 27, 1937Arthur Woltersdorf, Living Architecture.The smugness, stodginess, dull commonplaceness of officially recognizedarchitectural authorities, as exemplified in most essays of this book. The onlyexception—the only architect with something definite and fresh to say—is a pupilof Frank Lloyd Wright and not a member of the American Institute of Architects,as are most of the others. Characteristic of officialdom when it tries to “gomodern”: staleness, a reluctant repetition of the truths proclaimed by the realmodem [architects], which are too obvious to be disclaimed and are thereforeembraced half-heartedly, mechanically, without conviction, consistency or fire,evidencing an amazing ability to make even a new truth sound like a bromide; atthe same time, obviously no desire to accept this modernism as a whole, astruggling and pulling to compromise, to incorporate the old traditions with thenew or to explain the old lamely with new formulas borrowed from modernism. Amagnificent display of reluctance to say anything positive, important,fundamental or vigorous. A great deal of talk about meaningless details, are-chewing of trivialities, with all great fundamental principles ignored, withno real faith to proclaim, only a great show of cheap erudition andpseudo-importance in detailed knowledge of many nothings.A great emphasis on “public spirit,” on duty to the community, on being only“servants and expressors of national spirit, general spirit, mood of the people,trend of the times,” etc.Typical quotation: “The problem is to know the past and still be free to speakin a language that will hold the man in the street, so that he will think andtalk about architecture as his wife does about her favorite movie star.”Incidental question: a librarian writing about library building insists thatlibraries must be made to look as accessible to the public as possible—to “bringthe library nearer to the people.” “Spacious and inviting entrances are placedat grade level, close to the public thoroughfare, with as few steps as possiblebetween the pedestrian and the building.” This may be quite sound in relation tolibrary architecture, but the question it raises, in a more general sense, isthis: is it advisable to spread out all the conveniences of culture beforepeople to whom a few steps up a stair to a library is a sufficient deterrentfrom reading? Hasn’t that something to do with the attitude behind generaleducation for those better left illiterate?The advocates of “housing projects” rave about a hideous example of a huge blockof buildings all alike, with a series of windows like those in a jail, whereyour feeling of an individually owned house (“my home is my castle”) is reducedto owning three dots of windows out of a myriad of identical bee-hive cells.(This is to be advocated by Toohey—just right for him.)Another typical quotation—regarding the expression of “true American”architecture:In experience and expression each individual will contribute some factor commonto all. The sum total of these common experiences and modes of expression is thecommon denominator, the factor which dominates the race or the community; whichdistinguishes it and individualizes it. The development and enrichment of thisfactor is not imitation but worthy progression. [...]Climate, Geography, Race, Nationalism must impress and inspire the architect inthis desired, if not at once forthcoming, expression. The architect cannot standalone by himself ignoring the workings of these four great influencing factors,stand alone and endeavor merely to express himself, and achieve an art whichshall be so generally and widely expressive of fundamentals as to last andbecome a permanent influence, as permanent and as lasting in effect as thesocial organism of which he is part. If he is apart from, rather than a part of,the social order neither the artist nor his words will persist.(Great for Toohey!)Isn’t the exact opposite true of Frank Lloyd Wright? Doesn’t the genius and thenew always come as opposite to the “spirit of the community” and have to fightlike hell against it? I grant that the genius will not be known and will notinfluence the general culture unless he is fairly widely recognized. Isn’t itthen a question of forcing that recognition on the community (through therecognition of a few leaders), rather than a question of the genius “expressing”his community—whatever that is? If a genius passes unnoticed, the loss ishumanity‘s, more than his. There must have been many great innovators that neverinfluenced culture because they were not recognized in time. So much the worsefor culture. Culture is not the supreme arbiter, always right by the mere factthat it took a certain turn and not another. It is largely chance, the result ofthe eternal fight between man and masses. And if we judge men in their own timeand reality, which is all that counts to men, let them be judged by theirintrinsic value, not by their relation to a vague accident called “culture.” Awork of art is great by what it is, not by how many cheap imitations it hascreated in its assimilation into a “cultural” movement. (“The vermin of thecultured that feasts on the sweat of every hero”—Friedrich Nietzsche.)Probably sensing something of the above, [Woltersdorf] says a little later:Now the artist, especially the architect, not only should reflect the tendenciesand right movements of the age (who’s to determine the “right movements?” AR)—heshould direct them. He should even inaugurate them. He sometimes does; but hiswork is ineffectual until the society which he is trying to interpret to itselfrises to a plane of right consciousness and recognizes itself and its desires inthe ideal which the artist is seeking to advance.(More for Toohey.)When will this sort of pap stop? What precisely does society recognize and whatare its desires—in the sentence above? This kind of vague metaphysical hooey isat the bottom of all “social-consciousness” theorizing. Why assign profundityand ideals where there are none? Why not say honestly that an architect mustlead and make the society “rise to a plane of right consciousness,” withoutflattering the mob monster by making it, in some vapid, non-descript way, theinspiration and master of its leader?This book is a good example of what happens to the ideas of geniuses when“adopted” by lesser [men], of how dead, devitalized, dull, common and flat agreat idea can become in average, official, “communal” hands.029 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_029_r1.jpg]Darcy Braddell, How to Look at Buildings.Somewhat similar psychological type to the preceding book, in the sense of adesperate struggling for the old along with reluctant concessions to the new.But a type of mentality and attitude that is less vicious and pompous than thepreceding. A mild, esthetic mind trying, at least, to be fair. Not fightingvigorously against modernism and giving it its due, when unavoidable. The[concessions to modernism are] done with obvious reluctance and in terms of theold, applying old standards and appearing to justify it on the basis of the old,while actually trying to justify the old by the principles of the new. Frequentrecurrence of such statements as: “Even the modernists can’t escapewell-established fundamentals of architecture, which they have to share with theclassics,” etc. No viewpoint at all. A thoroughly polite and Milquetoastishsitting on the fence. Plus a yes-man complex, prone to admire indiscriminatelyevery established authority. (Such as the author’s silly admiration for[Christopher] Wren’s towers, and his weak excuses for their ugliness, his evengoing so far as to call them “original architecture.”)Not the type to violently oppose a new movement, but certainly not one toencourage or approve it, and certainly not until it is well established; then,perhaps, a little approval, grudgingly, without enthusiasm, in a dull,devitalized manner, strictly formalistic and superficial, not recognizing allthe fundamental principles, but carping on details, just as one does about theold eclectic architecture, making a new sort of super-eclecticism, a mixture ofeclecticism and modernity.This is not Toohey’s type, but a good source for Toohey, a good type for theminor, work-a-day “art critic,” a mass of which makes a good background forToohey and leaves the field open to him.Typical quotation:One thing is quite certain, nobody is ever going to make a simpler (in the truemeaning of the word) column cap and base than are already provided by theClassic Orders! Yet it is equally certain that their use is being discarded moreand more every day because they are not modern. What, then, is going to taketheir place? The “flight from the orders” argues a flight from a culture we haveall been brought up to revere. For the orders are not a worn-out decorativemotif, but part of the language of architecture. They represent orderedexpressions of thought.Also typical is his assertion that modern architecture is merely “dress-making,”only dressing a structural skeleton, but having nothing to do with realstructure. This is how much he understands about modern architecture—which,above all, is structural, as compared to the “dress-making” of Renaissance andsubsequent architecture. [...]Characteristic of this type is a total lack of basic principle or conviction.Vagueness. A great many contradictions. Details and petty measurements forcriticism, instead of a complete, unified system of thought. March 2, 1937C. H. Whitaker, Rameses to Rockefeller.In reference to Louis Sullivan: when the Journal of the American Institute ofArchitects published Sullivan’s Autobiography of an Idea, many people demandedthat the Board of Directors stop its publication. The members of the Boardrefused “even though some of them were a little fearful.” (This was in 1924.)About Sullivan:Your country has passed you by. That was what had happened, and I knew, as youread, what the passing by had meant and how you had been hurt. It was plain thenthat you had been crucified and lacerated, because you challenged the humbug ofthe art you loved. In every word that you read, I could feel the weight of thetragedy. But, like the voice of the captain rising above the wreckage, I couldalso feel the exaltation within you that no tragedy could crush. You had seen!You had beheld! You had known the rightness that has forever belonged tocraftsmen. You had heard and accepted the everlasting challenge! Ah, that was awonderful evening, Louis, and I never told you how I felt about it. I guessedthat you guessed that I knew. You must have known.March 12, 1937Same book.Real pearls of wisdom for Toohey: It is so easy to give credit for the Parthenon to the men whose names have comedown to us by the historical method—Pericles, Callicrates, Ictinus, and Phidias,whom Plato called “a wise stone-cutter”—and so easy to forget, by the same verydefective historical method, the long procession of building craftsmen who, yearby year, played with their changing ideas of form and proportion as succeedingvariations passed the ultimate test by which like and dislike were determined.Had it not been for this great unsung host of stone-carvers and stone hewers,there could have been no Parthenon. It did not spring from any single mind. Itwas not born of any single concept. Rather was it the fruit of a slowly ripeningexperience over a century of trial and error. Year after year the buildersstudied the result of their labor, looked at it, lived with it, and noted whatpleased them and what did not....Thus the historical method of giving credit for a building to some particularperson seems ungenerous. No building ever had a single author. One cannot pointto a single feature of building, anywhere, and say that it first appeared inthis building, or that. The whole historical method, in so far as it applies tocredit and authorship, rests only on the concept of society as a struggle forindividual glory and reward. It completely denies ... the endless procession ofworkers and thinkers, each making his humble contribution. Could anything be sweeter and clearer? March 28, 1937Same book. As a slogan for Toohey’s idea of architecture: As a beginning—for the builders who shall at last set to work for a society thatis resolved to build a civilization—what could be a better mark to aim at thanfor everyone a fine and spacious room, sun-lighted or sun-shaded, as one mightchoose! Fine degree of selective freedom!This is the best book for all the lying, evasions, and sophistries of Marxism asapplied to architecture. Toohey’s exact psychology at work. Always the attemptto give credit to the masses. In Greek architecture—by pulling facts in by theears, as in the quotation above [i.e., the March 12 entry]. In Gothic—greatpraise, because it is the anonymous architecture of collective workers. Blamingall the faults of the post-Renaissance architecture on the rise of theindividual architect. Phony examples of exploitation as expressed in buildings,such as this explanation of the Parthenon columns: “[T]he temple was meant toadvertise certain ideas that would inspire respect and make people pray and goto war without too much murmuring....”A dishonest, disgraceful, stinking book.030 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_030_r1.jpg]Claude Bragdon, Architecture and Democracy.An idiotic, unimportant book. The only thing of interest is the author’scombination of communistic leanings and great talk about the “Long Denied” witha silly mysticism that denies reason completely and puts the “heart” above the“brain.” Typical process of subconscious adjustment to purpose.Use this. Show the process, particularly obvious in the Catholic Church and inCommunism, through which all convictions, even on points [that appear to be] farfrom the main issue, are subconsciously, in individuals, and deliberately, inideologies, constructed in such a way as to support the main issue somewhere, inits consequences or in its hidden roots. The “style” of ideologies.A good example of sheer drivel, of putting one’s point across where it does notbelong, is Bragdon’s interpretation of Sullivan’s Prudential building:One feels that here democracy has at last found utterance in beauty; theAmerican spirit speaks, the spirit of the Long Denied. This huge, rectangularbulk is uncompromisingly practical and utilitarian; these rows on rows ofwindows, regularly spaced and all of the same size, suggest the equality andmonotony of obscure, laborious lives; the upspringing shafts of the verticalpiers stand for their hopes and aspirations, and the unobtrusive delicateornament which covers the whole with a garment of fresh beauty is like the verytexture of their dreams.This is the way Toohey criticizes buildings.A sample of collectivist-mystic balderdash: “Now materialism is the verynegation of democracy, which is a government by demos, the over-soul....”Glorification of the masses as against genius:But in every field of aesthetic endeavor appears here and there a man or a womanwith unclouded vision, who is able to see in the flounderings of untrainedamateurs the stirrings of demos from its age-long sleep. These, often forsakingpaths more profitable, lend their skilled assistance, not seeking to impose theancient outworn forms upon the Newness, but by a transfusion of consciousnesspermitting it to create forms of its own....His (the architect’s) problem, in other words, is not to interpret democracy interms of existing idioms, be they classic or romantic, but to experiencedemocracy in his heart and let it create and determine its new forms throughhim. It is not for him to impose, it is for him to be imposed upon.If he is at a loss to know where to go and what to do in order to be played uponby these great forces let him direct his attention to the army and the armycamps. Here the spirit of democracy is already incarnate. (!!!)A great truth, not at all in the way the author intended! June 4, 1937Alfred C. Bossom, Building to the Skies.The author praises the pseudo-classic architects of the Chicago World’s Fair of1893. He shows his eclecticism, praising the “modern” skyscraper, [while he is]devoid of true architectural convictions, of all inner fire orintegrity—“anything goes with the fashion of the moment.” In the list of greatAmerican architects of the early skyscrapers—not a word about Sullivan. (Norabout Frank Lloyd Wright.) Yet the author exhibits a plate of a junky buildingthat got first prize in 1921. Typical instance of accommodating mediocrity.He praises women’s interest in the architecture of the home. (That’s the reasonfor the monstrosities we have!) Some architects will not work for a womanclient, regardless of the fee. (Good for them!)Relatively simple regulations for American architects as compared to England.(Check on this.)According to the author, an American architect has to be a walking bureau ofbusiness information. He has to advise the client as to what type of building toerect on a certain site or even choose the site; what the prospects of theneighborhood are, how large a building it can sustain and make it pay, etc. (Hehas to consult the American Telephone Company that always knows all prospects.)Every skyscraper-building office has one or two employees, technical advisers onthis point. Author refused to build a bigger building than the locationwarranted; he felt his reputation would be hurt if he were associated with abeautiful building which turned out to be a commercial failure. (??) (Check upon this by all means. Is this the general attitude ? Where does the creativeinstinct come in on this?)Investors sometimes ask an architect to select a site and tell them what tobuild on it.Working practice of the author: after the site and the type of building isapproved, he “settles all the fundamental problems of the new building himself,”then turns the problem over to his designers who compete for the actual designof the building. (!) (Check up on this! Is it the usual practice? Is thebusinessman really the boss who hogs the credit, while the creative designer isonly a minor employee? Is it usual or is it just a typical instance ofsecond-hand practice? Good for John Eric Snyte.)Even the smallest firm building skyscrapers employs 20 to 25 draftsmen. A largerfirm would have 60 on its permanent staff and double this number during a rush.The head architect travels a great deal on inspections. (Spends ten nights amonth in a sleeping car.) A regular [payroll] of about $15,000 a week. Permanentoverhead—$250,000 a year.Preliminary drawings for a small (million-dollar) building take about twomonths. Every tiny detail is included. Separate sets made for the main sectionsof the job. In all, there are hundreds of them.From the moment he starts on his drawings, the architect is in constant touchwith structural engineers, contractors, manufacturers and suppliers ofmaterials, and the heads of thirty-two trades that will work under him. Freeexchange of opinions and information. Cooperative spirit. Open publicity abouteverything on job. Drawings and specifications posted in building, so that everyworker can read them. Contractors bid for the job. The winner, in turn, opensthe bidding for sub-contractors.A “cost-plus” contract allows the contractor the cost of the building plus afixed fee for himself (this is apart from the architect’s commission); anythingthe contractor saves is split between himself and the owner. This helps to savein buying materials, as the contractor is most experienced and acquainted withthe market.Typical and valuable instance of mob-spirit:[Raymond Hood is] an architect of the modem type who preaches and practicescooperation. He has no use for the architect who “shuts himself up in his officeto make a design and then sends it out to a contractor to build or to anengineer to fit up with the plumbing, heating and steel as best he can.” Nor hashe any use for the architect who “goes up to a Communion on Mount Sinai andhands the results to the owner, the engineers and the public.” In his view, asin my own, the best designs, at any rate for the building of skyscrapers, comefrom “a group of minds in which the architect is one link in the chain.”So speaks the mob. The results—the “Daily News Building” [designed by Hood] and[Bossom‘s] buildings—speak for themselves: they are the ugliest, flattest, mostconventional, meaningless, unimaginative and uninspiring buildings in the book.This type of architect works “by conference,” in which all parties concernedtake part, discuss his drawings, make suggestions, etc. (A Hollywood storyconference.) The result is a collective creation—“an average on an average.”(This method and these convictions, absolving the architect of all creativeresponsibility, are good for Peter Keating. Check up on just how much conferringand cooperation is done by an architect such as Frank Lloyd Wright.)Good touch: workers who steal rides on trains and get tools out of a pawnshop insome town where the architect is working—in order to work again under him. [...]031 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_031_r1.jpg]The author talks a great deal about daring, courage and leaving the way free fornew inventions. Yet—he is an eclectic artistically. His “newness” applies onlyto the technical, scientific side of new methods and materials, not to newesthetic ideas. No daring, courage or novelty in his architectural designs. Notalk at all in the book of the artistic problem of skyscrapers. No estheticconvictions.But a great deal of talk about cooperation. Let’s get together. The skyscrapercannot be the product of one man. It is all collective. A great many attacks on“separatism.” [He is] a second-rater and second-hander, following populartrends, praising engineering and Greek orders in skyscrapers with equal ease,naturally anxious for everyone to share ideas, in order to pick up what he canpick up. (Beware of those too eager for sharing—in wealth or in ideas; they’rethe ones who know that they’ll get more than they’ll give in such a pool. Thosewith much to give do not talk of sharing—they do not need it.)This author is just right for Peter Keating.032 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_032_r1.jpg]An important side-idea to bring out [regarding] the building of a skyscraper: Ifled by a strong personality, superior in knowledge and talent to the others,representing the complete authority and final judgment in all matters, with apyramid of ranks under him, widening toward the bottom—the perfect organizationwith the proper spirit of cooperation and discipline results, and the createdbuilding is a magnificent monument. If cooperation means equality, witheveryone’s voice as good as the next fellow’s and all the fingers in the pie—aneclectic mess results. (Check up on how, through what exact steps and means,these two methods work in practice.) June 10, 1937Matlock Price, The ABC of Architecture.The best architectural training is to be had in the Architectural Department ofone of the large Universities, or in a Technical School.“In the University it is possible to begin architectural training in the firstyear and carry it on, with other and more general studies, through the fouryears of college.” After this, it is very desirable to take from two to fouryears post-graduate work, specializing entirely in architecture. (Check up onall this.)The author also states that many architects consider a year or two of Europeantravel as the best preparation. (Rubbish!)University program:First year: history of architecture, drawing, “thorough training in the ClassicOrders,” simple problems of architectural design, freehand drawing, a generalfine arts course.Second year: making “measured drawings,” courses in perspective, shades andshadows, simple building construction, more advanced design problems.The next two years—the same subjects carried still further in more advancedproblems.At the same time courses in higher mathematics.Post-graduate work—design problems as advanced as the actual profession ofarchitecture itself.He may, at this stage, compete for a Traveling Scholarship which will pay hisexpenses for a year or two of special study in Europe, usually at the AmericanAcademy in Rome.If the student intends to become the designer of important public buildings, heshould spend a few years at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. (More rubbish!)Because of their belief in the value of the Beaux Arts training, a group of NewYork architects who originally studied there, founded the “Society of Beaux ArtsArchitects” with a working studio, or atelier, where any ambitious architecturalstudent may come and work on problems similar to those of the French Beaux ArtsSchool, under the direction of the Beaux Arts architects themselves, whogenerously give their time to this work. And every year a “Paris Prize” isawarded, which sends its winner, with all expenses paid, to spend a year in theEcole des Beaux Arts in Paris.(Look into this. Sounds perfectly anti-Roark. Try to meet one of them. Whatprompts such a business?)The step from draftsman to architect is seldom an easy one. In a small firm adraftsman may be taken into partnership, if his work is valuable; more likely ifhe can bring with him a “job”—“if through social connections he can develop aclient.” With money, he can buy himself into a partnership.In large offices, where it is more difficult, he may do work in his spare time,working at night or on holidays, if through some personal means he can get abuilding to design.Sometimes, if two fellow draftsmen can get work of their own to do, they give uptheir jobs and set themselves up as architects. If they have no money they mustbe very economical. [They may set up] a small office, two drafting tables,bought second-hand, and do all their own work. While working on their first“job,” they must do all they can to find another to follow up with.“Sometimes one plucky fellow alone makes the jump from draftsman to architect injust this way.”033 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_033_r1.jpg]About this particular book: a commonplace, plodding little author, well-meaning,but completely conventional. To wit: the advice about the Beaux Arts School.Equal notice for classical revivals and Frank Lloyd Wright. “Anything goes.”Scholarly and without convictions about it all. Naively funny descriptions ofall the jumbled eclectic adaptions of architectural styles in America. Suchsentences as “the best French chateau in America,” etc. After listing theEnglish, French, Dutch, Spanish and Italian buildings in this country, he addsquite seriously: “The Floridians have been even more adventuresome inarchitecture, achieving surprisingly successful adaptations of North Africanarchitecture, in stucco houses that are extraordinarily suggestive, in theiressentials, of the houses of Tunis or Algiers.” (!)Note: The peculiar preoccupation of architects such as this author and theprevious one with “proportions,” “moldings,” “scholarly faithfulness to Classicexamples,” etc. Worrying about every little thing, except the main one—thecomposition and its meaning as a whole. Isn’t it like the people who worrygreatly about fine points of “style” and grammar in literature, without caringwhat the writing is about? Again, the “how” against the “what.” (Yet, the “what”determines everything else, just as the end determines the means, not viceversa. I do not intend that the end should justify lousy means, either. The“how” should always be worthy of the “what,” but determined by it.) July 12, 1937Le Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture.He claims that the most beautiful forms are the simplest geometrical forms, theeasiest to see. (Danger of over-simplification of modem architecture here.) Thushe considers Classic, Egyptian, Roman and some Renaissance architecture good,but Gothic bad, or at least not pure architecture. (Lack of the true principleof Frank Lloyd Wright here.)Architecture is the first manifestation of man creating his own universe. [...]There is one profession and one only, namely architecture, in which progress isnot considered necessary, where laziness is enthroned, and in which thereference is always to yesterday....He claims that the terrible houses of today destroy the family, by beingunlivable. Advises modem houses to save family life.He claims that we must establish definite standards for architecture, in orderto elaborate these into perfection. (Danger of a new standardization and new setof rules for all architects to follow—just as in the following of old styles.)Elementary satisfactions—decoration. Higher satisfactions—mathematics. TheParthenon and the automobile—both products of selection. We must not assert with too much conviction that the masses give rise to theirman. A man is an exceptional phenomenon occurring at long intervals, perhaps bychance, perhaps in accordance with the pulsation of a cosmography not yetunderstood. [...]Art is this pure creation of the spirit which shows us, at certain heights, thesummit of the creation to which man is capable of attaining. And man isconscious of great happiness when he feels that he is creating.Advocates planned towns. (What will Roark say about that? Give it some thought.)Interesting book, but too much emphasis on mass-production houses. Beautifultheories—but in practice, in the illustrations of the man’s work, too muchstandardization, too much reliance on the principle of “the beauty of moderntools,” not enough of that superior architectural beauty which the authorhimself advocates.034 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_034_r1.jpg]David Gray, Thomas Hastings, Architect.The most disgusting book that I have read to date. The perfect picture ofeverything that stands against Roark. To be used plenty, for Peter Keating andall the others, particularly for John Eric Snyte. The perfect set-up of what hasmade modem architecture impossible. The perfect crystallization of theconventional architect, at the head of the profession, the kind responsible forArchitectural Societies and all that prevents real creative genius and fightsnot to give it a chance. Smug, arrogant in a vulgar way, vain, self-contented,bitter and nasty toward all who are not like them, attacking genius with aphony, angry contempt, but without reasons or explanations, attacking only withugly adjectives and curses, but never mentioning any valid grounds. [They]theorize in empty talk, seeming to accept all the best teachings of modemarchitecture and then distorting them by their own petty, silly, preposteroussophistries.Only actual quotations can do justice to the picture of such an architect asHastings:The man and the artist seemed inexplicably detached one from the other. So tospeak, one never met them both at the same time; and meeting the one gave littleclue to the nature of the other.As artist he was single-purposed, concentrated, intense, withdrawn into himself,obeying the mystic guidance of his genius with an almost ruthless energy anddevotion. As a man in his human relations his qualities were those of a lovablechild, generous, affectionate, sunny-natured. It was his good fortune never tohave grown up in a worldly sense. He believed in everybody, was disposed to likeeverybody, was troubled by no spiritual questionings. He found the world thebest of all possible worlds, and that, though he had worked his way through itfrom bottom to top by his own talent and industry. In this he was truly anamazing example of the preserving grace of simplicity and love.Sic!!! Such damning twaddle is presented in the book in the spirit of the greatestcompliment. It speaks for itself—for the man and also for those who admired him.Hastings had a “salon” that gathered for a “business man’s lunch.” “Charming”informality, “humor” and “quaintness.” Just a nice, big show to yell to theworld: “See what lovely, regular fellows we are!” A description of Hastings’entrance into one of these gatherings:She stopped him with the observation that he never had had an idea except tobuild his clients a fire house if they ordered a dog kennel. It was theirhabitual play together and Hastings went on with his part, sputteringprotestingly, calling on someone to protect him. As he peered, blinking throughhis pince-nez and recognized first one friend then another, he gave exclamationsof delight and went the rounds with his greetings, pouring out affectionateextravagances, wringing hands, holding Miss Marbury’s and begging her to elopewith him.Lovely? Just a good back-slapper that knew damn well how to get along with hisfellow men. It must also be noted that the struggle “from bottom to top”mentioned in the previous quotation was in reality from the security of anestablished family to his first jobs through the pull and protection of hisfamily’s friends.Some more about the lunches:Hastings in this milieu was like a boy out of school: gay, irresponsible,affectionate, charming. His old friends all called him “Tommy” and chaffed himincessantly. It was characteristic of the relation between him and those whowere fond of him, and he enjoyed it. At each new and affectionate insult hewould rock with laughter and mock indignation.It is characteristic all right.Hastings entertaining a guest at lunch:It was characteristic of him to make much of the stranger and put him at hisease. First he produced a wire puzzle—he was habitually buying such things fromstreet vendors—and challenged her to take off a ring which was apparentlyirremovable. When she had given it up, he held the thing below the table with anair of mystery and triumphantly produced it in two pieces. Then he told her hisstory of the father who asked his advice as to whether his son should embracearchitecture or dentistry. At this Dunne observed that if Hastings’ father hadconsulted a good architect, Tommy might now have been a good dentist.Shaking with laughter, Hastings went on to explain to [his female guest] that nodentist could have the anxieties of an architect; that when he was a beginner hewas always afraid that his houses were going to fall down but now when he sawthem again he was afraid that they weren’t.Such wit!Contrast this—if the mere rapprochement of the two in one thought is not toomuch of a sacrilege—with the chastity of a Howard Roark. [...]No early signs of his [aptitude for] architecture, except a “talent fordrawing.” At seventeen, he gave up his preparation for college and entered theoffices of a firm of furniture makers and interior decorators, as student anddraftsman. His first solo assignments were rooms to redecorate. He attended a“Sketch Club,” heard talk of the Paris Ecole des Beaux Arts and decided to gothere. Went to Paris at age twenty. He was “affectionate, social, fun-loving,and boyishly exuberant.... Though very young he appeared to escape thosesentimental and passionate predilections which blind the mind to work of equalmerit but of a different kind.” He liked everything. No ideas of his own, nopositive taste, no artistic, creative convictions. The above quotation is alsogiven in the book as a compliment.He studied at the Ecole for four years. Returning to America, at age 24, heentered the office of McKim, Meade and White as a draftsman. Here he met John M.Carrere, another Ecole man, and their friendship led to the forming of apartnership a year later. Hastings did the designing and Carrere handled thebusiness side. His first big commission, which warranted his going into businessfor himself, was for a hotel in Florida, given to him by a friend andparishioner of his father. He built the hotel in the Spanish Renaissance style.Hastings’ opinions:At any given point in this historic evolution he saw the architect building inthe manner which his own period had devised rather than selecting styles fromthe past. Architecture, therefore, had ever been modem and of its own time.Fine, but here is the conclusion:He maintained that as far as modem architecture could have a name and recognizedstyle, it must be Renaissance; for our life and civilization were stillmotivated by the forces which brought about the Renaissance. Therefore, themodem architect must be logically a Renaissance architect and such he conceivedhimself to be.Best example of sophistry I’ve ever heard. [Ralston Holcombe expresses this viewin the novel.]In 1897 (at the age of 37) he won the competition for the construction of theNew York Public Library. He wanted to make it more monumental than the originalutilitarian plan.The measure of this determination and tenacity is the fact that he wrung upwardsof nine million [dollars] from a not overwilling city government, instead of twoand one half million.... Its Renaissance elevation was to him equally logicaland essentially modern. As he saw it, the aesthetic treatment lay inevitably inthose principles of design and ornament developed since the revival of learningand the arts.... How the self-styled modernist who condemns this work asacademic, who denies the heritage of the past and exalts originality abovebeauty, would have conceived an appropriate monumental repository for theprinted record of man’s intellectual achievement is an interesting thoughperhaps not important speculation.Here speaks arrogant mediocrity. Note the constant attacks on originality bothfrom Hastings and from his enthusiastic admirer, the author of this book. Suchlittle phrases as “exalting originality above beauty.” Nothing is ever saidabout originality that is beauty. [...]During the years of work on the Library, Hastings had more than two hundredother commissions. He specialized in “monumental” works. Built a great deal forFairs and Expositions. The most important of his works in this period was theNew Theater in New York. He also won this in a competition. (Remember what FrankLloyd Wright said about competitions! This is the best supporting evidence.)“As he matured and gained authority, the teacher and evangelist in him becamemore evident.” He went to great lengths in preaching his architectural ideas. Healso went heavily for “public service.” In 1910 President Taft appointed him oneof the original members of the National Commission of Fine Arts. “This body wasto exercise a general supervision of the National Government’s activities in thefield of aesthetics and in particular of the architectural development of theNational Capital.” (A fine example of what happens when National Governments goin for art.) In this capacity, Hastings had a great deal to do with the buildingof Washington, D.C. [...]“He regarded architects who ignored tradition as uneducated, which was usuallytrue, or as actuated by a frivolous and vain desire to be original at any cost.”(Mediocrity going snobbish and on the defensive.) Speaking of a Renaissancearchitect, he said: “It would have been impossible for him actually to definethe style of his own period. That is for us, his successors, to do.” (Fineconsciousness in creation!) An architect, he goes on to explain, [should] studythe best that he can find in the past and use it to solve his modem problems.(Very creative!)Hastings at fifty:In 1922 he was awarded the King’s Medal by the Royal Institute of BritishArchitects, bestowed hitherto upon but two Americans, Richard Hunt and CharlesMcKim. He was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects, President of theSociety of Beaux Arts Architects, member of the Architectural League of New Yorkand of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He had served seven years as amember of the National Fine Arts Commission. France had awarded him the Legionof Honor. He was continually consulted by the municipal authorities of New Yorkin regard to its architectural projects and executed various public commissions.Here is the complete picture of society and collectivism at work. Who gavemedals and titles to Louis Sullivan or Frank Lloyd Wright? All this was going onin the same years when Sullivan was dying of a broken heart because his countrywould not recognize him, not even give work to him. If this doesn’t damnsociety, what can? [...]Hastings’ views:How near can we come to determining what is modem architecture, or what is theproper style of architecture for our time? Surely it should not be thedeplorable creation of the would-be style-inventor, or that of the illogicalarchitect, living in one age and choosing a style from another.The important and indisputable fact is not generally realized that fromprehistoric times until now each age has built in only one style ofarchitecture. In each successive style there has always been the distinctivespirit of the contemporaneous life from which its roots drew nourishment. But inour time, contrary to all historic precedent there is a confusing variety ofstyles. Why should we not have one characteristic style, expressing the spiritof our own life? Has the world of art always been in the wrong until today? Doesour actual work warrant the conceit of the assumption that we know more about itthan has ever been known at any time or by all artists for the last threethousand years? History and the law of development alike demand that we build aswe live.(Note the awful borrowing of modern ideas, only to lead up to such conclusionsas he makes.)He further claims that architecture always follows the political, religious,economic and other cultural developments of history, i.e., it follows the“spirit of the age.” And then:Therefore, before we can in any way indicate what style properly belongs to ourtime, we must first realize our historic position and the distinctivecharacteristics of our civilization. What determining change have we had in thespirit and methods of life since the revival of learning and the Reformation tojustify us in abandoning the Renaissance, or in reviving medieval art,Romanesque, Gothic, Byzantine, or any other style?(What indeed? This passage beats them all!)Out of these necessities of the times the Renaissance style was evolved, andaround no other style have been accumulated such vast stores of knowledge andexperience, under the lead of the great masters of Europe. Therefore, whateverwe now build, whether church or dwelling, the law of historic developmentrequires that it be Renaissance.All branches of art have contributed to the embellishment of this style; noother is so thoroughly expressive of the artistic feeling of the age in which welive....We should study and develop the Renaissance and adapt it in our modem conditionsand wants, so that future generations can see that it has truly interpreted ourlife. We can interest those who come after us only as we thus accept our truehistoric position and develop what has come to us. Without this we shall be onlycopyists or be making poor adaptations of what never was really ours.(What a mental hodge-podge!)And here comes the best of all: since the most practical solution is always themost beautiful, the gentleman claims that we should not concern ourselves withthe practical. Just make it beautiful and it will hold. No need of mathematicalcalculations: if a pier is beautiful it will automatically be strong enough.Calculations are needed only for verification. (What are you going to do with amind like that?)I believe in such calculations for purposes of verification, but in general thepiers will be about as safe to build upon when studied by an educated architectas when calculated by engineers.... It is really architecture andwell-proportioned masonry versus engineering and iron girders. Each has its use,but they are not interchangeable. Buildings have stood for centuries without aknowledge of modem engineering, solely because their plans were so well studied,so thoroughly artistic and beautiful, that constructive difficulties wereavoided....He is at his most vicious when attacking the skyscraper on every point possible:esthetic, moral, interference with the value of the neighbor’s property,depriving neighbors of light and air, traffic congestion, etc. Everything butthe boll weevil. “There is no hope for any continuity of lines and simpleregularity in domestic or privately owned buildings, which in any great cityordinarily form a beautiful background of a much needed monotony for itsoutstanding monuments, all of which together form the physical make-up of agreat municipality.” (It must be remembered here that he specialized inmonuments.) With all the viciousness of the little man aroused, he runs to Mammaand demands laws against skyscrapers. He was a member of a two-man committeesent to Albany for that purpose. He demands taxation of skyscraper property, ifhe cannot get direct laws against them. He yelps that he is fighting not foresthetics, but for “justice.” Justice to the little fellow, the small propertyowner, etc. Here is the anger of a mass-man, who has had his way too long and isfurious when a new development, truly original and modem, triumphs in spite ofhim, and he cannot stop it no matter what he does. When the phony prestige builton cheap imitation and fraudulent loud talk about high art does not work anylonger, he reverts to the one recourse of his type—the mass, i.e., the State.“There should be a law against it”—the cry of all cornered collectivists.Incidentally, he holds the cities of Europe as the ideal and would like to seeNew York resemble them, with all their old-fashioned restrictions on freebuilding. [...]With badly hidden resentment, he writes of originality in a contemptuous,skeptical way, evading the real question [by turning to] side-issues:Originality is only a natural and spontaneous effort to solve the practicalconditions imposed upon an architect, and it is generally a good test of themerit of his design when it looks as though it has been done before, howeverdifferent it may be from everything else.... When we consider originality, howoften do we give credit where it really belongs? This is a fair question, notonly in architecture, but in everything else, and yet, after all, whatdifference does it make?He goes on to say that it is often impossible to determine who originated acertain thing or idea. Is this the point? Isn’t it a guilty conscience speakingand rationalizing itself?He attacks the critics. Demands that only professional architects be allowed tocriticize architecture in writing. (And of course he and his pals will see to itthat no architect can practice unless he is one of their kind.)He attacks the engineers. “One danger in bridge-building is the engineer. In twocases out of three an engineer is employed. He sees the quantitative side ratherthan the qualitative point of view; he is apt to disregard the beauty ofdesign.” (Top of presumption.) Incidentally, if the practical is alwaysbeautiful, as he claims, why is it that the engineers do not achieve beauty? Ordoes this work only one way, his way, and not the other?To sum it all up, I must not forget the words of the book’s author in hispreface: “The circumstance that, alone of the notable practicing architects ofhis generation, Hastings formulated in writing his philosophy of art, hisideals, convictions, and critical comment would seem to warrant the assumptionof this responsibility (to publish the book).” This was written after Sullivanhad published his Autobiography of an Idea and Frank Lloyd Wright had publishedhis Autobiography. ! ! !If I take this book and Wright’s autobiography, there is practically the entirestory of “Second-Hand Lives.” November 22, 1937[AR obtained a job with Ely Jacques Kahn, a prominent New York architect, forthe purpose of learning about the daily activities of the profession. She workedin his office for six months as a filing clerk, typist, and general assistant.Later, she remarked about Kahn: “As a type, he was Guy Francon. He was so muchthe socially acceptable architect. He was abler than Francon, and he wasmodern—within careful limits. But his career was strictly dominated by Franconmethods. And he had that manner—very elegant and charming. ”]NOTES TAKEN IN OFFICE.Frank Lloyd Wright used to advise his lady clients to wear gowns cut in linesand made of materials to harmonize with the houses he had created for them.(Interesting, even if slightly silly.)Hugh Ferris: “The nature of the architectural forms and spaces which peoplehabitually experience are potent factors in determining the nature of theiractions, their emotions and their thoughts.” (I think he’s a phony, but this maybe an interesting thought, if not carried too far into preposterousness.)Swell touch of advance propaganda where it doesn’t belong: Lewis Mumford in TheNew Republic, July 6, 1927, criticizes the defects of a building by blaming themon the expensiveness of the site.It is as if even the great powers of industry and finance were not capable ofcontrolling the forces by which they have sprung into being, as if they, too,must submit to the system which they nominally dominate.Also—the building is “cold and hard”—a perfect symbol of modem business to Mr.Mumford. (!?!) (For Toohey.)I find it (the building) more interesting because of its finely humanizedinterior than because of its stupendous bulk against the skyline of the city.People, as well as cultures, have definite leitmotifs. Toohey’s can be seen veryreadily here. Follow up its manifestations as it consistently, even ifsubconsciously, asserts itself. Roark’s theme will be quite different. Animportant part of the book and the whole idea is this subconscious theme-song inthe psychology of men. This base and all the practical results. There are onlytwo fundamental bases: Roark’s and Toohey’s. Show them at work.035 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_035_r1.jpg]Some unknown architect writing a “review” on the Squibb building declares flatlythat “the building would have been better with color.” Then, praising the whitebrick, he wishes for a law to make all New York buildings of white brick—“withcolored trimmings.” (Just pass a law to have all buildings done as he likesthem! A sample of the “there-oughta-be-a-law” psychology.)036 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_036_r1.jpg]There has been an influx of socialites into the architectural profession.Careers are made solely on family connections. Important work is not given toarchitects of established fame and great achievement (generally recognized,practical achievement, not even an “arty” fame) because they “do not belong tothe 400.” It would be only natural for these people to be eclectics and todefend eclecticism as “culture”—because they have nothing else to offer.037 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_037_r1.jpg]The “society-playboy-architect” [Kenneth Murchison] who has never builtanything, but is quite famous. Writes articles and makes great caustic fun ofknown architects. Specializes in staging the “Beaux-Arts” ball for theBeaux-Arts Society of Architects. (The dirtier and sexier the ball—the morefunds for the educational work of the society. Great society!) [Murchison wasthe model for Athelstan Beasely in the novel.] November 28, 1937The following is from Modern Concepts Concerning an Organic Architecture fromthe Work of Frank Lloyd Wright (a proclamation sent by Wright to Kahn andautographed):Individuality realized is the supreme attainment of the human soul, themaster-master’s work of art. Individuality is sacred. Let us dedicate thisrepublic to multiply and elevate that quality in all art and architecture in allmen in all life.From the first issue of Frank Lloyd Wright’s magazine Taliesin (which perishedafter the first issue from a lack of subscribers):We are all possessive and we are all egoistic. Ingloriously so, the presentimpasse can show. But neither “possessive” nor “egoistic” need be inglorious.There is probably no suitable economic system not founded upon human egoism.There is probably no great society where individual possession is not somethingto be respected and encouraged.Nor is there a society worth considering where individuality is not thedesirable cultural product of human life....[Wright’s description] of organic architecture: “I got the sense of architectureas a reality no longer consisting in walls but inherent in the space within thewalls to be lived in.”His amendment of Sullivan’s formula: “Form follows function by way of the natureof materials.”He objects to making “good architecture” a matter of “good taste.” (Interestingpoint. Not a matter of taste, but of incontrovertible principle—or do Iunderstand it right? It should be so, and for all art, but what really is to bethe principle, concretely and definitely and in a “legally” clear definition?)From the article “Matter” by [Wright] in same issue: his enthusiasm for naturalmaterials as potential weapons to use for his own creation. “And then I wishboth mill and gravel heaps endlessly subject to my will.” (There is a Roarkemotion.)Gold and silver, lead and copper, tawny iron ore—all lying in drift to yieldthemselves up to roaring furnaces and to flow obedient to the hand of the mastermind: all to become pawns to human will in the part human imagination plays inthe human game we call civilization.... Wood, stone, pottery, glass, pigments,and aggregates, metals, gems cast into the industrious maw of mills, kilns ormachines all to be worked to the architect’s desire by human skill in labor. Allthis to his hand as the pencil in that hand makes marks that dispose of all ashe dreams and as he wills. December 3, 1937From “Selling Architectural Services Today” by Rion Bercovici, in Architecture,April, 1933:In order to sell his services today, the architect must be able to talk tobusiness men in their language. He must present his case from the angle of hisability to do work that will sell—merchandise, services, floor space, andanything that is housed. The architect cannot just be a merchant of even themost expert architectural and building counsel: he must be a merchant ofauxiliaries to salesmanship in one form or another. To do this successfully hemust adjust himself to the rhythm of the times.(What horrors and crimes aren’t always being excused by this great buck-passingto the “rhythm” or “spirit” of the times?)Kahn’s insistence on the “crafts”—too much. It is not part of architecture. Hebelieves that: “There is a potential and currently neglected field forarchitects in industrial designing of fabrics, metals, and so forth.” I’m notsure, but it seems to me that such a “field” would, to Frank Lloyd Wright, bewhat writing for Hollywood is to a writer.Such advice to architects as telling a store how they can sell more groceries bychanging their lighting. (Practical, perhaps, but is it architecture orwindow-dressing?)038 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_038_r1.jpg]A 1932 conference between four big architectural organizations discusses plansfor training architects and admitting them to practice. A suggestion is madethat the organizations themselves make the rules about admission of a youngarchitect to practice. (Sic!—this is the organization to which Frank LloydWright does not belong!)One of the guys there expresses the hope that they should make “A.I.A.membership synonymous with qualifications for practice.” (! ! !)Kahn explains that this was done to unify the license requirements in variousstates. Most states have examinations for licenses. When an architect has beenin practice for 15 years, he can take an examination for a National License,which allows him to practice all over the U.S.A. Kahn’s experience with thisexamination: the examining board was composed of “eminent” professors ofarchitecture who had never put up a building.The meeting of architectural organizations planned to pattern the licensing ofarchitects on that of the Medical profession. (But medicine is not a creativeart. Architecture is. Even at that, the American Medical Association has donemuch harm along with the good, such as the accusation often heard, possiblytrue, of keeping important discoveries off the market in order not to losevaluable practice. Wouldn’t the same happen to architecture ? And how safe isthe distinction between purely educational tests and esthetic tests for theadmittance to practice? What if this becomes an artistic dictatorship? (Checkup.) December 5, 1937Let us decide once and for all what is a unit and what is to be only a part ofthe unit, subordinated to it. A building is a unit—all else in it, such assculpture, murals, ornaments, are parts of the unit and to be subordinated tothe will of the architect, as creator of the unit. No talk here of “the freedomof craftsmen” for sculptors and the like.Also—man is a unit, not society. So that man cannot be considered as only asubordinate part to be ruled by and to fit into the ensemble of society.(I really believe that a building is a unit, not a city, so that city planningshould not control all buildings. Because a house can be the product of one man,but a city cannot. And nothing collective can have the unity and integrity of a“unit.”)Much of the confusion in “collectivism” and “individualism” could be cleared upif men [knew] what constitutes a unit, what is to be regarded as such. As to the rules about this—my job of the future.[AR completed this “job of the future” in Introduction to ObjectivistEpistemology. ]039 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_039_r1.jpg]From: The Life- Work of Frank Lloyd Wright.Wright’s principles of architecture (from his “In the Cause of Architecture,”1908): “Simplicity and Repose are qualities that measure the true value of anywork of art.” A building should have as few rooms as possible, taking account ofits needs. Openings should be integral features of the structure, and ifpossible its ornamentation. Eliminate unnecessary details and ornaments. Avoidappliances or fixtures. Avoid too many pictures on walls. Most or all thefurniture should be built in as a part of the whole scheme. “There should be asmany kinds (styles) of houses as there are kinds (styles) of people and as manydifferentiations as there are different individuals.” “A building should appearto grow easily from its site....” Follow the color schemes of nature. “Bring outthe nature of materials, always let their nature intimately into your scheme.”“Buildings like people should be quiet, sincere, true and then withal asgracious and lovable as may be. Above all, integrity.”At the beginning of his career, Wright found exceptions to the prevalenteclecticism “chiefly among American men of business with unspoiled instincts anduntainted ideals. A man of this type usually has the faculty of judging forhimself.”At the beginning he had great trouble with everyone: workers, mills, financiersand all. Millmen in Chicago refused to work on a drawing bearing Wright’ssignature; contractors even cut [the name] out, but millmen recognized the workand refused to “hunt for trouble.” (Incidentally, how about this forstandardization? How can one get the “right” standardization? What protection isthere within it for new ideas?)He fought against the cheap imitators of his work, who copied his forms withoutunderstanding his principle, who made a new “style” and formula out of hisforms.040 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_040_r1.jpg]Lewis Mumford [claims that] architects in America either pursue empty eclecticstyles, or turn into engineers, consider utility only, devoid of art.Wright differs from other modernists in that he wants to humanize the machine,make it serve artistic and human purposes, while the others want to make themachine and machine-principles dominant, eliminating all ornament entirely, allbeauty and art, beyond the barest utility.Mumford, with what seems to be the typical near-sightedness of a “pinkish”critic, has the presumption to ascribe Wright’s lack of recognition in Americato his being “regional”; Wright’s buildings, according to Mumford, are suitedonly to prairie country, but not to all of the U.S. This is as much as Mr.Mumford can see. He goes so far as to say that Wright’s buildings are “notcompletely successful.” The problem of a new architecture will require, heclaims, “the work of a hundred Wrights.”Typical: one critic in the book praises Wright highly, but claims that he is“personal,” not “universal.” Another one praises him particularly for being“universal.” (Doesn’t it all seem like a lot of rot? What is universal? Is theresuch a thing? Isn’t it merely something individual copied by a great manypeople? As such, does it acquire any added value? Should there be any suchconception as “universal” at all?)Note how the “pinks” in art circles stuck to Wright like leeches, how they triedto use his fame and influence to their own ends, misinterpreting him entirely,ascribing to him their own pet sociological implications which he never intendedor meant in a quite different way.For instance, from Pieter Oud [a prominent Dutch architect]:That which Wright desired, viz., an architecture based on the needs and thepossibilities of our own time, satisfying its requirements of general economicfeasibility, universal social attainableness, in general of social-aestheticnecessity, and resulting in compactness, austerity and exactness of form, insimplicity and regularity; that which he desired, but from which he continuallyescaped on the wings of his great visionary faculty, was tried in more actualconsistency in cubism.(Near enough, but how far! If I understand him, this is not at all what Wrightpreached and wanted and meant.)H. H. Sullivan says that two great ideas confront each other in the world: theidea of tyranny, appealing to man’s fear, and the idea of freedom, appealing toman’s courage. [He says] we now have mental slavery, even though physicalslavery is gone. But the idea of freedom is awakening, freedom of eachindividual’s own expression. (All this is fine, but what is this freedom and whothreatens it? I wouldn’t call it democracy, as Sullivan always called it. Didn’the really mean individualism?)Sullivan is opposed to all abstract philosophy (Platonism, Neo-Platonism, GermanTranscendentalism) as sterilizing life. (Wonder if he means what I would mean bythis?) December 6, 1937Raymond Hood states that “architecture is the business of manufacturing adequateshelter for human activities” and asserts that this conception imposes only onerestriction: “That the product must be adequately practical as a shelter forhuman activities.”Hood is a second-hander trying to be strictly “modem” in his terminology—whichhe stole from Le Corbusier, incidentally. Did he come to this “principle”himself? Did he fight for it? Or didn’t he just appropriate it when the battlehad been won by others, by the suffering of others, and then parade it as hisown great wisdom and gain prestige as a “foremost architect” thereby?041 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_041_r1.jpg]John Cushman Fistere, “Poets in Steel,” Vanity Fair, December, 1931.Here’s Toohey in full colors. Listing America’s ten greatest architects, hestarts off by being sarcastic about people naming Frank Lloyd Wright as first.Nevertheless there are many who believe that Mr. Wright is more genius thanarchitect, and who justify their opinion by pointing to his characteristicidiosyncrasies, and to the still more significant fact that he has designedcomparatively few buildings to support his manifold theories. Even his mostzealous disciples have difficulty in listing his actual achievements: the Larkinfactory, “that hotel in Japan,” and the glass and steel apartment house for NewYork that has never been built. As an architectural theorist, Mr. Wright has nosuperior; but as an architect he has little to contribute for comparison.May I be forgiven for copying this! This is Toohey par excellence—god damn him!Further from same:Number two on nearly everyone’s list of the ten great skyscraper architectswould be Raymond Hood, seemingly less of a genius than Mr. Wright, but perhapsmore of an architect. Unfortunately for the purposes of promoting him, Hood hasno theories to advocate, is anathema to the intellectuals because he opposed theappointment of Wright to the World’s Fair Architectural Commission, and ishappier sticking to [architecture] than he is in making speeches and givinginterviews. Hood already has three buildings to his credit to support the claimsof his friends that he, and not Wright, is the first architect of the country.(Nice friends, ain’t they?)Hood’s most promising trait is his inconsistency.... “I would never build thesame building twice”—that is the explanation of Hood.(“I would also build anything, because I have nothing to say” can be hisexplanation as well.)042 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_042_r1.jpg]This Hood interests me. I may be wrong, but there’s something sinister about theman. He was broke and ready to give up architecture, when he won the ChicagoTribune competition by going in “partnership” on the design with a prominentarchitect who had been “invited” to participate in the contest. Hood did thedesign, and shared the glory with the other man, who got $40,000 out of the$50,000 award. The building was eclectic, Gothic, and none too good. This wasafter Sullivan, after Wright, when Mr. Hood could have discovered modernism ifhe had wished to listen, let alone “invent” it. But he goes Gothic “becauseembroidery was in vogue.”He prospers on the reputation gained by this contest. He gets big buildings todo. Modem architecture is gaining. The shrewd gentleman realizes it—I imagine hewas a very good businessman. He switches to modernism with a bang—the Daily NewsBuilding. He is successful and sensational. He likes it. It is now safe to besensational. He speedily appropriates the language of the modernists—LeCorbusier, Sullivan and all. He is admired for it. He is “the foremost modernarchitect of America.” He is a prophet—neatly and nicely, with someone else’sprophecy and genius, and with someone else’s struggles and suffering havingpaved the way for his victory.It is now embarrassing to know that the words are stolen. He would like tobelieve himself that he is what he has managed to make himself appear. So hehates the men he has robbed. He fights them. He keeps Wright from the ChicagoFair. He hates Wright for being actually what he, Hood, only appears to be.And—an interesting parallel: Wright refused to participate in the Fair, unlesshe could have complete say over it; Wright did it because he had an idea of whathe wanted done with the Fair and he wished no interference with the idea; he hada truly beautiful and important thing to create. (“Terrible and megalomaniacal,”comments Kahn.) Hood, on the other hand, made no such demand; but, according toKahn, Hood was the ruler of the exposition. And an ugly mess resulted; Mr. Hoodcompromised or was incapable of anything better; he had no idea and nothing tocreate; he merely wanted the honor of bossing other people and being the “ruler”in their eyes, even if he had nothing for which to rule. And, of course, he hadto keep Wright out of it; Wright was the only danger to this kind of phony,second-hand supremacy and the one who could steal the thunder from and thespotlight off Mr. Hood. Isn’t that typical and significant? Isn’t that“second-handedness”? (I think I’ve analyzed it correctly. Check up.)043 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_043_r1.jpg]From the “Symposium on Architecture” at the Decorators’ Club:Kahn mentions that the plans for the Rockefeller Center were originally to beGothic, because of Mr. Rockefeller’s love for the Gothic [style]. Plans had evenbeen drawn in Gothic. But practical necessity, such as windows and lighting, ledto the adoption of a modern design. When I asked him about this personally, Kahnhastily denied that Gothic plans had been drawn. (?) Hood was the guiding handamong the eight or ten architects of Rockefeller Center. (Any wonder he got in?Would Wright draw up Gothic plans and then “talk” Rockefeller out of it? Whereis the great integrity and “modern” convictions of Mr. Hood? And RockefellerCenter is a mess, compared to what it could have been. As to its sculpture—Iwonder if Hood had a hand in the giving out of that commission?)As to the whole meeting: a lot of insufferable drivel. A bunch of wealthy idlersin evening clothes listening smugly to a re-hash of things they could read inany book in ten minutes. Two dotards pattering smugly about Classic and Gothicarchitecture. Kahn—the only one to say a little of something and to say it withconviction. The others—drooling about a “house in Pompeii,” which we are invitedto inspect “from a magic carpet,” and about the long nave of a Gothic cathedralsymbolizing “the long way of a sinner to redemption” (sic!). The well-fed moronslistening contentedly, certain that they are acquiring “culture.” Tickets at$2.20 a head. And Wright could not raise the money to publish his magazine! December 7, 1937Samples of phony architectural language (from Kurt Jonas, in the South AfricanArchitectural Record):Here we find, indeed, a four-dimensional composition of space enclosed bysolids. Especially the north and north-west aspect of the house shows a dynamicbalance of forms, such as it would be hard to surpass. At the same time, it isnot lacking in that interpenetration of spaces which brings out the hollowcharacter, full of fluctuating life, which is the expression of architecture ascompared with sculpture....The sphere of architecture is space. We must define space. But we cannot. Forspace is defined by movement. And movement presupposes time. Therefore we shouldspeak more correctly of spacetime.... Architecture is a four-dimensional art.... [T]his is a contradiction not due to the [average] man’s poor logic, but to thehigher logic, the dialectics of all life and art. To emphasize this I startedthat essay, Towards a Philosophy of Architecture, with the statement: “ModernArchitecture is the realization of a contradiction in itself.”That not all things are so simple as some people believe, that there areinherent contradictions in life and in art, is no fault of mine. It is the taskof the writer to show and to express this dialectic state, not to cover it witha torn fig leaf of simplifying logical construction, all for the sake of amentally lazy layman.Here is a typical one of Toohey: muddle the issue, appear deep by being unclear,down with logic in the name of a “higher logic”; this is the spirit of GertrudeStein and others, again denying superiority by denying reason—the sole danger tomediocrity. Remove reason—and what ground is there for greatness or smallness?Aren’t all equal when the scales have been destroyed? [AR made use of the above“phony language”—see Gordon Prescott’s testimony at the Stoddard trial.]044 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_044_r1.jpg]“Modernist” architects build their own homes in the most conventional,old-fashioned way. The exception—Frank Lloyd Wright.A silly New York Times article (1931) gloats over this, emphasizing that evenso-called “modernists” (such as Hood) do not live in “modernistic boxes,” thattheir homes are as old and eclectic as the homes of the conservative architects;[the article] stresses the fact that the [modernists‘] homes are ancient,reconditioned, part old barns, etc., and goes mushy over ancient cherry-trees,lawns, flowers and birdies and the like. One of the “modernists,” when askedabout his home, got sheepish, then admitted that he didn’t build it for himself,but for a client: his wife, who “didn’t like modernism.” Could Wright have donethis—wife or no wife? Could he stand living in a house he hated? Could any manwith sincere and profound convictions about his art, the art that is his life,live in a house that denies all his ideals? Could I, for the sake of a husbandor for Jesus Christ, read nothing but Kathleen Norris?

December II, 1937Note the difference of approach to their profession between all these successfulNew York architects and Frank Lloyd Wright. He wouldn’t go on a stag trip to the“Alma Mater” in Paris. He wouldn’t go to a ball dressed as his building. This isthe difference between the “common touch” and the ideal, between art as abusiness and art as a religion. The difference in the men is also in theirbuildings. It is this feeling I want for Roark—the burning reverence as againstthe “meal-ticket” architecture.Note also, for Toohey, the measly trick in the Vanity Fair article quotedpreviously, of not coming out with a direct statement of the writer’s ownopinion, but hiding behind such phrases as: “There are many who believe” and“his friends claim.” December 22, 1937A. T. North, “The Passing Show,” Current Architecture, September, 1930.This gentleman criticizes someone for saying that an architect must haveconvictions about his style—“as though the architect must have a styleconviction just like one has a religious conviction.” (Precisely! That’s what hemust have.)We expect our tailors and modistes to produce equally well any selected patternor style of garment, our physician to correctly diagnose and prescribe for allailments, and our attorneys to conduct any manner of litigation—but theexceptioned architect cannot render any and every style equally well because hewould be “so lacking in convictions.” Unfortunately, too many architects make acult of style. Style “conviction” in architecture?—it is amusing.What logic! Here’s mediocrity speaking.Ugliness can be produced only by abnormal persons, the normal persons alwaysdesire beauty.Now what is beauty? Who is to decide? By what rules? December 24, 1937Pictures of the A.I.A. convention: terribly stodgy, pompous, either “Babbitt” or“Social Register” faces of prominent architects. What a figure Howard Roark willbe among them! December 30, 1937In December, 1935, Mayor La Guardia announced a list of fifty architects whowould get all the big municipal work [in New York City].The jurors who selected the fifty architects were Phelps Stokes, Ralph Walker,and Kenneth Murchinson. These last two are architects (I don’t know about thefirst). Murchinson is the life-of-the-party of the architectural profession; hehasn’t built anything to mention—but what power! He is always in the thick ofthings, particularly in “social activities.”The men who selected the jury were all presidents of various architecturalorganizations. Two of these electors were named among the list of fifty. One ofthe two—Upjohn—spoke utter drivel about Gothic architecture at the meeting Iattended. (“The long nave is a symbol of the long road of the sinner toredemption.”) And he was president of the A.I.A.! Such is the power and theglory of organized mediocrity. January 1, 1938Notes on a conversation with Kahn:Plagiarism in architecture: plenty of it. Buildings which are copies of Kahn’sbuildings. Copies of his ornament. Case of client who asked him to build areplica of a certain building, and upon going to see the model, Kahn discoveredit to be a copy of one of his own buildings, which he showed to the client, muchto the latter’s amazement. Case of bank which planned a building; Kahn was askedto submit a sketch, which he did; no further action was taken upon it and Kahnwas informed that the plans had been abandoned ; upon returning from Europe somemonths later, he found his building done and erected, very badly done andunskillfully interpreted from his rough sketch, but still his very building. Thebank had taken his sketch and given it to some friend of theirs to build.Nothing done about this. Kahn did not sue or receive any payment for the sketch.Later, some “arty” book on architecture mentioned this particular building asthe best building of that year, giving credit to the plagiarist-architect.046 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_046_r1.jpg]A draftsman in an architect’s office is usually called “a designer” andtypically does the actual designing of his bosses’ buildings. If a draftsmanrefused to work in the style ordered, he would be fired immediately.047 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_047_r1.jpg]Frank Lloyd Wright, Modern Architecture.The preface to this book mentions instances of Wright’s lack of consistency andlogic, and quotes the following: “When asked to write The Logic of ModernArchitecture, Wright replied: ‘Is the rising sun logical? It is natural and thatis better.’ ” (This is sheer drivel. I am afraid that Wright has some of it oncein a while. When is logic going to be fully explained and vindicated?) From thesame preface: “Whose likes and dislikes are logical? We are now finding thatlogic, as a convention of human thinking, will not confine within its premisesart and life as creative activities.” (Rubbish!)[Wright] calls the A.I.A. the “Arbitrary Institute of Appearances.”048 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_048_r1.jpg]Arthur T. North [editor]: Contemporary American Architects, by E. J. Kahn.The abysmal idiot who wrote the preface [A. T. North] displays quite a differentspirit and approach to architecture than that in the writings of Frank LloydWright. Thus, in praising Kahn’s work, he has nothing of greater significance tosay than the following, which he considers to be important architecturalcriticism:Appraisals of buildings to determine their real contribution to architecturemust include inquiries as to whether they “work”—fulfill their intendedpurpose—and are sound financial projects. In both these respects the buildingsdesigned by Mr. Kahn are successful and at the same time he has complied withall legal and economic requirements.Such inspired writing![North writes] of Kahn: “His democratic manner, interested consideration ofmatters brought to his attention, tolerance for the views and opinions ofothers, and amiable disposition, cause him to be held in friendly regard andrespect.” What a tribute to pay to an architect! This, then, constitutes Mr.North’s idea of a great architect. Certainly, Kahn’s work deserves more seriousconsideration and more valuable comment. Yet, here is Mr. North as editor ofworks on modem architects and as publicist of ideas on architecture. What chancewould Frank Lloyd Wright or Howard Roark have here, [since they] are not“tolerant of the views and opinions of others”?! January 9, 1938Bruno Taut, Modern Architecture.In building, no personal isolation of the individual actually exists. Theprocess of building, by reason of the participation of innumerable artisans andworkmen and the considerable expenditure involved, which again represents labor,is in itself of a collective nature. [...]The test with regard to the collective attitude of mind of the architect is ofparticular value in this case, in that he is bound to hold sternly aloof fromany favorite constructive ideas, particularly dear to his own personal taste.[...]The small individual house, built in accordance with the wishes of an individualman or woman, is possibly still more indicative of the general standard of thedelirium of individualism.... The construction of a dwelling-house not onlyshows that a feeling of ownership is a menace to this quality, but even, so itwould appear, is in a degree opposed to it. For where the owner-builder is themore disposed to waive his possessive rights in favor of something really goodand useful, there will not only disappear the sentimental, romantic delirium,but the houses will come to bear a certain resemblance and suitability, the oneto the other.(What logic!)Should it not be impossible still to speak of taste, after the Stuttgartexhibition of 1927, for instance, proved that sixteen architects (all of whomdiffered greatly one from the other, even apart from the fact that they camefrom five different countries), without concerning themselves about any of thehouses not actually of their own design, were yet able to evolve a suburb of ahighly uniform character? A suburb in which each of them experimented in themost varied directions, proving that it was their common mental attitude whichproduced the unity of effect, thus excluding the question of taste. And yet, inview of the illustrations in this volume, many will assuredly contend: “That maybe all very well thought out, but it does not happen to be my taste.” To whichone can only reply: “Questions of taste are social questions.”(Note: the Stuttgart exhibition is nothing but a collection of trashy, shoe-boxhouses, none of which means anything, consequently all of which can beconsidered to produce an effect of unity, the unity of nothingness.)The coming world is most clearly expressed in its architecture, no matter fromwhat angle it is regarded. Painting and the plastic arts keep within the calm ofthe studio, entangled in their problems regarding artistic form. The heroicattempts of a Picasso to set up a general consistent formula on constructivefoundations are greatly to be appreciated so far as the standard of painting isconcerned; yet his vacillations from Cubism to Classicism, and again from Cubismto Abstractism, must surely be indicative of a certain want of clarity as to howpainting was to be linked on to the social whole. [...]This, then, is Toohey in the flesh speaking. Little can be added to thegentleman’s own words, except to note that he has quite a bit of praise for theawful monstrosities of cast-iron columns used when iron first came into use inarchitecture. He praises Renaissance architecture, when necessary. He has noconception of what Wright’s fight for modern architecture means, nor its spirit,nor its purpose. All he has grasped is the “down with ornament” idea. Which is,of course, nothing but glorifying mediocrity, making architectural creation ofsuch nature that it is open to anyone; anyone can build this senseless, awkward,common junk; genius or intelligence or taste are no longer necessary; tasteparticularly is deliberately denied and mocked. Note the remarks aboutPicasso—an attempt to connect idiotic modem painting to “the social whole,” toset up standards that deny ability, and open art to anyone and everyone. There’sToohey’s little system. January 10, 1938A. T. North, Raymond Hood.[Hood has little] to say about general principles of architecture. The book[focuses mainly on] explanations of details of his buildings, plus somesecond-hand statements on form following function, old re-hash of what has beensaid a million times before, without adding a single new thought. Theillustrations of his buildings show a magnificent absence of individuality.There is no such thing as a spirit or style of his own. Anything goes. Thebuildings could have been done by twelve different men. Appalling lack ofimagination. Plenty of Renaissance and Gothic. Modernism à la Germany. When hetries to depart from precedent in decoration and to create patterns of his own,they are horribly Renaissance, awkward and meaningless. A great deal of stealingfrom Wright and from E. J. Kahn. This is the man claimed by many to be the greatAmerican architect.A glance at his list of “societies” explains it all. Note also that he hasworked always with someone else, hardly ever on his own, and if he did work onhis own, he produced nothing of importance in those times. He has changed agreat many partners. Evidently he didn’t care with whom he worked, or so itappears from the numerous list of collaborators. Whether he was in each case theoriginal designer or not does not matter. I do not trust people with instinctsfor collaboration. January 12, 1938A. T. North, Ralph Adams Cram.A lovely compliment to Cram & Co. from Mr. North:In this (their use of Gothic) they have exerted a steadying influence onAmerican ecclesiastical architecture by retaining always its essential Christiancharacter and spirit. At the same time, they have drawn on other sources withequal success. In their design of collegiate buildings they have drawn on manyarchitectural sources [...] with the same facility and discrimination. In all oftheir work they have applied a serious and scholarly effort that produces anarchitecture which is appropriate to its purpose and in harmony with the besthuman attributes.Observe the art of sounding profound and meaning nothing whatever, such as inthe last sentence. January 17, 1938Architectural League of New York, 1930:All the eclecticism in the world. Modern structures, such as the Empire StateBuilding, and some of the oldest junk. The firm of Voorhees, Gmelin and Walkerhas, in the same issue, a modernistic building (Roerich Museum) and a bankbuilding in New Jersey with Greek pilasters at the entrance. Anything goes withthese architects. There is a home by Delano & Aldrich (society boys) which israther simplified à la modernistic, but with a dome in the center and a Greekportico for an entrance. There is a Sewage Disposal Plant with Greek moldings.It is almost pathetic to see the way in which the architects feel forced tosimplify their facades, yet hang on to the Greek trimmings, porticoes, ordersand such—in a slightly simplified form. (As if these were the only forms ofwhich they felt sure and they cling to them desperately, seeing nothing beyondthem.)The above applies only to commercial buildings. In the field of domesticarchitecture it is still the dark ages. Not one modern building. Not even atouch of modernity on the old monstrosities. The only modern [design] shown is amodel home built or projected by House & Garden. February 15, 1938N. C. Curtis, Architectural Composition.A silly book, musty, naive and old-fashioned, smelling of the XIX century, eventhough it is published in 1935. Written by a professor of architecture. Gives amarvelously clear picture of what the academic mind thinks of architecture andof what it teaches to students. [...]A lot of drivel on the idea of making a plan attractive in itself, not in whatit represents, but in itself, as a picture. This seems hard to believe, even forthe old days. (Check up on this.)Advice to students in learning to make beautiful plans: “Progress will only comethrough practice; by the study of beautiful plans, chiefly through tracingthem.”Throughout the book, a continuous emphasis on the “monumental,” which seems tobe the one type of architecture the author is most interested in—and the onemost useless.Traditional architecture, the great body of the master works of past epochs ofarchitecture, is the store house from which we ought to draw and in most casesto draw all the inspiration that goes to make for the greatness of ourcontemporary designs. The greatest commentators are no uncertain advocates ofthis doctrine. Let us hear what M. Gaudet has to say:“I know that to speak of tradition now passes far behind the times; the presenttendency is to scorn tradition. That means to despise long efforts continuedthrough centuries by the industrious generations preceding us; to seek generallyto conceal ignorance by affecting to scorn the unknown in order to avoid theeffort necessary to know it. Preserve yourselves from this error! Progress isslow and must be sure. Whoever proceeds slowly is sane, and whoever is sane goesfar. Do you know what is very strong and original? It is to do very well whatothers have merely done well. The finest epochs are those in which tradition wasmost respected, when progress was continually perfecting, when there wasevolution and not revolution. Never has there been spontaneous generation inart. Between the Parthenon and the temples preceding it are only shades ofdifference. Furthermore and especially for studies is tradition precious. Todare to become free from it one must judge it, and to do this it must be known.Tradition is a paternal patrimony; to dissipate it independently, one risksfinding himself wandering at random and must at least know how to find himselfanother shelter.”This sounds like the despair of a bunch of quacks or witch doctors, who haveheld power for a long time by reason of their specialized knowledge in a fieldmade mysterious, cluttered with minute details and requiring years of study,such dull and useless study of so much that is inessential, that few would enterit and the witch-doctors, consequently, held sway and ruled all architecture.When the people are leaving them, at last, they rack their brains for someexcuse to hold on to their phony position of prestige: we gotta have tradition,and if not, we gotta study it anyway, at least in order to discard it, etc. Butplease study it, because this is our field, our second-hand claim to prestigeand distinction! [...]This is a magnificent sample of what every thinking person in any line is upagainst.Simple and regular type forms of buildings, often of colossal dimensions, havebeen employed in all ages to embody purely idealistic concepts, or other idealsremoved from the merely useful or material. Such are the temples, mausoleums andmonuments of antiquity and the great cathedrals and churches of Christianepochs.Here is an important point of difference. Howard Roark will make all buildings“idealistic,” for every phase of life. Real life on earth, not in heaven, canand must be made beautiful.Research and careful study of the masterworks of architectural art are mostessential factors in training. By strengthening taste, discrimination is therebymade more sure and the novice will have the right to feel that he has climbedmany steps when he is able to select the good from the inferior. It is well toremember that in the study of design it is far better to copy something that isreally good than to try to create out of a limited imagination. After allimagination is rather largely a matter of memory, if it is not all that. Inarchitecture, it has been said, the sort of originality that consists in the useof old materials is quite satisfactory for all purposes. It was good enough forthe Greeks, why not for us?(Sic!)In conclusion:I am only paraphrasing the words of Sir Joshua Reynolds, when he said: “Thehabit of contemplating and brooding over the ideas of great geniuses, until youfind yourself warmed by the contact, is the sure method of an artist-like mind.”Isn’t there something here to explain why geniuses are so often recognized onlyafter they’re dead? When they are alive, they’re a menace to the second-handers.But when they are dead, their glory can be appropriated safely by thesesecond-handers who then accept the prestige of specialists in that which theirown kind would never have acknowledged while the author was there to claim hisown glory. (Also: how many of these recognized geniuses are such and how manythe creation of the second-handers?)049 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_049_r1.jpg]Frank Lloyd Wright, The Disappearing City.No notes. More of Wright’s ideas. Some beautiful, a great many not clear. Moreabout sociology than about architecture. [He speaks of] architecture as a forceshaping society. (Which it isn’t.)August 15, 1938From a speech by Charles D. Maginnis, president of the A.I.A., at theInstitute’s convention in New Orleans, April, 1938 [published in the May issueof The Architect’s World]:It is to be remarked that the world of our youth, to the understanding of whichour minds were so very painfully adjusted, is in the act of tumbling about ourheads and we are largely engaged in testing the validity of the fragments in theexpectation of constructing a better one. Inevitably the process is attended byviolent conflict of opinion. In the political order, for instance, we had beendeeply grounded in the faith that, with all its familiar inefficiencies, thedemocratic type of society offered the highest exercise and the most lastingsatisfaction for the human spirit. We now confront a mounting philosophy basedupon its complete denial. More profoundly still we had believed in the cogencyof the Divine principle in civilization. A strange new world rejects it as ananemic and disturbing anachronism....This is terribly important. Here is a man who fights modern architecture andindividuality, as later quotes show, an eclectic and a second-hander parexcellence. And he is precisely the type that would state and accept as a factthat “the world is tumbling about our heads.” Who told him it was tumbling? Whatgrounds has he to believe so? Only the Red propaganda, which he has acceptedpromptly and readily because he thinks that that is the way the wind is blowing.He has never had any standards and is, therefore, willing to abandon what hethought to be standards, willing to abandon anything. He is willing to gatherthe fragments and “build a better world.” Better—with the denial of democraticrights included? This is to be stressed. It is men like Peter Keating who makemen like Toohey possible; by denying standards, they are ready to accept anystandards handed to them by anyone, or forced upon them. Keating will submit toToohey as he submitted to everyone and everything else. Toohey is the type whoknows how to reap the harvest of the second-handers. After grudging, half-hearted, bromidic, meaningless compliments to modernarchitecture, the speaker shows what is really in his heart:And so, in this attitude of reserve, we may welcome the stimulation of the newmovement with all the challenge of its bitter rationality. That there isrefreshment in it we have already noted in the clarity, vitality andindependence it has brought to all design, even as we remark that, unlikeEurope, we have not as yet yielded to its complete implication. Whether it holdthe gift of completely alienating the past still remains to be proven. We havenot yet seen the convincing evidence and it is always to be remembered that anartistic philosophy must propitiate the eye no less than the reason. This maytake a little time. The human spirit has a way of finding its own satisfactions,and logic does not figure too largely in the matter.(Note the second-hander’s invariable disparagement of logic in favor of “spirit”or “sentiment.”)It may well be that the modem thesis is over-bold. It comes to one, forinstance, that of the new materials with which its philosophy is identified, itis perhaps the single weakness of steel that, with all its thrilling capacities,it cannot make for interesting ruins. It is a point not to be overlooked, foreven ruins have their eloquent and venerable importance. Always it has beenarchitecture which has given us testimony of the ages. Someone has said: “showme the buildings of a people, and I will tell you its history.” If we arecontent to render our own civilization in an architecture dependent upon steel,a reasonably remote posterity can have no visual knowledge of us, which might bea pity. In this there may be hint that the historic principle of structure isnot quite discredited and that walls will still be built against which ourposterity may bark its shins. For it is worthy of remark that it is the wallsand not the space which have so intelligently survived. Perhaps it may not betoo hazardous a prediction that the great and significant buildings of thegenerations will be built in the future, as they have been always built, interms of articulated and enduring masonry.(This speaks for itself! The most priceless bit I have yet found.)"},{"pageContent":"6PLOTAfter two years of working on The Fountainhead, AR was clear on the theme andcharacters, and had learned a great deal about architecture. But she had not yetworked out certain key elements of the plot. In particular, she did not yet havethe idea for the climax of the story, i.e., Roark’s dynamiting of CortlandtHomes and the subsequent trial. Long after the publication of The Fountainhead,she recalled her difficulties:I had the most impossibly difficult time, and nothing in the story could be setfirmly, only tentatively, until I had the climax. And that was a realmind-breaker. I needed an event which was connected with architecture, but whichwould put Roark in the position of real danger and of antagonizing the whole ofsociety. And, incidentally, I found that dramatizing events of an architect’scareer is enormously difficult, because the art itself is physical, it doesn’tdeal with people. All the conflicts have to be ideologically tied to thebuilding, but they are not about the building as such. A lawyer or a doctorwould be much easier to dramatize. And I remember cursing the profession forthat reason....It was while working in the office of E. J. Kahn that Ayn Rand thought of herdramatic climax. Kahn mentioned to her one morning that the biggest technicalproblem in architecture was the design of low-rent housing projects. That day,while eating lunch in a nearby cafe, she arrived at the idea of Roark designingand dynamiting Cortlandt Homes. She had solved the most difficult problem inplanning the book—she finally had the essential element of the plot. Thefollowing notes begin in March of 1938, shortly after this breakthrough, atabout the time that she quit her job with Kahn.Approximately two-thirds of her notes from this last pre-writing period arepresented here.

But hemotivates them and all the major events of their lives.On what occasions can Roark demonstrate his utter anti-socialness? Opportunitiesfor second-handedness:professional—obedience to opinions of others, the end becomes the means,existence only in the eyes of others, nepotism;personal—fear of public opinion, conventions and prejudices, sacrifice of one’sreal self to others.(Try to think out a type and a dramatic occasion for each.)Roark’s situations come from his peculiar attitude and his disregard of all thatwould constitute tragedy to average people. As far as the plot and physical bodyof the novel is concerned, all the main events are motivated by the second-handpsychology (or Roark as its opposite).The last part of the book is mainly Roark-Wynand. Consequently, the rest ispreparation for it which is resolved in the main climax. This is: Dominique,Peter, Toohey. Concentrate on this for first part—building toward last.(What if Roark is brought to Wynand, not through a house to build, but by theeditor, as a rescue, as [Wynand‘s] greatest prey?) [This sentence was crossedout.] March 31, 1938ROARK AND WYNANDWhat is Wynand’s stage when he meets Roark?Wynand is at the height of his success—and sick of it. He has married Dominique.His love for her is getting to a stage of mania—the despair of holding on to onething in which he sees salvation and self-respect. One thing which he reallywants—and now he wants her with all the passion of every other “wish he mighthave had.” His bitterness about his kind of life is growing steadily, butvaguely, obscurely, hidden. He denies it to himself, evades it, hides from itbehind Dominique. He has not missed and betrayed everything, he tells himself,he has Dominique. But precisely for that very reason, one serious devotion inhis life leads him to feel more strongly that which he has missed; it makes himrealize—subconsciously, against his will—everything that he has betrayed.Consequently, his attitude to Dominique is a feverish mixture of exaggerated joyand involuntary, exaggerated despair. This last is rarer. But there are suddenmoments, like explosions, like subterranean grumblings of the earthquake tocome, when he is madly bitter, unhappy at her—without reason. These are thefirst signs of the man breaking up. No one notices it except the editor [AlvahScarret], who does not like it.His attitude toward men around him is the same strange mixture, somewhatreversed; his spurts of sadism intensified, sometimes out of all proportion, tothe limits of the permissible. He has never been as bitter toward men. He isgetting worse, people say. The fact is that he is getting better—and does notknow it, and does not want to know it. He now has strange moments of relaxationin his taunting of men, moments of dead calm, a hopeless, weary calm that[suggests] his greatest danger—indifference. Even this pastime no longerinterests him. He is beginning to realize—subconsciously, for he would not yetadmit it to himself—that even this means nothing, that it proves nothing andredeems nothing. This subconscious conclusion terrifies him, drives him toexcesses. But it will take Roark to make him admit the conclusion in so manywords. The editor, wise in his own way and in his unerring second-hander’sinstinct, sees and recognizes the danger signs. He knows the coming loss to thesecond-handers’ camp of a great ally who has never really belonged to it.Consequently, Wynand’s excesses worry him less than his occasional terrifyingindifference. Once, when Wynand refuses to act true to form, the editor goadshim to it desperately.This is the groundwork for Roark’s entrance into Wynand’s life.What is Roark at the time?This is the definite beginning of Roark’s final [triumph]. Not much money asyet, but much fame. Notoriety, rather, of the resentful kind. Completeself-assurance. He knows he has won. His indifference to people can afford nowto be tinged with the slightest pity. There is a glow about him—of a greatbattle won. His calm is a challenge to others. His honesty—arrogance.How does Roark take Wynand?He sees through him at once. He sees more than the editor, more than Wynandhimself. He is amused, at first; then soon begins to pity him, with a kind pitythat respects, not insults. Ends by liking him. (One occasion of Roark’s gestureof faith in Wynand-either before or after Wynand’s attempt against him.)How does Wynand take Roark?Wynand is fascinated, at first. Completely and in spite of himself. Or rather,he does not fight against it, does not even analyze it. It is a complete,spontaneous emotion, so rare in him. He surrenders to it simply, naturally, andhappily. He knows only that here is a man whom he really likes—which has neverhappened to Wynand before—a man to whom he likes to talk, simply, directly,sincerely. This after the first few taunts—and quite involuntary,unpremeditated. Then he realizes—with a little frightened start—that he actuallyrespects the man. It is an entirely new feeling for Wynand; he enjoys it with aninterested curiosity. So much for the beginning. April 4, 1938Then Wynand realizes the trap into which he has fallen—too late. He has onespurt of ferocious hatred against Roark, a last gesture of self-defense. Roarkwins—which only makes Wynand like him more. (This may be the point where Wynandsuddenly cancels the construction of his country home—for no apparent reason atall, only to take it up again shortly afterwards, knowing that nothing will makehim cancel his house or lose Roark.) Perfunctorily, almost as a matter ofconscientiousness, Wynand goes through a few “temptations” of Roark—such asoffering him huge real estate projects if he surrenders his ideals. It does notwork. Not at all. Roark does not even hesitate for a moment, makes no great showof heroism and sacrifice in refusing. He refuses simply and immediately, as aman who does not ever see two, but only one course open to him. He does not evengive Wynand the satisfaction of being indignant. If anything, he is slightlyamused. He sees through Wynand’s game—the first victim to do so. To the editor’sterror, Wynand—instead of being furious at his defeat—is openly delighted.Openly even to himself. Not to Roark, of course, but openly enough for theeditor to see it and for Wynand himself to realize it fully, to admit it tohimself. In any future, lesser attempts, Wynand is now anxious for Roark todefeat him. Roark does. And the great Gail Wynand comes to a point where Roark becomes the most preciousthing in his life. Above Dominique, though Wynand does not admit it. Roarkbecomes his revenge against society, against that mob whom Roark is defying andto whom Wynand has surrendered. Wynand, at this stage, does not yet admit thissurrender to himself, but he knows it already subconsciously, hence all hisvague anguish, his peculiar spiritual hysteria. The full, conscious knowledge ofit will come later, when he is forced to betray Roark.At the moment, Roark becomes an obsession to him. In the most spiritual senseonly, without the slightest possibility of the merest hint of sexual perversion,Wynand is actually in love with Roark. There are no definite events, no concretespeeches in which this is displayed. It is there, nevertheless. It is aninstance of Wynand’s masochism, of which he has quite a taint. The torture ofloving a man whom in many other ways he hates appeals to him. He hates him foreverything that Roark is and he, Wynand, isn’t. He hates him as a challenge tohis whole life, as the embodiment of his conscience. He loves him for these veryreasons. Unrealized, there is in Wynand’s mind a twisted feeling of atonement inhis love for Roark—his worst enemy. He is punishing himself for what he hasdone—by bowing before what he should have done. The bowing hurts him. He enjoysit for that. By being hurt—at this late date—he thinks he is atoning for themany hurts he has avoided: he is suffering for an ideal—for the first and lasttime in his life. As a gesture to all the ideals he should have, but did not,suffer for.He now has two centers in his existence—Dominique as a joy he wished andobtained, Roark as a suffering he chose and accepted. He loses both at the sameblow.How he takes Roark’s love for Dominique is another great point to be consideredat length separately.053 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_053_r1.jpg]Another important second-hander: The kind that does not form opinions becauseothers hold them, but because they know instinctively this is what others willhold (e.g., Toohey, the editor). Toohey approves of a book, not because it isalready popular, but because he knows unerringly that it will be popular. Thebarometers of the mob. The deadliest kind of second-handers.PLAN OF THE LAST PARTRoark blows up the housing project.His arrest. Wynand offers help immediately. (“I know. I understand. I admire. Myentire resources at your service in your coming fight. G. W.”) Old lawyer comesout of retirement to take the case. Wynand supplies Roark’s bail.Fury of indignation in the press all over the country. Roark maintains completesilence—no explanations given. Wynand papers come out alone to defend Roark.(Incident of woman who wants house by Roark.)Toohey urges his union to strike against the “Ford” building. He does not hopeor intend to win. Just a gesture to “finish” Roark. Wynand’s greatest crusade.His insane determination. The editor’s fight with him. Dominique’sthreat-promise. (“I will love you if you stand by him. You don’t know whatyou’ll lose—if you don’t.”)Utter failure of the Wynand papers. Boycott against them on a grand, generalscale. His board of directors and the editor deliver an ultimatum. Wynandsurrenders. His papers come out against Roark.Wynand’s own, silent tragedy. He sees his second-hand power for what it is,fully, clearly and completely. He knows now the failure of his whole life.(Incident with housewife buying newspaper.)Wynand-Roark. Wynand begs him to escape and jump bail. Roark refuses.054 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_054_r1.gif]Dominique’s decision to escape with Roark the day before the trial. She tellshim that she loves him. Begs him to escape and to continue his work abroad. Shewill pay Wynand his bail. She is “buying him from the State of New York.” Roarkagrees.Their escape [the night before the trial] to her country home (which he built).Old servants who see them there. Their first night together after many years.Day of trial. Wynand is in Washington trying to use “pull” to save Roark. Roarkdoes not appear. Alarm sent out for him.That night. Dominique has arranged for private plane. Drives with Roark to theairfield. Mails letters to Wynand on the way. Fire in the “Ford” building—set bythe strikers. Roark sees it on the way [to the airfield], rushes to building inspite of her protests. The situation of the unconnected water tank. Roark rushesup through the flames to save the building. Dominique tries to stop him. Shefalls down after trying to hold the elevator. Looks up into a battery ofcameras.Roark’s fight against the fire on his way up. He connects the tank and saves thebuilding. Does not even care or notice when he is arrested. [Note the similarityhere to her earlier story, The Skyscraper.]Next morning. Wynand flies back to Washington in private plane. He knows nothingof the events of the night before. Drives to office from landing field. Seesextras in street, pays no attention. Peculiar reception of his office staff. Hebawls them out for “missing a scoop.” They run away from him. The editor rushesinto his office. “I told you so!” If he means Roark’s escape, Wynand laughs,why, he is delighted. The editor hands him a copy of a rival paper with thepicture of Dominique in the mud, on the front page. The whole story of the fireis there, plus the information already gathered by the police about Roark andDominique spending the night together at her country home. The editor is franticas to their policy in this crisis. Wynand doesn’t even hear him. Wynand isquiet, gentle, the gentleness of a man who is not alive any more. He asks onlywhere Dominique is, and hearing that she is at home, leaves the office, ignoringthe editor’s hysterical questions.Wynand-Dominique. When he comes home, he learns that she has just returned fromthe jail hospital (where Roark is) and that she is waiting to see him, Wynand.Their scene. He tries desperately to prevent her from saying one thing which hedreads. He starts by telling her that if she says the story isn’t true, it won’tbe true; his great power will make it untrue. He begs her, in other words, todeny it. It’s true, she tells him. She laughs: his great power, what did it dofor Roark? Wynand then talks hysterically, as if putting words into her mouth,telling himself what he has not heard from her, but wants to hear: that it isonly an affair, he doesn’t mind, he was expecting it sooner or later, they willgo abroad and forget it all. There are not reproaches from him, no anger, nothought of giving her up. Only a desperate plea for her not to leave him.She tells him that she loves Roark. When she says it, she realizes that that iswhat he had been dreading. She expects an explosion. She defies him. She tellshim everything and how much Roark really is to her. There is no explosion fromhim. No reaction. No words, after his recent outburst of them. He only muttersdully that if she wants a divorce, he’ll let her divorce him. He leaves theroom. Her letter and check of the day before arrive.... The editor phones,begging frantically for instructions on their policy. Wynand tells him to doanything he pleases. The editor holds him to that, makes him repeat it. Wynanddoes not care.Next morning. After a sleepless night, the full force of the blow has come toWynand. It is his last outburst of emotion. He goes to Dominique’s room, begsher, threatens her, offers her anything to remain with him; she can have all thelovers she wants, but not that one! She can even leave him, Wynand, if sheinsists, and go with any other man, but not Roark. Anything, but not Roark! Sheis kind to Wynand this time; she understands, she is sorry for him. She lets himsee that it is hopeless; that she will live or die for Roark. She knows that sheand Wynand have both found the same thing in Roark; only it is too late forWynand....She is now leaving to go to the trial. (She can’t do that! he objects. He can‘t,she answers, but she can. She is not the Wynand papers.) And before leaving shetells him that there is not much that he can do now, anyway, about theirmarriage: she hands him a copy of his own paper, where, on the front page, is astatement signed “Gail Wynand,” denouncing Dominique, insulting her, putting allblame on her, announcing to the world that he is going to divorce her. Wynand isunable to speak. Dominique can now feel pity for him. “Don’t, Gail. Iunderstand. I know who wrote it. Don’t blame him too much. He had to. You hadto.” She leaves for the trial.The trial. Roark enters, his head bandaged, his left arm in a sling. He isgreeted by cheers, applause and hisses. The public sentiment is now dividedabout him. The judge threatens to clear the court, “if they don’t remember thatit is a courtroom, not a news-reel theater.” The photographers have a swell timephotographing Dominique as she enters. She pays no attention. She sees no onebut Roark.The progress of the trial. The prosecution has an army of witnesses. (Perhapseven Dominique—to supply the motive as Roark’s hatred for Peter.) The defensetactics—“no questions.” No cross-examination whatever, not even of Peter, whohas some terrible moments on the stand and behaves like a piece of pulp. Peter,however, does not confess the truth and is not asked to.Wynand does appear in the courtroom—once. Thereafter, the editor prevents it.When the defense’s turn comes, the old lawyer has but one witness to call—HowardRoark. After the first formalities of name, profession, etc., the lawyer asks:“Mr. Roark, what connection did you have with the project known as [CortlandtHomes]?” Roark answers, very quietly: “I designed it.” [Then comes] the wholestory of the contract with Peter. The contract is introduced in evidence. BeforePeter can be warned by the prosecution or collect his wits, he has admitted hissignature and the truth of the story. The defense rests.The old lawyer’s closing speech—summation of what Roark is, of his standards, ofhis value to mankind. No plea for pity. No apology. A quiet defiance. A“This-is-what-he-is-now-dare-to-convict-him,-if you-can” feeling. The juryretires to deliberate.Jury out all evening and night. Possible scene of Roark, Dominique, old lawyer,some others waiting together for verdict. Roark talks—of everything but the juryand trial. The only time he can be poetic, almost tender(?).Next morning. The verdict: “Not guilty. ” The judge furious. It comes out thatthe first ballot was eleven ... guilty to one ... not guilty. The one swung theeleven. (Plant this one man earlier, his reasons, his psychology.) Dominiqueleaves courtroom as soon as verdict is rendered. She does not approach Roark.“Home and to bed!” the old lawyer orders him. “To the Ford building!” ordersRoark.Ovation of workers at the Ford building. (They have been listening on the radioto the verdict.) Then at Roark’s office: The one “capitalist” on the housingproject has announced that he is buying it from the state and will have Roark doit as it was intended. Other commissions—from sensation seekers....Then Roark comes home. Dominique is waiting for him there. Their one real,complete love scene. She will go away, not to disturb him now when his workneeds him; also to “find herself”—adjust herself to her new life. Then she willcome back. They will be together forever.055 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_055_r1.jpg]The Wynand papers have been doing beautifully during the trial. Circulation isboosted by a “succes de scandale.” Everyone reads the Wynand papers to see howthey “take it.” The editor takes advantage of it. He prints hints,double-meanings, “between-the-lines” allusions, things that will be quoted anddiscussed and gloated over; he builds up Wynand as a moral, outraged man. He isdelighted with and boasts to Wynand (without noticing Wynand’s horror) about thetons of fan mail arriving for Wynand, letters of sympathy and advice from goodhousewives, proposals of marriage from spinsters who promise not to “treat himthat way” and to “make him forget.” And Dominique, whom Wynand had tried sodesperately to keep from the mob, whose pictures were never allowed in thepress, is now splashed across every front page in the country, including theWynand papers. (Incident with paper in the gutter.) When a political eventoccurs that is in line with the Wynand papers’ policy and throws a great deal ofsympathy to them, when a noted gossip columnist decides to join the Wynandpapers, the editor’s victory is complete. The Wynand papers are back. The editoreven goes so far as to say before Wynand that the whole affair was a swell stuntfor them, after all.Wynand takes it all as in a daze, with the greatest indifference possible. Helets it be done. He does not even wince often. Dominique leaves for Europe.Wynand divorces her—in a short, horrible scene in which he repudiates herpublicly. It is Wynand’s greatest agony. He goes through it like an automaton.He is led by the editor completely. He has not gathered the pieces of his spiritenough to act for himself.Peter’s complete downfall. Short scene of his accepting an inferior commission,a home in the “Greek” style (“like his library”).Toohey’s defeat and new plans, grander than ever.056 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_056_r1.jpg]Very shortly after the divorce, the question of the Wynand Building comes up.The time is considered “just right” in view of “the triumph.” The board ofdirectors is in session to decide on the architectural competition for “thegreatest building in the world.” This is Wynand’s last gesture. All that he hasgathered of his spirit now goes into this—as a challenge to that new triumphwhich he hates. He rises. “Gentlemen, there will be no contest. I have chosenthe architect who will do the Wynand Building. His name is Howard Roark.” Deadsilence. The sole reaction is one choked hiccough from some unimportant littleguy. Wynand looks at the stunned faces, pouncing on them ferociously: “Well? Hasno one here anything to say? I take it that you approve of my choice,gentlemen?” In the silence, the editor gasps: “You’re mad, Gail!” Wynand whirlson him: “Why? Because he’s sleeping with my wife? Because I hate him more thanany man living? And because he alone can give us the greatest building in theworld? ... The matter is settled, gentlemen. I wish you a good day.” He leavesthe conference room.Nothing can sway Wynand in this, his last, his only real decision. To thefrantic pleas of the editor, he answers only that he does not give a damn anymore about “his public” and “his papers.” He has enough to live on. He doesn’tcare whether the papers go on or fail. He has no heirs to leave them to. Thepublic will accept it—he doesn’t care; the public won’t accept it—he cares less.But he will have this one thing out of his life, when he has lost all the rest;one thing that he wants.Roark is informed. He is called to Wynand’s office. He comes. Wynand meets himalone in his office, coldly, formally. There is no allusion to anything but thebuilding. Wynand informs him briefly, generally of the requirements, the kind ofbuilding he wants from the angle of utility, its purpose. The rest is up toRoark. He will have an unlimited budget. There will be no orders given by anyonebut him. He is to design and build it as he pleases. It is to be the greatestbuilding in the world. He does not even have to submit his design for approval;it is approved in advance. If Roark accepts the job, he will find the contractsready in the outer office; Wynand has signed them; all Roark has to do is tosign. Roark accepts. He is as calm, as cold, as unsur prised as is Wynand.Then Wynand says, with a little different note in his voice: “I do not wish everto see you again. I do not wish to speak to you. You will find my manager readyat any time for any orders you may want to give. I do not have to see you.” Hishatred, almost his insult, is apparent. Roark agrees calmly. Then, withoutlooking at him, Wynand says softly what that building had been intended to beand mean, how he had planned for it through the years, the crowning glory, thesymbol of his life. He looks at Roark suddenly. He adds: “I have nothing tocrown now, nothing to celebrate. I have nothing to go into that building—exceptwhat you’ll put into it.” He rises. His greatest moment. The sum and the summitof his life. Everything he has is in the words: “Build it as a monument to thatspirit which is yours ... and ... could have been mine.”057 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_057_r1.jpg]About eight months later (less, if possible). Dominique returns from Europe. Shehas not written to Roark of her return. She goes to his office-he is at theWynand Building. She goes to building. The steel skeleton is up. She standslooking at it. Then she notices a thing which makes her tremble suddenly andlean against a wall. She looks at the street, at the people around her. Shefeels suddenly the greatest of all events, the greatest of all triumphs, thevictory of all the “great unsung” over all the filth of the pavements and thoseupon them; she sees all of society in a flash—and what it means; she sees allthose whom it has crushed and passed by—and their vindication. She has seen asmall, dirty tin plate nailed to the scaffolding of the Wynand Building:“Howard Roark, Architect”She goes into the building. She is told that Roark is above, on top of thebuilding. She takes an open freight elevator to go up. As it begins to riseslowly, we rise with her above the pavements, above the shops, the theaters, thehouses, the church spires, above all that men do and are. (The writingaccelerates here with the growing speed of the elevator as it rises.) She isabove everything, with nothing but the sky and the distant ocean rising on thehorizon. Then she sees, alone, tall, erect against the sky, Howard Roark on thetop of the building, his red hair flying in the wind.

These principles are illustrated by the actions ofthe two men. In their relations to these two, and in the influence of these two,the [other] characters play out the drama which illustrates the twolife-principles.The others are: Dominique, Peter, Wynand.Dominique: The Toohey principles have forced her into a bitter cynicism aboutall life. She is born above these principles, and not ready as yet for those ofRoark, because nothing in life has ever taught her the Roark philosophy. Herstory is the struggle against the Toohey principle to win through to Roark.Wynand: He has lived according to Toohey all his life and has never believed init. He is only too ready for Roark and knows it the moment he meets him. Hisstory is the conscious struggle against the Roark principle, only to surrenderto it in the end.Peter: Unfit for any principle. The clay with which Toohey builds. He couldhave, perhaps, achieved a shadow of self-vindication with Roark. He reaches thebottom of waste and tragedy with Toohey.058 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_058_r1.jpg]Roark: integrity, loyalty to yourself.Toohey: exist for, by and through others.Roark brings out and encourages every form of truth to self.

Rocks like a frozen explosion—a struggle, the harmony of conflict, thehard unity not of peaceful balance, but of opposite forces holding one anotherin check. Sharp angles, like clenched muscles, deep gashes like wounds worn asdecorations, a million sparks in the granite, the rock flaming, a hard luster,the polish of heat, as if the air were a liquid, so dry that the stones seem wetwith sunrays.A few tufts of green—a luminous green tumbling in the wind, like green bonfiresburning on the fuel of granite. One tree—as a banner, victorious over the rock,rising to proclaim its place in this world of stone. [This last sentence wascrossed out.]The lake—an enclosed canyon, quiet, guarded, mysterious. Cold, obviously coldeven in its fire; in spite of it or because of it. Subterranean spring. Nobottom. [The preceding three sentences were crossed out.]A thin silver film cutting, midway, the walls of granite. A luminousbowl—lighting the sky. The sky—clear, blue with nothing, not a single cloud togive it limit or reality—as a mirror for the lake. The rocks continue into thedepth and then there is the sky. So that the whole place seems suspended inspace, with the sky below and above it, an island floating on nothing, a circle,a coral reef of the sky, anchored only by the two feet of the man on the rock.The place is wild, untouched, no trace of the existence of men.His laughter as the meaning of the earth around him, as its song, as the releaseof its tension. Triumphant, the complete ecstasy. (See Nietzsche aboutlaughter.) [Elsewhere in her notes, AR copied the following from Thus SpokeZarathustra: “O my brethren, I heard a laughter which was no human laughter—andnow gnaweth a thirst at me, a longing that is never allayed. My longing for thatlaughter gnaweth at me: oh, how can I still endure to live! And how could Iendure to die at present! ”]It’s the lines of his body that give meaning to the struggle around him, it’sthe struggle known and possible to his muscles, to his veins, to the thin linesbeating under his skin.063 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_063_r1.jpg]The township of Stanton began with a dump. Billboards advertising soap andgasoline. A church—carpenter Gothic with spire à la Wren. Streets—all alike andall awful. Consumptive, public, tight little houses, “fancy” architecture withthe paint peeling. Garbage can. Diapers on a line. A pampered dog on a cushion.A man’s behind—planting nasturtiums. A woman sprawled, legs spread apart, on aporch. A woman pushing a perambulator and wiping the sweat off with the back ofher hand.Roark amidst it. Everyone looks at his hair. Most people turn away too quickly.Some stare with a blind, nameless, instinctive hatred. All uncomfortable. Thealien. What had been joy in him is now arrogance, what had been strength is nowa challenge, what had been freedom is a nameless threat. As to him—he sees noone. He walks, as he swam, straight to a given point. For him the street isempty. He could have walked there naked without concern.Main square—shops about a lawn, a movie theater in competition with the stocktheater. Signs in shop windows welcoming the “Class of ‘22,” which is graduatingtoday. He turns off into a side street at the end of which, on a knoll, standsthe house of Mrs. Keating over a green ravine.064 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_064_r1.jpg]Roark versus the eclectics. (“Have you thought of clients?” “Yes, I have thoughtof clients. I do not presume to consider myself the only man of good taste inthe world.”) Mention of Cameron.Lead up to his utter selfishness. Dean mentions that he has no friends, hasrefused to join fraternities. “Won’t you reconsider? You have worked hard foryour education.” (Sketch his past.) “No, I won’t reconsider.” Whom to notify? Noone. No parents. No guardians. Who was his father? He has no one now. “We have decided. I believe, as was stated at this morning’s meeting, that theprofession is not for you. You’re giving it up, aren’t you?”“Oh, no. I’m just beginning.”“Who’ll give you work?”“I believe I know someone who will.”Dean’s anger. “You are dangerous.” End of interview.(“I haven’t the time to waste on exercises in calligraphy, copying. I’m here tolearn. When I’m given a project, its only value to me is to learn to solve it asI would solve a real one. I did them the way I’ll build them.”)THE ECLECTICSARTISTICALLYEverything beautiful in architecture has been done already. We cannot improve,we can only try to repeat.There is something good in every style. We can only choose from the greatmasters. Who are we to improve upon them? Of course, we must make properadaptations to meet modern conditions.That is tradition. We cannot break with tradition. It is our sacred heritage.Nothing worthwhile is invented by one man in architecture. The proper creativeprocess is a long, slow, gradual, collective one, in which each man adds hislittle bit to what has gone on before. This is the splendid march ofcivilization. And will always be so. The modernists? A passing mode, a freakfury of exhibitionists trying to attract attention. Look at Cameron.SOCIOLOGICALLYAn architect is not an end in himself. He is only a small part of a social unit.He does not build to please himself. Cooperation is the key word to the modernworld and to architecture particularly. Furthermore, the designing and artisticinspiration is only a small part of an architect’s equipment. He must also be abusiness man and a diplomat. Above all, he must consider the client. The Client,above all. It’s his cash that pays for the luxury of your artistic inspirations,isn’t it? He’s the one to live in the house. Who are you to tell him what hemust live in? You’re only an employee, like his secretary, his chauffeur and hiscook. You are only to execute his desire, in the best manner you are able andgive it the proper artistic form.ROARKARTISTICALLYWhy do you think the Greek style beautiful? Just because your grandfather didand told you so, and his grandfather, and millions before him?I am a man. I choose a work to do. I must do the very best possible to me. I amthe sole judge of that best. If I give up that right of valuing, I might as wellgive up the right to all thought. If I think, I value. I alone. How do I knowwho is right among the others? I can only judge of what is right to me, for me.Times have changed. New means, new materials. We put up awful imitations, we’reuncomfortable, wasteful, dirty. Why?Architecture—the most important of the arts. Changing the face of nature, man’sbackground, that against which his whole life is played. In no other art arethere set standards. The artist works as he alone pleases. Why not, then, inarchitecture? [AR’s formulations here are open to a subjectivist interpretation;see The Romantic Manifesto for her defense of the objectivity of estheticstandards.]Form follows function. Consider the reality of what you’re doing.SOCIOLOGICALLYThe people do not know what they want. There is no such thing as the spirit of apeople. [Someone must] tell the people what they want. There are men born totell and men born to accept. That is cooperation. I do not build for a client.He only [offers] a problem for me to solve. I am glad to have a client so that Imay build. Not vice versa. The client is my means, not my end. The building isthe end."},{"pageContent":"7NOTES WHILE WRITINGAR began writing The Fountainhead on June 26, 1938. She finished four and a halfyears later, on December 31, 1942. The writing went slowly at first, in partbecause of the difficulty of the task, and in part because financial troublescaused her to interrupt the work In 1939, she wrote two plays: an adaptation ofWe the Living (entitled The Unconquered) and a philosophical murder mystery,Think Twice (published in The Early Ayn Rand). In 1941, she took a job as areader for Paramount Pictures. Her (unpaid) campaign work for Wendell Willkie inthe 1940 presidential election was another major interruption. As a result,nearly two-thirds of the novel was still unwritten when she signed a contractwith a publisher (Bobbs-Merrill) in December 1941. She had to write at a furiouspace to complete the novel by the agreed-upon deadline of January 1, 1943.The above history is reflected in the present chapter. Whereas Part I involveddetailed analyses in her journal, there are comparatively few notes that pertainto specific scenes in the last two-thirds of the novel. By the time these sceneswere written, of course, her ideas were clear and she had little need to makenotes.The vast majority of her notes while writing are included here. Some of thematerial is undated; I have specified the year when it is known. I have omitteda revised outline of Part IV because it describes events as they happen in thepublished novel; the only other notes omitted were repetitive or cryptic.July 18, 1938CHAPTER IIFrancon’s speech (his distinctions).The audience. Peter in it. Peter’s thoughts about everyone noticing him, he andothers. Peter’s qualifications: star student, president of student body (he hasalways been elected), star of track team, fraternities.Peter receiving his degree, Paris scholarship, gold medal. Congratulations ofthe boys and of professors, Petechin among them (referring to his one building),mention of Peter’s graduation project. Francon’s mention of a job.Peter at the banquet. His talk on architecture. Peter’s thoughts about Roark.Roark’s help. Party of boys planned for later that night.Peter goes home. Wonders if people notice him or know who he is, determines thathe’ll make them know who he is. His and Mrs. Keating’s past.Peter comes home. Roark and Tony on the porch—Tony’s protestations toRoark—slight encounter between Peter and Tony. Tony doesn’t like Peter, Tonyleaves.Peter-Roark. Peter “wants to speak to him.” Peter’s condolences. The friendlyscene. Mrs. Keating rushes down, hearing his voice. She’s been waiting for him;he’s annoyed. Peter is gloating about Francon’s offer and hesitating about theParis trip. Mrs. Keating settles that. Peter asks what Roark will do. His horrorat the mention of Cameron. Peter raises the question of living together—withMrs. Keating keeping house for them. Roark refuses.Vesta comes down. Vesta—appearance and status. Her brusqueness and forcednonchalance. Roark insists on knowing what’s the matter with her. She confesses.Roark’s plan for the three of them to move to New York. Peter and Vesta agree.Mrs. Keating’s horrified protests overruled.Roark goes to pack, Vesta to dream, Peter to his party.Peter on way to party. Complete intoxication of success. The great things hewill do.What did he graduate in? Oh yes, architecture. October 16, 1938Roark: feature one building in each important line, show how he knows theimportant activities of life—and what he thinks of them.065 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_065_r1.jpg]Friendship: Roark is the only one capable of real friendship—because he is ableto look at people in themselves, unselfishly—because he is too selfish, becausethey are not a part of him in any way. He does not need them basically, does notneed their opinion of him, and [therefore he] can value them for their own sake,a relationship of two equals. Roark does not want to impress himself uponothers, because he does not need it.Other people cannot be friends, because in their petty selfishness—in theirconcern with themselves through others—they can be interested in friends only asthose friends concern them. They become tyrants, because they need the slaveryof others to inflate them.[Show] not only what second-handedness (as an abnormal, basic preoccupation withothers) does to the person himself, but also to those others, to his relationwith them. (Hatred of all who don’t belong. If one isn’t too concerned withothers—why want them to “belong”?) You can have real freedom (in every sense,freedom from one another) only when you stop being too concerned with others. November 8, 1938For the whole—every stage of the lives motivated by certain principles.Every detail of how a certain conception of existence works, what it does—andwhat are the results. November 10, 1938It’s terribly bad to be conscious of yourself as others see you, [whether theysee you as] good or bad. Take yourself for granted. The consciousness that feelsalone—without the weight of other eyes watching—is the only healthyconsciousness.066 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_066_r1.jpg]Another aspect of second-handedness: The horror of being nothing; every personone faces is not a person, not a rational, cognizant being, but a blind, deafagglomeration of bits from everyone else, unthinking and impotent, without thewill of decision, so that nothing in that person can be reached, nothing can actor respond. It is the hopelessness of attempting to speak to an animal—there isno language, there is no possibility of a language, there is a barrier thatcan’t be broken. The silent, universal, omnipresent beast of “otherpeople”—unreachable, irresponsible; vague and intangible, yet more real than theconcrete beings who represent it, who are only its fragments.[The following note was added on February 21, 1940:]Toohey is the one to capitalize on this. The soil is ready, begging for someseeds, because it is empty. Toohey gives them the seeds. Toohey molds publicopinion. And Toohey is the one to do it, not someone better, not the Roark type,because what Toohey preaches is in accord with and in support of the onecertainty of the mob: its rightness in being second-hand, its fear of thesingle, the strong and the definite. Toohey makes this second-handedness, thiscowardice and universal “equality,” into a virtue. And he is thus armed to fightthe Roark type. December 12, 1938For Roark-Dominique: She likes to think of the granite broken by his hands,[when] under his hands.For Toohey: His great enthusiasm for and preoccupation with books on childrenand animals, such books as Ferdinand or Tapiola, such movies as Snow White andall of Walt Disney. It would be Toohey who’d find philosophical significance inDonald Duck. Why? It’s not Donald Duck that he’s boosting. It’s philosophy thathe’s destroying.For Roark: Watch and trace the development, the growth of his ideas onarchitecture and what he does with them, the changes in his work.067 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_067_r1.jpg][The life of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper publisher, suggested to ARseveral concretes for the life of Gail Wynand.]John K. Winkler, W. R. Hearst, An American Phenomenon.The principles of “circulation getters”:Be first with the news. Go out and get it. In case of need, make it. Display itstrikingly, distribute it swiftly and sell it cheaply. Avoid brain-rackingcomment upon it. Follow it up until the evening of the day before the publicwearies of it. Then get something fresh....What is news, and to whom? To the circulation-getters, pure and simple, it iswhat will cause most excitement among the widest public. It is a commondenominator of ordinary minds. It is what will capture the crowd....The most glaring of his faults, it has been said, is that Hearst and the men heplaced in charge of his growing enterprises have too often denounced thesuccessful merely because they were successful, and painted rainbows of hope forthe unsuccessful merely because they were poor—and numerous....Hearst loves to astonish. Yet there is something in his enigmatic temperamentthat keeps him from warm, intimate friendship. The man is Oriental-minded....The Orient whispers to Hearst in many ways—in his lordly opulent living, hisunceasing quest for the beautiful, his curious instinct for watching otherssquirm, his habit of falling away from a wolfish world and embarking upon longpilgrimages attended by one faithful and obedient courier. [...]Within two years the twenty-six year old editor, owner and sole proprietor, hadconverted the Examiner into the greatest feature newspaper in the West—andwithin five or six years the paper had become by far the greatest money-maker onthe Coast. No man ever mastered the root elements of journalism so speedily asthe youth fresh from Harvard. From the first, as Roosevelt said, he manifesteduncanny ability at cutting across lots and anticipating public opinion. He knewwhat would please the mass even before the mass began to move toward his bargaincounter with its gaudy headlines, juicy morsels and (later) colored supplements,cartoons and comics. [...]Hearst was very interested in machinery; he always introduced the latest in hisnewspaper shops, and even did inventing and improving himself.Camaraderie with his subordinates, fun and excitement in the office, in hisearly days in San Francisco.Hearst got the best newspaper talent he could get—and did not spare money to buyit. He paid very high salaries.Sample of his methods:Word filtered into San Francisco that the famous Hotel Del Monte at Mon terey,some 200 miles down the coast, was in flames. While the other papers waited forthe news to reach them in the leisurely, traditional way, Hearst chartered aspecial train, filled it with staff writers and sketch artists and rushed south.The following morning the Examiner came out with a fourteen-page extracontaining one of the most vivid stories of a disaster that had ever beenpublished in the West.... Most of the headlines and legends had been written byHearst himself. Three editions were run off to appease the popular demand.Hearst enters civic problems in his paper:A new city charter was proposed. The paper fought the charter on the ground thatit would entrench the bosses in power. The charter was defeated. Then theExaminer proposed a new charter that would give the people a greater measure ofhome rule, and carried it. It opened a crusade to force a privately owned watercompany to lower its rates. It won that, as well as a campaign to force theelectric companies to place their wires underground in the suburban district.Hearst went after local bosses of the Democratic Party and caused theirindictments by a grand jury.One of his woman reporters pretended to faint on the street, was taken to thecity receiving hospital and then wrote an expose of it, which caused reforms.A baby was born in the City Prison Hospital to a drunken prostitute. The childwould have become a charity charge had not Hearst stepped in. The birth occurreda few weeks before Christmas. The Examiner started a fund for the baby andcalled it “The Little Jim Fund.”The baby died, and Hearst applied the money to build a hospital for crippledchildren. He personally guaranteed the entire sum, while trying to raise it byappeals in his paper.One of his reporters jumped off a ferry boat in order to see how much time wouldbe taken to rescue him (he was an expert swimmer). This caused reform of ferryapparatus and drills for life-saving.Hearst’s bitterest early battle was against the Southern Pacific Railroad, whichcontrolled the state. Hearst got hold of letters written by the Railroad’sattorney and published them, creating a sensational scandal.Hearst bought the New York Morning Journal in 1895. He was thirty-two years old.He lost a great deal of money before he made this paper pay, but he spent themoney heedlessly. He started a battle with Pulitzer’s World. He cut the price ofhis paper under that of the World. He raided his rivals. He took their best menaway from them; he doubled the men’s salaries. At one time he lured the entirestaff of the Sunday World: editors, artists, writers. He signed all the bestwriters and famous names he could get. “Invariably he would go into thecomposing-room at midnight to help make up the paper, and his gift for strikingdisplay and news arrangement was the marvel of his associates.” His greatestconcern was to build circulation at any cost. [...]One night he came into the composing-room and looked over the make-up of thefirst page. He said the story they were playing as second in importance wasreally more interesting than the first and suggested that they should remake. “Iagree with you,” said the make-up man, “but I am afraid there is no time toreset.” Hearst smiled, pushed the whole form off the table, making a beautifulpile of pied type, then asked: “Now, is there time to reset? ... There is alwaystime to make a thing better.”Hearst started on what he called the “new journalism.” His slogan was “Whileothers talk the Journal acts” and “What is everybody’s business is the Journal’sbusiness.” He decided to be the champion of the people not only in words but inaction. His paper started bringing legal actions and injunctions againstcorporations and public abuses, e.g., an injunction preventing the Board ofAldermen from granting a gas-franchise, which the Journal found illegal, andothers like that. [...]“A mobile ‘murder squad’ was formed to solve criminal mysteries independently ofthe police (by the paper). Liberal rewards were offered.” One murder wasactually solved by the Journal, when it published reproductions of the oil-clothin which the body was found, and one of the reporters traced the purchaser ofthe cloth and exposed the murderer.Hearst liked features with “women appeal”:On one occasion the entire third page was given over to “Stories of Love andRomance Gathered From the News of the Day.” Each of the seven columns wereheaded by heart-shaped illustrations. Soon “Letters From the Lovelorn” blossomedout. [...]The incident when two editors of Hearst’s escaped to Europe, from overwork, andHearst sent a reporter after them, found them, took them back and neverreproached them for it. “He greeted the deserters politely, without a word ofreproof or admonition, just as though he had seen them every day for the pastmonth.”Hearst helped many people, but always concealed his personal charities.Hearst started agitating for the Spanish-American War in order to create “live”news. There was a story, unproved, but considered possible: Hearst sent specialcorrespondents to Cuba, one of whom wasFrederic Remington, the eminent artist, who drew notable sketches of Spanishcruelty. After a short time Remington sent this telegram from Havana: “W. R.Hearst, New York Journal, NY: Everything is quiet. There is no trouble here.There will be no war. I wish to return. Remington.” This is the answer Hearst issaid to have written: “Remington, Havana: Please remain. You furnish thepictures and I’ll furnish the war. W. R. Hearst.” [...]When Hearst opened a paper in Chicago, he had to fight a war with other papers.They all hired thugs to interfere with the distribution and selling of oneanother’s papers. But this did not discourage Hearst and his paper remained.[...]Hearst obtained and published letters written by the vice-president of StandardOil. (He bought the letters from minor employees who stole them and let Hearsttake photostats of them.) The letters showed corruption of senators and others.They created a great scandal. It was even rumored that the President askedHearst whether he had any letters referring to him. “Nothing that I intend topublish at this time,” replied Hearst blandly.Hearst started publishing magazines in 1903. One of his greatest successes wasGood Housekeeping which appealed to women and to advertisers, with itsinnovation of tests for the products advertised. [...]One artist who was invited to work for a Hearst magazine answered: “The onlyenterprise in which I shall ever voluntarily join William Randolph Hearst willbe one of self-destruction.”Hearst went into motion picture production, but had to give up, losing a greatdeal of money. (His political career, after terrific ballyhoo, was also afailure. He lost the election for governor of New York and the nomination forpresident.) [...]He has a special system to check up on all his publications. He keeps a man toread them and to see that they carry out Hearst’s instructions. If they don‘t,they get a note of warning from Hearst. This gives the impression that hepersonally reads all of them.Hearst’s executives have a vast respect for and a very appreciable terror oftheir chief. Hearst derives Machiavellian delight in sitting in the wings andrelishing quarrels between the figures on his stage. When he has had his fun,and is convinced the scrap has gone far enough, he takes a hand. Generally, he“suggests” a holiday to one or the other disputant. [...]Hearst’s belief about journalism:The important thing for a newspaper to do in making circulation is to getexcited when the public gets excited. People will buy any paper which seems toexpress their feelings in addition to printing the facts.... Why, then [asks Winkler], is he not the uncrowned King of America, a truly greatleader? Because the average American citizen distrusts his motives. The averagecitizen is willing to be amused or entertained by him but has no confidence inHearst’s intellectual sincerity. That is why he is one of the most melancholyfigures of our time. Hearst has a thousand readers to one follower. The readersenjoy his comics, his high-pressure editorials, his provocative pictures, butthey have deep distrust of his motives. They no longer follow the shifting windsof his fancy. [...]Hearst does not allow his papers to have his biography in their “morgue.”“Newspaper work is the best line of work that I know of,” says Hearst. “If I hadmy life to live over again, I would be a newspaper man, and merely try to be abetter one.”If he had his life to live over, one wonders if Hearst would tread the samepath. Would his motto again be: “Capture the crowd at any cost”? Or would heelect to employ his astonishing talent to ennoble, to spiritualize the crowd? Noone can tell.This book lists (1928): Twenty-seven Hearst newspapers, nine magazines inAmerica and three in England, one book publishing corporation, eight film andnews services. UndatedWatch out for Roark being too heroic and always right too easily. (Inparticular, in scene with building he saves, Chapter V.)For Roark-Holcombe. Roark asks him why one must copy the Parthenon. Holcombeanswers: “Not the Parthenon. You’re quite right, Saint Peter’s Cathedral.”FOR DOMINIQUEDisillusionment—sees through people and everything—and doesn’t like it.Fierce independence—nothing in such a world will hold her.Enjoys destruction and deliberate nastiness—her answer to life and the only wayto make it interesting.Has denied herself all desire or enthusiasm—because life can hold her throughthat and she will not give it such an opportunity.She has contempt for all ideals—because of the ideals that she has been taught(Christian brotherhood).FOR ROARK-DWIGHTWhen Roark is broke, before going to Connecticut, he does not hide the fact fromDwight at all; he has no inkling of the idea that he should keep up his prestigefor the sake of Dwight, who looks up to him. [Larry Dwight, a minor characterthat AR cut from the novel, was a draftsman whom Roark met while working forJohn Eric Snyte.] Undated[The following fragment is from an early draft of Part I. It describes HeddyAdler, a mistress of Roark’s who was later cut from the novel. Heddy isreminiscent of Jinx in the short story Good Copy (see The Early Ayn Rand). Sherepresents a type that AR liked, but never found a place for in her novels. ]She was utterly incapable of two things: of lying and of denying herself adesire; she did not quite grasp the possibility of either process. It was justas plausible to her to push her way through a crowd [to see] a steam shovel asit would have been [to see] a royal coronation; she would have enjoyed either.She had been spoiled and sheltered, accustomed to seeing her every wish granted;she had emerged from it completely sure of herself, neither arrogant noroffensive, but irresistible in the bright, innocent self-assurance of a personwho had been spared all contact with pain. She acted as one would act if thiswere a dream world and life contained nothing to make lightness feel guilty andmen were free to give beauty and significance to the insignificant gestures oftheir every moment. She was completely real in being unreal. [...]She was not afraid of Roark and she did not question the things she could notunderstand in him. She had not expected that she would love him, but she neverneeded reasons or explanations for the unexpected. He was not exactly like otherpeople; she neither approved of it nor condemned it; she took it for granted;she never thought of resenting it, she was too avidly curious; and one universaltrait had passed her by entirely; it never occurred to her, upon meetinganything strange and different, that that strangeness and difference were to betaken as some deep personal insult to her. She did not doubt herself; she had nocompulsion to doubt others. [...] UndatedTO DO:When Part I is finished—go over it and make separate schedules for thedevelopment of Roark, Cameron, Keating, Toohey, Wynand, Dominique, Katie.(Minor: check on Vesta, Heller, Francon, Mrs. Keating.)Where and how much is given of Roark’s architectural philosophy? How much isnecessary?More important—and watch this for schedule: Roark’s philosophy of life.How about the mind versus the emotions? How much of that can or should beincluded? Where? In what form?Roark’s egotism versus Keating’s egotism? Where to stress and explain this?068 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_068_r1.jpg]Remember: “Form follows function”—in the writing and planning.(Enough of the glorification of the people as “natural” and “true.” Show whatthe people are.)

Wynand on a world cruise. Alvah Scarret.February 18, 1940[AR critiques her first draft of Part I.][The Chapter I scene in] Roark’s room: Is it necessary at all? If so—do better,put in more character.CHAPTER I: Roark planted too soon—too much of him given—too obviously heroic—theauthor’s sympathy too clear. (?) Don’t like Roark’s outbreak with Dean—can betreated differently. Don’t dialogue thoughts—narrate them (such as the Dean’sand Mrs. Keating’s). Roark changing his drawing—too much detail. (?) In thisfirst chapter—plant Roark: ornament—that his buildings are not modernisticboxes?CHAPTER II: Change Mrs. Keating’s approach to a subtler and meaner one—like theone she uses later about Katie. Give one speech on Keating’s attitude aboutarchitectural convictions. (?) CHAPTER III: Miss Bisbee—unnecessary? Too longabout Francon’s office—can be cut. Cameron’s biography should be gone over—someawkward passages. Cameron’s criticism of Roark’s drawings—don’t like it.CHAPTER IV: Details about Tim Davis—unnecessary. Make it shorter. Roark’s lifeand his tenement room—can be done better, simpler, there’s a little too obviousan effect there. Cameron giving Roark a raise—too much niceness. (?) Don’t haveCameron dropping his head on his arms.CHAPTER V: Roark looking for the “stamp” on faces—should be planted earlier andseparately and more importantly. Omit incident with faked plans—too much and toodetailed. Change it to narrative of Davis simply becoming useless, being crowdedout—and never knowing how it was done and Keating remaining his best friend andeven giving him a job and boasting of this “good deed.” Don’t like all ofincident with Roark fixing building—too long—technically dishonest—and Roark tooable. Cameron’s struggle against contractor unnecessary—reserve that for Roark’sfuture. [AR cut this last scene—it has been reprinted in The Early Ayn Rand.]CHAPTER VI: First reference to the Wynand papers should be separate and moreimportant. On Vesta’s first resentment [of Roark]—here is the place to put theother side of her character—the “social” one.The Dunlop incident—couldn’t it be cut? Important psychologically and as exampleof Keating’s methods—but perhaps too detailed for a mere incident. Keating’sfirst job of designing—shorter and clearer. Roark’s corrections—all the detailsor none. Narrative would be better than dialogue. The Cameron sequence fromAusten Heller to flashback and back again is bad. Put flashback and [summary] ofpast year first, then on to Heller and the Wynand papers. This is the place forthe first mention of the Wynand papers.CHAPTER VII: Better last paragraph of office closing sequence—more emphasis fordrawing on the wall. In resume of Keating’s rise—stress more (and most) thesecond-handedness: his worrying about people’s admiration for him and people’senvy, his comparing his achievements with others, his “good deeds”—and boastingof them. Mrs. Keating’s arrival not very well worded. Also—the transition toKatie.CHAPTER VIII: Cut some of Keating’s cruder insults to Roark. Keating must bemuch subtler in this. More about Mike—show why Roark likes him and why Roarkwould like him immediately.CHAPTER IX: Shorter on Roark’s looking for a job. No need for single incidents;they can all be blended into one narrative—all except Prescott.CHAPTER X: Lead up into the strike—simpler and more authentic.CHAPTER XI: Better and clearer summary of Roark’s six months with Snyte.CHAPTER XII: Cut out Heller’s thoughts on men’s interdependence. Much too early.Leave just the friendship angle—the unselfish devotion. Don’t like Roark’s talkon architecture—give it better build-up, lead into it better, and also betterwording and more original thoughts and expressions. Heller’s biography—verylast. More pointed and fresher.CHAPTER XIV: Cut out Heddy entirely. I don’t think that Roark needs anotherlove. Cut out Sanboms—too detailed for this part of the book—not detailed enoughin itself. Perhaps cut Fargo Store—another way of covering this period has to befound.CHAPTER XV: Cut out Heddy. Cut out Holcombe incident—or put in another one likeit instead.CHAPTER XVI: In conversation with Mike—plant that Roark does not want awhite-collar job. Control the obvious, pointless exaggerations in thedescription of the movie furor.069 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_069_r1.jpg]About first part in general:Do not dialogue thoughts. Control adjectives—cut the weakening ones. Do not useadjectives unless they are different and illuminating. Don’t go intoover-detailed analyses of psychology—unless it’s something new and illuminatingto say. Don’t give any details whatever—in sentences or thoughts—unless you havesomething new to say.Stress the second-handedness whenever possible, particularly in Keating, but adifferent facet of it each time. Cut out episodes that do not bear on thattheme. The book is not about architecture, it’s about Roark against the worldand about the workings of that thing in the world which opposes him. Give onlyenough pure architecture to make the background real. But only as a background.Eliminate bromides or convenient colloquial expressions ready-made, even inplaces that are mere transitions, such as “and it made film history,” “round ofnightclubs,” etc.Undated[For the scene by the granite quarry, when Roark and Dominique speak for thefirst time.]Estrangement—antagonism.Her putting him in his place as a worker.Her directness and defiant wit.His mockery in his quiet acceptance of the position she is imposing upon him—andwhen she attempts (faintly) to bring in the personal, it is he who refuses,sticking to the “Yes, Miss Francon” attitude of a respectful worker.[Roark:] “You want me and I know it and I’ll make it vile, to show you theenormity of your desire, because you’ll want me still. I’m obedient to you now,I’m nothing before you—and it won’t change things. I’ll crush you in spite ofit, because of it, when the time comes.”[Dominique:] “I have you in my power. I’ll torture you. I enjoy it. I want youto know that. I enjoy debasing you, because I’m debasing myself through it,because you’ll conquer me some day—I want it—I hate you and I’ll punish you forit.”All this on what appears as a discussion of his living conditions and herinterest in the workers.“You’re boasting.” “No, but ... it changes so little.” “In what?” “In yourinterest in workers. In the future. There are so many unchangeable things.” February 21, 1940Toohey [promotes] Keating—because he knows that Keating did not design theCosmo-Slotnick building.Toohey writes a profound article on Keating’s work, and tests Keating by askinghim if he did mean all those things, knowing quite well that he, Toohey, hasmade them up. Keating agrees that he did—and Toohey is happy. Keating isn’tquite sure whether he did mean all that or not and is not sure whether Tooheyknows it or not, but is very sure that Toohey is pleased. (These touches inToohey must be very subtle, vague and rare—only as a hint, particularly atfirst. Most of Toohey must seem to be very authentic, noble and “humanitarian.”)Toohey builds Keating up in print. Gives him commissions. Organizes the “YouthClub” of the A.G.A. with Keating as head. He controls the architecturalprofession through Keating. Disgrace to young sculptor on one of the buildings.(When Toohey switches to modernism, “Youth Club” switches with him.) The“youth”—and Keating—want to be “deep,” learn nothing, are glad to have it givento them by Toohey. He drives Keating into complete spiritual dependence uponhim. He inflates Keating with false, empty values—knowing they are empty,knowing that Keating will feel the emptiness without understanding it—and will,therefore, be ruined for any values. The emptier he is, the more Keating willneed Toohey.Toohey alone among his associates guesses at Wynand’s real nature—at least tothe extent of knowing that Wynand is not a mob-man at heart. Toohey, contrary tothe dictates of his usual clever diplomacy, tries very hard to appear as a heroand a “man of integrity” before Wynand. Wynand ignores him completely, neverconsiders him worth breaking. This makes Toohey furious—relegating him to thekind of man he knows himself to be. February 22, 1940Part II must show Keating at his height, enjoying himself immensely (his idea ofenjoyment, and the essential meaninglessness of it)—and plant the first seedsfor his later downfall (mainly through Toohey getting hold of his spirit,because of the emptiness of that spirit). February 24, 1940Toohey’s [purpose is] to ruin the strong, the single, the original, the healthy,the joyous—with the weapon of “other people,” of humanitarianism. To excuse allsins in kindness—and thereby to destroy all virtue. To kill happiness—in orderto have slaves. No man is dangerous to him-except the happy man. He exists likea maggot—on wounds and sores. UndatedToohey’s greatest enemy—independence of spirit.The first result of [independence] is great creation.Toohey destroys all independence in people and all great achievement.For the first: independence causes happiness. Toohey is out to destroy anddiscredit—philosophically and practically—all happiness. Unhappy people look fora yoke—and they come to him.For the second: To discredit great achievement, he sets up standards which areeasy for the phonies. Hence—Toohey and Gertrude Stein, Walt Disney, andFerdinand the Bull. [Gertrude Stein seems to have been the model for thecharacter Lois Cook, whose first name was originally Gertrude.]For the first: Catherine, Peter, Dominique, Dick Sanborn, attempt (later) atWynand. (Also Vesta.) [This is the last mention of Vesta Dunning in AR’s notes.]For the second: Roark, sculptor, young writer, Heller, Peter as architect, deathnotice on Cameron.The author of Ferdinand the Bull made into a “philosopher” by Toohey, as againstthe young writer. February 28, 1940For Gertrude [Lois Cook]: deliberate sloppiness—as careful as grooming—and forthe same purpose.Toohey’s behavior after the assassination attempt—“theatrical only in toocomplete an absence of anything theatrical.” Toohey is on his way to some“humanitarian lecture.”ADVANCE QUESTIONS FOR PART IIChange which Roark would not make and which ruined contractor?

April 22, 1940[For Kiki Holcombe’s party, where Dominique discovers that Roark is thearchitect who designed the Enright House.]What do I wish to show by the party (besides the meeting of Roark andDominique)? Second-handedness. What kind? The social kind. Which is?A desperate desire to make an impression on others. They are not there to seebut to be seen. Each wants to dominate the other and will crawl, lick feet, andmake a fool of himself for that domination. They cannot talk shop. They cannotraise controversial subjects. Don’t antagonize—above all. You’ve got to pleasethem all. Don’t mention what you’re really interested in; it makes you tooimportant. You gain importance here by being unimportant—in inverse ratio.Others are not interested in you as your own self; you offend them by presumingthat they are. Become only a mirror for them, while they’re trying to be amirror for you. The vicious circle. Toohey as the one to start the circlerolling, because he [provides] a direction compatible with all those people’shidden aims. They all want importance—they can find it only in others. They wantto be invited in order to get work in order to be invited here. (Use people tomake money to use to impress people with.) There are no values—that is why theycling so desperately to people.I show this by (?):Attitude toward Howard Roark. (“The Enright House is almost as good as theCosmo-Slotnick Building.” “He will be another Peter Keating.”) They know nothingabout his work and are nothing. They are interested in: the cost of the EnrightHouse, how did he get the commission from Enright, is he related to the Roarksof Schetwick? Don’t give a person reality by inquiring into his ideas, i.e.,into what he is. Detract from his importance by confining your interest to otherpeople around him: tie him to family, acquaintances, bosses.The conversations are about facts, not thoughts or opinions. Thoughts andopinions give personality to the one expressing them and require personality tobe expressed. Facts are impersonal. They want it kept impersonal, becausepersonality is dangerous. Or—they express opinions that are so bromidic as to bepublic property and safe. Resentment if anyone takes it out of that class. (Onthe one hand, things must be impersonal. On the other—utterly personal, that is,they want everybody to agree with them, because what is personal to them is tiedirrevocably to others. They have no personality apart from others—so others mustnot have it either.)Toohey’s social technique: he insults the person, but includes himself in beinginsulted, points out a real weakness, but excuses it. 1940[With one third of the manuscript completed, AR began to submit The Fountainheadto prospective publishers. She wrote a synopsis, apparently intended to be sentwith the manuscript, which contains a surprising idea for the climax. There isno evidence that this synopsis was ever sent to a publisher, and no othermention of the idea in AR’s notes. Many years later, she remembered hesitatingover her original idea for the climax (the dynamiting of Cortlandt Homes). Shewas concerned that it might be difficult to make it “plausible objectively” whyRoark would be justified in such dynamiting. It may have been this doubt thatprompted her to consider—perhaps only for a single day—an alternative climax.]Toohey has risen to a position of great power in society. He is the undeclareddictator of the intellectual and cultural life of the country. He has“collectivized” all the arts with his various “organizations,” and he allows noprominence to anyone save to mediocrities of his choice, such as Keating, LoisCook, and others of the same quality. He has to stop Roark. And when events cometo a point where he can destroy Roark’s career once more, it is Dominique whocomes to Roark’s assistance. She has learned a great deal from her strangemarriage to Wynand. Dominique kills Toohey. It is more than a murder—it is thedestruction of everything Toohey stood for. Roark takes the murder uponhimself—the circumstances are such that either one of them can be accused andRoark forces her to remain silent; she agrees, but only until the outcome of thetrial—she will speak if he is convicted.This, then, is the sensational trial—Roark against society. There is a greatdeal of public indignation at the murder of a “humanitarian” and a “saint” suchas Toohey. Wynand alone tries to stand by Roark—but public clamor forces him tobetray Roark, to reverse the policy of his papers and demand Roark’s conviction(see character outline). During the trial, the affair between Roark andDominique is made public (though not her part in the murder).Roark is acquitted—through the efforts of Austen Heller and his other loyalfollowers. Wynand is forced to divorce Dominique—his prestige with hisrespectable “Ladies’ Club-home-church-family” audience demands it. He betraysand loses the only two human beings who had ever meant anything to him.All his life, Wynand has dreamed of erecting a “Wynand Building” to house hisnewspapers, a monument to his achievement. Now, left alone and broken in spirit,his journalistic empire tottering, knowing that this empire will not survivehim, Wynand makes one last gesture. He decides to erect the Wynand Building ashis swan song. And he gives the commission to Roark. He barely speaks to Roarknow, he wants no personal contact, no feeling between them; he gives theassignment to Roark in a short, blunt, business-like interview, in cold,impersonal words. And only when Roark accepts and turns to leave the office,does Wynand add: “Build it as a monument to that spirit which is yours—and couldhave been mine.”When Dominique is freed of all ties to Wynand and comes back to Roark, never toleave him again, she finds him at the construction site of the Wynand Building,where the skeleton of Roark’s greatest achievement is beginning to rise into thesky.[One can guess the reasons why AR quickly rejected the idea of Dominiquemurdering Toohey. First, the climactic action is taken by a secondary characterrather than the hero. Second, such a climax would undercut the novel’s theme byimplying that Roark must be saved by a lesser character acting on the“malevolent universe” premise. Since Roark is the ideal, both morally andpractically, his victory must result from his premises and his actions.] December II, 1941For Toohey-Dominique: “Don’t fool yourself. You’re not a bitch—you’re a saint,which is much worse.” A saint can’t help but turn into a destructive, viciousmonster like Dominique in the world as it is-consequently down with the saints,they make the world much too uncomfortable by seeing it too clearly.071 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_071_r1.jpg]For Roark-Dominique: His love for her declared for the first time when sheleaves him—after she tells him that she’s married. “I won’t tell you that it’sunselfish love—it’s much greater because it’s selfish, because it’s my need.”Power over another person is clean only when you can be proud of the person thatyou have in your power—perhaps love is the only place to know and exercisepower. “You have much to learn—yourself—I can’t help you.” “Not until you comeback, of your own will, completely, forever, and on your knees.” December 17, 1941[On this date, AR made her final chapter outline for the second half of Part II(she seems to have written up to Chapter VIII). She had recently contracted withBobbs-Merrill to complete the novel by January 1, 1943.] December 31, 1941For Roark: “The first man entering a fresh, clean world for the first time.”1942 [The following notes pertain to the description of Gail Wynand’s background inChapter I, Part III.]GAIL WYNANDGun—indifference.His day.

The first two quotations below were copiedinto her journal and may have been intended for Parts I and II; the last wasplaced after the title page to Part IV.]Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for the noble manto understand: he will be tempted to deny it, where another kind of man thinkshe sees it self-evidently. The problem for him is to represent to his mindbeings who seek to arouse a good opinion of themselves which they do notpossess—and consequently also do not “deserve”—and who yet believe in this goodopinion afterwards. Ye preachers of equality, the tyrant-frenzy of impotence crieth thus in you for“equality”: your most secret tyrant-longings disguise themselves thus in virtuewords! But from time to time do ye grant me—one glimpse, grant me but one glimpse only,of something perfect, fully realized, happy, mighty, triumphant, of somethingthat still gives cause for fear! A glimpse of man that justifies the existenceof man, a glimpse of an incarnate human happiness that realizes and redeems, forthe sake of which one may hold fast to the belief in man!Undated[Regarding Roark:]A whole life lived on a certain principle. The highlights of that life. Thequality of that life, proceeding from that principle—with the result ofgrandeur, heroism, beauty, pride, honor, truth, joy. Not for anyone, but initself, in the man—and secondarily in those he touches and in his benefit tosociety—only secondarily and precisely because of the first, because of hisdisregard for society.

It is the conflict of these two principles in theirfundamental aspect.As a consequence, it is also a definition of what constitutes selfishness and adefense of selfishness in its true spiritual sense.The four men, after whom the four parts of the novel are named, present fourdifferent attitudes toward these two basic, irreconcilable principles.Howard Roark, the hero of the novel, is a man utterly devoid of the collectivesense. He is not an enemy of mankind, but much more than that: he is spirituallyunconscious of the existence of other men. Basically, life is consciousness; tolive means to think; the fundamental process which constitutes life itself isthe process of thought; thought is the creator of all values; the practicalapplication of thought is man’s work, his labor, his creative activity—and alllabor is a creative activity to some degree. In these two realms—his thought andhis labor—Roark is utterly independent of all other men. He faces life as if hewere the first man born. Nothing stands between the evidence of his senses andthe conclusions his mind draws from them. He does not even reject the conceptionof: “I must believe this because others believe it”—he goes much beyondrejection: he simply is unable to understand the possibility of such aconception. An entity such as “others” does not exist in the roots of hisconsciousness. Thus, the aim of his life-and his desires in life—lie within himalone.He is an architect. He builds as he wishes to build, as he considers right tobuild. He is true to his own truth—he knows no other. Tradition and custom—whatothers have done before him or what others wish him to do now—have absolutely nomeaning for him. He is a first motive, a prime mover, a creator of values, acreator in the only possible sense of the word. He is the life-giving principleitself, personified in a man. His work is his only reality and his only greatpassion. His happiness depends on nothing but his own achievement. And he finds,in that achievement, a sensation beyond happiness, a sensation for which theword ecstasy is inadequate, a sensation which is a reason in itself, whichjustifies all existence: Man at the highest possible to him.His valuation of himself depends on nothing but the concrete reality of hisachievement. He is good if he is convinced that his work is good. What othersthink of it or of him does not matter. His happiness, his pride, the motivepower of his will to live concern no one but himself and depend on no one else.Of course, he needs other men; but that need is secondary, not primary. As anarchitect, he needs clients; he needs people to live in the buildings hedesigns; but the difference is this: he needs clients in order to build; he doesnot build in order to have clients; while creating, he is essentially alone; thecreation is the end, people are the means, a secondary means; he does notachieve through other men nor for other men; he achieves through and for himselfalone, then offers it to others.Thus, spiritually he is a paragon of selfishness. And his life presents astrange paradox: outwardly, his life follows the course conventionallyconsidered as that of an unselfish man; he sacrifices everything to hisconvictions, to the integrity of his work; he is not concerned with wealth,fame, admiration or physical comfort; he lives in poverty; he is a martyr to anideal. Thus the devotion to an ideal, the noblest feeling possible to man, isalso the most selfish.The second paradox is in Roark’s relations to other men. Basically, he needsnothing from them; so he demands nothing of them. And thus, when he is a friend,he is the only true friend those around him possess. He does not love all menabstractly and indiscriminately. His love, as everything else he experiences,has to have a basis in his own reason. Men have to earn his love. And what herespects and appreciates in men is the same kind of spiritual independence ashis own. But when he likes a man, he likes him for that man’s own sake; not forwhat he, Roark, can get from that man, not for what that man can give him. Hislove is respect for the other man’s own value—apart from himself, apart from anyrelation to himself. Thus his attitude towards other men is completelyselfless—in the only noble and benevolent meaning of that word. He will notsacrifice himself for others; neither will he sacrifice them for himself. Hewill not let others enslave him; neither will he enslave them. He does not existfor the sake of others; neither does he expect them to exist for his sake.Having no fundamental need for other men, he can have no motive for bearing illwill towards them; and more than that: he bears towards them the only good willof any real meaning—the recognition of their own independent value. Such isHoward Roark.The second man of the novel, Peter Keating, is—basically—the utterly selflessman. His spirit is an empty space which other men have to fill. In himselfalone, he has nothing to offer—to himself or to the world. He cannot exist, savethrough others. His consuming ambition is to be great—in other people’s eyes.Thus, at the root of his spirit, others take precedence over his own self.Others establish all his values. Others become the motive power of his will tolive. He is an architect. He builds as his clients wish him to build. His workis not an end in itself; it is the means to satisfy other men and to obtain fromthem in return the one gift he needs so desperately—the gift of their approvaland their admiration. He has no convictions of any kind about his work; it isgood if others like it; he has never stated to himself a code of right or wrongin relation to his creative activity; to him, right is that which other peopleconsider right, wrong is that which they consider wrong. In his own mind, hedoes not even ask for the reasons upon which others have based these valuations;to him, the judgment of others is sufficient reason as such. He finds nohappiness in his own work; his happiness comes second-hand, through the reactionof others to his work.He achieves the first great triumph of his career when he wins an importantcompetition with a building which he claims to have designed, but which wasactually designed by Roark, though no one knows this save Keating and Roark;Keating is happy in the general admiration, even though he knows that he doesn’tdeserve it; he is happy in the fact that millions of men consider him a greatarchitect, even though he himself knows that the achievement they admire is nothis. If Roark were given the choice of being great in all eyes save his own orof being great in his own knowledge, with all other men ignorant of hisgreatness—he would choose the last. Peter Keating chooses the first. Thus, toKeating, all reality is second-hand-through others, by others, for others. Fame,above all else, is his greatest desire; the admiration of others for his personis his greatest need. His life is an eternal concern with what others willthink, what others will say, how others will react to him.Outwardly his life follows a course conventionally considered as that of aselfish man. He is not one to sacrifice for an ideal—he has no ideal. Hestruggles for fame, admiration, prominence, money. He has no scruples in thestruggle and he does not hesitate to sacrifice other men who stand in his way.But, fundamentally, he does all this for the spiritual sake of others—or,rather, for the satisfaction of his own spirit which depends on others socompletely. He needs the fame and the admiration in order to have the judgmentof others grant him his own value; he needs the money in order to impress otherswith a tangible evidence of his value; he needs the prominence in order toestablish his superiority over others. The quest for superiority is hisobsession; it is touched with hysteria; it is the most sensitive spot in hissoul. Since he has no objective, independent standard by which to establish hisown dignity, his pride and his self-respect, he can establish them only bycomparison. He is a success to the extent to which others have failed; he isgreat to the extent of his ability to surpass others. His selfless greatnessconsists essentially of the degradation of his brother men.And this is the paradox in Keating’s relations to men: basically, he iscompletely dependent upon them; thus he is forced to demand a great deal fromthem; selfless in spirit, he makes other men his victims, he sacrifices them tohis own emptiness, to fill his own void. His success does not depend upon theintrinsic value of his own work; his success is to be obtained through and fromother men; thus he has to fight men, to cheat them, to force one man afteranother from a position he desires; he has nothing to fight with, save hisability to outwit and outmaneuver other men; each man is his natural enemy. Thespiritual independence of another man is the greatest threat to him; being onlya mirror that reflects others, he expects others to be only a mirror for him. Aman unconcerned with the person of Peter Keating is an enemy; for within thatman, Peter Keating is dead; and Peter Keating has no life save within otherpeople’s minds. To exist he must force the consciousness of his existence uponthem. He spends his life cultivating friendships—and he is no friend to anyone.Spiritually enslaved, he carries the principle of slavery to all those aroundhim. He is a man without a soul, who has never felt the need of a soul. When hebegins to understand the truth about himself—it is too late.Gail Wynand, the third man of the novel, is a man who sold his soul. Independentin spirit, with a potentiality for greatness such as Roark‘s, he choosesdeliberately to betray his own self. Fundamentally, he does not need other menin that deep, primary, personal sense in which Keating needs them. But insteadof keeping himself apart spiritually, Wynand chooses to seek power over men. Hisconception of greatness is not in following other men, not in being admired bythem, like Keating, but in ruling them.A man of brilliant intellect, of great daring and imagination, starting lifefrom the abject poverty of a slum childhood, he rises to become a greatpublisher, head of a journalistic empire. He achieves his success by givingpeople what they want; nothing is too low or too sensational for his newspapersto exploit; he plays upon men’s worst instincts; he develops an unerring senseof public opinion, and the policy of his newspapers is to follow it faithfully.He does not allow himself the luxury ever to express an editorial judgment ofhis own; his editorials say what he knows his readers want him to say. Thedifference between him and Keating on this point is that Keating would haveaccepted, in his own mind, this judgment of his readers as final and valid;Wynand does not accept it; Wynand despises his readers and all humanity; butWynand thinks that power over men is his best defense against them. His onlyrelief from men is his love for great art, which he understands and appreciates.In his innermost consciousness, Wynand is free; but he does not possess Roark’ssingle-minded consistency; he does not carry his spiritual reality into action;Roark is too selfish to feel the need of imposing himself upon others in anyway; Wynand is selfless enough to need power. In acquiring power over others, heloses his own freedom; he has no outlet for his own convictions, no way totranslate them into reality. Potentially a prime-mover like Roark, i.e., a manwho thinks and feels through his own mind, he denies himself the possibility ofan idea to follow. But the need of such an ideal is deep within him. And thisneed, frustrated, turns into an active hatred of all ideals. Keating does notunderstand the conception of idealism; Wynand understands it too well. The moresuccessful he becomes in his career, the greater his impulse to destroy inothers that which he himself has missed, that which he has sacrificed to them.The only personal pleasure he finds in life is a sadistic delight in breakingthe integrity of other men. He will pay any price to force a writer of radicalsympathies into becoming a champion of conservatism, or vice versa. Thecommercial careerist holds no interest for him. It is only men in whom he sensesa sincere, profound devotion to their convictions that he chooses for hisvictims. He wrecks lives on his way, he drives some to suicide. He believes thathe is merely proving to himself the triviality of all human idealism. Hebelieves that he is prompted by contempt for human integrity. He cannot allowhimself to realize that he is prompted by a great love of integrity, that hetries to destroy it in order to prove to himself that it does not exist, that hehas not missed much—knowing only too well that it does exist and that he hasmissed more than he dares admit to himself.He has never allowed himself a complete, profound, personal desire of his own.But, at the climax of his life, an overwhelming personal issue forces him to puthis power over men to an actual test. He attempts, for once, to sway the publicopinion which he thought he controlled. He attempts to use his newspapers tochampion an unpopular cause crucially important to him. He finds himselfhelpless. Public opinion will not follow him. Men are deaf to his commands andto his pleas—men who have never been given cause to respect him. He sees, forthe first time, that he has no power over men, but has surrendered himself intotheir power instead, that he does not rule, but is ruled, that he has been afigure-head sitting on a throne which they had created and which he could occupyonly so long as he pleased them, that he is the creation of his own slaves, thathe is the puppet and they hold the strings, that his life and his power havebeen second-hand. And the monster he helped to feed is now unleashed againsthim: the voice of other men, the pressure of public opinion force him to betrayhis own cause, to reverse the policy of his papers in obedience to the generaldesire and against his first and only ideal.Ellsworth M. Toohey, the fourth man, is a creature of perfection in his ownkind, just as Roark is a creature of perfection in his—and the completeantithesis of Roark. Toohey is successful at the evil of which Keating andWynand are victims. Toohey is the paragon of spiritual “second-handedness.”Basically, Toohey is non-creative. He has nothing of his own to offer—to himselfor to others. His evil lies in [the fact] that he knows it, accepts it andglories in it. He begins where Keating and Wynand ended. Keating soughtsuperiority after his own fashion; he wished for good, even though hisconception of good was false; when he discovered the basic lie of his life, whenhe saw that he had been neither superior nor good—the discovery brought himspiritual ruin. Wynand sought power as a means of independence; when hediscovered the true nature of his power—he was ended spiritually. Toohey beganby seeing and accepting what these two could not accept; he knew himself to beincapable of intrinsic superiority or independence; he made of this his virtue;he dedicated himself to the destruction of all superiority and all independence.He accepted consciously the negation of all values, of all ideals, of all thatis high and noble in man—with a full realization of the meaning of such values.Not in frustrated longing for an ideal, but in cold and deliberate hatred of allintegrity. He chose to be consciously evil. He is the great Nihilist of thespirit.Toohey understands human greatness and the motive-power of human greatnessbetter than any other man in the story. Roark is great, but too unself consciousto analyze or understand it—for a long time. Keating and Wynand seek greatnessblindly. Toohey knows its roots. He understands fully the basic antithesis, thetwo principles fighting within human consciousness—the individual and thecollective, the one and the many, the “I” and the “They.” He knows that thesource of all greatness, of all that is free, creative, forward-moving,and—ultimately—benevolent to all men is a man’s basic independence of spirit,his integrity of thought untouched, fundamentally, by any concern for others. Heknows that the source of all evil and all sorrow, of all frustration and alllies is the collective sense, the intrusion of others into the basic motives ofa man. And since he is dedicated to the destruction of greatness, he becomes theenemy of the individual and the great champion of collectivism.Toohey knows that each man must be judged by what he has achieved through thecreative labor of his own mind, not by what he has or has not done for others;that his creation is the greatest gift he can bring to others, such as thecreations of all great thinkers, artists, and scientists, creations madepossible not because of their brothers, but in spite of the opposition of theirbrothers, made possible only by the profoundly selfish integrity of the spiritof the great creators. Toohey knows that a man’s achievement is the only measureof his value and of his superiority. And Toohey knows that in such a competitionhe has no chance at superiority; he is basically sterile; he has no greatpassion for anything and no great interest in anything save other men. Thus hedecides not to attempt to seek superiority, but to do better: to destroy itsvery conception. He cannot rise. He can pull others down. He cannot reach theheights. He can raze them. Equality becomes his greatest passion.His life program is simple: to destroy men by tying them to one another; topreach self-sacrifice, self-denial, self-abasement; to preach the spiritualslavery of each man to all other men; to fight the great creator andliberator—Man’s Ego. Toohey is famous as “The Humanitarian.”Any form of personal happiness is a form of freedom. To destroy men he mustdestroy their joy in living; to destroy their joy in living he must destroy allthat is personally dear and important to them. Such is his first instinct inrelation to any human being he meets. He wrecks the life of his niece,Catherine, by destroying the only important thing of her existence—her love forPeter Keating. He destroys Keating by killing such self-respect as Keating didpossess. He attempts to destroy Dominique Francon, the heroine of the story(more about her later), by encouraging her perverse desire to resist alldesires. He has no personal concern for Keating, Catherine, or Dominique; it isonly their inner selves which he wishes to annihilate. Men who are happy livefor themselves; Toohey cannot allow men to live for themselves; unhappy men turnto others for consolation, attempt to fill the emptiness of their failure byexisting for the sake of others; and this is the state to which Toohey wishesthem reduced. “Let all live for all. Let all sacrifice and none profit. Let allsuffer and none enjoy. Let progress stop. Let all stagnate. There is equality instagnation.” Such is Toohey’s secret motto. And it is the more frightening sincehe truly seeks nothing for himself. He does not wish to subjugate men to his ownwill. He wishes to subjugate all to the will of all. Which means—to the will ofnone. Universal slavery—without even the dignity of a master. Slavery toslavery. A great circle and an utter equality. Such is Ellsworth M. Toohey.His chief weapon is mockery. A great, all-embracing nihilistic ridicule. Allownothing to remain sacred in a man’s soul. Earnestness towards any conceptionwhatever, the mere conception of earnestness itself, is the base of reverence.Allow nothing to be important to a man’s spirit. Laugh it out of existence.Laughter, not as joy, but as destruction. Fight ideals, not by denial, but byinternal corruption. Toohey is wiser than Wynand; Wynand tried to destroyintegrity by crude force from without, which merely tore that integrity, intact,out of a man’s soul. Toohey is subtler and deadlier: he makes integrity rotslowly within that soul. He uses a man’s integrity against itself; he makes itbecome loyalty to principles basically destructive of all integrity. He destroysidealism in men, not by denying it, not by preaching the vanity of all ideals,but in precisely the opposite manner: by professing the great value and glory ofidealism in men and then directing their idealism toward objects basicallydestructive of all ideals. Thus, he holds out unselfishness as the supreme goalof the spirit; thus he holds out brother-love as the sublime virtue. He does notdeny the conception of superiority among men, but destroys it by glorifying theworthless as superior. Thus, fully recognizing the genius of Roark, he holds himup to ridicule; fully recognizing the mediocrity of Keating, he hails him as agreat architect. An art critic by profession, Toohey manages to reach into everyfield of creative endeavor; and in every field he enshrines mediocrity—in orderto destroy all shrines. Keating in architecture; Lois Cook in literature—a phony“modernist” who writes “words on words,” “words above meaning” and thus destroysboth words and meaning; in painting—a creator of the pork-chop-fur-lined-tea-cupschool; and so on. Do not fight human achievement in the open. Destroy it fromwithin. Destroy by internal corruption. Destroy the rare, the difficult, theexceptional, the original by substituting standards of achievement open to theabilities of any and all. That, also, is Ellsworth M. Toohey. That he is aCommunist in his political convictions is only incidental; he proclaims that hefights Rockefeller and Morgan; he really fights Shakespeare and Beethoven.Thus the four men of the story are: Howard Roark, who is great and knows it;Peter Keating, who could not be great and does not know it; Gail Wynand, whocould have been; and Ellsworth M. Toohey, who could never be and knows it.A few words about Dominique Francon and about the general course of the story.Dominique’s basic passion is a fierce love of independence. But it is anindependence that turns upon itself—in protest against the world she sees aroundher. Capable of great desire, she makes it her aim to desire nothing. Actually asaint, in that her subconscious demand is perfection—from herself and from allothers—she finds a vicious delight in lowering herself to whatever action sheconsiders most contemptible; since she cannot find perfection, she prefers itsopposite extreme to compromise. But such conscious self-degradation is only hermanner of a quest for the sublime. Her redemption is in that she never acceptsspiritually the vile depths to which she descends; she defies the depths bydescending.It is quite obviously inevitable that she should love Roark and that her lovefor him should be final, complete and immediate. It is a love too great to beendured in acceptance; she can bear it only by denying, by resisting it, bydegrading it, by trying to destroy it. Like most women, and to a greater degreethan most, she is a masochist and she wishes for the happiness of suffering atRoark’s hands. Sexually, Roark has a great deal of the sadist, and he findspleasure in breaking her will and her defiance. Yet he loves her, and this loveis the only passion for another human being in his whole life. And her love forhim is essentially worship, it becomes her religion, it becomes herreconciliation with life, with humanity and with herself—but not until manyyears later.Roark’s life is the simple, single-tracked pursuit of his onlygoat—architecture. It is the continuous struggle of his own truth against men.He experiences every hardship, every defeat, every agony that men can place inhis way. But it leaves him untouched—within. His conflict is with the outsideworld, not with himself. He never achieves universal recognition—which he neversought. But he wins the freedom to work as he believes, he fights through to thechance of creating great buildings. His buildings—not his love nor hiscompliance—are his gift to the world. And by ignoring men, he gives themcreations of great value. At the end of the story, we leave him at the height ofhis work and of his power. And in that work, he has found a height of happinessunknown to most men, he has made the world a better place by the fact of makingsuch happiness possible, by the fact of making it exist within his own soul—andthe realization of man’s capacity for ecstasy is the only reason for thisworld’s existence. Or so the author believes.Keating achieves the kind of success he seeks, early and easily. He wins greatpopular acclaim. But the emptiness and the uncertainty within him allow him nohappiness. He has never known peace with himself. Such joy as he finds in lifeis only a guilty, unhealthy, unsafe satisfaction. He has not the courage of hisown desires—and he passes up the only chance at happiness he had, his sincerelove for Catherine. His success goes as it came—through the whim of others. Hispopularity fades as that of all current fashions; undeserved from the first, hisfame dwindles and dies; he is replaced by other popular heroes of the same type.And it is only when people begin to desert him that he begins to question hisown soul, to realize dimly what it was that he missed, what it was that he hadalways envied, feared and resented in Roark. When he understands it, it is toolate. We leave him, a man without hope, without future, without past, a man whohad lived through others, had brought them nothing but sorrow and left themnothing but bad imitations of every bad building created before him.Toohey proceeds successfully on his chosen course of destroying all those whoselives touch his. He fails only with three human beings: Roark, Dominique, andWynand. Roark is the great, consuming hatred of his life, the symbol of all thathe must destroy. He is helpless before Roark; he cannot touch Roarkspiritually—and he knows it. So he marshals every social weapon he controls—tobreak Roark’s career. And Toohey holds a great power over society, carefullybuilt up through the years. But he fails. He cannot prevent Roark’s ultimatetriumph. In regard to Dominique, Toohey is one of the few who understand herreal nature. He goads her on to self-destruction. He helps to bring about hermarriage to Wynand—a marriage he hoped would destroy them both. He has a specialinterest in Wynand: he works slowly, through many years, to obtain editorialcontrol of the Wynand papers, on which he is employed as a specialcolumnist-commentator. He understands Wynand. He knows that Wynand’s bittercynicism is only a mask for the kind of spirit Toohey dreads; he knows thatWynand is not basically corrupt. He hopes to achieve that corruption throughDominique, whom he considers to be the worst possible influence that Wynandcould encounter. He fails in his calculations. At the end of the story, he losesthat particular battle by losing his position with the Wynand papers. Butanother great newspaper signs him up at once. Toohey, like time, marches on.Wynand’s retribution comes first in the person of Dominique, in that he fallsdesperately in love with her; desperately—because it is his first complete,sincere and personal emotion. When he marries her, he knows that she does notlove him, but he does not know that she loves Roark, that the marriage is onlyher way of defying and degrading her love for Roark, the bitterest way she couldfind. She chooses Wynand as the most completely vicious man she knows. She isdisappointed in this; she herself brings the first awakening of Wynand’sessential self. His love for her becomes the symbol of everything he has missedin life: an experience completely his own, to be guarded savagely against allother men, those other men whose public property he is.But it is Roark who is life’s final revenge upon Wynand. When [they] meet,Wynand is 54, Roark is 37. Wynand does not suspect that Dominique had beenRoark’s mistress, and his attitude toward Roark has no relation to Dominique.Instead of the usual hatred which men of Roark’s integrity had always aroused inhim, Wynand’s reaction is a great, irresistible, unformu lated wave ofrecognition and admiration. He does not understand or analyze it for a longtime. He knows only that he needs Roark in some odd, unaccountable manner.Slowly, through their strange relationship of unspoken understanding, Wynandbegins to realize that Roark is the symbol of everything he has betrayed; Roarkachieved what he had lacked the courage to achieve; Roark is his own self, as hemight have been; Roark is his revenge against society, against that mob whomRoark defies and to whom Wynand has surrendered. And although Roark is anexternal reproach to him, although the mere fact of Roark’s existence brings himthe first spiritual suffering he has ever allowed himself to experience—Roarkbecomes Wynand’s obsession. Wynand is actually in love with Roark. It is love inevery sense but the physical; its base is not in homosexuality; Wynand has neverhad any tendency in that direction. It is more hero-worship than love, and morereligion than hero-worship. Actually, it is Wynand’s tribute to his ownunrealized greatness. This love has no relation to his love for Dominique; it isnot faithlessness to Dominique; and yet, were he ever asked to choose betweenthe two, Wynand would have chosen Roark. Wynand welcomes the torture of loving aman whom he should hate. He finds a dim, twisted sense of atonement in his lovefor his worst spiritual enemy. He is punishing himself for what he has done—bybowing before what he should have done. It is his first acceptance of anideal—and his first suffering for its sake. Roark becomes the most preciousthing in his life.Roark’s attitude toward Wynand is a deep understanding; in a way—respect ; andthe only pity he has ever felt for any human being. As to Dominique, she seesthe situation, resents it and is frightened by it. To her, there is no otherreality and no other concern but Roark. She is jealous of Wynand, of any feelingRoark might have in response to Wynand’s adoration of him. It is a triangle—inwhich the husband and wife are both in love with the same man.It is when—through Toohey’s efforts—Roark becomes the center of a sensationalscandal and faces a trial involving a possible sentence of life-imprisonment,that Wynand attempts to defend Roark through the influence of his newspapers.Roark is the object of great public indignation. Wynand wants to defend him,more passionately than he would want to defend his own life. But he cannot fightthe monster of public opinion. He is forced to make his papers clamor forRoark’s conviction. He is forced to betray his first and only god.It is Wynand’s final tragedy. He faces the full understanding of his ownspiritual degradation and of that illusory power over men for the sake of whichhe had allowed his degradation. Roark is acquitted. In the circumstancessurrounding the trial, Wynand learns the truth about the past of Roark andDominique, and that they still love each other. He loses them both. He is forcedto divorce Dominique. He has nothing left but his newspaper empire, which he nowhates—with all its energy, spirit and prestige gone.Dominique comes back to Roark—completely, finally and voluntarily, understandingthrough him the meaning of life as he has lived it, as she is prepared to liveit for the first time.This, very generally and very roughly, is the story. December 13, 1943[Shortly after The Fountainhead’s publication, Warner Brothers bought the movierights. The following notes were made as AR began work on the screenplay. ]General Theme: Man’s integrity.Plot Theme: Howard Roark, an architect, a man of genius, originality andcomplete spiritual independence, holds the truth of his convictions above allthings in life. He fights against society for his creative freedom, he refusesto compromise in any way, he builds only as he believes, he will not submit toconventions, traditions, popular taste, money or fame. Dominique Francon, thewoman he loves, thinks that his fight is hopeless. Afraid that society will hurtand corrupt him, she tries to block his career in order to save him from certaindisaster. When the disaster comes and he faces public disgrace, she decides totake her revenge on the man responsible for it, Gail Wynand, a powerful, corruptnewspaper publisher. She marries Wynand, determined to break him. But Roarkrises slowly, in spite of every obstacle. When he finally meets Wynand inperson, Dominique is terrified to see that the two men love and understand eachother. Roark’s integrity reaches Wynand’s better self, Roark is the ideal whichWynand has betrayed in his ambition for power. Without intending it, Roarkachieves his own revenge—by becoming Wynand’s best friend. Dominique findsherself suffering in a strange triangle—jealous of her husband’s devotion to theman she loves. When Roark’s life and career are threatened in a final test, whenhe becomes the victim of public fury and has to stand trial, alone, hated,opposed and denounced by all—Wynand makes a supreme effort toward his ownredemption. He stands by Roark and defends him. Wynand loses, defeated andbroken by the corrupt machine he himself had created. But Roark wins without hishelp—wins by the power of his own truth. Roark is acquitted—and Dominique comesto him, free to find happiness with him, realizing that the battle is neverhopeless, that nothing can defeat man’s integrity. [Note that the movie’s plotis to focus on Roark, Wynand, and Dominique; Keating and Toohey are not evenmentioned.]074 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_074_r1.jpg]Specific theme, as presented in screenplay:Independence—as against obeying the wishes of others, as against the “social”spirit, which is: Keating, who tried to live by public polls; Wynand, who triedto use the mob; Toohey, who consciously used collectivism for the purpose ofgaining power and enslaving mankind.Therefore, Roark’s speech must summarize the above, give it a statement—the goodis not the social, but the individual, not the herd-instinct, but independence;to live for yourself or for others is an issue of the spirit, the choice betweenone’s own judgment and the surrender of one’s judgment, between integrity andmental prostitution. The form of a society will be the result of this basicissue. May 3, 1948[Almost five years later, Warner Brothers began to make the movie. Shortlybefore the start of principal photography, the director (King Vidor) asked AR towrite instructions for the scene in which, after Kiki Holcombe’s party,Dominique comes to Roark’s apartment. Patricia Neal, Vidor said, needed a betterunderstanding of Dominique’s psychology. The instructions helped; AR commentedlater that this was “the best acted scene in the movie.”]NOTES ON SCENE IN ROARK’S APARTMENTDominique’s PsychologyThis scene contains the entire progression of Roark’s and Dominique’s loveaffair in the book. Dominique’s part in the scene gives her a chance to showevery aspect of her character.Dominique’s basic attitude is the violent conflict between her passion for Roarkand her despair. The more she admires him, the more certain she is that he willbe destroyed. She is so hurt herself that she is driven to hurt him, but hercruelty to him is only an extreme expression of her love. We must be certainthat there is never a touch of feminine cattiness, vanity or malice inDominique’s performance. She defies Roark because she worships him. She defieshim for the pleasure of seeing him master her. Her real desire is always to seehim win.The different aspects of Dominique’s character and mood in the scene go in thisorder: Defiance—bitterness—sex—feminine helplessness.1. At the beginning of the scene, Dominique is coldly, arrogantly defiant. Thisis her way of paying Roark for the rape. Her attitude, in effect, is: Well, ifyou want to break me down, I will break down with a vengeance, I will go all theway—and it won’t do you any good. She is challenging him by overdoing hersurrender. To achieve this effect, she must read her lines coldly, arrogantly,with an undertone of bitter mockery. When she speaks of how much she loves himand how much she missed him, her voice must sound as if she were throwinginsults in his face, throwing them coldly, contemptuously and deliberately. Thenthe lines will sound as if they are torn out of her against her will—and thiswill convey a feeling of passion for him much greater than any sentimentalreading could achieve.2. These are the speeches where Dominique shows all her bitterness against theworld—and, in doing it, she shows her own uncompromising idealism and heradmiration for Roark. In this bitter form, she pays him the greatestcompliments. This is her real declaration of love for him—because here shestates the reasons for her love: she loves all the things which the world hateshim for. While she speaks about his business and clients, her voice has moreemotion than she showed in the preceding moments when she spoke of love. This iswhere she begins to show despair, but not openly; it is merely in the bitternessand tension of the way she speaks; she must speak as if every word hurt her.3. Here we see Dominique’s sexual violence. This is the first time when shegives in to Roark physically and voluntarily. Her response, when he seizes herin his arms, is a contradiction of everything she has said. She has spokencoldly about wanting to leave him, but the moment he touches her, her responseis one of desperate, irresistible hunger for him. While she is in Roark’s arms,she is her real self, free for a few moments. She is, frankly and openly, aprimitive sexy female—in the highest sense of the words. When Roark says, “I hadto let you learn to accept it,” her silent answer shows that she has more thanaccepted it: the way she kisses him has the same quality of open desire as his,it is she who seizes him as he had done it to her before. The purpose of thispart of the scene is to explain why Dominique decides to marry Wynand: Herphysical hunger for Roark is so great that she knows she will not be able toresist it. She knows she will not escape, but will keep coming back to him inspite of all her convictions—so she has to tie herself in some irrevocablemanner to keep herself away from Roark. That is the motivation and purpose ofher marriage to Wynand.4. This is the last and startling transition of Dominique’s attitude in thescene. It is the only time we will see her break down completely—and it must bethe breakdown of a strong woman, not of a weepy little girl. Her despair hasbeen growing throughout the scene and now it breaks into the open. Here she iscompletely feminine, helpless, pleading—but never weak. She has a desperateurgency and sincerity—she does not realize the preposterousness of what she isasking—so that when she speaks about cooking and scrubbing floors, it does notsound homey, but tragic. When she says, “Don’t laugh, I can,” Roark has notgiven the slightest indication of any desire to laugh. In fact, this is where helistens to her most earnestly, because he knows that this is real despair.When Roark refuses her and she gets up to reach for her wrap, her manner becomesthat of the cold, detached, Madonna-like woman which she is through most of thepicture. But the rest of the time, she gives the impression of a person whofeels nothing; here, she is a person who has felt too much—she is drained of allemotion, life or hope.At the very end of the scene, when she is in Roark’s arms again, her desire forhim returns, but now it is not enjoyment, it is a tortured, involuntarysurrender. She really wants to escape from him—her manner must be the directtransition to the next scene where she goes to Wynand.075 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_075_r1.jpg]Roark’s PsychologyRoark’s attitude throughout the scene is much simpler. There is no conflict inhim. He knows what he wants—but he learns in this scene that he cannot haveDominique, at least not for a long time.At first, his manner is a direct continuation of his attitude in the quarrysequence. It is self-confident, mocking, with an undertone of triumph—becauseshe has surrendered by coming to him, which is what he was waiting for. Helistens to her first speeches with the faintest hint of a mocking smile. He isenjoying it. He likes her defiance, because he likes a victory over a strongadversary.The first change in his attitude comes when she says: “I love you, Roark.” Thisis more than he expected. He knows that coming from her it is a danger signal.When she tells him why she is certain that he will be destroyed by the world, helistens calmly. He knows that he won’t be destroyed. He is so sure of himselfthat he will not argue with her about it. He knows she is wrong and, therefore,he feels confident that he can win her.His only answer is to sweep all her objections away simply by showing her thegreatness of their love for each other. To him, the world can never be a threatand can never stand in the way of his own happiness.It is only when Dominique falls down on her knees and starts pleading with himthat he realizes completely the extent of her despair. Then he understands thathe cannot force her into his own attitude toward life, that she will have tolearn it herself. He acts toward her on the same principle as he acts in hisprofessional career. He wants a voluntary acceptance, he will not force hisideas on anyone. He raped her only because he knew that she wanted it; but sheis not ready for happiness and he cannot force her to be. His action here isquietly heroic. He could have demanded anything he wished of her, and she wouldhave obeyed. Instead, he lets her go. His last speech must be delivered veryquietly and with great self-confidence, so great that it needs no obviousemphasis, no raised voice. It is a man speaking with absolute certainty, evenwhen he suffers, and he does suffer here.Their last embrace is in the nature of a farewell—though not an immediatefarewell. This will be their last night together, and Roark knows it, but hedoes intend to have that last night.076 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_076_r1.jpg]Notes About the SetIt is extremely important that Roark’s room be kept completely in character withhim. He is quite poor at this time. He knows that whatever money he got for theEnright House will have to last him for a long time, and he is not the type ofman who would waste money on personal luxuries. Also, he is too great an artistever to want any second-rate junk around him. Therefore, his room must beextremely, startlingly simple. It is not the simplicity of squalid poverty, butthe simplicity of deliberate intention. The room must be large, with a feelingof space and with an absolute minimum of furniture. He would want his home to beas functional as his buildings. He would have only the things he needs andnothing else. He would never make attempts at homey comfort or prettifying.Above all, there must not be any pictures on the walls. The walls must be bare.There must be one large window, a couch, a drafting table, a few chairs, adresser, a wooden filing cabinet for his drawings—and that is all. No curtains,no rugs, no boudoir pillows, no books, no fancy lamps or ash trays and, for thelove of God, no vases or knick-knacks. The furniture must be modern and verysimple—the kind of good, but inexpensive modem that one finds sometimes in NewYork. An impression of beauty can be achieved by the proportions and therelations of the objects in the room. The effect of the room must be the same asthe effect of Roark’s character: direct, stark, purposeful, austere. Since thelove scene is to be played in evening clothes, its effect—against the simplicityof a room that looks ascetic like a monk’s cell—will be most startling.077 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_077_r1.jpg]SuggestionsIn the love scene, Roark sits down, not in a chair, but on a couch. The way Iwould suggest doing it is as follows: They stand near the couch when Roarkseizes her in his arms. After his line: “You’d rather not hear it now? But Iwant you to hear it. I love you,” he kisses her and they lean back and go downtogether, without breaking the kiss, his mouth not leaving hers.For the last embrace my suggestion is this: Dominique is wearing a straplessevening gown; when she is about to leave, she reaches for her wrap and puts iton. She has it on when Roark takes her in his arms. Show the embrace in aclose-up that includes their heads and shoulders. As he holds her, while shemoans that she wants to leave him, the wrap slips off. We do not see her gown,but only her naked arms, back and shoulders; we see Roark’s hand moving slowlyfrom her shoulder down her back."},{"pageContent":"PART 3TRANSITION BETWEEN NOVELS"},{"pageContent":"8THE MORAL BASIS OF INDIVIDUALISMShortly after completing The Fountainhead, AR contracted with her publisher,Bobbs-Merrill, to write a short nonfiction book giving a systematic presentationof the novel’s ethics and politics. Her working title was The Moral Basis ofIndividualism.AR’s notes for this book provide a fascinating record of her philosophicdevelopment during the period between The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Inthe course of these notes, she is discovering and clarifying many of the ideasthat become essential in John Galt’s speech. Her formulations here should not beinterpreted as Objectivism; rather, they ore her notes to herself while she isworking out how to present Objectivism as a systematic philosophy.Her joumal for The Moral Basis of Individualism con be viewed as a progressionwith three stages. She begins in September of 1943 by writing a “tentativeoutline,” a foreword and an unworked draft of the first three chapters. She thenstops work on the draft and instead begins asking herself questions and thinkingaloud on paper. Finally, in the summer of 1945, she critiques her original draftand rewrites part of it before deciding to drop the project.There seem to be two reasons why she lost interest in writing this book. Yearslater, she recalled that in the early stages of planning she had concluded that“it was useless to present a morality without a metaphysics and epistemology.”Second, her primary interest was fiction writing In her journal from May 4, 1946(see Chapter 11), she explains thatthe idea of writing a philosophical non-fiction book bored me; in such a book,the purpose would actually be to teach others, to present my ideas to them. In abook of fiction the purpose is to create, for myself, the kind of world I wantand to live in it while I am creating it; then, as a secondary consequence, tolet others enjoy this world, if, and to the extent that, they can.August 18, 1943TENTATIVE OUTLINEI. The Life PrincipleThe “nature” of man—the primary matters of his existence—the rationalprocess—the particular qualities of man as creator (the Roark qualities)—the lawof his survival (the Active Man). Show how the “action spark” has the sameapplication today as in the primitive jungle. How to define and recognize it.II. The Death PrincipleThe only other possible way of survival—through the brains of others. Thesecond-hander, his particular qualities (the Passive Man). (Altruism andCollectivism.)III. The Moral LawThe exposition of the new moral law—examples to range over the whole field, inhistory, politics, economics, personal relations. Not serve or hurt others—thebasic position and the basic realm is neutral, independent. Express the idea ofthe “sin of omission.” IV. Individualism and CollectivismThe mind cannot be added. Brute force is the only form of expression possible toa collective—but even force cannot be exercised without reason.V. Man and MenThe proper relationship of man to men, deduced from the moral law. Traders, notservants. But trade only that which can be traded—hold on to the untradable.Altruism is an absolute evil. (The evil escape which it permits and becomes.)VI. The Moral SocietyThe proper society deduced from the proper relationship. (The advantages ofsociety to man—but only on the above basis. What is the use of advantages thattake his life in exchange, by crossing the basic limit of his rights?)VII. How It WorksThe Capitalist System. Selfishness—and the benefits to others as a secondaryconsequence. Government as protection of the individual against the collective.(The police protect single men against mobs—not a collective against singleevil-doers.)VIII. The Immoral SocietyDuplicate the same process in brief, starting from the altruistic principle andleading to an outline of a consistent collectivist society. (Collectivism as theprinciple of race prejudice and of every form of injustice.) First—theory, thenshow examples from practice.078 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_078_r1.jpg]NOTESTo start with: Man exists and must survive as man. This is not for those who donot believe in reason and logic. (?) [This last sentence was crossed out.]The reversal of all moral values when taken from the individual realm into thecollective.Altruism is spiritual cannibalism. If it is so wrong to eat another man’sbody—why is it right to feed upon his soul for one’s own survival?The man who wishes to live for others is merely confirming his inferiority. Theinfallible test of a man’s value is the degree of his indignation against theidea of compulsion and against the idea of being like others, of beingunoriginal. (Look at the others—is that what you are proud of being like? Ifnot, do something about it, don’t hold it as a virtue.)Man is not his brother’s keeper. (All responsibility must carry with it theauthority to enforce it.)The altruist’s inevitable concern with the inferior—its reasons and results.The “good of a collective” that demands the sacrifice of an inventor in order toavoid unemployment.Man cannot give life to himself. But it is up to him to maintain it.(For “free will”: you cannot change the basic materials—nature, natural law,your own nature—but you are free in the use you make of it; you exercise choiceamong given materials. Be careful here of the definition of “your ownnature”—how much is given to you, how much you can alter. You do not make anautomobile nor can you make it perform what it can’t perform, such as flying,but you can drive where you wish.)It has to begin with pride in self, with that which constitutes man—thereasoning mind. The rights or application of the mind is unlimited, except forthe right to deny itself—if a mind denies itself, it cannot enjoy the rightswhich belong only to it. To deny itself means to deny the mind’s essential[nature as] an individual entity. The mind can conclude anything itwishes—except that [it may] impose its will by force upon other minds.The root of the desire to abase man—as in the idea of smallness before nature.Altruism as a weapon of exploitation. The creators are disarmed. They have thegenius, the life gift. But the second-handers have virtue.If it is good to suffer for others, a true altruist has to make others sufferfor still others—thus he is doing them good by making them virtuous. If anyonethinks that this sounds fantastic in theory, look at the way it works out justlike that in practice and ask yourself why. There is and can be no otherexplanation. (If it is good to sacrifice oneself for others, then one makesthese others vicious by making them accept one’s sacrifice—since the giver isvirtuous and the receiver evil. Thus the altruist achieves virtue at the expenseof the virtue of others—is this altruism? But it can mean nothing else.Logically, one would have to land in some such silly situation as the Japaneseexchange of gifts.)No relation of man to man is possible without a moral principle. If there is nosuch principle, brute force is the only recourse and the only form ofrelationship. But in any relation between men the unstated and acceptedprinciple [of altruism] is that each must sacrifice himself to the other. Eachmust attempt to achieve not his own advantage but that of the other man. Bothknow this to be impossible. No definition [of a moral principle] can be madethis way—and no deal. So both drop all moral considerations whatever (“businessis business, morality has nothing to do with it”) and both attempt to squeezeall they can out of the other, to sacrifice him to oneself—as the onlyalternative to an impossible self-sacrifice. No decent or fair relation amongmen is possible on the basis of altruism. Only when one begins with theprinciple that the other man does not exist for one’s sake, that the other has alegitimate and moral right to his own advantage, only then is a fair relationpossible. Never demand of another man that which would constitute his sacrificeto you. Never grant him that which would constitute your sacrifice to him.Never initiate the use of force against another man. Never let his use of forceagainst you remain unanswered by force.Love as exception-making. The vicious implications of the idea of “lovingeverybody.” Not love—but a benevolent neutrality as your basic attitude to yourfellow men. The rest must be earned by them. Justice, not mercy.Remove the idea of altruism from your mind—then look at the collectivists. Seethese shabby, sordid men of horror for what [they are], without the aura ofvirtue that idea gave them. What, but that idea, could make men tolerate andaccept that horror?What kind of a person are you? What do you see when you think of “man”—a hero oran Okie? This question is the decisive one—it holds everything. The style of asoul. (If you’re confused, try this. It will tell you everything. Then try tountangle it.) (The worm who wrote to Pat about the Wright brothers—thedeliberate belittling of greatness.) We do not attempt to acquire the virtues ofheroes—we attempt to give heroes our vices. [“Pat ” refers to Isabel Paterson,author of The God of the Machine and a friend of AR’s in the 1940s.][In regard to] the Passive Man—stress obedience and following. The first desireof the Active Man—to do things alone and in his own way. The first desire of thePassive Man—to obey and not to be responsible. [The Active Man wants] neither toimpose himself upon others nor to be imposed upon. Best results and most moralmethod of action—alone, not together. Tests of school children. Hollywoodscenarios. Mob actions—lynchings. Cooperation, not collectivism. Government’sonly duty—protect individual rights for individuals, not create encroachmentsfor pressure groups. There can be no individual action without productive oreconomic freedom. There can be no such freedom without property rights. The“body” and “soul” of human rights. Who can rule best—the one or the many?Neither. As little ruling as possible. Then—go to the Capitalist System. September 4, 1943The Moral Basis of IndividualismI do not recognize anyone’s right to one minute of my life. Nor to any part ofmy energy. Nor to any achievement of mine. No matter who makes the claim, howlarge their number or how great their need.I wished to come here and say that I am a man who does not exist for others.It had to be said. The world is perishing from an orgy of self-sacrificing.—HOWARD ROARK, The FountainheadFOREWORDMankind is committing suicide.The peculiarity of the present world disaster is that every group of men inevery country is the originator of its own destruction. Men are not fighting oneanother for self-preservation. They are each fighting all for the right toannihilate oneself as fast as possible.Intellectuals, such as Trotsky, worked to bring about the dictatorship of theproletariat in Russia; they have been murdered by that dictatorship.Industrialists, such as [Fritz] Thyssen, and church leaders, such as [Martin]Niemoller, worked to bring about the Nazi regime in Germany; they have beenexterminated. [The preceding two sentences were crossed out.] American laborunion leaders caused the creation of Labor Boards; these are now the instrumentsthrough which labor union leaders are being sent to jail. Republicans who decrythe New Deal usurpation of power are now advocating the passage of a laborconscription act which would give the New Deal its last, winning step towardtotal power over this country. Conservatives, anxious to preserve capitalism,are supporting this measure which would turn citizens into serfs—which would bethe end of capitalism, for it cannot function through serfs. Leaders of racialminorities are advocating the destruction of the American system ofgovernment—which is the only system that ever has or can protect a racialminority. Intellectuals have embraced, en masse and in toto, the doctrine ofcollectivism—under which the intellectual professions are the least possible andthe first to go. Name a group of men and you are naming that group’s murderers.There must be a reason for a suicidal mania that has infected a whole world,particularly when the suicide is not conscious or willing, when the victims arethrashing about in wild despair, wondering who is destroying them, swatting ateveryone in sight, dragging their brothers along as they race down into theabyss and scream that someone is pushing them.It is generally recognized that mankind has achieved, since its rise fromsavagery, a miraculous progress in the realm of its material culture—and nonewhatever in the realm of its ethics. Our homes are superior to the cave of theNeanderthal man, but our morals are no better than his—worse, if anything, forwe do not have his excuse of ignorance. There is no act of inhumanity which heperpetrated and which we do not perpetrate, except that he did not possess ourexquisite means of perpetrating it and he could never equal our present scale.In a recently published book (The Spirit of Enterprise by Edgar M. Queeny), theauthor—intent upon a hymn to human progress—spends five pages describing man’smaterial triumphs. Then he adds: “Our morals have come a long way, too. The merethought of a feast on a loose piece of human flesh, which to the Bushmen bringsmouth-watering longing, is to us horrid and nauseating.” This is all he canoffer, without equivocation, for ten thousand years of man’s spiritual growth.And even this claim is open to question, because cannibalism occurred in SovietRussia in the famines of 1921 and 1933, and God only knows or can bear the sightof what is occurring in Europe now.Why has man displayed such magnificent capacity for progress in the materialrealm and yet remained stagnant on the level of savagery in his spiritualstature? This discrepancy has been recognized, decried, deplored, denounced byeveryone. It has never been explained. Countless explanations of evil andremedies for it have been offered through the centuries. None of them worked.None of them cured or explained anything.Yet that which mankind holds as its moral ideal has been known and accepted forcenturies. The basic principle of men’s morality has not changed since thebeginning of recorded history. Under their superficial differences of symbolism,ritual and metaphysical justification, all great ethical systems from the Orientup, all religions, all human schools of thought have held a single moral axiom:the ideal of selflessness. That which proceeds from love of self is evil, thatwhich proceeds from love of others is good. Self-sacrifice, self-denial andself-renunciation have ever been considered the essence of virtue. In no othermatter has mankind held to such total unity, so completely and for so long.Altruism is the doctrine which holds that man must live for others and placeothers above self. Humanity has proclaimed its moral ideal unanimously. It hasnever been questioned. It has always been the ideal of altruism. [Later in thischapter, AR notes that the cultures of ancient Greece and capitalist Americawere at least partial exceptions to this rule.]This ideal has never been reached. In spite of its statement and restatement, inevery land, in every age, in every language, in spite of its professedacceptance by all, mankind’s history has not been a growing record ofbenevolence, justice and brother-love, but an accelerating progression ofhorror, cruelty, and shame. Baffled, men have accepted the explanation that manis essentially evil; man is weak and imperfect; he doesn’t want to do good. Thenoble ideal of altruism is never quite to be achieved, only approximated; man isimmoral by nature.But look back at mankind’s record. Every major horror of history wasperpetrated—not by reason of and in the name of that which men held as evil,that is, selfishness—but through, by, for and in the name of an altruisticpurpose. The Inquisition. Religious wars. Civil wars. The French Revolution. TheGerman Revolution. The Russian Revolution. No act of selfishness has everequaled the carnages perpetrated by disciples of altruism. Nor has any egotistever roused masses of fanatical followers by enjoining them to go out to fightfor his personal gain. Every leader gathered men through the slogans of aselfless purpose, through the plea for their self-sacrifice to a high altruisticgoal: the salvation of others’ souls, the spread of enlightenment, the commongood of their state.It is said that self-seeking hypocrites used these virtuous sentiments to deludetheir followers and achieve personal ends. Doubtless, there have been such and agreat many of them. But they never caused the bloody terrors caused by thepurest “idealists.” The worst butchers were the most sincere. Robespierre askedand wished nothing for himself. Lenin asked and wished nothing for himself. Butthe record of Attila is that of an amateur compared to theirs. At the apex ofevery great tragedy of mankind there stands the figure of an incorruptiblealtruist. Yet, after every disaster men have said: “The ideal was right, butRobespierre was the wrong man to put it into practice,” (or Torquemada, orCromwell, or Lenin, or Hitler, or Stalin) and have gone on to try it again.But what is one to think of creatures who are willing, century after century, tobear every form of agony, every kind of martyrdom, for the sake of that whichthey consider as their moral ideal? Are they creatures devoid of moral instinct?Is not the determination to act according to one’s conception of right, nomatter what the price, precisely the attribute of a high moral sense? Men havebeen robbed, enslaved, tortured, slaughtered in the name of altruism. They haveaccepted, forgiven, and borne it, because their ideal demanded it of them. Theprice they have paid in unspeakable suffering should have granted them, atleast, a badge of virtue.But the nature of their ideal has robbed them even of this earned honor.A true premise, once accepted, leads to a greater truth and a clearer knowledgewith each subsequent step deduced from it. A false premise leads to a greaterfalsehood and a blacker evil, until, followed to its ultimate conclusion, itbrings total destruction, as it must. The spiritual tragedy of mankind has nowreached this last step. The spectacle of horror which the world presents at thismoment has never been equaled and cannot be surpassed. This is the end of theblind alley of men’s thinking. And there is no way out—save all the way back, tothe beginning, to the first principle which permitted men to be led into this.The ideal of altruism has now taken its ultimate toll. We are the witnesses ofits climax. We see mankind destroying itself before our eyes. We see the priceit is paying. We glance back at its history and we see the price it has paid.But we look on and say: “This noble ideal is beyond human nature, because menare imperfect and evil.”Isn’t it time to stop and to question that noble ideal instead?September 6, 1943AXIOMMoral law is a code of right and wrong. The moral law of man must be based onhis nature as man. This is implicit by definition. That which is right andproper to man must be right and proper to man. A moral code not based on man’snature would have to be stated like this: that which is right and proper to manis that which is improper and impossible to him. Whatever such a statement mightbe, it is not a statement of morality, but of total evil, by its own terms. Itleaves man no choice but to acknowledge himself as evil by nature, in which caseno morality is possible to him, or to destroy himself. ([Note added later:] “Inorder to exist I must be evil. If I do not wish to be evil, I must not exist.Existence is evil.” This is where I’ll discuss the morality of altruism.)What is man’s nature? The definitive factor must be that which is peculiar toman, that which distinguishes him from all other entities, objects or creatures.The attribute peculiar to man is the rational faculty. It is that which, in allknown nature, is possessed only by man. ([Note added later:] Define the rationalfaculty here. Truth to the facts of the outside world.)Man exists. He is alive. He is distinguished from all other existing objects andliving creatures by the faculty of reason. He is a rational being.Every species of living creature survives through the exercise of that attributewhich is its particular, distinguishing faculty. All its other attributes areadapted to the mode of existence set by the one which is its means of survival.If it were otherwise, if two fundamental attributes of a creature, bothessential to its nature and to its survival, were in irreconcilable conflict([note added later:] nail this down)—the creature would have to perish. Theattributes and nature of a bird are set by the determining factor of flight asits means of survival. The attributes and nature of a tiger are set by thedetermining factor of predatory hunting as its means of survival. That which inart is style, that which in music is leitmotif—the central theme, the basicprinciple, the determining conception which sets and rules every detail of thewhole—is, in living nature, the creature’s means of survival.Man survives through the exercise of his rational faculty.That is his sole means of survival.Man comes on earth unarmed. His brain is his only weapon. Animals obtain food byforce guided by instinct. Man has no claws, no fangs, no horns, no greatstrength of muscle, and no instinct to guide him. He cannot obtain sustenancefor his body except through the exercise of his rational faculty. He must planthis food or hunt it. Planting requires a long, consistent process of thought—ofobservation and logical deduction. Hunting requires weapons; man cannot huntwith his hands, his quarries are his superiors in speed or force, and makingweapons requires a process of thought. Man could not survive even as anherbivorous creature by picking fruit and berries at random. He has no instinctto tell him which plants are beneficial to him and which are a deadly poison. Hecan learn it only by conscious experimentation or by the observation of otherliving creatures who do not touch poisonous plants—a procedure which, in eithercase, is a process of thought.([Note added later:] Here the transition from the material to the spiritual.)From these simplest primary necessities on through his every other need, hisclothes, his shelter, his philosophy, on to his greatest achievements, from theflint and arrowhead to a modern skyscraper, everything man is and everything hehas comes from a single attribute—the function of his reasoning mind. The EmpireState Building was not erected by instinct.But it is the nature of the rational faculty that it implies choice and thepossibility of error. Instinct is infallible within the limits of its sphere.Nature gives an animal both the means and the method of survival; he cannot dowrong in his method; he does what he must; if he is confronted by a fact outsidethe provisions of his instinct, he can do nothing and he perishes. (This can beobserved in any country road: wild creatures that run from the approach of manor horse do not run from a speeding automobile; instinct has not armed themagainst an automobile, as it has not armed cows off railroad tracks. Theformulation of an abstraction—such as the rule that two bodies cannot occupy thesame space at the same time—is not done by instinct.)([Note added later:] He is given the tool; the nature of the tool sets themethod of its use, but man must discover that method. Reason applies tonature—and to himself.)It is man’s distinction that he is given the means, but not the method ofsurvival. He must discover the method himself. The process of discovery is along series of steps—of observation, deduction, conclusion. The possibility oferror hangs over every step. Nothing guarantees in advance the correctness ofhis deductions. It is up to him. One error in the process grows with eachsucceeding step—until, if pursued far enough, it leads to the final proof oferror, to destruction. Man’s life ultimately depends upon every conclusionwithin his brain.The process of deduction is a succession of answers to questions, on a singlebasic pattern: “Yes” or “No.” The possibility of differentiating between a “yes”or a “no” is the capacity of choice. Choice is the ultimatum of man’s existence.The process of differentiating is an act of choice. The rational process is asuccession of such acts. The first commandment of an animal’s survival is only:“Act or perish.” The act is prescribed. The first commandment of man’s survivalcarries a fateful responsibility: “Choose right before acting or perish.”But the responsibility goes deeper than that. It is not only that man survivesthrough the rational faculty which functions through constant choice. It is thathe also has the choice of exercising his rational faculty or not. He can make anerror in judgment. He can act against his own judgment. He can suspend alljudgment. ([Note added later:] Explain what it means to act without judgment.)An animal cannot act against his instinct nor suspend it. He enjoys a safety mancan never have—the invariable operation of his means of survival. He cannot actagainst his own nature. Man can. Man can stop his source of existence. Man canchoose not to act as a rational being. Man can choose not to function as a man.His destruction will be the ultimate price—but it will not be the immediateconsequence. The rational faculty operates through time. It does not grant manthe safety of an immediate retribution for error. The greater man’s knowledge,the more complex the factors involved in any given act—the longer the intervalbefore the consequences of that act become evident to him. At any moment of hisexistence, man lives with the possibility of acting as an agent of his owndestruction.Just as man must discover the methods that permit him to obtain sustenance fromthe physical world, so he must discover the methods that permit his means ofsurvival—his rational faculty—to function. Nothing is granted to himautomatically, neither the results of the operation of his reason nor even theoperation itself. He must discover the rules which that operation requires. Hemust direct his actions by these rules. He must learn to act in accordance withhis nature as a rational being.Man cannot give life to himself. But its preservation and continuation are up tohim. Life is given to him—survival is not.Man cannot change his nature. But its realization and fulfillment are up to him.Being a man is given to him—remaining a man is not. He is the only creature whocan slip beneath his own stature. He is man only so long as he functions inaccordance with the nature of a rational being. When he chooses to functionotherwise, he is no longer man. There is no proper name for the thing which hethen becomes. It is not an animal—it does not possess the animal’s equipment ofsurvival. It cannot survive, but it has that interval of time at its disposalbefore the consequences of its choice catch up with it, an interval as a preludeto destruction, a process of disintegration like a slow-rotting disease. Thus itexists for a while—a thing of corruption and death.A flea does not have the responsibility of remaining a flea. It can be nothingelse. A tiger does not have the responsibility of remaining a tiger. Man mustremain man through his own choice. Nature guarantees him nothing, not even hisown nature. Such is the penalty and the honor of being a rational creature.([Note added later:] Careful here. It may be [asked]: well, if his nature issomething relative, arbitrary—how can you base morality on his nature? Hisnature must be achieved by him. The process here, in effect, is this: man is rawmaterial when he is born; nature tells him: “Go ahead, create yourself. You canbecome the lord of existence—if you wish—by understanding your own nature and byacting upon it. Or you can destroy yourself. The choice is yours.”)Such is the origin of man’s moral faculty.The moral faculty—the ability to distinguish between right and wrong—is implicitin the rational faculty. The act of choice is the act of establishing values:the accepted and the rejected. Yes or no, right or wrong, good or evil. ([Noteadded later:] Unwarranted jump. A transition is needed.)A moral code is man’s statement of the principles that permit him to function asman. It is his protection against becoming his own destroyer. It is his code ofrules for the preservation of that entity of consciousness which we call hissoul or his spirit.The first, most earnest, most crucial question man asks of himself is: Am Iright? An animal cannot conceive of such a question. Man cannot escape it. Inone form or another, it rings through his whole life. It sets the leitmotif ofhis existence—the style of his soul. No matter what he has accepted as hisconception of the “good” and no matter how often he betrays it, his desire toremain good has the fierce intensity of a primary instinct. His quest for moraljustification has a quality of desperate urgency. Men have died willingly for anideal. It is said, of such cases, that their moral instinct was stronger thantheir instinct of self-preservation. ([Note added later:] This is their instinctof self-preservation.) This is not true. The fact is that men—whether they haveconsciously stated it or not—know that their moral instinct is the firstcondition of their self-preservation.All moral systems speak of spiritual death as penalty for immorality. Thisstatement contains all the dangers and possibilities of deception inherent inany half-truth. Man is urged to save his soul at the price of his physicaldestruction—an unwarranted contraposition. It is true that man destroys hisspirit in breaking the principles of morality. But the whole truth is much widerthan that. The whole truth is that man cannot preserve his body unless hepreserves his soul. His spiritual survival precedes his physical survival-thelast is not possible without the first. And if man is placed in a situationwhere he must choose between spiritual evil or physical death, he chooses thelast, because the choice is death in either case; only, in the first case, it isa dreadful form of slow disintegration which no man can choose once he hasunderstood it. The moral man is the one who understands.([Note added later:] This is where altruism cut man’s soul off from his physicalreality.)But if a moral code is a necessity of man’s survival, what happens when his codeis in opposition to his survival? Then man finds himself in a state of perpetualinternal war—a civil war against himself. This is the state in which he haslived for centuries. Let us now clear away the wreckage—and the rubbish.The establishment of values requires a standard. What is the standard by whichmoral values are to be set? Good and evil? Good—for what? Evil—to whom?The nature of man sets the standard of his moral code. Man’s survival sets thepurpose. A moral code in opposition to man’s nature or survival would meanimmediate destruction, if actually adopted.The axiom of the only morality proper to man is:MAN EXISTS AND MUST SURVIVE AS MAN.All that which furthers his survival is good. All that which obstructs it isevil. The conditions and qualities required by the function of his rationalfaculty constitute the Life Principle and are, therefore, good. The conditionsand qualities that proceed from or result in the obstruction of his rationalfaculty constitute the Death Principle and are, therefore, evil. [AR laterrejected the idea that ethics begins with an axiom. For her proof of man’s lifeas the standard of moral value, see John Galt’s speech in Atlas Shrugged and“The Objectivist Ethics ” in The Virtue of Selfishness.]Any morality not based on this axiom would have to claim either that a) man doesnot exist, or b) he exists, but his survival is not desirable, or c) he cansurvive as a sub-human creature. The viewpoint of those who might wish topropound any such morality can have no pertinence in any human discussion.([Marginal note:] Good!)If one accepts man for what he is—a rational being—any hypothesis one may holdupon his origin or the origin of his rational faculty will not contradict man’sproper moral code. If it is held that man is created by God, endowed with animmortal soul and with reason as an attribute of his soul, it still holds truethat man must act in accordance with his nature, the nature God gave him, andthat in doing so he will be doing God’s will. If it is held that man is a whollymaterial creature of unknown origin and that his rational faculty is anattribute of his physical body, a superior manifestation of material energy—itstill holds true that man must act in accordance with his nature, of which thatrational energy is the free, dominant and determining part. [Later, ARrecognizes that an objective ethics is incompatible with an irrationalmetaphysics. When she rewrites these notes in 1945, this passage is eliminated.]The only metaphysical viewpoint that cannot accept or be accepted in thisdiscussion is the old doctrine which has a long, disreputable history, as manyvariations as a skin disease, and can best be identified in its present versionby its current title of “dialectic materialism.” It is the doctrine which deniesthe existence of the rational faculty in man. It holds choice as an illusion andreason as a by-product of physical environment, nutrition and “conditioning,”operating without volition, automatically and unalterably. There is a catch inthat doctrine, however. Its proponents claim to have reached it by rationaldeduction. They urge us to take action upon it, to improve our physicalenvironment in order to improve the by-product, our brain, and they beg us totake such action through a conscious decision of—our rational faculty. It is anembarrassing contradiction which no dialectic materialist has ever explainedaway. Until it is explained, the doctrine is not worth considering ordiscussing.There is an axiom implicit in the act of reading or writing any book-the axiomthat a book can be read or written. There is an axiom implicit in any book onmorality—the axiom that morality is possible. ([Note added later:] Notnecessarily.) There can be no morality without the rational faculty. There canbe no rational faculty without the act of free choice. If this is not acceptedas self-evident, no conception of morality nor of a book is possible. Animalsand imbeciles are neither rational nor moral. This book is for men. September 18, 1943THEOREM I: THE BASIC ALTERNATIVE[AR here presents independence as the primary virtue in her morality (the “basicalternative” is the choice between independence and dependence). Later, sheidentifies independence as a derivative, an aspect of the primary virtue ofrationality. See John Galt’s speech, where she writes: “Thinking is man’s onlybasic virtue, from which all the others proceed. ”]... There is nothing in nature to hinder the function of man’s rational faculty.That function follows a simple pattern: to observe through his own senses, tomake the proper deductions through his own reasoning power. Nothing must standbetween the material and man’s mind. No intermediary is possible. What canassume the role of such an intermediary? Only other men. The conclusions, thethoughts, the opinions, the wishes or the orders of other men. Man can, if hechooses, accept the ideas of others without examination, repeat what he is told,follow instead of inquiring, shift to others the responsibility of choice,judgment and decision. But whatever he does in such case, it is not an act ofreason. The only threat to man’s rational faculty lies in the person of others.([Note added later:] This point must be illustrated concretely. Tremendouslyimportant step—not well stated. Not clear.)In this thinking, each man must be as the first man facing a new world for thefirst time.Nothing can guarantee that he has made the right deductions, and nothing canprove that he has made the wrong ones—except the consequences, observed andexamined by his own mind. His own mind remains the ultimate criterion, the courtof final appeal. Other men can find a better solution for any given problem andshow to him the error he has made. But this error must be demonstrated inrational terms—and the demonstration is not conclusive or valid to him until hehas become convinced of its truth by the operation of his own reason. He mustexamine a theory presented to him by other men exactly as he examines any factof physical nature, by the same method, through the same act of independentrational judgment. He is as alone in the presence of an idea as in the presenceof a jungle. He can make an error; so can any other man; so can any number ofother men. The fact that others hold an idea to be true is no proof of itstruth. The idea must be examined on its own merits by his own mind. Nothing elseis relevant, nothing and nobody. The responsibility of final judgment is stillhis. The immutable question remains: “Is this true?”—not “Do others believe thisto be true?” ([Note added later:] But truth is not “subjective.” Only theresponsibility is.)In the delicate, exacting, infinitely strenuous process of reason, there is onedeadly consideration man must escape, a trap which, once closed upon him, stopsthe process dead: the conception of other men as authority. If, at any point inthe process, man makes a step because others tell him to, if he accepts aconclusion based on nothing but the unexamined pronouncement of others, if thatalien judgment assumes the role of an unquestioned ruler in his mind—hisrational process is ended (in this specific instance).It does not matter whether the idea he accepted is true or false. The act ofsubstituting the word of others for one’s own judgment is an act of suspendingone’s rational faculty—the primary act of man’s self-destruction.And thus the first condition required for the operation of man’s rationalfaculty, the demand inherent in its nature, is independence. Man’s independencefrom all other men. The reasoning mind can accept no outside authority. Itcannot work under any form of compulsion. It cannot be curbed, sacrificed orsubordinated to any consideration whatsoever. Nor to any other man. Nor to anynumber of other men. The rational faculty demands total independence—infunction, in action, in motive.The man who surrenders this independence destroys his means of survival. Hesurrenders the responsibility of thought. Then others must carry it and he willlive as a parasite on the products of their thinking. But who are the “others”?If every man waits for others to do the thinking he will borrow—no thinking willbe done. Then no man can survive.The man who surrenders this primary independence commits the act of slippingbelow his nature, into the sub-human. He will survive for a while—as a parasitesurvives, not as a man. He will be able to satisfy his physical needs—by thegrace of those who had the strength to remain men. But nothing will stop thedisintegration of his spirit—because he is acting against the nature of man, heis acting on the principle that represents man’s destruction.If “Man exists and must survive as man” is the axiom of man’s morality, then thefirst moral principle deduced from it, the first commandment to guide man in hisrelations with other men, is the principle of independence. Independence of manfrom men is the Life Principle. Dependence of man upon men is the DeathPrinciple. All that which proceeds from man’s independence is good. All thatwhich proceeds from man’s dependence upon men is evil.To preserve the independence of his mind is man’s first and highest moral duty.It stands above any other precept. It takes precedence in any conflict.Man’s first moral duty is to himself. No other man can have a claim upon him[that supersedes this right]. This right is primary. All relations of man toother men are secondary.Left alone, man has a single alternative: think or perish. When man lives in thesociety of other men, the working intelligence and productive energy of othersgive him the possibility of another alternative: think or be supported by thethinking of others. Without effort, ability or responsibility, he has a marginof time at his disposal, a margin which he might believe to include his wholelifespan, when he can survive as a parasite. Most societies man has known havemade this form of survival seem easier and more practical [than independence].([Note added later:] Be more specific. Illustrate.)The choice man makes here is the crucial choice; primary in its nature, based onthe manner of his survival, on the issue of life or death, this choice willdetermine all his subsequent behavior, his actions, his motives, his character,the style of his soul. ([Note added later:] Because it is the basic principle.)This choice is the root of good and evil.We are far removed from the immediate realities of the process through which manobtains his sustenance; a complicated society and the heritage of centuriesbehind us disguise the primary forms of that process, and have disguised it forman since the beginning of recorded history. So the basic choice assumes adifferent form in the minds of men. The essence of the choice remains: produceror parasite. The form becomes: independence or dependence.This is the only real division among men. These are the two irreconcilableantagonists within the human species. Every other distinction—of birth, race,class, position—is artificial and superficial. This one is fundamental—and it ismade by voluntary choice. Each man classifies himself.What makes man choose to be a parasite? A great many motives, of which thecommon denominator is fear. Independence is a terrifying responsibility. Man hasgone to any length and any depravity in trying to circumvent the fact that hissurvival is in his own hands and that no outside power can offer it to him as agift. [The motives are] fear of responsibility, fear of effort, fear of his ownincompetence, envy of the abler and the better endowed, greed for unearned andundeserved rewards. ([Note added later:] And he has been taught to regardindependence as evil.)The modes of survival of the producer and the parasite are diametricallyopposed; so the conditions they require in order to function are opposite; theirneeds are opposite; their codes of behavior are opposite. [...]Such are the Active Man and the Passive Man.The Active Man is the producer, the creator, the individualist, the egotist, thelife giver.The Passive Man is the parasite, the imitator, the borrower, the collectivist,the altruist, the death-carrier.As we shall demonstrate fully when we examine them both in action and in detail.September 29, 1943THEOREM II: THE LIFE GIVER—THE ACTIVE MANSince man’s physical survival depends upon his rational faculty, the realm ofhis mind precedes and determines every other sphere of his activity. That whichis not proper in this realm cannot be proper in any of his actions.A man’s mind is an attribute of his self, of that entity within him which is hisconsciousness. That entity can be called spirit. It can be called soul. Itremains—no matter what its origin—a man’s self. His “I.” His ego.If to preserve the independence of his mind is man’s first moral duty, whatchoice is he to make when his thinking clashes with the thoughts and convictionsof others? Such a clash occurs at every step of a man’s life, most particularlywhen his thinking results in a new, original discovery—as every new discoverymust originate in one brain, that is, with one man, and therefore must be apartfrom or in opposition to whatever convictions men previously held on thatsubject. What is man’s choice in such a conflict? It is a choice of authority.“I think” or “They tell me.” Whose authority is he to accept? Upon whoseauthority is he to act? Who must be placed first: his ego or other men?The independence of man’s mind means precisely the placing of his ego above anyand all other men on earth. It means acting upon the authority of his ego aboveany other authority. It means keeping his ego untouched, uninfluenced,uncorrupted, unsacrificed.In the realm of man’s mind, the principle of altruism—the placing of othersabout self—is the one act of evil, the original sin. [Marginal note on the lasttwo paragraphs:] Good!Man’s virtues are the qualities required for the preservation of hisindependence. They are personal qualities, unsocial by their nature andantisocial in any conflict of man against man. They are unsocial, because mancannot derive them from other men, cannot receive them as a gift from an outsidesource, but must generate them from within his own ego. They are profoundlyselfish virtues, for they proceed from his ego, pertain to his ego and cannot besacrificed to any consideration whatsoever. Without these virtues man cannotsurvive nor remain man.Integrity—the first, greatest and noblest of all virtues—is a synonym ofindependence. Integrity is that quality in man which gives him the courage tohold his own convictions against all influences, against the opinions anddesires of other men; the courage to remain whole, unbroken, untouched, toremain true to himself. It is generally recognized that a man who is true tohimself is a man to be admired. But the sloppy confusion of human thinking hasprevented men from understanding their own words or hearing what they areactually saying. “True to himself”—what does that mean? True to his own ego.True to the duty of holding his ego apart from all other men—above them andagainst them when necessary. A man of integrity cannot place others above self.Here again, the principle of altruism is an act of evil.The virtue of courage is the strength to face any threat and to fight back.Fight what? Nature, as well as other men when necessary. If, however, one mustplace others above self—then it is evil to resist them; then one must surrenderif a conflict arises. But the man of courage is the one who does not surrender.In an issue of courage, altruism becomes cowardice—an act of evil.The virtue of honesty is implicit in the function of the rational faculty. Manrequires the greatest, the most ruthless honesty of observation and reasoning inorder to reach as correct a conclusion as his rational capacity will permit. Aman willing to fool himself will collapse—and does—in his first attempt atthought. The incentive to dishonesty comes when man deals with other men. Whatis the exact procedure of a dishonest action? A man says a thing which he knowsto be untrue or commits an act which he knows to be wrong—in order to obtainsomething from other men or achieve some end that depends upon others. Whetherhe does it for personal gain or for any other reason, does not alter theprocedure. The motive is irrelevant to the nature of the action. The nature ofthe action is that man acts upon what he believes to be agreeable or desirableto others, not upon his conception of the truth, that he acts to deceive others,they are his first concern, they determine his conduct. This is the placing ofothers above self. The procedure of dishonesty is the procedure of altruism—andan act of evil.A sense of honor is a selfish virtue by definition, because it implies the honorof one’s own self. Of one’s ego. A man with a sense of honor will not submit tocertain things nor permit them to be done to him—the things which he considersdishonorable. Dishonorable to whom? To him. Will not permit them to be done—bywhom? By other men. What, then, does a sense of honor require? The placing ofself above others. The principle of altruism applied here would becomeabjectness and depravity—an act of evil.The virtue of self-confidence is made clear by the very term. It is notconfidence in others, nor reliance upon others, but confidence in one’s ownability, in one’s strength, one’s courage, one’s judgment, one’s vision.Confidence in one’s own ego. When is this virtue called upon? In a conflict withothers. Here altruism would mean trust in anyone and everyone above self-thebehavior of a Milquetoast of the spirit—an act of evil.The virtue of strength implies all the same considerations. Strength ofcharacter, strength of will, strength of spirit—all attributes of the ego,needed in conflict with others, all making an application of the principle ofaltruism an act of evil.The love of freedom is a synonym of independence. Freedom from what? Nothing cantake a man’s freedom away from him—except other men. Freedom means freedom fromothers. A man who places others above self should have no objection to being aslave. In fact, that is the condition he should desire. Here altruism meansenslavement—an act of evil.A sense of justice is an intellectual quality—totally selfish, because it cannotbe exercised except through one’s own judgment, one’s own rational faculty. Hereman cannot accept the pronouncement of others, as he cannot accept it in anyprocess of reason. A just man acts upon that which he has concluded to be just.If he places others above self in a matter of justice, he is committing theequivalent of joining a lynch mob. Here altruism assumes one of its blackestforms of evil.The virtue of wisdom implies all the same considerations as above. One cannot bewise except through one’s own brain and acting upon one’s own thoughts. It isnot necessary to repeat what altruism would mean here.All these virtues are contained in, enhanced by, based upon one fundamentalvirtue—that of self-respect. Self-respect is implied in each of them. A man whodoes not respect himself can have no integrity, no courage, no honesty, nohonor, no strength, no wisdom, no virtue of any kind. Self-respect implies thata man considers himself an entity of value—a purely egotistical consideration.These virtues are primary. They pertain to the realm of man’s mind and spirit.And in that realm, altruism is either impossible or evil, or both. [...] September 30, 1944The relation of the immediate and the long-range in morality. (The impressionthat “evil pays.”)After we have defined the good and the evil—what are the proper methods offighting the evil?A Peter Keating [type might make the] argument: “Since I have a second-hander’ssocial talent, why should I not exercise it to the limit and get more than Icould by my own ability?” Here comes the question of the proper relation betweenthe primary and the secondary matters, between basic individualism andfunctioning in a society of exchange.(Note on a good argument about the position of an unemployed man in a capitalistsociety: the primitive condition of fighting nature directly is always open tohim (Pat’s argument), but the advantages left to him by others, by civilization,more than balance the hazard of having to seek employment through other men. Heis asking for a chance created for him by others.)Think very thoroughly on the relation of theory to practice, covering everypossible instance where it looks as if theory does not have any meaning inpractice. Is it in any sense true that in a free society a basic right canbecome meaningless and without application? Analyze cases such as: cameramenblacklisted by Hollywood ([Albert Mannheimer‘s] question); the closed shopdisaster to the New York stage (you are not forced to deal with establishedproducers, but in practice it means that you cannot have a producer); thehypothetical case of a monopoly (say, telephone) free to refuse services to anindividual or a group of men or a branch of business.In this last case, it is obvious that the inventor’s monopoly has such anabsolute right. Does it mean, however, that individualism then degenerates intoits opposite in practice, into collectivism? Has the size of an enterprise (madepossible by the scope covered by modern inventions) anything to do with it? Inother words, does an invention such as the telephone give the individual whocontrols it a collectivist’s power by the sheer size of his business? (No, Ithink.)Granted that such monopolies would be destroyed by counter-inventions, if man’singenuity is left free—what happens to individual victims in the meantime? (Hereagain, the relation of the immediate and the long-range.) Also, a singleindividual denied service by one of these gigantic enterprises has no recourseunless there is a collective of men in his position—or else no competitor willstart to compete against the monopoly. Is there a principle involved in such apossibility? Is there a possibly legitimate argument that if huge privatecompanies control everything—individualism becomes meaningless in practice? (No,I think.)Still, the point here seems to be size. Before modern inventions, enterpriseswere within the personal scope of one man’s control and ability. Moderninventions seem to make enterprises “collective” in scope and nature. (I may beterribly wrong here, but I must analyze this “seeming.”) A man can competeagainst a hand forge—can he compete against the Radio Corporation of America?The main point is: does he have to compete? Is there or is there not room leftfor individualism in practice—under the most extreme consequences of“laissez-faire” that can be imagined and legitimately supposed to happen?This is probably the point at which people now go in for collectivism andstatism. Since collectivism is not the solution, but only the complete surrenderinto the very evil one is opposing—is there a solution? Or is it thatcivilization must periodically collapse because it always becomes collectivismand stops? And that the moment any economic activity grows beyond the“controllable capacity” of one man—the limit has been reached and we go into thedark ages again? All of these questions are probably nonsense—but an awfullyclear statement and definition is needed.Here is the seeming contradiction: mass production gives inestimable advantagesto the individual through the cheapness of products made possible by a“collective” of customers—but then the individual is tied to that collectivetask. Or is he? It’s individual inventors and producers that make massproduction possible. It’s individuals and minorities that support new inventorsand teach the masses to appreciate them. Obviously, it starts with prime-moversand followers. But what about the results? Here again, a most careful statementof the relation between individualism and a society of exchange is needed.Does all this mean that an individual acquires “collective” power through agreat invention that becomes a mass industry, and that to compete with him, orto be independent of him, another man needs “collective” power?And if we say that voluntary collectives (such as unions, closed shops,employers’ agreements) are evil, but cannot be stopped by law—and we rely onlyon men’s wisdom and proper choice—will it work in practice? Since the majorityare second-handers by nature, will they necessarily and always destroy a freesystem by starting with voluntary collectivism? If the prime movers are clear onthe idea that there must be no state interference, but the second-handers arethe majority with the political power, then is every civilization only to have avery brief period (such as Greece’s 150 years and America’s 150 years) beforethe second-handers unavoidably destroy it? Just a brief period of magnificenceonce in many, many centuries—and then destruction? Is that the inevitable fateof mankind? Is it basic and eternal—a small group of prime-movers feeding therest and being destroyed by those they feed? (For The Strike.) [The Strike wasthe working title for Atlas Shrugged; this is the first reference to the novelin her notes.]Or are second-handers in the majority? That, perhaps, is the heart of thequestion. Maybe not. Maybe Pat is right—the fault is in men’s thinking, not inman’s nature. (Think, think, think on this point.)Granted that collectivism and statism are brought about by minorities—as[Ludwig] von Mises proves. What can the minority of prime-movers do about it?Are the collectivists’ methods open and proper to prime-movers? Won’t themajority always follow the collectivists if given a clear choice? (No, I think.)Isn’t it actually true that even among collectivists and statists it is always aprime-mover off the track who does the real damage?—so that the world isdestroyed by the Wynands, not the Tooheys? (I think so.) [Here AR is grasping anidea essential to Atlas Shrugged: that evil is impotent—it has no power exceptthat which the good grants it.] But if so—can it ever be stopped? What can stopprime-movers from going off the track for one reason or another? I suppose theanswer is: Nothing. There is no automatic fool-proof and error-proof [way]. Ifthere were, there would be no free will. Nothing can ever replace man’snecessity to make a free, conscious choice—the necessity of an effort of reason.All we can do is indicate the right way, the proper principles—and then fight,fight, and fight for them.That a man knows the right idea is not enough. He must still act upon it. Thereare, then, two acts of the free will: the will to know the truth and then thewill to act upon it. The first does not lead automatically to the second. October 25, 1944In answer to the question “If a morality is not based on the common good, whatis it then based on?”: on a definition of the moral individual and on that whichis good for him. The moral individual is the best and highest possible to man.By what standard? By the essence of man’s nature. The man living in accordancewith his nature is the moral man and the “surviving” man—he carries the lifeforce, the life principle, he is the self-renewing “energy” and thefountainhead. What is man’s nature? Man is a reasoning being.And since morality is a matter of free will, open to all but the insane—the goodof the moral man is good for all, i.e., for all those who wish to be moral.What is good? That which is in accordance with the life principle of man. Theindependent, the self-reverent, the self-sufficient.Do I set myself up as an arbitrary elite and formulate a morality for my ownkind of elite, at the expense of others? No, because it is not to be enforcedupon “others” or anyone. “Others” are free not to accept it and not to subscribeto it; they may have their own kind of collectivism, altruism or whatever theywish. But they are not free to enforce it upon me and my “elite”—they are notfree to arrange their collectivism at our expense. The objective dividing lineis: no man exists for the sake of another man. There can be no moraljustification for a collectivism [forcibly imposed] on one man for the sake ofthe others. But, the collectivists would say, our survival depends uponenslaving this exceptional individual; haven’t we a right to do it? No. First,it does not and cannot depend upon such enslavement; second, if it did, it wouldnot work just the same, the enslaved creator would not save them; third, if itdid, it would still be evil and no such universe is worthy of existence, so thatit would be moral to let the collective, the creator, and the world go to hellaltogether.This point—no man exists for the sake of another man—must be established veryearly in my system. It is one of the main cornerstones—and perhaps even thebasic axiom. [For AR’s final view of this issue, see the introduction to TheVirtue of Selfishness.]079 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_079_r1.jpg]In relation to my earlier notes on individual competition against bignear-monopolies: take notice of Mr. Hazen’s complaint about the impossibility ofan independent producer competing with big movie companies because “the bigcompanies won’t loan their stars to independents.” [Joseph Hazen was presidentof Hal Wallis Productions.] Mr. Hazen wants to compete with ready-made tools tobe handed over to him by the competition. He doesn’t want to start at thebeginning—he wants to expropriate that which the competition has created (anduse it against the competition), he wants to be boosted to an equal level tostart competing, he wants to be handed an unearned advantage. Is the way open tohim to compete from a clean beginning ? Obviously, yes, in this case. He can andshould create his own stars, and all his other tools.Isn’t the situation the same in every other line of business where men yelpabout the impossibility of competing with bigness? Monroe Shakespeare [abusinessman in Kalamazoo, Michigan] says that he can’t compete with automobilemanufacturers and he wants to expropriate the patents that they created—which isexactly like Mr. Hazen’s stars. What’s to prevent Shakespeare from inventing hisown patents? What if he can‘t—why should he demand the property or discoveriesof others? And if there are no new patents to be invented in connection with theautomobile—why should he go into that business and expect an unfair advantage?Even from the angle of “the common good,” why should society help [establish]him in a branch of business which society doesn’t need, since the existingcompanies cover it perfectly?If he has, not a basic patent to offer, but an improvement on the existing ones,which he cannot use without the consent of the original patent’s owners—then hehas to sell his idea to these owners. They won’t see it? That’s too bad—but thatis the basic condition of an exchange society—the voluntary consent of thoseinvolved in a transaction. (Yes, even if a lot of men are blind, stupid andunable to see their own advantage. That is the basic law of an exchange society.It includes the right of fools to make mistakes. Any kind of sin of omission hasto be permitted—there’s no way out of that. But no sins of commission.)But, Shakespeare might say, in such a case the owners of the original patentwould dictate terms and take unfair advantage of the new inventor. Notnecessarily. Not if he holds out and if what he has is good enough and they wantit badly enough. Again—the rule of a free exchange society. (And, as a matter offact and history, the fools cannot hold a valuable invention down, nor close theroad to it by being unable to see it and thus not giving it a chance. Theycannot stop the inventor or the invention. It is the history of every greatinnovation that it [overcame] fools. And it’s the fools who suffered—not theinventor, nor society. Provided the social system is free, and the inventor hasa chance to fight. He does not need ready-made encouragements. All he needsis—no barriers. Hands off and out of my way! Don’t help me—but don’t stop me.)080 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_080_r1.jpg]In answer to the argument that “man doesn’t know what is best for him—in thisday of specialization a man cannot know what is best for him as well as a doctorcan.” First, the primary choice is still with the man—does he wish to call in adoctor and what doctor? If he doesn’t want any, no moral right can force him,even though he might die. He has the right to choose to die. Freedom includesthe right to make mistakes. There’s no definition of what’s good for aman—except that which a man chooses as good for himself. He is the final andtotal judge of that—provided his choice does not include the use of force uponother men. (Incidentally, doctors can be wrong, and so can engineers, and anyspecialists. There is no [automatically] defined good for everybody. Only theright to choose one’s own good. To suffer through the consequences of one’s ownerror is a proper part of the existence of a being endowed with free will. Butto suffer through the mistake of another which is forced on one for one’s owngood is an inexcusable, unnatural evil.) [For AR’s view of the good asobjective, see “What is Capitalism? ” in Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal.]But second, and most important: if the choice here is between a genius subjectedto the will of a moron or a moron deprived of the help of a genius—the first isthe evil, the second not. Here is a good case of the sins of commission andomission. The first is a positive sin of commission. The second is only a sin ofomission—which is not a sin. (This distinction must be covered very thoroughly,completely and unanswerably. It is a cardinal point; it is the root and sourceof altruism.)081 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_081_r1.jpg]Minor point: if the majority of men cannot know what is good for them, each forhimself, how can they know what is good for others by proxy? If they are to becontrolled by “specialists,” because they cannot know everything themselves, howand by what standards will they choose the specialists? This is where communismruns into fascism—the rule of a collective by an elite for the sake of thecollective.How many men are incapable of living by independent effort in a system of freeenterprise, based on merit? Only a small, subnormal minority are incapable. Thuscollectivism is not even the sacrifice of a brilliant minority for the sake ofthe average majority—but the sacrifice of everybody, of the majority, to theworst and lowest minority: the incompetent and subnormal. Collectivism is noteven “the greatest good for the greatest number,” silly and vile as such aformula is. Collectivism is the sacrifice of the greatest number for thegreatest good of the vilest and smallest number. And besides, it won’t work—evenfor the benefit of the morons. October 26, 1944A possible definition of a right: a “right” is that which it is morallypermissible to defend by force. Here I have to be very careful. This might betotally wrong. If carelessly handled, it could be used as justification for theright of a communist to murder an employer who does not give him a job. Again,“sins of omission” come in. This is only a hint, a possible clue to be thoughtout very carefully, from every possible angle and in every possible application.It is no good—unless a total proof of it can be given. As a clue to it: it wouldhave to be clearly stated that only that which does not depend primarily uponother men can be considered “a right”—such as life, liberty, and the pursuit ofhappiness. But again—the definition of the principle and its application inreality has to be given—“the long-range and the immediate.” Such as: “Myhappiness depends on my work—what about the man who refuses to give me the job Iwant?” Here again—the definition of basic individualism in an exchange society.(Clue: Nobody is forced to provide you with the means of exercising a right. Butnobody must stop you from exercising it.) [See “Man’s Rights” in The Virtue ofSelfishness for AR’s final definition.]Could it be that virtues (toward other men, socially only) are virtues ofomission, while sins are only of commission? There’s something important here.Of course, the real and primary virtues are individual and positive, virtues ofcommission, such as: integrity, courage, wisdom, honesty, independence. But inthe social realm—in relation to others—the virtues are all of omission, that is,hands off. While the sins are of commission—positive violence.The whole relation of man to society has to be defined, its proper order stated:Man, the entity, first—then his relation to society. Society is only the sum ofindividuals, therefore the order is natural, logical and proper: individualentity, rights, and morality first, then the secondary matters pertaining tosociety, to the established entity’s relation with others. If relations areplaced first—who is it that’s having relations, whom are we talking about?In any clash between the individual and the social, the individual must win, theindividual has the right and the priority. (But be sure that the individual isstrictly individual and clearly defined as such.) October 28, 1944The force which a proper government exercises against criminals is not indefense of society, but of an individual. A murderer did not hurt “society”—hekilled an individual man. He violated, not a “social” right, but an individualright. Secondarily, the punishment of a murderer benefits society [because]society cannot exist unless individual rights are protected. Here again, thesocial is secondary, a natural consequence of the individual—and beneficial onlyin that secondary manner.This point is extremely important. It is the sloppy fallacy that a policemanprotects “society”—that he is there to combat crimes against society—thatcreates the acceptance of the idea that we can exercise force for the “social”good. There is no “social good” and it can never be defined. Only in servingindividual good can we accomplish any social good at all. And the clear,objective standards defining the individual good are inalienable individualrights. Force can be exercised only in the protection of these rights. [Here wesee AR’s respect for the rights of every man, genius or not; her individualismhas led her away from Nietszche. ]The policeman is not protecting a community (a collective) against singleindividual malefactors. He is protecting individuals against the possibility ofcollective violence. The only protection the individual needs is against thecollective, and the only action which a collective can take (as a collective) isviolence—physical force. A society based on the prohibition of the exercise ofphysical force between its members is an anti-collectivist society. (Force isthe only specifically “collective” method.)(Breach of contract comes under the same category. If a man is up against asingle man and a contract is broken, the man can deal with the breaker by force.But he cannot [protect himself] if the breaker has a collective of followersunder his command. Then the intervention of government—of law to protectcontracts—is needed, because this keeps the issue between two men and theirrights, allowing no recourse to violence in which the man with the mostfollowers would win. Again, a contract society is an anti-collectivist society.) November 6, 1944The art of writing is the art of doing what you think you’re doing.This is not as simple as it sounds. It implies a very difficult undertaking: thenecessity to think. And it implies the requirement to think out three separate,very hard problems: What is it you want to say? How are you going to say it?Have you really said it?It’s a coldly intellectual process. If your emotions do not proceed from yourintellect, you will not be able to apply it, even if you know all the rules. Themental ability of a writer determines the literary level of his output. If yougrasp only home problems well, you’ll be only a writer of good homey stories.(But what about Tolstoy?) February 13, 1945Note on altruism: in private and voluntary instances of help to another person(and this is only kindness, not altruism) it works well only when the recipientof help is a worthwhile person (essentially an “action” person) who istemporarily in need, purely through accident, not through his own nature. Such aperson eventually gets back on his own feet and feels benevolence (or gratitude)toward the one who helped him. But when the recipient is essentially a “passive”person, chronically in need through his own nature, the help of another gets himdeeper into parasitism and has vicious results: he hates the benefactor.Therefore, here’s the paradox about “helping another”: one can help only thosewho don’t actually need it. With the others, help leads only to disaster. Helpis proper only in a catastrophe or emergency—such as rescuing a drowning man. Itseems right by the very nature of things: a catastrophe is the opposite of thenormal; therefore, that which is proper in a catastrophe is the opposite of thatproper to a normal, healthy human existence.Besides, all instances of legitimate help seem to be of a physicalnature—rescues in illness or physical disaster. The possibility of spiritualhelp seems doubtful. Incidental assistance—yes. Real, crucial help—no. Butmaterial wealth is the result and consequence of a spiritual effort—work andthought. Why should it be distributed according to a rule (altruism)inapplicable to the primary sphere, to its source, the spiritual life of man?Proper relation of men—justice. A fair exchange to mutual advantage—not charity.No, not in any way. A man owes his fairest judgment to another man—nothing else.This is a moral law—up to each man, not to be imposed by force or by the state. March 25, 1945“Only a man fit for solitude is fit for human association.” He must bring anentity to his relationship with others; otherwise his own vacuum creates asuction, he must feed on the substance of others, he becomes “a second-handerwho cannot exist except as a leech on the soul of others.” June 29, 1945[AR now critiques her original draft. The foreword is referred to here as the“Introduction ”; “Axiom” is Chapter 1; “Theorem 1: The Basic Alternative” isChapter 2; “Theorem 2: The Life Giver—the Active Man” is Chapter 3.]NOTES ON THE WRITTEN PART OF THE MORAL BASIS OF INDIVIDUALISM INTRODUCTIONExcellent in content and general effect. Bad in language—too journalistic anduncertain. Shaky. No unity of style, because no unity of method and approach.Reorganize and rewrite, keeping the same beginning and end. Go easy on and becareful of “journalistic” references—keep them specific and general atonce—general primarily, and specific only to the extent needed to drive the ideahome, only in the nature of a concrete illustration. (But remember that it mustbe clear to the contemporary reader, and clear to any reader at any time. Whenin doubt, aim for the latter.)In speaking of [altruism in history], cover the point that your statement holdstrue even if most of the followers of an altruistic leader acted for “selfish”material gain. (Such as—“the real purpose of the Crusades was Oriental trade.”)If [the motives were selfish], why didn’t the leaders recruit men for thepurpose of “selfish” looting? And—if an ideal is such a handy cover-up for thelowest “selfish” purposes—isn’t there something wrong with the ideal? Isn’t itbecause the ideal cannot be defined and is impossible to practice?CHAPTER ITo cover more thoroughly the [point that] “reason” is the determining faculty ofman: it is obvious that man’s physical survival and progress have been achievedonly through his reason. If that is the prime law of the survival of hisbody—can his soul (or spirit, or consciousness) have a contradictory, oppositeprime law of survival? Reason is a faculty of the spirit. Applied to thephysical realm it has performed miracles. It has never been applied consistentlyto the spiritual realm—to ethics, which is the code of spiritual laws—and lookat the state of our morality!If we cannot survive without our rational faculty, our prime laws of conductmust be those required by the rational faculty.Chapter I should begin by stating the axiom. Then define man’s nature. Then ask[AR interrupts her thought, crossing out the preceding two words]. Or—begin byasking whether a moral code is necessary? Prove that it is-for a rational being.What is the rational? That which is true to facts. To exist one must be true tofacts. If one goes contrary to the facts of existence—one perishes, simply bybeing or making oneself unfit for existence. [Here we see AR grasping thecrucial point that ethics begins by asking not “What are the right values? ” butrather “Why are values necessary? ”]What is the rational? To be right. What is the moral? To be (or do) right. (Whyis the same term used?) A code of ethics must be totally, profoundly, completelypractical—or else it is a means of self-destruction (as altruism is). It isaltruism that has caused the idea that morality is “impractical,” something forwhich one must suffer, that “virtue is its own reward,” meaning its only reward,and that “idealism” or “theory” are the opposite of reality and practice.[Regarding the point that man must choose to be man:] This might be the placefor the statement that: “Man screams in terror at his own greatness, begging byevery possible means to be delivered from it. The greatness is being a freeagent.”082 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_082_r1.gif]Chapter I is not well-organized; it leaps into side-lines, does not follow astraight progression. Reorganize the material and the order of presentation.When you speak of “reason” and “the rational faculty,” illustrate the concreteapplication of what you mean once in a while.CHAPTER IIAn additional point here: if someone says “But so many crucial mentalconclusions in a man’s life are made under the influence of other men (orproceed from other men)”—the answer is: “Quite so. For some men. But some otherman had to think of it in the first place. Even if it’s only a small improvementon the material left by others—if it is an improvement and a new step, some oneman had to think of it.” And as general historical illustration and proof—thegreatest achievements and advances were made in individualist societies, whenmen worked alone—not in collectivist ones, where men were encouraged and forcedto work together. Also, the great epoch-making discoveries (such as the Wrightbrothers’ airplane) were made by single, individual men. Only the minorimprovements and variations are made by collectivists (such as the boasteddiscoveries of Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia). There is almost a law here: if aman gets his major impetus from the material (or influence) of others, he is oflesser stature than the man who strikes out the farthest by himself. And theachievement of the first will be less than that of the second.Point to cover: Edison, born in the jungle, would not have invented the electriclight. But he would have invented the torch—or some other equivalent of hisachievement—equivalent in the sense of a tremendous step forward in comparisonto what was known before. The savage who died in the swamp at that time, havingachieved nothing, still exists today—he is every man who has never held athought of his own. It is not society that made Edison’s achievement possible(nor the social heritage)—it is Edison.The important point: the thoughts of others (the heritage of civilization) canbe of tremendous help to man—but only if weighed, examined and accepted by hisown reason. They become a death trap and a menace when accepted merely on theauthority of other men.[Regarding the disintegration of spirit in the parasite:] Clarify this thought.I mean here: if he persists in this action or to the extent to which hepersists. He may still act as a rational being in other spheres—but the poisonis planted and will continue to grow. And—the more he indulges in thenon-rational (the second-hand), the more he acts on the death principle and thefaster he comes to one form or another of actual destruction.[Regarding social relations:] Before you come to “any principle as a guide inhis relations to other men,” cover the point of how the morality of reasonapplies to man alone—even to a man on a desert island. The first commandment isto exercise his reason. Morality is not social (and don’t forget the evils thatcome from thinking that it is). Only after you have established this, can youcome to morality in relation to other men. [Here we see AR’s transition, inregard to the primary virtue, from independence to rationality.][Regarding the choice to be a parasite:] This needs the added statement that thedegree of a man’s intelligence is not the essential, determining factor here—theexercise of his intelligence is. (And a necessary addition to this is: if youcannot venture independently into difficult intellectual spheres—don’t ventureinto them. There is no moral obligation to know and solve everything, to have anindependent judgment upon everything. There is a moral obligation that suchjudgments as you do hold must be your own. Let your sphere of concern be aslarge or as small as you feel capable of handling (and you’re the sole judgehere)—but it must be the sphere of your independent rational judgment. There isnever an obligation upon man to handle more than his intellect will permit him.If he finds himself in a position where it seems that he has to—he has broughtit upon himself, through second-handedness. If a writer steals, because hecannot invent, he had no business being a writer. The test for a person in anyfield is the question: What do I know about this by myself, without having heardit from others?)Chapter II is extremely confused. The material is out of sequence and covers toomany fields too soon.CHAPTER IIIExcellent in thought, but not definite in statement and much too soon insequence. I take virtues for granted, instead of proving that they are virtues.Since it draws parallels between egoism and altruism, it must come later, afterboth have been stated, defined, and analyzed.FOR CHAPTER IMan’s sole means of survival is the rational faculty. It is a spiritual facultythrough which he controls matter. Yet he has excluded it from his spiritualfield—and does his damnedest to find himself excuses to be set free of it. (Manscreaming against his own greatness.) He doesn’t want to realize that he himselfmust be controlled by the same faculty—and by himself. He dreads theresponsibility. He wants the license of chaos within himself. What for? (“It’ssuch a big responsibility really to desire something.”) June 30, 1945GENERAL NOTESBe very careful to keep in mind that the axiom of your morality is not “Man mustsurvive,” but: “Man must survive as man.” This is the crucial point; otherwiseit becomes an issue of any kind of survival, and any criminal moron can claimthat he is moral when he murders, because that is his only means of survival.This point, clarified, must cover such cases as when a man chooses to die,rather than compromise with evil. Since man’s status as man is within his ownkeeping (and he is the only such creature, that is his crucial distinction), thebasis of his morality is the preservation of himself as man, not just thepreservation of a physical hulk (which, incidentally, cannot be preservedwithout the preservation of his human spirit).083 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_083_r1.jpg]A possibly helpful point toward a clear definition of what constitutes one’s ownjudgment and what is merely taken on second-hand authority: an independentrational judgment is one which we know how to apply to the concrete. Everystatement or judgment is an abstraction; when we repeat an abstract statementwith no clear idea of its concrete application, we are [being] intellectuallysecond-handed; we destroy our connection with reality and our sole means ofhandling it—the very fact of our consciousness.It is useless to accept generalities second-hand, i.e., on the authority ofothers, because generalities are of no value except when and as applied to theconcrete, and each man must do that for himself, applying principles to theconcrete events of his life. He cannot do it with a principle he has notunderstood.084 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_084_r1.jpg]Man has a right (and a moral duty) to state the terms of his existence (again,since his nature is in his own keeping). At a certain point, he must tell hisbrothers: “This is the kind of existence I do not accept.” At that point, he[may] face a firing squad rather than submit to others. Think this point overcarefully: it leads to an extremely important fact—that morality is not social,but in certain respects anti-social. Morality is unsocial in essence: it appliesto and proceeds from man, not society. But when it involves man’s relation toother men, it becomes anti-social; it is man’s protection against society.(“Rights were not given to man by society nor for society, but against society.They are man’s protection against all other men.”) And, incidentally, only wheneach man is thus protected can one have a good society. Let society alwaysremain what it is—a consequence, not a determinant, an effect, not a cause, thesecondary, not the primary. July 3, 1945Nail down—thoroughly, completely, once and for all—the fool idea that good ismerely a matter of good will or good intentions. Here’s another abstractionwithout relation to the concrete—a “floating abstraction.” [AR’s first writtenuse of this expression.] Before you can have “good will,” i.e., before you canwant to do good, you must know what is the good. In effect, fools say that allthe problems, personal and political, can be solved by finding “men of goodwill.” But the “good” is never defined. And actually, most of the evil in thisworld is done by and through “good” intentions. The cause of evil is stupidity,not malice. “Good” is an intellectual concept.085 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_085_r1.jpg]Regarding the golden rule: “Do unto others as you’d want them to do unto you.”This is used in support of altruism. In that way, it would imply that you mustgive out to charity because you want to be an object of charity yourself. Or—youmust sacrifice yourself to others because you want them to sacrifice themselvesto you. Actually, the golden rule can work only in application to my morality:you do not sacrifice yourself to others and you do not wish them to sacrificethemselves to you. You may want to be helped in an emergency or acatastrophe—but only in such cases. You consider such cases a calamity—not yournormal and proper state of existence. You do not wish to live as an object ofcharity—and you do not hand charity out to others.July 5, 1945GENERAL PLAN PART I: MORALITY1. The nature, necessity, and axiom of morality. (Morality must be practical.)2. Define the morality of egoism.3. Define the morality of altruism.4. Virtues—under both moralities.5. Human relations (personal, economic, political)—under both moralities.6. Conclusion—the spiritual wreckage and corruption caused by altruism. Thespiritual status of an egoist.PART II: POLITICSThe reference of political forms and ideas to morality—and to both systems ofmorals.086 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_086_r1.jpg]Blast—once and for all—the horrible notion that love is in the nature of ahandout, that it’s alms, charity, something undeserved but handed down out ofgenerosity or pity. This idea leads to the impossible precept of lovingeverybody. If love is undeserved, one can love everybody; then, the less theobject deserves it, the nobler is the love, since it makes the one who lovesmore generous. Therefore, the noblest emotion would be, not to love a Roark, butto love the lowest, vilest, most contemptible moron one could find. This hasbeen actually preached. Yet, in common sense, people do not love that way.Love is exception-making and it must be deserved. This means [it must be] anexchange—the one who loves gets a personal, selfish happiness out of the virtuesor qualities he admires in the object of his love, and love is his payment forthem.It is the idea of love as alms that leads to the idea of parents’ love for theirchildren as a generous sacrifice. But if the parents get no happiness out oftheir love for their children—their sacrifice is of no use and they’re viciousparents (other things being normal). If they do get personal happiness and theirlove is authentic, they’d better stop prattling about self-sacrifice.087 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_087_r1.jpg]When society makes claims on the individual—the individual also starts makingclaims on society (such as “my right to a beautiful street”). Then no untangling[of “rights”] and no justice is possible. The ultimate recourse is brute force.Without individual rights, no peace among men is possible. By herding men into“unity,” one creates total disunity and chaos. Instead of peace, one gets war ofall against all, and general hatred. July 6, 1945The contradiction in the collectivists’ view of mankind: They hate mankind andbelieve that men cannot rule themselves for their own good, [because of] maliceor stupidity or both. Yet they advocate giving total power to this vicious,incompetent majority. This is where the idea of a Nazi elite comes in—fuhrersruling others for the others’ own good.Every collectivist hates mankind because he hates himself.The collectivists have such a tender concern for the dregs of humanity. What istheir attitude toward humanity’s heroes? July 8, 1945For morality as non-social: it is most important (and hardest) to be honest withoneself. The person who lies to himself is much more revolting and corrupt thanone who lies to others.088 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_088_r1.jpg]Why is the word “virtue” used as a synonym for “strength” or “effi cacy” ? Thereis here the same connection as between “right” used for “true to facts” and for“morally correct.” Obviously, the conceptions of morals and virtues were [meant]to be practical—not the complete opposite of practice. Altruism made them thislast.There is also the question: practical for whom? If ethics had always beenconsidered as a social matter and based on collectivism—obviously the “good” andthe “virtues” were set to profit collectivism, to work for the collective (forsociety). But collectivism doesn’t work. Therefore, the ethics of collectivismdidn’t and couldn’t work. Men had to live as individuals—at least partially—inorder to survive at all. Thus ethics and “ideals” became the impractical, theimpossible. Thus all beauty, dignity, and inspiration were taken out of men’sactual lives. Men functioned on the conviction that their actual existence andtheir deepest reality were vicious, depraved, contrary to all ideals. And everyattempt to reach the ideal resulted in suffering, horror, and evil.No, ethics are not set arbitrarily, with some utilitarian purpose in view (asthe dialectic materialists may claim at this point); that is, ethics are notrelative, set “pragmatically.” No, we cannot have: “bourgeois ethics,”“capitalist ethics,” “collectivist ethics”—for the sake of a class, a state orany other “sake.” Ethics are absolute and objective. They must be based—not onan arbitrarily chosen purpose—but on the very nature of man. And the nature ofman is individualistic. And the only ethics that will work are the ethics ofindividualism.089 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_089_r1.jpg]In ethics, when we ask the question: Practical for whom? Good for whom? we mustgive a reason for the answer. Good for the collective? Why? No reason can begiven. Good for the individual? Why? Here there is a reason and an unanswerableone: because such is man’s nature.090 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_090_r1.jpg]Account for the fact that man is not “a social animal.” Explain the facts[regarding] human affection and loneliness.091 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_091_r1.jpg]Men have always thought—for some reason (think this out)—that morality must bedifficult. The morality of egoism is much—oh, much!—more difficult than that ofaltruism (if difficulty is any relevant criterion at all). But it works.092 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_092_r1.jpg]Altruism works like every cheap [fraud]—by blaming the victim. As aspiritualistic medium tells you that your “vibrations are wrong” if you seenothing in his demonstrations, altruism tells you that it’s you who’re evil ifyou end up in a sea of blood by following consistently the dogma of altruism.July 9, 1945Even though men have been commanded to love their neighbors—they feel no lovewhen facing a neighbor; they feel only an immediate sense of guilt: “I shouldlove this man, but I don’t. I’m no good.” An emotion cannot be achieved bycommand—only by rational conviction. The acceptance of arbitrary authority is socounter-rational and, therefore, so counter to human nature that men cannotforce themselves to make it a conviction. Even though Christ commanded men tolove their neighbors and men have accepted the idea that Christ is God-like and,therefore, right—they still cannot experience an emotion on the basis of: “Idon’t know any reason for it, but Christ told me so, therefore it must beright.”Emotion can come only from actual rational conviction.If men say that their emotions are a chaotic, contradictory mess—well, look attheir convictions. They have none—or, to be exact, they have a grab-bag ofundigested, unapplied, contradictory generalities, acquired at random, withoutvolition, choice or examination. The state of their emotions is the result. Amess can produce only a mess. If you treat your mind like a garbage can, arecipient for any chance refuse, then your emotions will be garbage—useless,disconnected hunks of a little bit of everything, leading to nothing butdecomposition, rot, suffering. Mental activity is the production and emotionsare the consumption of your spirit; you have nothing but garbage to consume whenyou have produced nothing but garbage. July 13, 1945The moral man is not necessarily the most intelligent, but the one whoindependently exercises such intelligence as he has. He is not the man who has,potentially, the greatest brain power (if this can even be measured ordetermined), but the one who exercises his own brain power independently. Thus,a college professor who makes the intellectual error of collectivism orsecond-handedness somewhere in his thinking turns out in his theory and practiceto be a vicious man (same with criminals, dictators, social reformers). But aplain man concerned only with his own life and his own job, not venturing beyondthe limits of his own intellectual capacity, is usually a moral man in everysense. Therefore, the moral faculty is not something independent of the rationalfaculty, but directly connected with it and proceeding from it. The moralfaculty, however, is not dependent upon the amount of intelligence, but upon theproper exercise of intelligence-its exercise according to the rules its naturedemands, independently. In other words, the intelligent man is the moral man ifhe acts as an intelligent man, i.e., in accordance with the nature of hisrational faculty. (He has the choice not to act in accordance with his rationalfaculty. That is why ethical laws are necessary. The laws of any function areimplicit in the function. But man must discover and formulate them.)093 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_093_r1.jpg]My greatest personal mistake is ever to allow a word or a moment that “doesn’tcount,” i.e., that I do not refer to my own basic principles. Every word, everyaction, every moment counts.(This is also the pattern on which everybody makes mistakes [or] becomesirrational—not relating their one action or one conviction to another.)094 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_094_r1.jpg]Why must man’s morality be that of individualism and egoism? Because otherwisethe best is sacrificed to the worst. If we establish the virtues which arational man needs in order to survive, and then say that the goal of hisvirtuous action must be service to those who do not have such virtues—we placevirtues in the service of vice, we penalize virtue and give a reward to vice (orweakness). [In regard] to survival, the altruist formula would read: the mancapable of survival must not make his own survival his goal, but the survival ofthe man incapable of survival. ([Note added later:] If he works for his ownsurvival, he is vicious. He can justify it only by helping the unfit. If hedoesn’t do so, he had no right to survive.)If we refer to happiness or the enjoyment of life, the altruist formula wouldbe: the man capable of achieving enjoyment or the means of enjoyment must notmake his own enjoyment the goal—but the enjoyment of the man incapable ofachieving it.If we formulate a moral code, the man who lives up to its every provision is theperfect, ideal moral man. If then we formulate our ideal man and make him aservant of others—it comes to sacrificing or subordinating the perfect to theimperfect, the ideal to the corrupt.If the ideal moral man is the mark at which we must aim—how can we wish to reachthe ideal if, when we reach it, our life shall be sacrificed to our moralinferiors?(Here the question of natural endowments enters—to be defined and covered.)A moral code must be the code of man at his best—at his best in every way,including natural endowments, since these are desirable. A moral code is thecode of establishing values. Desire (or purpose) establishes values.Suppose we imagine a man with all the perfect natural attributes: intelligence,strength, talent, health, beauty—every conceivable natural qualification. He isthen a perfect entity, an entity perfectly fitted for life. But how will helive? Life is action. He must decide on his own action, set his own purpose. Hischoice must be guided by the moral law—he must also be morally perfect. (Hereagain I need a definition of why man needs a moral law. Moral law is a code ofgood and evil. Whose good and evil? Man’s. What man? The most perfect manconceivable.)Now if it is asked: but what about the imperfect man, since most of us areimperfect? We can act only on the basis of our degree of perfection, trying toapproach perfection; we cannot live on the basis of our flaws. For instance, ifwe are sick, we must try to get well—we cannot base our life on being sick. If aman is incurable, e.g., blind, he cannot expect the healthy to live by the rulesset for his blindness.[Man‘s] actions and his observance of the moral law are up to him. The purposeof life is happiness—and if we adopt the morality of altruism, then the man mostfitted for life has the least right to it (or to its enjoyment, to happiness).The more endowed he is, the less right he has to his own enjoyment. And the lessendowed the moron is, the more right he has to enjoy himself and to demand thesacrifice of everyone else. This is the irrational paradox of altruism—and it isvicious, since it is irrational and unnatural. This is the process by whichqualities (virtues) desirable in fact become undesirable in morality (and alsodesirable natural attributes are made undesirable). This is why virtue becomesimpractical. Altruism is the morality of death and destruction (and it leads todeath and destruction in practice) because it holds as desirable the opposite ofthe qualities needed for man’s survival, the qualities of life.The ideal is composed of all the attributes which we consider desirable. Why,then, should the final goal and purpose of the desirable be the undesirable? Whyshould a genius serve the happiness of the moron? Why—as an example—should abeautiful woman give up her evening gown to an ugly one?Here enters the differentiation between ideal and moral ideal. The moral codemust be the code that is needed by and is fair to the best possible type of manborn naturally: the most intelligent, the ablest, the healthiest, the mostbeautiful. The average, lesser man cannot be sacrificed to this code; the betterman doesn’t need his sacrifice. But more than that, the lesser man also can liveonly by such a code—to the degree of his abilities—and his rewards will becommensurate with this. But if it is said: “What about the man who cannot liveby such a code at all?” The answer is: “Then he cannot live at all—because thisis the only code by which man can survive.” No man must survive at the expenseof another man.(One of the roots of altruism is [a man‘s] fear of his inferior naturalability.) July 14, 1945Man is afraid to consider himself and his happiness the final end—because toachieve happiness is a great effort, a great responsibility, and most men areincapable of it. Or, achieving what they think is their happiness (some form ofsecond-handedness) they feel it’s low and shoddy—and long for something“higher.” In effect, what they feel is: “Is that all? That’s not worth livingfor. Something must be worth living for—and it’s not in me, since my besthappiness is so low and unsatisfying.” This is the pattern of their “instinct”for “something high and noble.” July 17, 1945The short-range must not contradict the long-range. The distinction betweenimmediate pleasure and happiness is that a pleasure which is part of yourgeneral happiness, a step towards it, is proper—but one which has to be paid forwith suffering later is improper. Example: if your long-range happiness dependsupon your marriage (by your own choice and definition, i.e., you have acceptedit as happiness), then an affair with some chance woman may give you pleasurefor the moment, but will destroy the thing you prize more. (In most marriages,the trouble is that the marriage is only a compromise, not happiness, and so isthe affair—neither chosen nor accepted fully and consciously.) If you overeat itmay give you pleasure for the moment, but destroys your stomach and health thenext day. The long-range is your guide and standard for the immediate. What ifyou have nothing of long-range value to you? Well, you won’t be happy. What iftwo “compromises” clash—as in the conventional marriage? Choose by your owndefinition which you prefer. But you can’t expect to have your cake and eat it,too. July 18, 1945Since man must establish his own values, accepting a value above himself makeshim low and worthless. Allow nothing to stand between you and the world. Theworship of something above you (like God) is an escape, a switch ofresponsibility—to permit you anything.A code of ethics is man’s statement of his instinct of self-preservation, and itmust be based on his conviction of his value.The first law of ethics: demand the best. (If you demand the worst, you betraythe good—and yet ethics are supposed to be a code of good and evil.)Establish your values—then go after the best.095 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_095_r1.jpg]Nature never gave to a creature instincts contrary to its own survival. Allinstincts are aimed at survival. If we assume that man has instincts that arecontrary to his rational faculty, then nature has given him instincts opposed tohis survival. That does not seem likely, unless we assume that he is slated fordestruction and extinction (like the lemmings). And—as an “instinct” species—mancertainly is on his way out. (Perhaps we are really in the process of evolvingfrom apes to Supermen—and the rational faculty is the dominant characteristic ofthe better species, the Superman.)096 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_096_r1.jpg]Regarding the argument that “we must live for the whim of the moment”: naturedoesn’t function by the whim of the moment. The rational faculty works byobserving and discovering immutable laws of nature. And the rational facultyfunctions through time. If you let one moment contradict your long-rangedecisions, you’re acting immorally.097 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_097_r1.jpg]Altruism poisons a man’s happiness. When he has achieved something and is happy,he is forced to think: “But I am not serving anyone. Therefore I’m vicious.”098 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_098_r1.jpg]Why are there more neuroses nowadays? Because, as men learn to think more andbetter, the evil of their original false premises catches up with them and makesit impossible for them to go on. (This is assuming that men have really learnedto think more—or have tried to. It is possible that man’s ethics have been thecause of the fact that men have not achieved any intellectual progress. Theethics of altruism, of course, is the cause of men’s failure to achievehappiness or any progress in morality.)099 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_099_r1.jpg]An example of the vicious injustice of applied altruism: a man gives a job to ahalf-wit, on the basis of pity. He tells himself that he’s done something noble,he’s sacrificed the better service he could have had—for the sake of theinferior creature. Is he the only one whom he’s sacrificed? He’s sacrificed hiscustomers—in effect, society—to the extent of the poorer service his businessoffers (and if he continues on this policy he’ll have to go out of business).But, above all, he’s sacrificed the better man, the able applicant, who expectsand deserves justice—i.e., expects to have his ability recognized. The able manhas been rejected for being able—for a virtue. The employer has committed anevil and immoral act. (Virtue includes the ability to recognize and appreciatevirtue—this is justice.)100 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_100_r1.jpg]Two crucial questions to formulate—the two most important steps or key points:(1) define the need of morality, and (2) prove why (proceeding from the rationalfaculty) man’s morality must be that of individualism and egoism (independence).101 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_101_r1.jpg]To exercise conscious rational control is man’s first responsibility, duty andmoral commandment. (To assert his will against circumstances—like the man in thesnow.) July 19, 1945MY OUTLINE1. Man’s morality must be based on his nature.2. Man’s nature is that of a rational being. The rational faculty is his onlymeans of survival. His physical faculties are of no use to him without theguidance of his mind.3. The function of the rational faculty is to observe the physical world anddraw conclusions about it, thus establishing a certain truth about it. Man mustthen act on the basis of this truth. The rational faculty operates through aseries of acts of choice.4. The rational faculty is not automatic. Nothing assures man of the correctnessof his conclusions in advance. Nothing can prove an error to him—except theconsequences, observed by his rational faculty.5. Even the use of his rational faculty is not automatic. Man can choose not toexercise it—or, rather, not to exercise it in certain acts or in certain spheresof activity. He can choose to act as a robot (or second-hander). It is here thathe becomes his own destroyer.6. Man needs a moral code as a set of rules on what is right or wrong for him asa rational being. The moral faculty is a necessity of the rational faculty.7. Man observes nature and concludes what is true of it or not. He then has toact upon his knowledge. To act, he has to set himself a purpose. He estimateswhat is right or wrong for his purpose. The purpose determines the value heplaces on his acts—as means to an end. (For example: he observes that a seedgrows when planted in the ground, but not when thrown on a rock. If his purposeis to grow wheat—it is right to place seeds in the ground; it is wrong toscatter them on rocks.) Now if man has accepted it as his first moral axiom thathis survival is good, this becomes the standard of his moral code—“Man mustsurvive as man.” His moral code is a standard for his valuation of himself—hecannot consider himself good if he acts as his own destroyer. He must look athimself as a moral entity to be created by himself.8. What is the purpose of man’s survival? Happiness. Whose happiness? His own.If man’s survival is made the means to some end—and if at any point this end[conflicted with] his survival, he would have to be motivated byself-destruction. Therefore, the placing of any goal as the standard above hissurvival is evil. If man is not to survive for his own happiness, but forsomeone else‘s—then, if the claims of this other interfered with his ownhappiness, he would have to survive in suffering. Therefore the placing ofanyone’s happiness above one’s own is evil.9. There are, therefore, only two axioms to be accepted as self-evident in mymorality: (1) man must survive, and (2) man must be happy. But both of theseaxioms impty—“as man.” Man’s survival and happiness are not automatically“human.” These two axioms apply only to man as a rational being. When manchooses to act in a sub-human manner, it is no longer proper for him to survivenor to be happy. There is no reason in fact by which he can claim these tworights as natural. He cannot survive at all, if he acts on another basis; if hecannot survive, he cannot have any happiness.10. The rational faculty is individual. The only threat to its exercise lies inother men. The first demand of the rational faculty is independence.102 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_102_r1.jpg]My three cornerstones: man is an end in himself; no man exists for the sake ofanother man; each man exists for his own happiness (to be achieved by his owneffort).My chief virtues: self-reverence (the sense of the heroic in man);self-sufficiency (independence, integrity, the capacity of happiness—which isself-contained and self-justifying); worship of the ideal (define your ideal,then live by it, work toward it, find your happiness in it—make your happinessbe a response to man at his highest, not at his lowest).103 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_103_r1.jpg]People suffer because they are not appreciated—not because they get no alms.Alms, pity, and charity is precisely what they don’t want. But when their betterqualities get no justice or appreciation, they lose faith in themselves, in menand, above all, in ideals. It is at this point that they turn cynical andvicious.But before you can get appreciated—ask yourself: “For what?” You cannot beappreciated for a potentiality you have not exhibited. Act, before you demandany appreciation from others; give them objective evidence of what it is youwant them to like and admire in you; be sure you have objective (rational)standards for your achievements. (This is an example of the fact that therational is the only bond possible between men, and the only standard in alltheir relationships.) July 20, 1945By proclaiming his willingness to sacrifice himself, man acquires the right tosacrifice others. If it is asked: but is self-sacrifice easy?—it is the easiestthing in the world for the man who has no self. First, he makes a virtue of hisone most dreadful deficiency. Second, his desire to destroy others is his mostburning desire—once he has dropped his own self-respect. The man who does notrespect himself can have no love or respect for others.In practice, the actual satisfaction of all dictators is to command, humble,humiliate, hurt others (which means precisely to sacrifice others). Whatenjoyment except this one can a dictator have when he lives in debauched animalluxury and in constant fear, hatred, suspicion of even his closest friends? Notlove, but sacrifice of men becomes his only desire in relation to them.104 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_104_r1.jpg]If a man bases his values on brute force—he is saying to himself, in effect:“This method cannot keep me alive, but I can make it work by enslaving those whocan keep me alive.” Then he must realize that the method he’s chosen as properto him is not the one proper to those who must keep him alive. Then his code ofvalues will destroy them—and when they are destroyed, he will perish; thus hehas destroyed himself. So he cannot claim that his method and his code of valuesare based on man’s survival, not even on his own. It is based on man’sdestruction—because it is not human and cannot work for man.105 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_105_r1.jpg]If men claim that the rational faculty is an innate gift (which it is, or ratherits power is, just as the degree of any physical talent varies from birth) and,therefore, a man cannot be blamed if he is born with a mental capacityinsufficient for his survival, and he cannot make it the standard of hissurvival—the answer is that he has no choice except to exercise his mind to thefull extent of his capacity—and let the overflow of the better minds of othershelp him (which it does, but not at his demand). He cannot impose his need as astandard of value upon his betters, i.e., upon those who have to help himsurvive. If he has no capacity of survival, then it is precisely hisself-interest, his desire to survive, that must make him accept the standardsand values of those on whom his survival depends.106 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_106_r1.jpg]A parasite (in the physical world) destroys that upon which it feeds—like avirus that attaches itself to a living cell and kills it. Man has to destroyhimself if he lives as a parasite upon the work and souls of other men. Yetaltruism has made him just that. No other species exists as a parasite uponitself. Man does. (There is a difference here, though: an animal destroys hisfood, in the sense of killing another creature. But he does not try to exist bydestroying his fangs, horns, or whatever is his tool of survival. A humanparasite does just that: he destroys his tool—the human brain. That is why hecan be defined as a creature unfit for existence—an embodied death principle—theactual evil.)107 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_107_r1.jpg]A crucial issue exists between the conception of “self-as-is” and “self” as arational free agent. For instance, it is considered noble to have an“impersonal” attitude toward knowledge. It is implied that a personal attitudewould be, not the desire to know the truth, but the desire to gain someadvantage. Yet it is only the most personal, independent element of a man—hisrational faculty—that is capable of acquiring knowledge. Truth, therefore, ispresumed to be somehow detrimental to a man’s interests. By what, then, does heestablish his interests?108 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_108_r1.jpg]If men feel: “I’ve got to live such as I am, on the basis of my flaws,” theanswer is: “You can’t live on the basis of your flaws. Such as you are, you canlive only on the basis of your virtues.” Here the idea of “getting by” enters.The “individual,” the “subjective,” has always been held to be the irrational.Yet it is only objective reality and the tool that masters it—the rationalfaculty—that permit man any individuality at all. And for man, objective realitydemands individualism.The “subjective” school says, in effect: “I yam what I yam and that’s all Iyam.” The answer is: “Fine. But what are you?” They say: “I am born orconditioned or determined this way—and therefore I can’t be blamed for it, I’mnot bad, therefore I’m good—as is and whatever it is.” The answer is: “You areneither good nor bad. You are nothing at all. If you are a ‘determined’creature—no conceptions of morality, nor even of values, can apply to you.Nature has not given you any values automatically—nor can you define them toyourself or to others. You may try to exist by whatever it is you claim is yourcode of values. When you come to dealing with the physical world—in order tosatisfy your instincts, hunches, or condition ings—you’ll see what will happento you. You don’t know what you want nor why you want it. How do you expect toget it?” (To want anything, one must have a standard of values.)109 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_109_r1.jpg]Man may be justly proud of his natural endowments (if they are thereobjectively, i.e., rationally), such as physical beauty, physical strength, agreat mind, good health. But all of these are merely his material or his tools;his self-respect must be based, not on these attributes, but on what he doeswith them. His self-respect must be based on his actions—on that which proceedsfrom him. His survival depends on the proper kind of action. His appreciation ofhimself must be on the same principle. Every animal (and even plants) exhibitsself-respect or a kind of self-pride—an attitude of considering itself valuable,i.e., good. And it exhibits [this attitude] in direct proportion to its fitnessfor survival. Man’s fitness for survival lies in his rational faculty. Thesurvival of the fittest—as applied to man? It is the survival of the best mind;the best mind is the most independent; the most independent man is the mostmoral man. If we understood this correctly—the survival of the fittest does meanof the best. But the best—for man—is not brute force, nor cunning, nor slyness,nor any quality that depends upon the existence (and sacrifice) of other men inorder to be exercised.If a man says: “But I realize that my natural endowments are mediocre—shall Ithen suffer, be ashamed, have an inferiority complex?” The answer is: “In thebasic, crucial sphere, the sphere of morality and action, it is not yourendowments that matter, but what you do with them.” It is here that all men arefree and equal, regardless of natural gifts. You can be, in your own modestsphere, as good morally as the genius is in his—if you live by the same rules.Find your goal within yourself, in whatever work you are honestly capable ofperforming. Never make others your prime goal. Demand nothing from others as anunearned gift and grant them nothing unearned. Live by your own rationaljudgments. Be independent in whatever judgments you hold or actions youundertake, and do not venture beyond your own capacity, into spheres whereyou’ll have to become a parasite and a second-hander. You’ll be surprised howdecent and wonderful a human being you’ll become, and how much honest,legitimate human affection and appreciation you’ll get from others.As to material rewards, you’ll get what you deserve, what you have produced. Thegreater rewards received by men of greater ability do not concern you—becausethey were not taken from you. There is no point and no sense in your hating theman of superior ability because he has more material wealth than you have. It ishis ability that produced the wealth. If he had no such ability or if youdestroyed him—it still would not make you able to produce that wealth. All youcan do is rob him. His ability does not hamper yours, it merely surpasses it.And so do the material rewards. There is no point in your hating a beautifulwoman for being more beautiful than you are; if she lost her beauty or if youkilled her, it would not make you more beautiful. You’ll say, but men wouldconsider me more beautiful then, without the comparison? Not necessarily.Standards of beauty, like any standards, are set by a certain ideal ofperfection, usually personal to each man. You will not be any nearer toperfection by eliminating a rival who was nearer.No, moral virtue is not its only reward. But it cannot give you rewards you haveneither earned nor deserved. Moral virtue will give you just what youdeserve—and this is quite a great deal. (Particularly if you choose to make it agreat deal and exert the needed effort.) Moral virtue will give you justice. Andmore than that neither men nor nature can give you.If men’s desperate rebellion against the objective world, reason, and justiceis, at [root], a rebellion against the shortcomings of their own naturalendowments, if men scream so much against the “injustice” of being born withoutsome special great talent or desirable faculty—why don’t they exercise suchfaculties as they have, instead? Most of their unhappiness in this line (withthe possible exception of physical beauty) comes from second-handedness. Theydon’t want to write—they want the fame, money, and prestige of a writer. If theyhad an actual, personal desire to write, i.e., if they had something tosay—without any second-handedness involved, no desire to impress, nor any desireto re-hash some plagiarized ideas—they would have the talent. Men usually havethe talent for that which they want to do—if they really want to do it, i.e., iftheir primary motive is personal, not second-hand.110 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_110_r1.jpg]The pattern of spiritual human relationship under my code of ethics has the formof a sale—value for value received; the pattern under the code of altruism isthat of graft—of a bribe.July 21, 1945Advice to people on what to do under my ethics: name your action by its actualname, i.e., be conscious at any moment of what it is you’re doing. Above all, beconscious of what you’re doing in the long run, of your overall meaning andgoal. People think from moment to moment—they don’t connect—they have notacquired the idea of a whole life. That is why they whine in middle age: “Whatwas it all about?” (They exist in the manner of consciousness of an animal.)111 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_111_r1.jpg]Make a note of the way in which people actually lose all capacity to think whenthey appoint themselves as thinkers for others, as molders or expressers of“public opinion.” They do make sense in their specific, individual and selfishjob. But there is a peculiar, special kind of rottenness that [takes hold] inthem the moment they begin to think in or for “the public.”This applies both to such cases as a reader who has good independent judgmentuntil he becomes an editor—and to such cases as when a man has to defend hisviews in public. This last may be due either to the innocent fact of beingunprepared and not connecting new ideas fast enough—or to the much more viciousfact that a man feels no necessity to have any “wider” convictions(philosophical, social, or political), but feels he must have them aswindow-dressing, so whatever nonsense he spouts, he spouts only to make a“cultured” impression on the listener. He doesn’t want to believe, he only wantsto convince you he believes something. Now this is real second-handedness inoperation; abstract convictions, ethics, ideals, philosophies are [regarded as]only a social convention, only a means to an end. That is the real absence of anego.How do those people exist? Not too well. Obviously they’re not happy and they’rerunning from themselves. But can anything be taught to them? Can they be showntheir own emptiness? This is hard to answer. I suppose, not until they want tosee it. Not until some form of suffering makes them question themselves. Thething that puzzles me is only: how do those people exist at all, withoutrealizing that central emptiness? Isn’t it something they should discover forthemselves and at once? The truth is probably that they have some most peculiar,logically twisted substitute or excuse or justification. The thing that bothersme here is: how can people live in inconsistency? The immediate answer would be:because it’s so difficult to be consistent and rational (and besides they havebeen trained not to be). Therefore, they take inconsistency as a law ofexistence, they’re bewildered, they can’t untangle things—but they have to go onliving, so they let it go at that.The main difference between me and them is that I try to keep my thinkingstraight and give my complete, honest, interested attention to any intellectualargument. They either don’t want to try, or are indifferent, or actually resentit when brought face to face with the necessity to think and connect. I try tolive consciously, from the basic principle on up to every detail. They live,essentially, by chance. The most important questions are the ones they won’t orcan’t face. July 22, 1945Knowledge grows from basic premises like a plant from a seed. The seed is like abasic premise in which all the details and consequences of the future plant arecontained—and only a certain plant can grow from a certain seed. Once you haveaccepted a basic premise, you will have to follow and accept all theconsequences, because they are in the seed. You have no power to change thenature of the universe, the nature of matter or its laws; and you have no powerto change the nature of a logical sequence. But where is your freedom and thefield of your free will? In exercising [your reason] to understand [nature] anduse it as material to fulfill your purpose. You set the goal and the meaning;the field of choice and possibilities is immense; the only necessity involved isthat you use the material as it is and your tool (reason) as it is—that youunderstand them for what they are before you choose or achieve a purpose.Do not call it a “limit.” The basic fact of reality is a “limit”—the fact ofexistence, which presupposes an entity, which means a thing differentiated bycertain intrinsic, essential attributes from that which it is not. “To be”implies a “limit”—a distinction from that which is not. If you demanded“freedom” from the natural world—you would demand, in effect, anundifferentiated chaos, the non-existence of entities, actually more thandeath—the annihilation of the conception of the possibility of living.112 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_112_r1.jpg]We apply reason to the material world, but not to the spiritual, not toourselves. The material world gives us an objective standard, a starting point,a solid fact, the something from which we have to proceed—since we cannot createsomething out of nothing, or base something on nothing. There is no suchstandard in the spiritual world. Yet the rational faculty should be thatstarting point. And a moral code should be that standard.In dealing with physical nature each man is an independent judge: he willconsider a car good if the car runs—and he will make sure that he sees the carrunning. But in the spiritual world men are second-handers: they place thequality of judgment within the consciousness of others, being lost and unsurewithin their own. So we have the paradox that in physical matters the actualvalue and performance of the product is the standard (people will buy a car ifit is a good car), but in spiritual matters (precisely in the realm of greatest,absolute individualism) the collective counting of noses is the standard (a bookis good if people buy it). Physical values are thus ethical (based onvalue-judgments) and personal—but spiritual values are non-moral and“commercial” in the most vulgar sense of the word. Physical values become an endin themselves, moral values a means to an end. (There is here a strange circle.Our rational faculty is the means of obtaining satisfaction from the physicalworld. But the satisfaction is spiritual, since the physical is only a means tothe satisfaction of our desires—and of more than our physical desires.)113 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_113_r1.jpg]The essence of morality is to desire that which is good. But we must define whatis good—and that is the purpose of a code of ethics.This point must cover and account for the fact that some people admit virtuewithout desiring it—such as Mallory’s “the genius recognized too well—the peoplewho see it and don’t want it”; or “He’s a saint—I don’t like saints.”Is the cause here the fact that people think of morality as an arbitrarilyprescribed code of ethics, the Christian code, and rebel against it? Isn’t thegreatest error of all morality the fact that the moral systems prescribedconcrete rules, arbitrarily, instead of general principles that would allow menprecisely the essence of morality—a free choice between good and evil? Thinkthis over. The key here is the relation of the abstract to the concrete, of thegeneral to the particular—and the need is that of a clear statement of the linedividing the two and of the relationship between the two.What actually happens when men get lost in abstractions? What is the nature andcause of a “floating abstraction”?Think over the relation of “survival” to happiness, the exact point in theprocess of man choosing a goal. And the relation of the material to thespiritual.Humanitarians claim to hate suffering, and therefore to make it their goal toeliminate it. They take for granted that happiness is automatic, but sufferingis not and therefore we must direct our actions at eliminating suffering. But itis precisely happiness (or good or virtue) that is not automatic and must beachieved by effort and purposeful action. Suffering comes automatically from theabsence of action. (To be exact, the absence of the right action; if you donothing at all, or if you make a mistake and do nothing to correct it, that’swhen suffering will come automatically as your proper, natural punishment.Everything good—desirable—has to be achieved.)But you want to act to relieve the suffering of others? Can you? To what extent?And why should you? And at what price? And is that the chief goal of life? Isyour goal to run around correcting errors—or to act straight?114 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_114_r1.jpg]Here there enters the question of what it is you love when you love “Man.”Again, a reversal of the abstract and the concrete that destroys the concrete.By loving “Man” as an abstraction in the sense of loving any and all men, youend up by loving the worst of men. By loving “Man” as an ideal, you love actualmen and the best among them. What is the difference between “abstract” and“general”? Between “archetype” or “ideal” and “average”? There might be animportant key here. July 23, 1945The person who believes in determinism (personal or historical) merely confessesthe truth about himself: he is not a prime-mover, he does not know what makeshim act or how or why—therefore he assumes that others are equally “determined,”floating non-entities pushed around by chance. Having no prime-moving ego withinhimself, such a person assumes one of two things: either that others are equallyuncertain—therefore “something” outside moves us all; or that others know anddecide, while he can‘t—so he accepts them as the mover and the standard. Usuallyit’s both, since the essence of a second-hander’s thinking is that he does notthink, therefore none of his premises are too clear and all of them arecontradictory. If this were not so, if he were completely consistent withanything, he wouldn’t be a second-hander.115 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_115_r1.jpg]Can purpose determine entity? Purpose presupposes the one (a consciousness) whosets the purpose. And man is that one—the standard, the point of beginning.Think this over. (Plato said function determines virtue. I mean something muchmore than that.) July 27, 1945An animal can have self-respect automatically—“I am good such as I am,” becausethe capacity of self-destruction is not within him. A man’s self-respect (andinstinct of self-preservation) must be conscious (based on a standard of values)because he can be his own destroyer. That is his great innate fear—and one ofthe causes of his rebellion against reason, against the terrible responsibilitywhich the rational faculty involves.116 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_116_r1.jpg]The tendency of all civilization has been toward division of labor—notcollectivization. Toward splitting jobs into separate activities—not towarddoing things more and more “together.” All economic progress has come from that.But, it may be said, since each man does only a part of the whole—shouldn’tthere be a collective direction and shouldn’t the whole direct the parts? Thewhole does direct the parts—by the mechanism of supply and demand, which isactually the verdict of the majority upon what kind of work it wishes done. Butit is the whole as a number of individual units acting independently, eachexercising his judgment for his own good. It is not the artificial arrangementof a “whole” out of units that cannot be added together, a whole that involvesthe sacrifice of some parts to others and is not, therefore, a whole. Each manshould have a say about economic production and consumption? He does. Byproducing and by buying. In this way, each man decides for himself, and the“whole” is the sum of such decisions. In the collectivist way, each would haveto decide for all—which is impossible in practice and vicious in concept, sinceit is the diametric opposite of human nature.July 28, 1945The mental and moral corruption of so-called intellectuals is due to the factthat they are the real class of “exploiters.” Men cannot be enslaved by sheerforce alone—it would take too many people, so no parasitical minority couldenslave the productive majority. The enslavement has to be done by spiritualmeans, by making men feel that their slavery is “right.” (This was done by everytyrant in history and by modem dictators.) Therefore it’s the “intellectuals”who become the spearhead, the professional tools and source of any humanenslavement. They’re second-handers, collectivists, altruists—and getting paidfor nothing. They believe that one can build that mode of living into a system.Defeat collectivists and altruists by the single method of contempt. Take awaytheir aura of holiness. Look at them for what they are—parasites.117 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_117_r1.jpg]The usual reason [given for] moral corruption is hatred for mankind—a man usescollectivism as an excuse for his own rottenness—“he can’t help it, others arevicious, he’s got to get along.” Thus he switches the responsibility. “Others”are his excuse. But there is no excuse. A man’s estimate of mankind is only areflection of his estimate of himself. You think man as such is rotten? (Not themajority, but man as such.) It’s only you who are rotten. If you think you’recapable of virtue, but others are not—you’re a human being, therefore man assuch can be virtuous. The majority can’t? Why should that concern you? Keep themajority (or anyone) from power, keep society free—and you have nothing to worryabout. July 30, 1945[AR is here rewriting and expanding on her notes from September 6, 1943. Thefirst few pages have been omitted because the content was not significantlydifferent from the 1943 notes.]The purpose of a moral code is the preservation of man’s nature, i.e., thepreservation of man as man.Every living thing exercises a form of choice—to the extent of assimilating onlythose elements which are necessary to its survival, not any and all elementsindiscriminately. A plant absorbs particular chemicals out of the soil. Ananimal hunts particular foods. To live, a living thing must have a code ofvalues: that which is good for it and that which is not. Its survival is thestandard, the measure of value. But for a plant or an animal, the standard, thevalues, the method of survival and the exercise of that method are automatic; noother choice is possible; no conscious choice is necessary.Man’s method of survival is not automatic. He must establish it by consciouschoice based on a rational observation of nature and of himself; he mustdiscover what he is, what he needs, how he must act in order to exist. He mustestablish his own code of values. Its standard must still be the same: survival.But the values he establishes must be the ones needed by and appropriate to hisone and only means of survival—the human means—the rational faculty.A moral code is man’s statement of the principles that permit him to function asman. It is his protection against becoming his own destroyer. It is a set ofvalues upon which he bases his rules of conduct, the rules of what is right orwrong for him as a rational being. The moral faculty is a part and a necessityof the rational faculty.The establishment of values requires a standard. The concept of “value”presupposes an entity to whom an object or action is valuable. Moral valuesconstitute a code of good and evil. By what standard are they to be set?Good—for whom? Good—for what?Man’s nature sets the standard of his moral code. Man’s survival sets thepurpose. His proper morality is based on a single axiom:MAN EXISTS AND MUST SURVIVE AS MAN.All that which preserves man’s nature as a rational being is good. All thatwhich destroys it is evil. All the actions based on, proceeding from, inaccordance with man’s nature as a rational being are good. All the actions thatcontradict it are evil. All the forms and conditions of existence that permitman to function as a rational being are good. All the forms and conditions ofexistence that prevent it are evil.The actions, conditions, motivations, and qualities required by and for thefunction of man’s rational faculty are man’s virtues—by sanction of the factthat they constitute man’s life principle, his means of survival, the forms,expressions and essence of his living energy.It must be carefully noted, at this point, that the word “man” denotes aconcrete, specific, existing entity—not “mankind,” which is a collectiveabstraction. An entity survives by surviving; a “kind” may attempt to survive byslaughtering nine-tenths of the entities composing it.Before we proceed to analyze in detail the implications contained in the aboveaxiom and the specific code of behavior it demands, we must stop to examine andfully understand the nature of the axiom itself.It consists of three facts which must be accepted as self-evident: 1) that manexists, 2) that man is a rational being, 3) that man’s survival is desirable. 1) Any conception or discussion of man’s existence is an axiom implying threeparts: that man exists, that an objective world exists around him, and that hehas the faculty of rational consciousness which enables him to know the externalworld. [This is AR’s first discussion of the axioms of existence andconsciousness; see John Galt’s speech for her definitive formulations.]These three facts need not and cannot be proved. Any proof rests on them andimplies them as axioms. Proof by physical demonstration implies a physical fact(in the external world) demonstrated to an observer (man) who grasps it througha faculty of consciousness which permits him to grasp it (the rational faculty).Proof by rational demonstration implies an entity (man) who possesses a facultyof consciousness (the rational faculty) which permits him to acquire knowledgeabout facts (in the external world). Proof cannot begin in a vacuum. Existencebegins by existing. Proof begins with something that exists proving somethingabout something that exists.The nature of man and the nature of the world in which he lives are notself-evident. It is the function of man’s mind to give him knowledge of himselfand of the world—the knowledge of what he is and of what it is. But that he isand that it is are axioms implicit in the mere fact of consciousness, axiomspreceding and permitting the perceptions, conceptions and definitions whichconstitute his knowledge.A stupendous amount of writing has been done as an alleged demonstration of thefact that no objective world exists outside of man—or that man does not reallyexist—or that he exists but has no mind—or that nothing really exists at all.But since all the volumes of such demonstrations simply amount to: “Myobservations of the world lead me to conclude that it doesn’t exist, thatthere’s nobody observing it and that there’s no faculty to observe it with,” wecan safely take these theories and their authors at their own word—asnon-existent. 2) The assertion that man has no rational faculty is a contradiction in terms.An attempt to lift oneself by one’s own bootstraps is the physical counterpartof a man proclaiming as a fact the fact that he has no capacity for graspingfacts. ([Note added later:] By means of what does an irrationalist demonstratethat reason doesn’t exist?)The anti-rationalist doctrine (remember that “anti-rationalist” means“anti-necessity-to-make-sense”) is extremely old, has a long, bloody history andas many variations as skin disease. That doctrine has no intelligiblecontent—but a most intelligible purpose, since the rational faculty is the badgeof man’s freedom. That doctrine has always preceded and accompanied theslaughter and enslavement of men. Its current version is known as “dialecticmaterialism.” It holds that man has no mind. It holds choice as an illusion andreason as a by-product of the physical environment, nutrition, and some sort ofa voodoo process named “conditioning,” which makes reason operate withoutvolition, automatically. Translated into human language, this doctrine claimsthat the operations of reason work on the following pattern: if you had oatmealfor breakfast, you will think that two and two make four; if not, you’ll thinkit’s six.A statement such as: “Man’s thinking is conditioned by his background” is merelya confession that the speaker has no conception of what constitutes thinking,and that those to whom the statement might apply are not men whose thinking isconditioned, but men who do not think at all. The appalling collection ofmiscellaneous garbage which present-day men hold to be their intellectualconvictions has no resemblance to or connection with the act of thought. Itwould be useless to argue that some backgrounds bring some men to a state wherethey cannot think. The only men who cannot think are those who are or belong ininsane asylums. That a great many men do not choose to think is another matter.There are reasons for such a choice, which we shall examine later; the chiefreason can be mentioned now—thinking is not done automatically.The proponents of the doctrine that denies the existence of man’s rationalfaculty claim to have reached their doctrine by—rational deduction. They urge usto improve our physical environment in order to improve the by-product, ourbrain, and they urge us to take such action through a conscious decision of—ourrational faculty. If a dialectical materialist asks at this point: “But whyshould I have to make sense?”—the answer is: “You don’t have to. Just rememberthat you don’t.”Then there is a school of opinion which describes itself loosely as“naturalistic” or “realistic.” The arguments of this school amount to: Man’sbody has many similarities to an animal’s body, therefore man’s consciousness islike that of an animal, therefore man is ruled by instincts, therefore reason isa delusion, therefore the way a rat goes about getting to a piece of cheese in amaze is the way man goes about building the Rheims Cathedral.By this type of argument one could say that an animal’s body has so manysimilarities with a plant’s that the animal’s consciousness and manner of livingought to be like a plant‘s, therefore his basic distinction—the power oflocomotion—is an illusion, therefore an animal ought to dig his paws into theground and stay there, because it is unnatural for him to do more.It is precisely by observing nature that we discover that a living organismendowed with an attribute higher and more complex than the attributes possessedby the organisms below him in nature’s scale shares many functions with theselower organisms. But these functions are modified by his higher attribute andadapted to its function—not the other way around. Plants possess digestive andreproductive organs; animals possess digestive and reproductive organs plus thepower of locomotion. An animal’s stomach is not that of a plant; it is notadapted to the needs of an organism attached by roots to the ground, but to theneeds of an organism that obtains its food by moving.Man possesses digestive and reproductive organs, plus the power of locomotion,plus the faculty of reason. The distinction of an animal from a plant is thepower of a self-moving body; the distinction of a man from an animal is thepower of a self-moving mind. Whatever organs and attributes man may possess,they are modified by and adapted to the needs of a being who survives throughthe use of his mind. His nature is not to be discovered by what he has in commonwith lower animals—but by what he has and they haven’t.If it is biased not to notice similarities between a man and an amoeba—what sortof bias prompts those who do not notice the differences? Man is a rationalbeing, according to the plain, hard, material facts of reality. Those whoimagine themselves as harsh realists when they say: “Man is just an animal ruledby his stomach,” had better remember what puts food into a human stomach andwhat must be preserved if there is to be any food—or any stomach.Since no road is ever muddy enough but that someone will rush to plump himselfinto its middle, there are a great many middle-of-the-roaders on this issue, whoclaim that man has a mind all right, except that he’s not able to use it. Mancannot, they say, be called a rational being because his actions are notmotivated by his mind; his mind is like his Sunday clothes, kept in a darkcloset and donned reluctantly on rare occasions; and when donned, it makes himstiff, uncomfortable and unhappy, because it never fit him well in the firstplace. What man does on weekdays, they say, is to gallop about stark-naked, onall fours, because it reminds him of his mother who gave him a complex, and towhirl around catching his own tail which he hasn’t got but feels he has; that iswhat he does because it makes him happy. Reason? Reason, they say, is justsomething he uses in such negligible, incidental matters as earning a living.([Note added later:] There’s no basic contradiction or conflict between the“physical” and the “spiritual.” There are no different sets of rules orprinciples for them. They’re based on and proceed from the same principle.)It is pointless to argue with theinstinct—feeling—urge—emotion—compulsion-sub-conscious boys and to debate whatpercentage of man’s nature can be called rational. It is simpler to take them attheir word. Even if we suppose that man is not a rational being, but a howlingneurosis endowed with one percent of rationality—it still remains true that inorder to survive he must take rational actions rationally thought out fromrational motives, and that unless he does so, he won’t be there to enjoy hissub-conscious. Let it be but one percent of his nature, his rational faculty isall that matters in him and all that counts. It must still be taken as hisdominant trait—because it is his sole lease on life. He can survive only to theextent that he is able to exist in accordance with it. When and if he is unableto do so—he has stated and signed his death warrant. There is no point indiscussing the way of life proper to a creature who has no means to keep itselfalive.Your inexplicable emotions? Your great big dark mysterious urges? Yourirresistible impulses? Your desires for you don’t know what you don’t know why?Go right ahead and roll in them as in any other gutter. But remember that whenyou lie on a barren stretch of soil, with a single seed of wheat in your hand,all your emotions, urges, and desires will not make the seed grow. Only yourmind will. 3) Every living thing is motivated by the instinct of self-preservation. This isimplicit in the mere fact of life. Life is a matter of motion and activity; aliving thing not motivated by self-preservation would not and could not preserveitself. But a plant’s or an animal’s method of survival is automatic, i.e.,instinctive; therefore its motive is an instinct. Man’s survival is not achievedinstinctively; therefore an instinct is inadequate to motivate it. His motivemust be conscious.([Note added later:] Most men actually have no desire to survive—in fact, theyact as if they had accepted the opposite premise; their actions are consistentwith a hatred of life.)Man needs a rational decision, an axiom understood and consciously accepted: Iwish to survive—my survival is desirable. In accepting this, he has accepted thestandard and the first axiom of morality.In morality man’s life is taken as the supreme value. It is the gauge by whichthe value of every part, aspect and action of his existence is to be measured.If anyone now asks: But why do I have to hold my survival as desirable?—Theanswer is: You don’t have to. It is an axiom, to be accepted as self-evident. Ifit is not self-evident to you, you have an alternative: admit that your survivalis not desirable and get out of the way. There is no middle-ground and no middlechoice. The act of evading this issue, making no decision, closing your mind andjust floating along, is precisely the act of suspending your rational faculty—ofrefusing to observe a fact, to identify it and to understand it. It is theprimary act of your self-destruction. With that as your first premise, you willnot survive—and the span of life you have at your disposal will be a successionof acts leading to your self-annihilation, as the history of mankind and of mostprivate lives has amply demonstrated. You have many choices open to you, but thechoice is saying: “I don’t have to decide whether life is desirable, I’ll justlive” is not one of them. That choice is not given to you because the life yourefer to is a human life, and a human life is not preserved automatically.A moral code is not a sentimental luxury, nor a pretty dream, nor an arbitrarydecree, nor an impractical abstraction. It is the hardest, most practical of allnecessities—because without it no practical action nor any kind of life ispossible.But a moral code—like any other rational conception—cannot be forced upon men.It must be accepted. Those who wish to accept what is to follow, are asked toaccept as self-evident a single axiom:MAN EXISTS AND MUST SURVIVE AS MAN.August 3, 1945The “common man” doesn’t understand the gibberish of the “intellectuals”—because the common man relates abstractions to the concrete. It takes asecond-hander, a collectivist intellectual, to run amuck among “floatingabstractions.” August 4, 1945It is the doctrine of altruism that stops men from thinking. They have beenbattered by altruism and have accepted it before they reach the age of reasonand begin to think. Then altruism stops them—because the very nature of thinkingis not merely unsocial, but anti-social: it is profoundly selfish, it impliessetting oneself apart from and above all others. So men feel (and justly, bytheir standards of morality) that they are doing something vicious when theyattempt to think. (Why is every thinking, independent person called “hard,”“conceited,” “arrogant,” “selfish”?)August II, 1945 When fools say that technical progress destroys man, that themachine is bad for him, it makes him evil, etc.—the actual fact behind thephenomenon they describe is that man’s moral thinking is centuries behind hisscientific or “practical” thinking. He has never discovered the morality thatwould permit him to use and enjoy the machine properly. He has not discoveredthat reason is his only weapon and standard for dealing with both physicalnature and with himself.118 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_118_r1.jpg]For self-reverence: we must begin with love for the conception of man as arational entity, free to create himself—and then we must live up to it.119 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_119_r1.jpg]To start his code of ethics, man must recognize himself for what he is: anindependent entity. On that basis he can demand his own happiness. (Hishappiness and all the means to it must be created by himself.)If, by the altruistic code, a man is evil if he is happy, but good if he makesothers happy, then those others are either: 1) evil because they are happy,therefore a man is good by making others evil, or 2) good because they are happynot through their own efforts but through an unearned gift. In this last casethey are considered good because they have not acted in accordance with man’snature, which demands that he produce what he consumes.Nature demands just one thing of man: “Make sense”—“Use your rationalfaculty”—“Don’t expect me to be what I am not.” August 22, 1945THE RATIONAL FACULTYThe rational faculty is an attribute of the individual.There is no such thing as a collective brain. There is no such thing as acollective thought.A thought held by many men is not held “in common.” It is held by eachindividual man in his own individual mind. If three men think that “Life isdesirable,” the idea is not broken up into three separate parts, one held byeach man—one man holding the concept of “life,” another the concept of “is,” thethird the concept of “desirable”—and the three parts uniting somewhere in theether to form a complete idea held collectively.We may multiply to infinity the number of men involved or the complexity of theidea they hold—and the fact remains the same.An idea, simple or complex, cannot be held in half by two men, working togetheras a Siamese-twin unit or collective. A man cannot say in reference to hisideas: “I’ve only got the nouns and the adverbs—my brother Joe’s got the verbsand the adjectives—we think kinda like a team.” An idea is not a jig-saw puzzlewhose pieces can be scattered among various participants, while a mysticalsuper-entity-the collective—puts the picture together, with none of them seeingor grasping the whole. An idea, an intelligible mental conception, is held inits entirety in the mind of one man. Another man may hold the same idea—in itsentirety and in his own mind.A scientist who has arrived at a complicated scientific theory is not therepository of a collective thought composed of contributions by Aristotle, RogerBacon and on down; his own mind has grasped, understood and passed judgment upona great many ideas presented to him by a great many men through the ages, haseliminated some of them, has accepted others, and has reached a conclusion,which constitutes a rational conviction. If his mind has not done that, butmerely contains an undigested junk heap of unrelated information, such contentis not thought, nor is it related to thought, nor is it related to the processof a human mind, but to the process and content of a dictaphone [a machine, nowobsolete, to record dictated material].Different men may hold knowledge of different facts, which, when put together,lead to new ideas and a wider knowledge. But such putting together can be doneonly by a rational process in the mind of one man who assimilates the newknowledge supplied to him by others, relates it to the fact that he knows, formsconclusions and produces a new, coherent, intelligible whole. Any of the othermen involved may perform the same process. But each has to perform it alone, inhis own mind, rationally grasping every step in the process if he is to graspthe whole. If none of the men has performed the process and none has grasped thewhole—there is no whole. There is no new idea born. There is no collective brainfor it to be born in.An agreement reached by a group of men, in which separate men have contributedseparate parts, is not a collective thought. It is the result of thought, theproduct, the secondary consequence. The primary act—the process of reason, theprocess of observing, considering, passing judgment—had to be performed by eachman alone. If one of the men involved corrected his own conclusion because ofthe convincing evidence presented by another man, he has done so by anindependent act of his own reasoning mind; if he has not performed such an act,but has merely agreed, blindly and without judgment—what he has done is not anact of thinking, nor is the final agreement a thought in his mind, nor has hecontributed anything to any agreement or thought, nor will that final agreementreached by others do him any good.Men may share their knowledge, not their thinking. Knowledge is not thinking; itis the result of thinking, the product of the process of thought. The process ofthought is one activity—among many others—that cannot be performed collectively.That which man produces can be shared but not that which made him capable ofproducing it. A man can chop up a pile of wood and divide among other men thelogs he has cut—but not the strength of his arm. A man can perform a rationalprocess and offer to others the conclusions he has reached—but not the power ofhis brain. All the functions of man’s body and mind are private, personal,individual. They cannot be shared or transferred.We can divide a meal among many men. We cannot digest it in a collectivestomach. No amount of love and self-sacrifice will enable a man to use his lungsto breathe for another man. No quantity of G.P.U. agents will enable a man tothink through the brain of another.Any consultation among men, any exchange of thoughts, is only an exchange ofproducts. Every man involved must perform an independent process of reasonbefore he can accept or reject an idea. No possible effort by the others cangive him anything of value without that basic capacity of his own. The productis secondary—the capacity primary. A thought cannot be imparted to a manincapable of thinking. The rational faculty is like a broadcasting station: itsproduct cannot be transmitted to those who lack a receiving set.The rational faculty can neither be shared nor added. It does not grow byaddition. It has a singular, but no plural. Men can unite their physical force,but not their brain power. Two young boys can join their strength to lift aweight, and their combined strength will equal approximately that of an adultman. Two half-wits do not equal one intelligent man. Nor do two intelligent menunited produce an entity of double intelligence. The combined physical power ofa group of ten average men is ten times that of each member of the group. Thecombined mental power of a group often average men is exactly that of the mostintelligent member of the group—and no higher. The rational faculty has noplural.Even the addition of men’s physical power is possible only in a few instances ofits many applications—such as in lifting weights or in destroying and smashingthings. If a group of men were lined up and ordered to run a race together, as acollective, maintaining a united front or unbroken line throughout—theircombined speed would not equal the sum of their individual speeds, nor even thespeed of the fastest man among them, but that of the slowest. Their collectiveeffort would not lift them to the level of the best, but reduce them to thelevel of the worst. The lowest common denominator is always just that—thelowest.If a group of men were ordered to solve an intellectual problem together, as acollective, acting in unison, taking no step without common assent andunderstanding—their combined effort would not equal the capacity of the bestbrain among them, but of the dullest. And, as a matter of fact, the actualresult—if any—would be somewhere below the result produced by the dullest oneworking on his own; because, left alone, he would be unhampered.Thousands of years ago, one man, somewhere in a forgotten jungle, looked attrees and thought of gathering their branches into the shape of a hut forshelter. Others saw his work and copied it. Their descendants inherited the hut.One among them thought of planting posts upright to support horizontal beams.The hut became a house. The post-and-lintel house became the Parthenon. Mendiscovered the principle of the arch—and the Parthenon became the Pantheon. Mendiscovered the principle of the flying buttress—and the Pantheon became theRheims Cathedral. Men learned to make structural steel—and the Rheims Cathedralbecame the Empire State Building. But all through the process, what meninherited from other men was only the product of their thinking. The movingforce in the process—the determining force—was man’s rational faculty that tookthe product as material, used it and originated the next step.In each new step, the achievement was not that of the originator’s predecessors;their achievement had been there before; the part of a newly created objectwhich constituted an achievement was not that which had been known before, butthat which had not been known; not what the achievement was based on, but whathad been added to that base. It was not the inventor of the hut who made theskyscraper possible—he made the hut possible; nor was it the designer of theParthenon, nor any of the men who left their achievements to their heirs. Theskyscraper was made possible by the thought of the man who designed it—to theexact extent to which the thought was new, i.e., his own.In any period of mankind’s progress, the credit for what is done does not belongto a collective achievement of the past. First, it was not a collectiveachievement, not the group production of a group working as a group—but anaggregate of single, specific achievements by single, individual men. Second,even if viewed vaguely and inaccurately as a “collective achievement” in thesense of representing a sum, the past achievements in any period are just that:past. They are done, finished, completed—inert. What is done from then on, whatis added to them, what is discovered, defined, invented, created for the firsttime in what constitutes the achievement. The credit belongs to the man who madethe new step.No matter how many steps were taken to reach any stage in the development of anyparticular human product, no matter how many men perfected single details—eachstep was the work, the creation and the achievement of some one individual man.Someone had to think of it.If several men thought of it simultaneously, as when inventors make similardiscoveries independently of one another, it still remains true that each had toarrive at his conclusion through a rational process of his own. An argument suchas “If Columbus hadn’t discovered America, somebody else would have,” ispointless and meaningless. Yes, somebody else would have—if he had acted asColumbus did, i.e., if he had ventured out on an untried journey guided by anidea of his own, unshared and unsanctioned by the majority of hiscontemporaries. It is of no importance how many men could have equaled theachievement of Columbus and discovered America. The fact remains that he did andthey didn’t.The usual cry of mediocrities about [what] they could have invented if someoneelse hadn’t beaten them to it can be answered simply by pointing to theinexhaustible potentialities still open and unexplored in every field of humanendeavor. Let them design a new safety-pin before they start whining about howthe Wright brothers beat them to [the discovery of the airplane].It would be pointless to debate whether one man actually thought of making a hutall by himself, or whether the first hut represented a long series of stepsinvented by many men in succession. The process of achievement remains the same:a single man making a new step, in some cases a small, imperceptible step—inothers, a gigantic leap forward. We do not know the authors of mankind’s firstachievements because their names have not been recorded. But we do know fromrecorded history that no achievement, great or small, has ever burst uponmankind spontaneously out of nowhere and nobody—nor, as fools believe, out ofeverywhere and everybody. It came from some one man.We can also observe that the development of every particular sphere of man’screative activity has not been an even, microscopic succession of contributions,like a procession of ants each adding a grain of dust to the common line. Inevery sphere—art, literature, music, science, invention, philosophy—the line ofprogress has shot from mountain peak to mountain peak, from one single burst oflight to another, from a key name marking a turning point to another key name atthe threshold of a new direction. The valleys, the candle drops and the modestfootsteps between such points were filled by many men, each elaborating some onedetail of the giant’s heritage. The accomplishments of these modest men are notto be despised; they were authentic contributions and they must be given theirvalue—but no more than their value. It is not out of their collected effortsthat the basic, crucial, epoch-making achievements have come. It is these great,single achievements that gave them a field in which to work, each to the extentof his own talent.If anyone wishes to claim that the greater the achievement the more men wererequired to reach it, the history of every creative profession will prove theexact opposite: the greater, the more primary, the more cardinal theachievement—the fewer men were responsible for it. Only the sphere of polishing,elaborating, pressing seams and ironing wrinkles involved many smallcontributions by many different men. The design of an in-built ashtray is acontribution to the appearance and comfort of an automobile; it is not the samekind of contribution as that made by the man who designed the internalcombustion engine. The automobile is not their collective product on equalterms.There is no anonymous achievement. There is no collective creation. No step wastaken anywhere—no single nail was designed—by a group of men working in unisonunder the guidance of a majority vote. Every step in the development of a greatdiscovery bears the name of its originator. Behind the most complex of moderninventions we find the names of five or ten men—out of the billions who livedand died during the years when the invention was being perfected. There was nocollective achievement involved. There never has been. There never will be.There never can be. There is no collective brain. March 22, 1946[Some men] think that being “instinctive” or “spontaneous” is being oneself—thatis, if no rational process is involved. But what lies behind one’s“spontaneity”? Isn’t it the thinking one has done? And isn’t rational thinkingthe most truly personal and independent activity of all? Has Aristotle’sidea—that the rational in us is “God” or “the impersonal”—something to do withthis? The rational is God-like, i.e., independent, but it is not impersonal. Thetruly independent is the truly personal.This is for “reason and emotions.”"},{"pageContent":"9TOP SECRETIn 1944, AR was hired as a screenwriter by Hal Wallis, the producer ofCasablanca. Wallis had just opened his own production studio, and she was thefirst screenwriter he hired. Her contract called for her to work for him sixmonths a year for the next five years.In late 1945, Wallis suggested that AR write an original screenplay about thedevelopment of the atomic bomb. Although she was interested in the project, sherecalled years later.I told him I wouldn’t because we would probably disagree politically.... I toldhim that I couldn’t undertake such a thing unless I had an agreement with himthat nothing would be put into the picture that clashed with my political ideas.If he were willing to do that, then I would do the script.AR wrote a paper for Wallis explaining the essential ideas that her script wouldcontain. The paper, entitled An Analysis of the Proper Approach to a Picture onthe Atomic Bomb, is presented below.Wallis did agree to AR’s approach, and she began her research. She interviewedseveral of the key men who worked on the bomb, including Dr. J. RobertOppenheimer, the scientific director. AR’s notes from these interviews arepresented here, followed by her synopsis of the proposed screenplay.Regrettably, the movie was never made. When Wallis began the project, he knewthat MGM was already working on a movie about the bomb. After AR had completedabout one-third of the script, Wallis sold the rights to her work to MGM. ButMGM had no interest in her script; apparently, it simply wanted to terminate arival project So AR stopped work on Top Secret in March 1946 and began full-timework on Atlas Shrugged.January 2, 1946AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROPER APPROACH TO A PICTURE ON THE ATOMIC BOMB(CONFIDENTIAL)An attempt to make a picture on the atomic bomb can be the greatest moral crimein the history of civilization—unless one approaches the subject with the mostearnest, most solemn realization of the responsibility involved, to the utmostlimit of one’s intelligence and honesty, as one would approach JudgmentDay—because that is actually what the subject represents.The responsibility of making such a picture is greater than that of knowing thesecret of the atomic bomb. The atomic bomb is, after all, only a piece ofinanimate matter that cannot set itself in use. Whether it’s used and how it’sused will depend on the thinking of men. The motion picture is a most powerfulmedium of influencing men’s thinking. To use such a medium on such a subjectlightly or carelessly is inconceivable.If there is any reason why this picture cannot be made honestly—it is better notto make it at all. There is no possible reward that can be worth tampering withsuch a subject and its consequences. Money? All of us are quite rich—and even ifwe were broke and starving, we could not permit ourselves to make money thatway; it would be more honorable to become hold-up men. Prestige? What prestige?One does not achieve prestige through a dishonest thing. We all have names whichare respected—and we will dishonor ourselves by earning the contempt of thethinking people and of the plain, honest public. We cannot fool anyone; the toneof a picture that fudges, evades, and compromises is recognized immediately byeveryone.But if greatness, nobility, patriotism, and the salvation of mankind are notmere sentences to spout in public, if we mean any small part of it—this picturecould be an opportunity seldom offered to any man. It could be truly an immortalachievement, an event of historic importance and a great act of patriotism.To do this, we must take our task seriously.To take it seriously, we must think.To think, we must begin by realizing fully what this subject involves.It involves the life or death of mankind.Unless we understand what this means and how and why, unless we keep this inmind constantly—we will be committing the crime of children who light a fuse,then run and say: “I didn’t explode the thing—I only struck a match—it blew upby itself.” We will have on our conscience millions of charred bodies—those ofour children.This is not a subject for petty politics, cheap generalities, evasions or the“well, it’s a matter of different opinions” attitude. Every man who speaks aboutthis has to be as certain of his opinions as he is of his own life; which meansthat he has no right to an “opinion,” but must have a conviction. A convictionis a profound certainty reached on rational grounds, after considering everyaspect of the question to the best of one’s intelligence. The responsibility isso great and so terrifying that unless we have the courage for it, we’d betterleave the subject alone.The courage needed is the courage of honest and serious thought. In order to becertain that we do not, unwittingly, preach death and horror—we must be veryclear in our own minds on what we want to say. If we’re not clear, the picturewill run away with us and become one more instrument of world destruction. Thiswill happen without our conscious intention, because the ramifications andimplications of this subject are tremendous, because they are of an intellectualand sociological nature, because we cannot escape them and, therefore, this isnot a subject to be treated unconsciously.The analysis that follows is broken into two parts:I. General considerations.II. The specific problems of the picture.Do not be afraid of Part I. It is not intended to be included in the picture. Itis merely a preliminary discussion, in the nature of ground-breaking. It is astatement of the issues involved which we must consider before we approach thepicture. They are not issues which I want to attach to the subject. They areattached to it. We cannot ignore them—therefore we must give them attention andthought. We cannot say: “But we’re not interested in politics.” We have to beinterested, because the subject is political—though not in a narrow sense of theword. A picture on this subject will have political implications, whether wewant it or not. Therefore we must face the issues, examine them carefully andmake sure that our implications will be of the kind we want.None of our Part I discussion will get into the picture. It is intended only forourselves. It is an exposition of the nature of our responsibility. After wehave understood and accepted it, we will be ready to discuss the picture itself.I. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONSLet us begin at the beginning. The first question we have to ask ourselves is:what is the specific danger of the atomic bomb to mankind?The specific danger is that the bomb constitutes a weapon of total destructionand if it exists at a time when men and nations are bent on a course ofdestruction, it will wipe out mankind.Therefore, we cannot permit ourselves to preach anything that will push menfurther along that course.What is that course?Are men at present involved in a world catastrophe and in unprecedenteddestruction? They are. Have they been going in that direction with steps ofprogressive violence in the last hundred years? They have.Everyone—of any political shade of opinion—agrees that the world is in a mess.And the mess is getting worse day by day, not better. Why?If we want to know the reason, we must observe the growing disintegration of theworld in the last hundred years and ask ourselves: What is the idea that hasbeen growing in the world at the same time? What is the social philosophy thathas been spreading and gaining ground in the same proportion, in the same era?It is the idea of Statism.This is no time and subject for evasion and dishonesty. To be honest, we must bespecific. Statism does not mean just Gestapo agents running around shootingwomen and children. That is the final result of Statism, not the cause; one ofits manifestations, not its essence. The essence of Statism is the idea thatgovernment must be all-powerful and must control the existence of men.There are all kinds and forms and variations of this idea, but all thedifferences are merely trimmings. We hear piles of superficial nonsense about“good” Statism and “bad” Statism, about differences between “Aryan” and“Proletarian,” “for a selfish goal” or “for an unselfish goal,” control “by therich” or “by the poor”—and all of it is just so much childish tripe. The basicidea—an all-powerful government—is the same in all these theories. And inpractice we see that the results are exactly the same under all of them. And notonly under the modern versions of Statism, but under all the variations of itthat have existed in history.Now, in our day, the basic issue of the world—the crucial conflict—is betweenStatism and freedom. Specifically: between an all-powerful government and freeenterprise.During the eighteenth century the trend of men’s thinking was toward freeenterprise, and as a result we got the nineteenth century—a period ofachievement, progress and prosperity unequaled in history; a period during whichthere were fewer government controls than at any other time, before or since;and—most important to our subject—the longest period of peace ever recorded(between the times of Napoleon and Bismarck).But while free enterprise was accomplishing these miracles, the thinking of men,who did not understand the issue, was turning in the opposite direction. Theturning point occurred approximately in the middle of the nineteenth century.Stunned by the rush of an unprecedented progress which they’d had no time todigest and analyze, men began to think that they could improve shortcomings bythe short-cut of government action. They began advocating and establishinggovernment controls.For the last hundred years, the world has been going toward Statism, gradually,in one form or another. If Statism were the right principle, this would havemade the general condition of mankind progressively better, in correspondingdegree. Instead, it has made conditions progressively worse—under every form ofStatism and no matter who held the power. We have not seen more general wealthand a rising standard of living throughout the world—but a growing poverty andnow literal starvation. Not more freedom—but concentration camps and torturechambers. Not peace—but more wars, each more horrible than the last.Statism leads men to war because that is its nature. It is based on theprinciple of force, violence and compulsion. This means, on the principle ofdestruction. Statism cannot maintain itself because it kills the productiveactivities of its own subjects; therefore it cannot exist for long withoutlooting some freer, more productive country. This is a fact demonstrated byworld history. It is the Statist nations—the controlled nations, the nations ofdictatorial government—that have always resorted to violence and caused wars.Statist Sparta against Athens. Statist Carthage against Rome. Statist Spainagainst England. Statist Napoleon against the whole of Europe. Statists Bismarckof Germany and Napoleon III of France, against each other. Statist Wilhelm II ofGermany and Nicholas II of Russia who, between them, plunged the world into theFirst War.And now what about this last war? Who started it? The alliance of twodictators—Hitler and Stalin. Now observe a most significant point: theAmerican-British strategy throughout the war was to destroy the productioncenters of the enemy and knock him out—because America and England were notafter loot, they had nothing to gain by war, they were the productive nationsand were merely defending themselves. Was that the strategy of Germany andRussia? No. While Germany was overrunning Europe, she was very careful to spareindustrial centers, to seize them intact, and promptly loot machinery and entirefactories for shipment into Germany. And Russia did precisely the same whileoccupying Germany—and is still doing it. If we want to know who and what leadsthe world to war, destruction, bloodshed and horror—isn’t the answer blatantlyobvious in practical demonstration? Or are we still going to prattle likehigh-school boys about “capitalist greed” and “rich munitions-makers”?So long as Statism had only guns and dynamite with which to enslave men, mankindhad a chance against it. After every havoc wrought in history by onedictatorship or another, mankind could still recover, rebuild and start overagain. The destruction was partial and limited. But notice that with theimprovements in the technology of weapons, each war left behind it more ruinthan the one before. Now, with a weapon such as the atomic bomb and with a trendsuch as Statism in the world, there is no more chance left and our days areliterally numbered—unless the trend is reversed.An atomic bomb is safe only in a free society—because a free society does notfunction through violence and does not cause wars. Such a weapon would bedangerous in the world at any time. At a time when most of mankind has embracedthe faith of Statism—a world suicide is most surely ahead of us, unless menlearn a different faith.The best sociological minds of this country say: “Mankind has just one moregeneration to exist. This is a final ultimatum to us. Now men must be free—orperish.”The horror and the responsibility in that statement is the fact that ourgeneration will probably have a chance to muddle through irresponsibly to ournormal graves—that we know it instinctively and so refuse to think about it toodeeply. But our children will not survive. Nobody who is under twenty now willescape it. And it is we, now, who are going to blast them into bloody vapor—we,who will decide the issue by what we do and think—we, who’ll pass the sentenceon them and throw them into a screaming horror—while we ourselves escape. Thisis what I, for one, will not have on my conscience. And I don’t see how anyoneelse can wish to have it [on his conscience].This is not a subject for quibbling or evasions. When we say “men must be freeor perish,” let us be specific and honest about what “free” means. It means freefrom compulsion; it means free from rule by force; it means free from governmentcontrol of enterprise.Since the issue of free enterprise versus Statism is so fundamental, sinceeverything we do or say affects it, since every bit of propaganda relates toit—we cannot touch a subject such as the atomic bomb without knowing clearlywhere we stand. There is no fence to straddle here, no compromises, noneutrality, no appeasement policy possible. [...]The atomic bomb is now the focus of everybody’s sociological thinking. Allpeople agree that mankind must reconsider its whole direction in a world thatcontains the atomic bomb. The question is: What direction?The Statists are already making propaganda capital out of the atomic bomb byyelling that now we must have a bigger and better Statism, a world slave statewith a world totalitarian government—for the sake of harmony and peace. Well,this last is true: we must have peace or it will be the end for all of us. Butharmony is not achieved by force. Brotherhood is not achieved by compulsion.Peace is not achieved by appeasement.Harmony, brotherhood and peace can be reached only voluntarily—or not at all.Only free men are peaceful men. When we need peace as desperately as now, wemust have freedom.It is true that mankind must reverse its direction. But its direction has notbeen toward free enterprise. Its direction has been toward Statism. That is thetrend which must be reversed.The world is still stunned by the atomic bomb and is groping desperately forsome understanding of its significance. Therefore anything we say or hint orimply or suggest in a picture on this subject will have tremendous consequencesin influencing the thinking of a muddled, confused, bewildered public.Let us realize and remember that the atomic bomb as an argument can be morepowerful and destructive spiritually than it is as a weapon physically.To sum up, the crux of our responsibility in making the picture is this: (1) Itis precisely because of the atomic bomb that the world must return to freeenterprise; (2) The atomic bomb is a tremendously potent argument. If we use itas an argument for Statism—we will have blood on our hands. If we use it as anargument for free enterprise—we will make an inestimable contribution towardsaving mankind; perhaps, a historic and immortal contribution.The whole history of the atomic bomb is an eloquent example of, argument for andtribute to free enterprise. It would be monstrous to disregard the lesson, toignore it or to twist it into the exact opposite. We don’t have to attachartificial propaganda to the picture. We must let the facts speak forthemselves. We must only present the truth. But we must present the truth, thewhole truth and nothing but the truth.II. THE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS OF THE PICTUREIf our picture is to be a tribute to free enterprise, does it mean that we haveto enter into a controversy and antagonize a lot of people? Not at all. Since wewill treat the subject in a broad, philosophical manner, we will find everybodyin agreement with us. We will present the issue in such a way that we will leaveno room for argument and nobody will dare disagree with us, except theout-and-out Fascists and Communists.How do we do that? Very simply. By presenting the issue not in superficial,political terms—but in its deeper, essential terms. We state our theme likethis: “Man’s greatest achievements are accomplished through free, voluntaryaction—and cannot be accomplished under force, compulsion and violence.”If we stick to this theme intelligently and consistently, who will want todisagree? In order to object, a person would have to admit that he is againstfreedom and in favor of violence.Do we touch on any political issue in the narrow sense of contemporary Americanpolitics? No. None of that is pertinent. We are not for or against Labor orCapital or Republicans or Democrats. We are presenting only a fundamental issue.If, after seeing our picture, the audience walks out with the conviction thatpersonal freedom is desirable and that the use of force is neither good norpractical, that is all we want to accomplish, and it will be a greataccomplishment.However, we cannot do this by merely tacking on a few cheap speeches aboutfreedom, worded in such a general way that it can mean anything or nothing. Ourtheme must be explicit, clear-cut and expressed not in speeches, but in action.It must be integrated into the structure of our story.Do we have to attack our own government and criticize the New Deal? No. (So longas we don’t start glorifying the New Deal, either!) As far as I know withoutfurther research, our government seems to have behaved properly in regard to theatomic bomb. All we have to do is show the government’s actions factually,stressing that in this case it acted as a free country’s government should act:it did not use compulsion.But where we must express our theme full blast is in our treatment of thegovernments of the countries from which the scientists escaped. This is theheart of the real issue historically—and this is the crux of our theme. We mustshow how Statism destroys, exiles and paralyzes men of genius—why these mencould not work under compulsion—why they could produce what they produced onlyin a free country. Will anyone object to our showing that dictatorships dothings at the point of a gun, by force, by decree, by orders in the name of theState? A person who objects to that, deserves to have every returned soldierspit in his face.So much for our general approach to the subject. Now let us examine theparticular key points.1. WHAT MADE THE CREATION OF THE ATOMIC BOMB POSSIBLE?This is the most important question our picture has to answer.In presenting the strictly factual history of the bomb, we will not be able toavoid a slant of unintentional propaganda, one way or the other. The history ofthe bomb is long and complex. We cannot literally present all the facts. We haveto exercise choice in what we select to present, how we present it, whatsignificance we attach to it, what meaning we convey. In order to present thetruth, we must be able to distinguish the essential from the inessential. Anyrecord can be falsified by omission of the essential and overstressing of theinessential. This is where we have to be careful.For instance: it is a fact that Roosevelt gave to the scientists the fundsnecessary for their experiments. How are we going to treat this point? If weshow or imply that that was the crucial factor in the creation of the bomb, wethrow at the world the most powerful piece of propaganda for Statism that couldbe devised. We tell the audience, in effect: “See what a strong government cando? Many people objected to Roosevelt’s arbitrary use of money for secretpurposes—yet look what he gave you! The proper way to run the world and achievethe best results is for you common men to shut up, to trust a leader implicitly,to let your government decide for you and plan for you without your knowledge orconsent.” This is what our audience will walk out of the theater with.Do we want to say that?Do we want to feature the superficial aspects of the case and release on theworld a thousand converted Statists with each showing of the picture? Do wewant—in presenting the greatest achievement of free enterprise—to make “apicture whose hero will be Roosevelt,” as I have heard suggested?If not, does it mean that we should falsify Roosevelt’s contribution? Certainlynot. We must give him full and exact credit for the part he played. Not lessthan that—and not more.Here is the first point where clear and honest thinking is required: if it weretrue that the atomic bomb was an achievement of strong government—why didn’tGermany achieve it? Hitler’s government was much stronger than ours—if by“strong” we mean strong-arm, total control, dictatorial power, arbitrary use ofmoney and resources. Hitler certainly wanted to find the secret of the atomicbomb—and he tried. He started preparing for war long before we did. He could anddid throw the entire resources of his country into his war machine. What gooddid it do him? He did not get the atomic bomb.That is a fact. How do we treat it? If we ascribe it to sheer luck, just anaccident of fate in our favor—if we say that Hitler could have got the bomb,that he was just on the verge of it, only we beat him to it—we miss the wholesignificance of the story of the atomic bomb. We are then committing a moralcrime by falsifying a historical lesson of tremendous importance.There is no factual evidence to support the idea that Hitler was about todiscover the bomb. There is plenty of evidence to the contrary. But here is whatwill happen if we accept that idea: we’ll be saying to the audience, in effect:“A totalitarian system is just as good and efficient as ours. Even more so. Theycan do anything we can. It was quite a feat for us to beat them.”Is that true?The fact is that Germany did not, could not and never would have created theatomic bomb; nor Italy; nor Russia.Is it an accident that since the beginning of the machine age, all the great,basic, epoch-making inventions and discoveries have come from America andEngland? Mostly from America, secondly from England—and with very fewcontributions from all the other countries. Why? Anglo-Saxon superiority? No.The inventors were of all races and nationalities. But they all had to workeither in America or in England. The other countries then elaborated on thediscoveries, worked out some details and variations, made minor improvements;but never produced anything crucially new, never made a discovery that was aturning point in science; nothing to compare with the steam engine, the electriclight, the automobile, the airplane, the telephone, the telegraph, the motionpicture, the radio. For God’s sake, can we ignore that? Are we going to say“sheer accident?” How many accidents of this nature do we need to be convinced?And if, through our own fault, an atomic bomb drops on us in a few years—are wegoing to say that was an accident, too?The simple fact is that invention, discovery, science and progress are possibleonly under a system of free enterprise. If you want to know why and how, indetail, please read Science and the Planned State by John R. Baker, a Britishscientist. It is a short book, recently published. It presents the whole case,with facts, names, dates, records, reasons and unanswerable proof.This is the crucial point of our approach to the picture. If we take thegreatest invention of man and do not draw from it the lesson it contains—thatonly free men could have achieved it—we deserve to have an atomic bomb droppedon our heads.Now let us look at the history of the bomb in detail. If there is a God, it isalmost as if He had staged it that way on purpose—to give us an object lesson.Some of the key figures in the development of the bomb were [Albert] Einstein,[Niels] Bohr and [Enrico] Fermi. They had to flee from Germany, Denmark andItaly. The Statist dictators had these men and had the knowledge of theiroriginal discoveries. And it did not do the dictators any good. These scientistslaid the foundations of their future achievements in their own countries. Butthey could not continue to work there. They had to escape to a free country.Then there is Dr. Lise Meitner who made her first important experiments right inNazi Germany—and had to escape. Her colleagues who remained behind, Hahn andStrassman, continued the work and got no results. She continued the work in afree country—and got results. There are many, many other refugees fromdictatorships among the scientists who contributed to the atomic bomb. Theobject lesson is eloquent.How are we going to treat it? Are we going to say that these refugees werevictims of racial prejudice? That is not an explanation. Racial prejudice was asymptom, not a cause; a manifestation of Statism, not its basic essence. Racialprejudice as such does not cause exiles and concentration camps; it can’t; itdoes not rule society; it remains the province of bums and the lunatic fringe.It is only when racial prejudice acquires political power, only when itestablishes a system of Statism where man’s individual dignity and individualrights are destroyed, only then can it actually start to shed blood. Withoutindividual rights, there are no minority rights; without minority rights thereare no majority rights either. And an individual is the smallest minority onearth.To say that Einstein and Lise Meitner were thrown out of Germany on account ofracial prejudice is the truth—but not the whole truth. It was racial prejudicearmed with State power. And what about Fermi and the others? There was no racialprejudice involved in their cases.The whole truth is that no achievements can be made under a Statist systembecause: (1) Statists always throttle and destroy the ablest men among theirsubjects because Statist systems are based on blind obedience; men of abilityare dangerous, independent and not easily ruled; (2) Even when a few men ofability survive in a Statist system and are begged or ordered to produce—theycannot produce because they cannot work under orders, controls and compulsion.Nothing new and great can be or ever has been done that way. (See Science andthe Planned State. See the whole of history. Try to name one exception.)That is the point our picture must make. That is the lesson of the atomic bomb.That is the greatest glory of America, its noblest distinction and its highestpride. And if anyone objects to our saying that, he does not deserve the name ofa human being.2. THE ACTUAL HISTORY OF THE ATOMIC BOMBTo tell the whole truth about the atomic bomb means to show the entire processof its creation, at least in highlights and key-points.This is essential to our theme and to historical accuracy. Furthermore, it hasthe value of great public interest. The public is eager to know just what theatomic bomb really is and how men made such a discovery. Therefore we must tellour story from the beginning.The first step was Einstein’s equation on the conversion of matter into energy,which he formulated before the First War. After that, there was a long,progressive series of steps, achieved by single scientists working independentlyof one another all over the world. Quoting now merely from a newspaper account(this has to be checked by fuller research), the key steps seem to have been:the discovery of the neutron by Sir James Chadwick, in England, in 1932; thesplitting of a uranium atom by Lise Meitner, Hahn and Strassman, in Germany, in1939; the elaboration upon this experiment by Niels Bohr in Denmark and EnricoFermi in Italy; the meeting of Bohr and Fermi in America in 1939, when the firstdiscussion of the possibility of an atomic bomb was held; Fermi’s proposal torepresentatives of the Navy; the creation of the atomic bomb project; the twoyears of work there; the test in New Mexico; the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.That, in a very general outline, is the story we have to tell. What is itssignificance? To whom does the credit for the atomic bomb belong?By the time Fermi approached the Navy with his proposal, the basic scientificwork was done; scientists had discovered that the atom could be split and knewhow to do it; what remained was the practical application, specifically to thepurpose of a bomb. Who had given to the world the crucial basic knowledge? Thesingle, voluntary, unplanned, unregulated efforts of individual scientists, eachfollowing his own line of research. Was it a “collective” achievement? No. Theydid not work together under a common plan, nor under directives, nor by majorityvote. It was not the achievement of one individual—nor the achievement of anorganized group. It was—as all civilization—the sum of free, individual efforts.I quote from Science and the Planned State: “We may turn to any part of scienceand we are likely to find the same thing: the fundamental discoveries arecommonly made by single workers.”I quote from Einstein: “I am a horse for single harness, not cut out for tandemor teamwork.”Now we come to the last stage—the work on the atomic bomb project. That was anorganized effort. Organized by whom? By one man or five men—we don’t know thenumber—but we know that work was done under the absolute guidance of a few topscientists. Was that a collectivist method of working? Well, the members of that“collective” didn’t even know what they were working on. There was no“democracy” about it, no majority vote, no “collective bargaining.” Shall wethen consider it an example of Nazi methods—a small, ruling elite and a blindlyobedient mass? No. Because none of those men was forced into that project.What was it then? Why, simply and exactly the same method as that of any largeenterprise carried on by a free industrial concern. Any enterprise has to workunder a single guidance—so long as it is one specific task. The employee in aprivate industry has to take orders from the boss, and cannot and must not voteupon the boss’s policy--or you get chaos; but beyond and outside the specificwork which the employee has voluntarily undertaken to perform, the boss has nopower over him; and within his particular task, an employee must be left freeand must exercise his own effort to achieve results. Isn’t that the pattern offree industry? And isn’t that the way the work on the bomb project was done?A splendid example of cooperation and discipline? Of course. So is any Fordplant. The biggest and most successful examples of large-scale organization havealways been American. Because this kind of cooperation is possible only amongfree men by voluntary agreement.Is that collectivism? No. Collectivism is compulsion. Compulsion and cooperationare not synonyms. They are opposites. Collectivism is group action by decree—andin matters where no group action is possible. Cooperation is a highly complexdivision of individual labor. Collectivism is not division, but herd action, intheory—and a gun stuck in your back in practice. You don’t cooperate at thepoint of a gun. Only free men can cooperate.This is the crucial difference between the method of free enterprise and themethod of Statism. This is why one succeeds and the other fails. This is why thescientists could not work under dictatorships, but could work in America. Thisis why an organization such as the bomb project could not exist in Germany.We must keep this clearly in mind in order to show the real historicalsignificance of these events. We must not get into a childish interpretation ofsecondary matters. We must not give the impression that the secrecy, themilitary discipline, the walled-in cities were responsible for the achievement.These things were required to protect a secret—not to solve it. They werenecessities of wartime and of the fact that the work involved a military weapon.They were not necessities of scientific research. We must keep these two aspectsclearly defined and apart.Now we come to the part played by the government. What was the most significantthing about it? The fact that the government did not attempt to run the bombproject. The government and the Army took orders from the scientists—not viceversa. The government provided the means—and let the scientists do the work asthey wished. We must show this clearly.Otherwise, there is a great danger of the usual superficial interpretation. Theaudience will make a conclusion such as: “It was a government project, wasn’tit? And it turned out well, didn’t it? So government control is good.” It is bysuch crude, blanket conclusions and unanalyzed, unwarranted generalizations thatall the errors in sociological thinking are made.The part played by the government in the bomb project is not the part peopleadvocate when they speak of government control. A government project is run bythe government. A private industry controlled by government takes orders fromthe government. This is the exact opposite of what happened on the bomb project.For once, the government literally acted as the servant of the people involved,not the master. The government put itself at the disposal of the scientists andcarried out their wishes without questions. This is illustrated nicely in thelittle incident of General Marshall giving a $250,000 check to one of thescientists, without knowing or asking what it was for.This behavior of the government is highly commendable and if we present itexactly as it was, it will be the best compliment we can pay to the governmentin this case, and it should please every official involved. Do you thinkofficials will be offended if we show that they acted as free men toward freemen—and not as Gestapo agents or Commissars?This is a point that must be shown and stressed. It displays the contrastbetween a free country and a Statist dictatorship. Under a dictatorship, menwould be forced into the project, assigned to it by command, frozen in theirjobs, prohibited from leaving under penalty of death, and ordered to work. (Andtherefore no work would be done.) Materials would be confiscated. (And thereforethere would be no materials.) The government would decide who does the work,where and how; there would be the usual unholy mess of directives, regulations,red tape, commands—and bloody purges to punish lack of progress, men executed inorder to make the survivors work better through terror. (But achievements andcreation are not done through terror.) There would be the usual inquisition onwho belongs to what race and whose political beliefs are or are not in strictaccordance with the official party line. Now are we still going to wonder why noachievements ever come out of dictatorships? Sheer accident?The atomic bomb was not a creation of government—but of the free cooperation offree men. And it is essential to show its whole history—from the single steps bysingle scientists—to their exiles and escapes—to their coming together for theirlast effort under the guidance of the best among them. We must not start thepicture with the final stage, something like Roosevelt calling the scientiststogether and saying: “Boys, make me an atomic bomb.” That’s not the way it wasdone. If that were the way, Hitler would have done it.We must not fall into a naive Statism by featuring a government project andsaying: “Government did it.” That would be equal in intelligence to a man whocomes out of a movie theater, saying: “The theater owner is the one who createdthat wonderful movie. He provided the theater, didn’t he?”And while we show the part played by the government, with proper and exactcredit—we must also show, with proper and exact credit, the part played byprivate industry. The tremendous material and technological resources that wererequired to make the atomic bomb came from and were created by private Americanindustry, by free enterprise—and were not and could not be created anywhere elseby any other method. Statist nations could not have manufactured the bomb, evenif they had invented it. The atomic bomb was the end product of a huge, complexindustrial structure made up of private achievements and ingenuity—a structurewhich Statism can neither accomplish nor copy. This must be said and shown.The plants built for the bomb project in Tennessee and in the state ofWashington were built by the DuPont Company—“without profit and with arepudiation of all patent rights” (N.Y. Times). This must be shown. Patentrights mean that the DuPont Company had contributed some original inventions.This must be shown.In our handling of the public names and figures involved, we must maintain thestrictest fairness, accuracy and impartiality. If we present Roosevelt in afavorable light, we must also present the DuPonts in a favorable light. Nobodywill or can object, so long as what we present is factually true.120 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_120_r1.jpg]In the manner and terms I have here described, the general tone of our picturewill be that of a great tribute to America—an epic of the American spirit. Wewill not do it in any phony flag-waving way (we must never even say it nor makespeeches about it); we will merely show the American method and its results. Wewill dramatize that which is the essence of America.An abstract, general theme of this nature will give deeper significance to thespecific events we present, will lift the picture above the class of adocumentary film of the moment into that of a great historical work, and willgive it the importance and the dignity which the subject demands.Our picture will say: “This is what America has done—she is the only one whocould have done it—this is how and why she was able to do it.”If the above exposition does not represent your approach to the picture, Icannot permit myself to take upon my conscience the contribution of a singleline to it.If you agree with this exposition and wish to make the picture on this basis—Ishall consider it an honor and a privilege to work on the screenplay. January, 1946THEMEThe mind against brute force;therefore—The mind is that which cannot be forced and will always win against force;therefore—Freedom from compulsion;therefore—The methods of free enterprise against the methods of the totalitarian state.121 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_121_r1.jpg]Show throughout that what applies to men applies in exactly the same way tostates and nations. (Men are the atoms of society. Matter is organized accordingto the nature of atoms—not atoms according to what one would like to do withmatter.)First part: scientists fight a lonely, losing battle as the world moves towardtotalitarianism, the rule of force, the climax of which is Hitler.Second part: the world, lost in a chaos of brutality, has no recourse but toappeal to scientists (the mind) to save it from unleashed brutality. January, 1946[AR prepared the following list of questions for the first of two interviews sheconducted with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who served as scientificdirector of the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos.]QUESTIONS FOR J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMERWhen did he start in Chicago? Summer, 1942.When in New Mexico? March, 1943.Who selected the scientists for New Mexico? How were they invited? What wastheir attitude? Incidents?How was the work done? To what extent [was it] controlled? To what extent [wasit] free? If controlled—by whom? How many free, unexpected discoveries werethere? How many men were responsible for crucial, basic points?Incidents to show progress of the work?Were there crucial turning points, i.e., milestones of the progress?What points or events stand out in your mind?Was there any one specific day or event when they knew they had it?Was there a specific event when they started manufacturing the actual bombsused?(Our picture is to be a tribute to the scientist—as a representative of freeinquiry and the independent mind.)Contributions of industries?Incidents of German work on the atomic [bomb]? What happened to Otto Hahn? [OttoHahn was a German chemist and physicist who received the Nobel prize in 1944 forsplitting the uranium atom (1939). He collaborated with the Nazis in theireffort to develop the atomic bomb.]Did scientists really fear German success and consider it a race—or were theycontemptuous of the German efforts?What does he consider the best in people as demonstrated in connection with thisproject?What does he consider the worst?Any trouble or interference which he cares to mention?Incidents typical of the men as scientists?What does he consider his most important contribution to atomic physics—beforethe project?How was he picked to be head of Los Alamos—was he chosen or did he volunteer?When and how did he first hear about the project?January 8, 1946NOTES FROM INTERVIEW WITH J. R. OPPENHEIMERNo theoretical problem. “Approved for destruction.” Some parts ready two yearsbefore.Scientists—[almost] no one turned him down. (One refused. Two quit the project.)Project had a bad name at the beginning.[Obstacles to hiring scientists:]1. Scientists already employed.2. Project’s bad name.3. Remote location.4. Hated to work for Army.Town run by Army—commanding officer in charge.[Oppenheimer was] called by Dr. Arthur Compton in spring of 1942.Group came to Berkeley in summer of 1942.Staff of laboratory at maximum of 3,500—scientific staff about 900. In the lastthree years—scientific work at Los Alamos, production at the other two labs[located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington].Early part—working out scientific schemes for the other two plants. Group atfirst meeting being told about work in single teams.All 900 knew the scientific principles—and others after six months residencewere told what they were making.They kept it secret without rules—merely by making it a principle to keep itsecret.Bohr was not closely associated—brought some slight information—not essential towork.Fermi contributed enormously.Scientific high points (prior to project):Rutherford—discovery of nucleus.Quantum theory.[James] Chadwick—discovery of neutron.Dr. Bush important, “had President’s ear.” [Dr. Vannevar Bush was director ofthe government’s Office of Scientific Research and Development. ]Refugee scientists responsible.Summer of 1942—decision to manufacture bomb was made. Theoretical work was done.Conant and Bush presented evidence to Roosevelt. [Dr. James B.Conant was chairman of the National Defense Research Council during World WarII.]January 15, 1946QUESTIONS [FOR DR. J. R. OPPENHEIMER]Describe typical day.How was work done? On assignment—or free investigation of assigned problems?When did he move to live in Los Alamos?Bodyguard?Theoretical scientist: Give one incident about himself prior to project.Incidents typical of the men as scientists?Control of Army?Hiroshima.NOTES FROM [SECOND] INTERVIEW WITH DR. OPPENHEIMERSeminars—free discussions (“give and take”).Tormented by something he can’t solve.Memories:Moral doubts.Bohr arrives at his house—evening, it is snowing. Went for walk. Talk aboutGerman work.About a year ago—terrible jam on equipment—working 24 hours a day—shop burneddown—“evening of extreme [weather conditions]”—snow, inadequate water pressure.Three or four people at first (March, 1943)—cold—conferences in half-builtrooms.Waiting for news of Nagasaki.Surprises—came out in conferences—about eight people talking. Trouble aboutfreedom and getting their own personnel and supplies. Trouble with engineers whowanted to start building. First model of bomb had nothing in common with actualbomb.Scientists ran it—they decided what they needed.Formal parties—like Englishmen in the Congo.Hiroshima—Sunday at Los Alamos—brother called and they went for ride—tookchildren to go swimming. Next morning he got phone call at lab—everything allright. On Tuesday night—a colloquium—800 scientists—worried that the next onemight not work.Assembly of first bomb (Trinity). [This was the bomb used for the test in NewMexico.]Compton left—got scared—in early days.Bodyguard:Sentry at house—standing all night. One of two guys had to go out with him.Driver assigned to Compton.June 1943—guard assigned—couldn’t [leave] often.His achievements:Theory of cosmic ray particles—that neutron particles were cosmic rays—1936.Typical day:Talking with individuals about their problems; trying to give them a feeling ofconfidence; correcting them while making them think they did it themselves.Conferences: two on technical subjects, one on administration. One meeting aweek to describe progress.122 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_122_r1.jpg]General Groves was the only boss over Oppenheimer.Scientists given choice of problems. Reasons instead of authority.Free to solve problems.Scientists like music. Long walks, skiing, horses.No one ever gave an order at Los Alamos. [AR recalled this part of the interviewyears later: “I asked him whether the scientists worked under orders. He lookedat me in the way that my best characters would have, and said in a morallyindignant tone: ‘No one ever gave an order at Los Alamos. ’ ”]They did things they didn’t want to do—only because they understood thenecessity. A great scientist ran the machine shop. People who ran calculatingmachines and other dull jobs.After a hundred experiments—“we’re getting something.”[AR’s meetings with Oppenheimer proved useful later: he became the model forRobert Stadler in Atlas Shrugged. In a 1961 interview, she recalled:“Oppenheimer set the character of Stadler in my mind, which is the reason forthe first name of Robert. It’s the type that Oppenheimer projected-that enormousintelligence, somewhat bitter, but very much the gentleman and scholar, andslightly other-worldly. Even his office was what I described for Stadler—thatalmost ostentatious simplicity. ”] January 16, 1946NOTES ON INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL [LESLIE R.] GROVESGroves—top in his profession (Army engineering)—took chance on disgrace ifproject failed.He was told of his appointment first in hall of Congress building—came out ofMilitary committee where he testified—met General Somervell—asked his opinion ontaking assignment with General overseas—Somervell told him the Secretary of Warhad another assignment for him “which might win the war.” Groves [complainedabout being] given a research job; [at first] he thought it was fantastic anddoomed to failure.Groves didn’t know project would succeed. “I thought we had a 60% chance—and hadto take it before anyone else did.”Groves had to make crucial decisions—often against the advice of his scientificadvisors. (In the case of starting Oak Ridge from [Dr. E. 0.] Lawrence’s “speckof light.”) Groves had no organization set up—there was no time—he ran thingshimself—appointed the right men and almost never changed them.Groves was “salesman” to get big industries to take the contracts.They could have refused—but not one of them did. The story of DuPont—the boardof directors—the meeting and the papers face down—Chairman speaks—not one paperis turned over (among those who didn’t turn the paper over was Lamont DuPont,who owns 60 million [dollars worth] of DuPont stock). [The papers containedclassified information on the Manhattan Project, which the Department of Defensewas willing to divulge if necessary.]Groves says he would like to see stressed “teamwork and American management”—noother country could have done it.Groves went to Milwaukee to see a contractor; he solved two technical problemsfor [the contractor] while in a hotel room conference.One method of doing a certain scientific process had to be abandoned afterspending a huge sum.January 23, 1946INTERVIEW WITH DR. KAYNES[Dr. Kaynes was apparently a scientist who worked with Richard Feynman in thecomputing group at Los Alamos.]Conflict of scientists who were in Army. But [they were] free in the laboratory.Never worked under compulsion.What is the critical mass?One works with cross-section (cyclotron involved).Neutron renector—looked for damper—tried to “freeze design.”At request of Fermi, made calculations to see if the world would blow up.Dr. Hans Bethe gave talk at colloquium before test; they were terrified whenthey realized how little they knew.Dr. Kaynes accepted job knowing nothing about it. Arrived in early 1944. Usedfirst names. Dr. Bethe told him they were making a new element. Told everything.Asked: “What do you want to do?”Worked with a “screwball”—Richard Feynman.(Scientists dressed sloppy. Only big shots dressed—Bethe and Oppenheimer, butnot Fermi.)Bohr and son came often. Fermi eventually came and stayed there about a yearbefore test. Chadwick was stationed there (for British) almost from beginning.Lawrence visited. Dr. Bethe. Dr. [George B.]Kistiakowsky—White Russian.(Ideal of most professors—university without undergraduates.)Feynman was Kaynes’ group leader (about age 27). He traveled to Albuquerque tosee wife, who was dying of T.B. Beat tom-toms right in laboratory—the morenoise, the harder he was thinking. Wife died. No one paid attention to workhours.One hundred tons of TNT used to test instruments—a few months before atomictest.Dr. [William George] Penny got word his wife in London was hurt in bombing.Later learned his wife died—intense hatred.Los Alamos originally planned for 75 scientists, grew gradually.Polish scientist who could not find his wife in Warsaw.Columbia—started work with Fermi—men came out all black from carbon.Fermi—scientific. Compton—administration.(Communists not allowed on project.)Art Wahl (chemist) discovered plutonium—E. O. Lawrence’s laboratory at Berkeley.January 25, 1946INTERVIEW WITH MRS. OPPENHEIMERTest was referred to as “Trinity.” Test was on a Monday—the next Saturday Mrs.Oppenheimer gave a party—evening dress. Mood was one of relief.After Hiroshima they did not feel like celebrating.The Oppenheimers were the first family to move to Los Alamos.[The town] had about 30 people then—a big dormitory for scientists in one of theschoolrooms. The Oppenheimers lived in one of the masters’ houses of the oldschool. Community life was much friend lier and more harmonious than in othercities—higher mental level.Dr. Oppenheimer took job only on condition that his essential workers would knowthe secret.A great part of their work was spent in meetings and conferences.At first, scientists were afraid of possible German atomic research, but laterlearned there was none. Scientists worked in order to save lives and end thewar.Was it in order to beat the Germans to the discovery? “Good God, no!”January 29, 1946INTERVIEW WITH COLONEL NICHOLS[Colonel K. D. Nichols served under General Groves, and had responsibility forthe design, construction, and operation of the plants which produced thefissionable material required for the bombs.]Spies tried not to be promoted.Nichols, [General George C.] Marshall, and a civilian wandered for a day,choosing the site.Plans about center of town—useless planning.Ore refined at other plant [Oak Ridge, Tennessee].Scientists impatient with engineers.Main problem: critical size and detonation.Detonation—crucial—the gamble.Lawrence [influential in] selecting Oppenheimer.FBI security men—separate organization. Foreign spy. Feed back answers toGermany. (Phony answers written by scientist.)Miss Tracey (Compton’s secretary): “I have a husband on Iwo Jima. You don’t haveto ask me.”Better work when they knew what they were doing. “Never saw such a change in atown” (as took place after they knew).Mrs. Nichols—story of how she heard news that it was a bomb.Community troubles with scientists who hated restrictions, such as no choice ofschools for their children.January, 1946PHILOSOPHIC NOTESAnswer to Oppenheimer’s worry:“Scientists are the representatives of free inquiry. They will protect you—andthey will not work for or under compulsion. The atom bomb and the sudden rulingposition of the scientist shows that force is not practical. Force needs brainsto be applied. Without thought, you cannot even indulge in violence. Brute forceis nothing—thought and principles everything.“The atom bomb is a weapon of defense—it is not good for looting—anddictatorships are looters. The atom bomb is the weapon of a free country.”For “overall” guidance:Wars are caused by the anti-rational, pro-force psychology of men. If we do notdeal with one another through reason—nothing is left to us but brute force.Whenever anyone advocates the achievement of anything whatever through the useof force or compulsion on men—he is planting the seeds of war.Have a sequence where somebody wonders what causes war—and scattered, “human”examples of the above psychology.“What causes wars?” can be a kind of overall theme and unifying line.“Just as a tiny, invisible atom holds forces that determine the shape ofmatter—so you, each man, by the ideas you hold, determine the shape of worldevents.” (“Do not worry about anything except your own ideas and responsibility.It will work.”)Everything we have comes from someone’s thought.Scene where mother says “nobody wants war”—and we show all the preaching ofviolence: worker—“take the property of the rich by force”; industrialist—“makeworkers work by force”; teacher—“educate people by force”; writer—“make peoplego to my plays by force”; farmer—“prohibit the sale of milk from other states byforce”; dietitian—“make everybody drink orange juice by force.” “Since societyis complex—we need force.” (Then show scene at construction site.)The antagonists: the Nazi ideal—a horde of armed brutes; the free ideal—ascientist, alone at a blackboard. (Sequence about the ancestors of both sides.)England in ruins—“our only defense”—Chadwick. Conclusion from “teamwork” is not“any man is unimportant, only the team counts,” but “every man is important.”“All human activities are like a chain reaction; somebody has to be the firstneutron.”Don’t forget line (toward end): “It was not an accident.”Someone (maybe Chadwick) looks at sky and says: “God did give us a means forright to win over might: the mind which can find the secrets of the universe andwhich cannot work for evil, because it cannot work under compulsion.” (Evil[men] steal the ideas and achievements of free men; it is up to free men toprotect themselves and the world from that—by protecting freedom.)The men that a dictatorship needs most (if it’s real power that it wants) arethe first to turn into its bitterest enemies (Fermi, Einstein) —by the verynature of the idea of dictatorship.January 19, 1946[The following is AR’s “general outline” of the screenplay.]We open with an immense shot of the night sky—the stars and planets—the vastmystery of the universe. Camera tilts to include the earth below—a dark spreadof hills, wide and desolate under the sky. A single pinpoint of light showssomewhere in the hills; it looks like a feeble, futile competition to theflaming spread of the stars. Camera moves forward slowly, and we begin todistinguish the figure of a man standing in the hills. He seems helpless andsmall, totally insignificant in the face of the immensity of the universe.The man is about thirty years old. He is looking up at the sky. His face is weakand bitter. He turns slowly and walks toward the light we have seen; it is thelighted window of a small, modest house somewhere in the hills of California.Inside the house, a young woman is lying in bed. The man, her husband, comes in.He speaks bitterly of the fact that man is only a worm in the universe—ahelpless, insignificant worm—and what is the use of anything? The young wifereproaches him gently—that is no way to talk on the day when their son was born.And we see the new-born child beside her.The young mother is full of hopes and dreams for her son. She expects him tohave a great life in a great new world; the war has just ended, there will neverbe another war. She asks her husband what important events took place on the dayof her son’s birth. The father picks up a newspaper—it is the year 1919. Heglances through the pages, briefly naming the big events of the day. Somewhereat the bottom of a page, he finds a small item announcing that Sir ErnestRutherford, British scientist, has succeeded in smashing an atom of nitrogen. Hedrops the paper contemptuously; he does not consider this of any importance;scientists, he says, are useless; this is the day of the practical man, the manof action.There is a photograph of Rutherford in the paper. From it we dissolve toRutherford himself, in his laboratory in England. He is being interviewed by acouple of reporters—it is not considered a big story—the reporters are not tooimpressed. Yes, Rutherford says, he can explain his experiments so that thelaymen would understand—he is not sure, however, that it would interest manypeople. He proceeds to explain briefly the nuclear theory of the atom, which hehad formulated in 1912, and his present experiment by which he transmutednitrogen into hydrogen. Of what practical use is that?—asks one of thereporters. A little astonished, Rutherford, the theoretical scientist, answers:“I don’t know.” “Then why are you interested in that kind of research?”Rutherford answers, very quietly: “Only because it is knowledge of the truth.”We dissolve to the young father saying: “What is the truth? There is no suchthing as objective truth.” He is saying it to his son, now ten years old. It isthe year 1929. The boy is an earnest, intelligent child; his face shows futurestrength and character. (For the purpose of this outline only we’ll call himJohn X—he can be anyone, he is the young generation of today.) The father isreproaching him for his scholarly inclinations—the boy studies too much, readstoo much, asks too many questions. The father wants him to go out more, learnmore about the world and become useful when he grows up; people who think areuseless; the mind is a superstition, truth is a superstition, everything isrelative, we mustn’t question anything, we must learn to take orders. The fatheris a kind of petty-Fascist type, a shiftless failure who wants to run everythingand does nothing, who takes out his own incompetence in hatred for the world; herepresents the cheap cynicism, the irrationalism, the contempt for moralstandards and intellectual principles which characterized his generation allover the world.Tied into this scene we show, with brief explanations, a scene of Dr. E. O.Lawrence, at the University of California, with his new invention—the cyclotron;and a scene of Dr. Robert J. Van de Graaf, at Princeton, with his new giantelectrostatic generator—two important points in the progress of atomic science.Then, as the father complains about the state of the world—there is nothing todo now, after the stock market crash, no frontiers left to conquer—we go to aplane flying over the desolate wastes of North Canada. Gilbert Labine discoversthe black rock on the shore of a lake. We show his expedition through the snowthe next year, the discovery that the rock is pitchblende [uranium ore], theestablishment of his company.123 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_123_r1.jpg]1932. John X is 13 years old. He shows signs of becoming nervous, restless,bitter—as he studies in secret from his father. He has to smuggle the latestscientific magazines into his room and hide them. In connection with hisstudies, we show scenes of: the Cockron-Walton experiments, in England,splitting atoms with protons; Sir James Chadwick, in England, discovering theneutron; Prof. Harold Urey, in America, discovering heavy water.124 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_124_r1.jpg]1934. Niels Bohr, in Denmark, formulates his theory of the structure of the[atomic nucleus].Enrico Fermi, in Italy, invents the technique of bombarding an atom with slowneutrons.Scene of Fermi’s clash with Fascist officials who hamper his work. (I would liketo have information from Fermi about an authentic incident—also the exact dateand manner of his escape from Italy.)John X is now fifteen. There is a violent scene when he tells his father that hewants to become a scientist. Scientists, the father declares, are no good,because they “live in ivory towers.” Man must act, not think. His son must learnto be practical; take, for instance, that fellow who’s growing so powerful inGermany; of course, the father says, I don’t approve of some of his ideas, butnobody will deny that he’s practical, a realist, a smart man with an efficientsystem who’ll get what he wants. As an illustration of how one goes about beingpractical, the father seizes the boy’s books and throws them into the fireplace.As the books burn, we dissolve to a huge pile of books burning in the square ofa German city, under swastika flags. And we see the “practical man,” Hitler, inhis office, bending over a map of Germany. He tells his assistants that hecontrols all of it—he boasts about his power—to hell with principles andtheories—thinking is a weakness—the brain is evil—action and force are all thatcounts—a powerful State can accomplish anything—the individual doesn’tmatter—the mind doesn’t matter (exact quotations from Mein Kampf to be usedhere). Camera pans to the window of the office: there is a light in a distantwindow of the dark city outside. Camera moves toward that window and into theroom. It is a modest study. A solitary man sits working at a desk. The deskholds nothing but books, papers, abstract formulas. The man is Einstein.Scene of Einstein leaving Germany. (I would like to have the date and authenticdetails from Einstein.)125 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_125_r1.jpg]1936. John X, seventeen, is entering college. He has given in to his father andgiven up his ambition of becoming a scientist. As a result, he is a listless,frustrated, embittered youth, cynical, without fire or faith, without muchinterest in anything—like most of the youth of that time. His father, verypleased, accompanies him when he enrolls at the University of California tostudy whatever it is his father has selected for him. Actually, the father isnot interested in any education, but wants him to become a great collegeathlete. (“The brawn is mightier than the brain.”) As they walk down a hall ofthe University, they see—through a half-open door—a man at a blackboard in amodest office. The man has his back to us and is writing incomprehensibleformulas on the blackboard. From a friend or a minor college officialaccompanying them, they learn that the man is working on some mysterious studiesof the mesotron and cosmic rays. “There!” says the father, “do you want to endup like that?” The boy shakes his head. As they pass the door, we see the signon it: “J. R. Oppenheimer.”126 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_126_r1.jpg]1939. John X is struggling through college—miserably. The brilliant boy hasbecome a worthless student. He cannot do well the things he hates. He hasflunked many examinations and doesn’t care. He is drinking, running around toparties, driving recklessly—without any real joy. When somebody mentions to himthe unusual scientific discoveries being made in the world and shows him ascientific magazine—he flings it aside angrily. He is beginning to hate thesubject of science, because it is tied to his renunciation of his one realdesire.We go to Germany—to the laboratory of Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner. We see theexperiment in which uranium atoms are split for the first time. Hahn and Meitnerare puzzled by it—they do not understand the significance of their ownexperiment—the presence of the element barium. They attribute it to someimpurity in the material or some mistake on their part.Lise Meitner is forced to leave Germany. On the train going to the frontier, sheis snubbed and pushed around by arrogant Nazi brown-shirts; the Nazi State hasdamned her on three counts: the old are useless, women are useless, Jews areuseless. She sits alone in a comer of the train, her mind intent on theinexplicable experiment; she makes calculations on a piece of paper. A solutionoccurs to her suddenly; it is a stunning solution—but she must keep quiet aboutit. At the frontier, Nazis search her luggage: they take from her an old camera,a typewriter, and other such physical objects; nothing of value to the State,they declare, can be taken out of Germany. We see a close-up of Lise Meitner—thebroad forehead, the intelligent eyes. What she is taking out is in her mind.In Denmark, Lise Meitner explains her solution—that the uranium atom wasactually split in half—to Dr. Otto Frisch, another refugee scientist. Together,they communicate the discovery to Niels Bohr. Realizing its tremendousimportance, Bohr sails for the United States.Bohr informs Einstein, Fermi, and other scientists in the United States. Theexperiment is repeated at Columbia—and [there is] a tremendous release ofenergy, as predicted by Einstein’s formula.January, 1939. Bohr and Fermi attend a conference on theoretical physics inWashington. Their report creates a sensation among the scientists. Fermisuggests to some of his colleagues the possibility of a military application ofthe new discovery.March, 1939. Fermi and Pegram approach representatives of the Navy Departmentwith the suggestion of an atomic bomb.October, 1939. Fermi and his friends enlist the help of Einstein and AlexanderSachs to approach Roosevelt. Sachs obtains an interview with Roosevelt, readsexcerpts from Einstein’s letter. Roosevelt forms first “Advisory Committee onUranium.”November, 1939. The committee reports; Roosevelt approves first purchase ofmaterials—for $6,000.Summer of 1940 (after the fall of France). Einstein gets first news from theunderground that Germany is doing some work on atomic research. Sachs urges moreeffort—by contacts with Roosevelt. The “National Defense Research Committee” isformed, with Dr. Vannevar Bush in charge. Bush makes contracts for uraniumresearch with many University laboratories. He finds Labine and has him reopenhis mines, closed by the war, to get uranium ore.Parallel scenes in Germany, showing the Nazi method: slave labor operating theuranium mines in Czechoslovakia. A department of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute inBerlin is ordered to work on atomic research; the top scientists are kicked outand a good Nazi put in charge.Spring, 1941. University laboratories report progress—the possibility ofisolating U-235 and of producing plutonium.November, 1941 (just before Pearl Harbor). The government approves $300,000 incontracts. Dr. Conant is put in charge, under Dr. Bush. An American mission(Pegram and Harold Urey) is sent to England to confer with British scientists.December, 1941 (after Pearl Harbor). Roosevelt tells Dr. Bush to go ahead, hewill provide any funds needed. It is decided that British scientists will joinin the work in the United States. The project now becomes secret.127 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_127_r1.jpg]1942. John X goes to war—he is assigned to military intelligence and sent toEurope.Summer, 1942. The Manhattan Project is formed and Gen. Groves is put in charge.(Scenes of Gen. Groves’ nomination for the post as he described them to us.)Prof. Lawrence solves problem of the electromagnetic method of separating U-235.(I believe this is the experiment described by Beatty, with the pinpoint oflight and Gen. Groves called to observe it. If chronologically correct, we usethis scene here.)December, 1942. Fermi succeeds in producing a [nuclear fission] chain reactionin a basement of the University of Chicago.Parallel scenes: Vain attempts by German scientists to produce a chain reaction.(They made thirteen attempts—without success.)128 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_128_r1.jpg]1943. Gen Groves, in his role of “salesman,” arranges the first industrialcontracts to build Oak Ridge. Construction begins on February 2, 1943.Parallel scenes: The Germans in charge of the heavy water plant in Norway. Weshow the methods of terror, expropriation and slave labor. Even though thisplant was based on the discovery of an American (Urey) and built by Norwegianindustrialists, the Nazis believe they can run it successfully through sheerforce. Their attitude is, in effect: “You fools do the work, then we’ll take itover by force, because force is all that counts.”February 28, 1943. The Norwegian plant is blown up—under the leadership of twoNorwegian scientists, formerly of this plant.(If this is technically and historically possible, I would like to have John Xconnected with this explosion and wounded in subsequent action.)Spring of 1943. John X, who has been wounded in action and sent back to theUnited States, recovers and is summoned to the office of his chief. Under theimpact of his war experiences, the boy is now a wreck spiritually; he isembittered, disillusioned and firmly convinced that his father was right:nothing matters in the world but brute force. His chief informs him that he willbe entrusted with an assignment of extraordinary responsibility: he is to serveas bodyguard to one of the most valuable men on earth. “Who?” asks the boy. “Aprofessor of physics,” is the answer. The boy feels contempt for hisassignment—he thinks he is being thrown into the discard because of his wound.Scientists, he remarks bitterly, live in ivory towers; of what importance arethey? “You’ll find out,” says the chief.That evening, John X meets the man he is to guard—Dr. Oppenheimer.Oppenheimer has been placed in charge of the planned Los Alamos laboratory.Together, he and the boy drive to Los Alamos—over the desert and the mudroads—to the future site where there is nothing but an old school-building now.The attitude of the scientist and the bodyguard is one of hidden mutualantagonism. The scientist resents the necessity of being watched. The boy isskeptical about the scientist’s work and importance.It is from this that the drama of their relationship will come: the gradualunderstanding—the boy’s growing admiration for the scientist—the boy’s finalregeneration and return to spiritual values, as he sees them exemplified in thework at Los Alamos.The exact sequence of incidents we’ll use to illustrate the next two years(1943-1945) cannot be decided upon until all the research material is in. Ishould like to use as many real incidents as possible—and invent episodes onlywhere no factual information is available, to illustrate the general trend andprogress of the work.Some key spots, which we have and will use, are:Incidents illustrating the activities of Oppenheimer and Groves: Oppenheimerpersuading scientists to come and work at Los Alamos, overcoming theirobjections to “the project’s bad name”; Groves “selling” industrialists onundertaking dangerous and almost impossible contracts.Parallel scenes: In Denmark, the Nazis try to persuade Bohr to work for them. Herefuses. Why should they need him? Didn’t they say that an individual is of noimportance, only the race matters? They threaten him. He asks themcontemptuously: “How are you going to force a mind? How are you going to tearout of it an idea not yet born? You have destroyed millions of human brains. Canyou make one single brain work? You wish me to produce for you something youcan’t produce—yet you consider yourselves the masters of the world. Isn’t there,perhaps, an error in your theories? One single crucial error?” The Nazis arestopped—they cannot kill him, he is too valuable. [Note the similarity to thescene in Atlas Shrugged when Galt is tortured.] They threaten to torture hisson. The underground arranges the escape of Bohr and his son—first by boat toSweden, then by plane to England. Here we have the incident of Bohr’s head beingtoo large for an oxygen mask—and the great scientist arriving in England barelyalive.Scene of Bohr’s arrival at Los Alamos (as described by Dr. Oppenheimer) —dinnerin the stone kitchen of the schoolhouse—the walk through the snow, talking oftheir problems.Late in 1943. Oppenheimer needs 190 of the finest precision-tool makers. We showthe recruiting of these workers—and the scene of the old man, with sons in theArmy, who abandons a better job for the hardships of living and working at LosAlamos. In connection with this, we show a scene where John X asks angrily whyso much fuss is made about getting these workers, why aren’t they just draftedand forced to come here, since they’re needed so badly for such an importantjob? Oppenheimer smiles and explains to him that the precision work needed is sofine a human breath can ruin it. Can you make a man do that kind of work byforce?Parallel scene: A German laboratory where a worker ruins a delicate, valuablepiece of equipment. The Gestapo agents are stumped: was it an accident orsabotage? Neither they nor we will ever know.Incidents to illustrate the magnificent sentence Dr. Oppenheimer said to us: “Noone ever gave an order at Los Alamos. ”Scientists given a choice of problems and allowed complete freedom to work outthe solutions as they wished. Men doing difficult and unpleasant work “onlybecause they understood the necessity” (Oppenheimer). “We used reasons insteadof authority” (Oppenheimer).Scene of Gen. Groves getting the heads of the DuPont Company to accept adifficult undertaking. (I presume this was the construction of Hanford.) TheDuPont board of directors meeting, with the thirty papers face down on thetable. The Chairman speaks, explaining the great importance and secrecy of theundertaking. “Those who wish to know what it is may turn their papers over.” Theboard accepts [the contract]—and not one paper is turned over.129 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_129_r1.jpg]1944. Scenes of the construction and the work at Oak Ridge, Hanford, and LosAlamos. Here scientific incidents will have to be integrated, whenever possible,with the human elements of pioneer living conditions and the “melodrama”elements of secrecy, guards, etc. I want to have as many concrete, specificscenes as possible—and reduce the use of an impersonal montage to a minimum, inorder to avoid a newsreel effect. Here John X will serve as a legitimateconnecting link between the laboratory, the living conditions, and the “secrecy”aspects of the story. He is both a participant and an observer—and the fact thathe is a skeptical, slightly hostile observer will help to give conflict, dramaand meaning to the incidents.A few highlights of December, 1944:The Japanese balloon that landed on a Hanford power line.The Nobel Prize dinner in honor of Dr. Rabi—the prize being given for his workin atomic science, much to the discomfort of those in charge of keeping thatsubject and Dr. Rabi’s connection with it secret.The telephone call to Dr. Oppenheimer at Los Alamos; he comes back into the roomsmiling happily. His fellow-scientists think he has received some good newsabout their work, but the news he received is about the birth of his daughter.Incident of the scientist whose little son asked him for an atomic bomb forChristmas.130 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_130_r1.jpg]1945. Some time early in the year, Dr. Oppenheimer decides that they will beready to start on the actual construction of the bomb by February 28, 1945. Itis he who then proceeds to correlate the enormous amount of knowledge andinformation gathered in two years of experiments. By February 25th, it looks asif they are as far from the solution as ever. But by February 28th, they do havewhat they wanted—and the actual manufacture of the bomb can begin.It is early in 1945 that material from Oak Ridge and Hanford (U-235 andPlutonium) begins to arrive at Los Alamos. This material—after the tremendousamount of work at the two giant factories—arrives in small bottles, under heavyguard.Spring, 1945. Truman is told the secret of the atomic project right after hisinauguration.Some time in June (or earlier), the bombs are shipped to San Francisco. Incidentof yard master who refuses the bomb car priority and sends torpedoes first.Late June, 1945. Test of tower in New Mexico desert with small ordinary bomb.Lightning strikes tower and explodes the bomb. Better insulation has to be made.July 12, 1945. The atomic bomb, unassembled, is taken to site of test. The nextfew days—as described in official reports.July 16, 1945. The test explosion—as described in official reports.Same day—the Indianapolis sails from San Francisco for Guam.Scene where Truman decides that bomb will be used—to save American lives (asdescribed by Truman).August 5, 1945. On Tinian. Word comes that the first bomb mission is on. Capt.William Parsons, designer of the bomb, supervises its assembling. From LosAlamos, Oppenheimer keeps in touch with Tinian, by teletype.August 6, 1945. The take-off of the plane—as described in official reports.The bombing of Hiroshima.That day (Sunday) at Los Alamos: Oppenheimer waits for word of results, spendsday in normal activities, hiding suspense. Next morning—he gets phone call thateverything is all right.Scene where Mrs. Groves is asked to listen to radio—and discovers she is“married to Flash Gordon.”Tuesday night—colloquium of 800 scientists at Los Alamos. Terrific applause whenOppenheimer enters and makes report.Night. Oppenheimer and John X walk in the hills around Los Alamos. Oppenheimertells him that the achievement was not an accident—only free men in voluntarycooperation could have done it—so long as they’re free, men do not have to fearthose who preach slavery and violence—because the mind is man’s only realweapon, and the mind will always win against brute force. The boy is looking atthe stars—just as his father did 26 years ago. But his face is shining withpride, courage, self-confidence. Now man does not look like a worm in the faceof the immensity of the universe—his figure looks heroic, that of a conqueror.The boy’s last line is: “Man can harness the universe—but nobody can harnessman. ”"},{"pageContent":"10COMMUNISM AND HUACThis chapter begins with on open letter addressed “To All Innocent FifthColumnists,” which AR wrote in late 1940 or early 1941, when she was encouragingconservative intellectuals to form a national organization advocatingindividualism. I believe she wanted the letter to be issued by such anorganization.The rest of the material dates from 1947 and deals with Communist propaganda inthe movies: it includes AR’s testimony before the House Un-American ActivitiesCommittee (HUAC), as well as her notes to herself on whether HUAC had violatedthe civil rights of Communists. circa 1940TO ALL INNOCENT FIFTH COLUMNISTSYou who read this represent the greatest danger to America.No matter what the outcome of the war in Europe may be, Totalitarianism hasalready won a complete victory in many American minds and conquered all of ourintellectual life. You have helped it to win.Perhaps it is your right to destroy civilization and bring dictatorship toAmerica, but not unless you understand fully what you are doing.If that is what you want to do, say so openly, at least to your own conscience,and we who believe in freedom will fight you openly.But the tragedy of today is that you—who are responsible for the comingTotalitarian dictatorship of America—you do not know your own responsibility.You would be the first to deny the active part you’re playing and proclaim yourbelief in freedom, in civilization, in the American way of life. You are themost dangerous kind of Fifth Columnist—an innocent, subconscious FifthColumnist. Of such as you is the Kingdom of Hitler and of Stalin.You do not believe this? Check up on yourself. Take the test we offer you here.1. Are you the kind who considers ten minutes of his time too valuable to readthis and give it some thought?2. Are you the kind who sits at home and moans over the state of the world—butdoes nothing about it?3. Are you the kind who says that the future is predestined by something orother, something he can’t quite name or explain and isn’t very clear about, butthe world is doomed to dictatorship and there’s nothing anyone can do about it?4. Are you the kind who says that he wishes he could do something, he’d be soeager to do something—but what can one man do?5. Are you the kind who are so devoted to your own career, your family, yourhome or your children that you will let the most unspeakable horrors be broughtabout to destroy your career, your family, your home and your children—becauseyou are too busy now to prevent them?Which one of the above are you? A little of all?But are you really too busy to think?Who “determines” the future? You’re very muddled on that, aren’t you? Whatexactly is “mankind”? Is it a mystical entity with a will of its own? Or is ityou, and I, and the sum of all of us together? What force is there to makehistory—except men, other men just like you? If there are enough men who believein a better future and are willing to work for it, the future will be what theywant it to be. You doubt this? Why then, if the world is doomed to dictatorship,do the dictators spend so much money and effort on propaganda? If history ispredestined in their favor, why don’t Hitler and Stalin just ride the wave intothe future without any trouble? Doesn’t it seem more probable that history willbe what the minds of men want it to be, and the dictators are smart enough toprepare these minds in the way they want them, while we talk of destiny and donothing?You say, what can one man do? When the Communists came to power in Russia, theywere a handful of eighteen men. Just eighteen. In a country of [170,000,000]population. They were laughed at and no one took them seriously. According totheir own prophet, Karl Marx, Russia was the last country in which Communismcould be historically possible, because of Russia’s backwardness in industrialdevelopment. Yet they succeeded. Because they knew what they wanted and wentafter it—historical destiny or no historical destiny. Adolf Hitler started theNazi Party in Germany with seven men. He was laughed at and considered aharmless crank. People said that after the Versailles Treaty Germany could notpossibly become a world power again, not for centuries. Yet Hitler succeeded.Because he knew what he wanted and went after it—history or no history. Shall webelieve in mystical fates or do something about the future?If you are one of those who have had a full, busy, successful life and are stillhard at work making money—stop for one minute of thought. What are you workingfor? You have enough to keep you in comfort for the rest of your days. But youare working to insure your children’s future. Well, what are you leaving to yourchildren? The money, home or education you plan to leave them will be worthlessor taken away from them. Instead, your legacy will be a Totalitarian America, aworld of slavery, of starvation, of concentration camps and of firing squads.The best part of your life is behind you-and it was lived in freedom. But yourchildren will have nothing to face save their existence as slaves. Is that whatyou want for them? If not, it is still up to you. There is time left to abortit—but not very much time. You take out insurance to protect your children,don’t you? How much money and working effort does that insurance cost you? Ifyou put one-tenth of the money and time into insuring against your children’sfuture slavery—you would save them and save for them everything else which youintend to leave them and which they’ll never get otherwise.Don’t delude yourself by minimizing the danger. You see what is going on inEurope and what it’s doing to our own country and to your own private life. Whatother proof do you need? Don’t say smugly that “it can’t happen here.” Stop andlook back for a moment.The first Totalitarian dictatorship happened in Russia. People said: well,Russia was a dark, backward, primitive nation where anything could happen—but itcould not happen in any civilized country.The next Totalitarian dictatorship happened in Italy—one of the oldest civilizedcountries of Europe and the mother of European culture. People said: well, theItalians hadn’t had much experience in democratic self-government, but itcouldn’t happen anywhere else.The next Totalitarian dictatorship happened in Germany—the country ofphilosophers and scientists, with a long record of the highest culturalachievements. People said: well, Germany was accustomed to autocracy, andbesides there’s the Prussian character, and the last war, etc.—but it could nothappen in any country with a strong democratic tradition.Could it happen in France? People would have laughed at you had you asked such aquestion a year ago. Well, it has happened in France—France, the mother offreedom and of democracy, France, the most independent-minded nation on earth.Well?What price your smug self-confidence? In the face of the millions of foreignmoney and foreign agents pouring into our country, in the face of one step afteranother by which our country is [moving] closer to Totalitarianism—you donothing except say: “It can’t happen here.” Do you hear the Totalitariansanswering you—“Oh, yeah?”Don’t delude yourself with slogans and meaningless historical generalizations.It can happen here. It can happen anywhere. And a country’s past history hasnothing to do with it. Totalitarianism is not a new product of historicalevolution. It is older than history. It is the attempt of the worthless and thecriminal to seize control of society. That element is always there, in anycountry. But a healthy society gives it no chance. It is when the majority in acountry becomes weak, indifferent and confused that a criminal minority,beautifully organized like all gangs, seizes the power. And once that power isseized it cannot be taken back for generations. Fantastic as it may seem tothink of a dictatorship in the United States, it is much easier to establishsuch a dictatorship than to overthrow it. With modem technique and modernweapons at its disposal, a ruthless minority can hold millions in slaveryindefinitely. What can one thousand unorganized, unarmed men do against one manwith a machine gun?And the tragedy of today is that by remaining unorganized and mentally unarmedwe are helping to bring that slavery upon ourselves. By being indifferent andconfused, we are serving as innocent Fifth Columnists of our own destruction.There is no personal neutrality in the world today.Repeat that and scream that to yourself. In all great issues there are only twosides—and no middle. You are alive or you are dead, but you can’t be “neither”or “in between.” You are honest or you are not—and there is no neutral“half-honest.” And so, you are against Totalitarianism—or you are for it. Thereis no intellectual neutrality.The Totalitarians do not want your active support. They do not need it. Theyhave their small, compact, well-organized minority and it is sufficient to carryout their aims. All they want from you is your indifference. The Communists andthe Nazis have stated repeatedly that the indifference of the majority is theirbest ally. Just sit at home, pursue your private affairs, shrug about worldproblems—and you are the most effective Fifth Columnist that can be devised.You’re doing your part as well as if you took orders consciously from Hitler orfrom Stalin. And so, you’re in it, whether you want to be or not, you’re helpingthe world towards destruction, while moaning and wondering what makes the worldsuch as it is today. You do.The Totalitarians have said: “Who is not against us, is for us.” There is nopersonal neutrality.And since you are involved, and have to be, what do you prefer? To do whatyou’re doing and help the Totalitarians? Or to fight them?But in order to fight, you must understand. You must know exactly what youbelieve and you must hold to your faith honestly, consistently and all the time.A faith assumed occasionally, like Sunday clothes, is of no value. Communism andNazism are a faith. Yours must be as strong and clear as theirs. They know whatthey want. We don’t. But let us see now, before it is too late, whether we havea faith, what it is and how we can fight for it.First and above all: what is Totalitarianism? We all hear so much about it, butwe don’t understand it. What is the most important point, the base, the wholeheart of both Communism and Nazism? It is not the “dictatorship of theproletariat,” nor the nationalization of private property, nor the supremacy ofthe “Aryan” race, nor anti-Semitism. These things are secondary symptoms,surface details, the effects and not the cause. What is the primary cause,common to both Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany, and all other dictators, past,present and future? One idea—and one only: That the State is superior to theindividual. That the Collective holds all rights and the individual has none.Stop here. This is the crucial point. What you think of this will determinewhether you are a mental Fifth Columnist or not. This is the point which allowsno compromise. You must choose one or the other. There is no middle. Either youbelieve that each individual man has value, dignity and certain inalienablerights which cannot be sacrificed for any cause, for any purpose, for anycollective, for any number of other men whatsoever. Or else you believe that anumber of men—it doesn’t matter what you call it: a collective, a class, a raceor a State—hold all rights, and any individual man can be sacrificed if somecollective good—it doesn’t matter what you call it: better distribution ofwealth, racial purity or the Millennium—demands it. Don’t fool yourself. Behonest about this. Names don’t matter. Only the basic principle matters, andthere is no middle choice. Either each man has individual, inalienable rights—orhe hasn’t.Your intentions don’t count. If you are willing to believe that men should bedeprived of all rights for a good cause—you are a Totalitarian. Don’t forget,Stalin and Hitler sincerely believe that their causes are good. Stalin thinksthat he is helping the downtrodden, and Hitler thinks that he is serving hiscountry as a patriot. They are good causes, both of them, aren’t they? Then whatcreates the horrors of Russia and of Germany? What is destroying allcivilization? Just this one idea—that to a good cause everything can besacrificed; that individual men have no rights which must be respected; thatwhat one person believes to be good can be put over on the others by force.And if you—in the privacy of your own mind—believe so strongly in someparticular good of yours that you would be willing to deprive men of all rightsfor the sake of this good, then you are as guilty of all the horrors of today asHitler and Stalin. These horrors are made possible only by men who have lost allrespect for single, individual human beings, who accept the idea that classes,races and nations matter, but single persons do not, that a majority is sacred,but a minority is dirt, that herds count, but Man is nothing.Where do you stand on this? There is no middle ground.If you accept the Totalitarian idea, if the words “State” or “Collective” aresacred to you, but the word “Individual” is not—stop right here. You don’t haveto read further. What we have to say is not for you—and you are not for us.Let’s part here—but be honest, admit that you are a Totalitarian and go join theCommunist Party or the German-American Bund, because they are the logical end ofthe road you have chosen, and you will end up with one or the other, whether youknow it now or not.But if you are a Humanitarian and a Liberal—in the real, not the prostitutedsense of these words—you will say with us that Man, each single, solitary,individual Man, has a sacred value which you respect, and sacred, inalienablerights which nothing must take away from him.You believe this? You agree with us that this is the heart of true Americanism,the basic principle upon which America was founded and which made it great—theRights of Man and the Freedom of Man? But do you hear many voices saying thistoday?Do you read many books saying this? Do you see many prominent men preachingthis? Do you know a single publication devoted to this belief or a singleorganization representing it? You do not. Instead, you find a flood of words, ofbooks, of preachers, publications, and organizations which, under very clever“Fronts,” work tirelessly to sell you Totalitarianism. All of them arecamouflaged under very appealing slogans: they scream to you that they aredefenders of “Democracy,” of “Americanism,” of “Civil Liberties,” etc. Everybodyand anybody uses these words—and they have no meaning left. They are emptygeneralities and boob-catchers. There is only one real test that you can applyto all these organizations: ask yourself what is the actual result of their workunder the glittering bromides? What are they really selling you, what are theydriving at? If you ask this, you will see that they are selling you Collectivismin one form or another.They preach “Democracy” and then make a little addition—“Economic Democracy” ora “Broader Democracy” or a “True Democracy,” and demand that we turn allproperty over to the Government; “all property” means also “all rights”; leteverybody hold all rights together—and nobody have any right of any kindindividually. Is that Democracy or is it Totalitarianism? You know of aprominent woman commentator who wants us all to die for Democracy—and thendefines “true ” Democracy as State Socialism [probably a reference to DorothyThompson]. You have heard Secretary [Harold] Ickes define a “true ” freedom ofthe press as the freedom to express the views of the majority. You have read ina highly respectable national monthly the claim that the Bill of Rights, astaught in our schools, is “selfish”; that a “true ” Bill of Rights means notdemanding any rights for yourself, but your giving these rights to “others.” Godhelp us, fellow-Americans, are we blind? Do you see what this means? Do you seethe implications?And this is the picture wherever you look. They “oppose” Totalitarianism andthey “defend” Democracy—by preaching their own version of Totalitarianism, someform of “collective good,” “collective rights,” “collective will,” etc. And theone thing which is never said, never preached, never upheld in our public life,the one thing all these “defenders of Democracy” hate, denounce and tear downsubtly, gradually, systematically—is the principle of Individual Rights,Individual Freedom, Individual Value. That is the principle against which thepresent great world conspiracy is directed. That is the heart of the whole worldquestion. That is the only opposite of Totalitarianism and our only defenseagainst it. Drop that—and what difference will it make what name you give to theresulting society? It will be Totalitarianism—and all Totalitarianisms arealike, all come to the same methods, the same slavery, the same bloodshed, thesame horrors, no matter what noble slogan they start under, as witness SovietRussia and Nazi Germany.Principles are much more consistent than men. A basic principle, once accepted,has a way of working itself out to its logical conclusion—even against the willand to the great surprise of those who accepted it. Just accept the idea thatthere are no inalienable individual rights—and firing squads, executions withouttrial, and a Gestapo or a G.P.U. will follow automatically—no matter who holdsthe power, no matter how noble and benevolent his intentions. That is a law ofhistory. You can find any number of examples. Can you name one[counter-example]? Can you name one instance where absolute power—in anyhands—did not end in absolute horror? And—for God’s sake, fellow-Americans,let’s not be utter morons, let’s give our intelligence a small chance tofunction and let’s recognize the obvious—what is absolute power? It’s a powerwhich holds all rights and has to respect none. Does it matter whether such apower is held by a self-appointed dictator or by an elected representative body?The power is the same and its results will be the same. Look through all ofhistory. Look at Europe. Don’t forget, they still hold “elections” in Europe.Don’t forget, Hitler was elected.Now, if you see how completely intellectual Totalitarianism is already incontrol of our country, if you see that there is no action and no organizationto defend the only true anti-Totalitarian principle, the principle of individualrights, you will realize that there is only one thing for us to do: to take suchaction and to form such an organization. If you are really opposed toTotalitarianism, to all of it, in any shape, form or color—you will join us. Wepropose to unite all men of good will who believe that Freedom is our mostprecious possession, that it is greater than any other consideration whatsoever,that no good has ever been accomplished by force, that Freedom must not besacrificed to any other ideal, and that Freedom is an individual, not acollective entity.We do not know how many of us there are left in the world. But we think thereare many more than the Totalitarians suspect. We are the majority, but we arescattered, unorganized, silenced and helpless. The Totalitarians are anefficient, organized and very noisy minority. They have seized key positions inour intellectual life and they make it appear as if they are the voice ofAmerica. They can, if left unchecked, highjack America into dictatorship. Are wegoing to let them get away with it? They are not the voice of America. We are.But let us be heard.To be heard, however, we must be organized. This is not a paradox.Individualists have always been reluctant to form any sort of organization. Thebest, the most independent, the hardest working, the most productive members ofsociety have always lived and worked alone. But the incompetent and theunscrupulous have organized. The world today shows how well they have organized.And so, we shall attempt what has never been attempted before—an organizationagainst organization. That is—an organization to defend us all from the comingcompulsory organization which will swallow all of society; an organization todefend our rights, including the right not to belong to any forced organization;an organization, not to impose our ideology upon anyone, but to prevent anyonefrom imposing his ideology upon us by physical or social violence.Are you with us?If you realize that the world is moving toward disaster, but see no effectiveforce to avert it-If you are eager to join in a great cause and accept a great faith, but find nosuch cause or faith offered to you anywhere today—If you are not one of those doomed jellyfish to whom the word “Freedom” meansnothing—If you cannot conceive of yourself living in a society without personal freedom,a society in which you will be told what to do, what to think, what to feel, inwhich your very life will be only a gift from the Collective, to be revoked atits pleasure at any time—If you cannot conceive of yourself surrendering your freedom for any collectivegood whatsoever, and do not believe that any such good can ever be accomplishedby such a surrender—If you believe in your own dignity and your own value, and hold that such abelief is not “selfish,” but is instead your greatest virtue, without which youare worthless both to your fellow-men and to yourself—If you believe that it is vicious to demand that you should exist solely for thesake of your fellow-men and grant them all and any right over you—If you believe that it is vicious to demand everyone’s sacrifice for everyoneelse’s sake, and that such a demand creates nothing but mutual victims, withoutprofiting anyone, neither society nor the individual—If you believe that men can tell you what you must not do to them, but can neverassume the arrogance of telling you what you must do, no matter what theirnumber—If you believe in majority rule only with protection for minority rights, bothbeing limited by inalienable individual rights—If you believe that the mere mention of “the good of the majority” is notsufficient ground to justify any possible kind of horror, and that those yellingloudest of “majority good” are not necessarily the friends of mankind—If you are sick of professional “liberals,” “humanitarians,” “uplifters” and“idealists” who would do you good as they see it, even if it kills you, whoseidea of world benevolence is world slavery—If you are sick, disgusted, disheartened, without faith, without direction, andhave lost everything but your courage-—come and join us.There is so much at stake—and so little time left.Let us have an organization as strong, as sure, as enthusiastic as any theTotalitarians could hope to achieve. Let us follow our faith as consistently asthey follow theirs. Let us offer the world our philosophy of life. Let us exposeall Totalitarian propaganda in any medium and in any form. Let us answer everyargument, every promise, every “Party Line” of the Totalitarians. Let us dropall compromise, all cooperation or collaboration with those preaching any brandof Totalitarianism in letter or in spirit, in name or in fact. Let us havenothing to do with “Front” organizations, “Front” agents or “Front” ideas. We donot have to proscribe them by law. We can put them out of existence by socialboycott. But this means—no compromise. There is no compromise between life anddeath. You do not make deals with the black plague. Let us touch nothing taintedwith Totalitarianism. Let us tear down the masks, bring them out into the openand—leave them alone. Very strictly alone. No “pro-Soviet” or “pro-Nazi” membersof the board in our organization. No “benevolent” Trojan horses. Let us sticktogether as they do. They silence us, they force us out of public life, theyfill key positions with their own men. Let us stick together—and they will behelpless to continue. They have millions of foreign money on their side. We havethe truth.As a first step and a first declaration of what we stand for, we offer you thefollowing principles:We believe in the value, the dignity and the freedom of Man.We believe:• That each man has inalienable rights which cannot be taken from him for anycause whatsoever. These rights are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.• That the right of life means that man cannot be deprived of his life for theconvenience of any number of other men.• That the right of liberty means freedom of individual decision, individualchoice, individual judgment and individual initiative; it means also the rightto disagree with others.• That the right to the pursuit of happiness means man’s freedom to choose whatconstitutes his own private, personal happiness and to work for its achievement;that such a pursuit is neither evil nor reprehensible, but honorable and good;and that a man’s happiness is not to be prescribed to him by any other man norby any number of other men.• That these rights have no meaning unless they are the unconditional, personal,private possession of each man, granted to him by the fact of his birth, held byhim independently of all other men, and limited only by the exercise of the samerights by other men.• That the only just, moral and beneficent form of society is a society basedupon the recognition of these inalienable individual rights.• That the State exists for Man, and not Man for the State.• That the greatest good for all men can be achieved only through the voluntarycooperation of free individuals for mutual benefit, and not through a compulsorysacrifice of all for all.• That “voluntary” presupposes an alternative and a choice of opportunities; andthus even a universal agreement of all men on one course of action is neitherfree nor voluntary if no other course of action is open to them.• That each man’s independence of spirit and other men’s respect for it havecreated all civilization, all culture, all human progress and have benefited allmankind.• That the greatest threat to civilization is the spread of Collectivism, whichdemands the sacrifice of all individual rights to collective rights and thesupremacy of the State over the individual.• That the general good which such Collectivism professes as its objective cannever be achieved at the sacrifice of man’s freedom, and such sacrifice can leadonly to general suffering, stagnation and degeneration.• That such conception of Collectivism is the greatest possible evil—under anyname, in any form, for any professed purpose whatsoever.Such is our definition of Americanism and the American way of life.The American way of life has always been based upon the Rights of Man, uponindividual freedom and upon respect for each individual human personality.Through all its history, this has been the source of America’s greatness. Thisis the spirit of America which we dedicate ourselves to defend and preserve.In practical policy we shall be guided by one basic formula: of every law and ofevery conception we shall demand the maximum freedom for the individual and theminimum power for the government necessary to achieve any given socialobjective.If you believe this, join us. If you don‘t—fight us. Either is your privilege,but the only truly immoral act you can commit is to agree with us, to realizethat we are right—and then to forget it and do nothing.There is some excuse, little as it may be, for an open, honest Fifth Columnist.There is none for an innocent, passive, subconscious one. Of all the things wehave said here to you, we wish to be wrong on only one—our first sentence. Proveus wrong on that. Join us.The world is a beautiful place and worth fighting for. But not without Freedom. 1947 [AR wrote the following article for the Motion Picture Alliance for thePreservation of American Ideals. It was published in the November 1947 issue ofPlain Talk, a conservative political magazine.]SCREEN GUIDE FOR AMERICANSThe influence of Communists in Hollywood is due, not to their own power, but tothe unthinking carelessness of those who profess to oppose them. Some dangerousRed propaganda has been put over in films produced by innocent men, often byloyal Americans who deplore the spread of Communism throughout the world andwonder why it is spreading.If you wish to protect your pictures from being used for Communistic purposes,the first thing to do is to drop the delusion that political propaganda consistsof political slogans.Politics is not a separate field in itself. Political ideas do not come out ofthin air. They are the result of the moral premises which men have accepted.Whatever people believe to be the good, right and proper human actions—that willdetermine their political opinions. If men believe that every independent actionis vicious, they will vote for every measure to control human beings and tosuppress human freedom. If men believe that the American system is unjust, theywill support those who wish to destroy it.The purpose of the Communists in Hollywood is not the production of politicalmovies openly advocating Communism. Their purpose is to corrupt non-politicalmovies—by introducing small, casual bits of propaganda into innocent stories—andto make people absorb the basic premises of Collectivism by indirection andimplication.Few people would take Communism straight. But a constant stream of hints, lines,touches, and suggestions battering the public from the screen will act like thedrops of water that split a rock if continued long enough. The rock they aretrying to split is Americanism.We present below a list of the more common devices used to turn non-politicalpictures into carriers of political propaganda. It is a guide for all those whodo not wish to help advance the cause of Communism.It is intended as a guide, and not as a forced restriction upon anyone. We areunalterably opposed to any political “industry code,” to any group agreement orany manner of forbidding any political opinion to anyone by any form ofcollective force or pressure. There can be no “group insurance” in the field ofideas. Each man has to do his own thinking. We merely offer this list to theindependent judgment and for the voluntary action of every honest man in themotion picture industry.1. DON’T TAKE POLITICS LIGHTLY.Don’t fool yourself by saying, “I’m not interested in politics,” and thenpretending that politics do not exist.We are living in an age when politics is the most burning question ineverybody’s mind. The whole world is torn by a great political issue—freedom orslavery, which means Americanism or Totalitarianism. Half the world is in ruinsafter a war fought over political ideas. To pretend at such a time thatpolitical ideas are not important and that people pay no attention to them isworse than irresponsible.It is the avowed purpose of the Communists to insert propaganda into movies.Therefore, there are only two possible courses of action open to you, if youwant to keep your pictures clean of subversive propaganda:1. If you have no time or inclination to study political ideas—then do not hireReds to work on your pictures.2. If you wish to employ Reds, but intend to keep their politics out of yourmovies—then study political ideas and learn how to recognize propaganda when yousee it.But to hire Communists on the theory that “they won’t put over any politics onme” and then remain ignorant and indifferent to the subject of politics, whilethe Reds are trained propaganda experts—is an attitude for which there can be noexcuse.2. DON’T SMEAR THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM.Don’t pretend that Americanism and the Free Enterprise System are two things.They are inseparable, like body and soul. The basic principle of inalienableindividual rights, which is Americanism, can be translated into practicalreality only in the form of the economic system of Free Enterprise. That was thesystem established by the American Constitution, the system which made Americathe best and greatest country on earth. You may preach any other form ofeconomics, if you wish. But if you do so, don’t pretend that you are preachingAmericanism.Don’t pretend that you are upholding the Free Enterprise System in some vague,general, undefined way, while preaching the specific ideas that oppose anddestroy it.Don’t attack individual rights, individual freedom, private action, privateinitiative, and private property. These things are essential parts of the FreeEnterprise System, without which it cannot exist.Don’t preach the superiority of public ownership as such over private ownership.Don’t preach or imply that all publicly owned projects are noble, humanitarianundertakings by grace of the mere fact that they are publicly owned—whilepreaching, at the same time, that private property or the defense of privateproperty rights is the expression of some sort of vicious greed, of anti-socialselfishness or evil.3. DON’T SMEAR INDUSTRIALISTS.Don’t spit into your own face or, worse, pay miserable little rats to do it.You, as a motion picture producer, are an industrialist. All of us are employeesof an industry that gives us a good living. There is an old fable about a pigwho filled his belly with acorns, then started digging to undermine the roots ofthe oak from which the acorns came. Don’t let’s allow that pig to become oursymbol.Throughout American history, the best of American industrialists were men whoembodied the highest virtues: productive genius, energy, initiative,independence, courage. Socially (if “social significance” interests you) theywere among the greatest of all benefactors, because it is they who created theopportunities for achieving the unprecedented material wealth of the industrialage.In our own day, all around us, there are countless examples of self-made men whorose from the ranks and achieved great industrial success through their energy,ability and honest productive effort.Yet all too often industrialists, bankers, and businessmen are presented on thescreen as villains, crooks, chiselers or exploiters. One such picture may betaken as non-political or accidental. A constant stream of such pictures becomespernicious political propaganda: it creates hatred for all businessmen in themind of the audience, and makes people receptive to the cause of Communism.While motion pictures have a strict code that forbids us to offend or insult anygroup or nation—while we dare not present in an unfavorable light the tiniestBalkan kingdom—we permit ourselves to smear and slander American businessmen inthe most irresponsibly dishonest manner.It is true that there are vicious businessmen—just as there are vicious men inany other class or profession. But we have been practicing an outrageous kind ofdouble standard: we do not attack individual representatives of any other group,class or nation, in order not to imply attack on the whole group; yet when wepresent individual businessmen as monsters, we claim that no reflection on thewhole class of businessmen was intended.It’s got to be one or the other. This sort of double standard can deceive nobodyand can serve nobody’s purpose except that of the Communists.It is the moral—(no, not just political, but moral)—duty of every decent man inthe motion picture industry to throw into the ashcan, where it belongs, everystory that smears industrialists as such.4. DON’T SMEAR WEALTH.In a free society—such as America—wealth is achieved through production, andthrough the voluntary exchange of one’s goods or services. You cannot holdproduction as evil—nor can you hold as evil a man’s right to keep the result ofhis own effort.Only savages and Communists get rich by force—that is, by looting the propertyof others. It is a basic American principle that each man is free to work forhis own benefit and to go as far as his ability will carry him; and that hisproperty is his—whether he has made one dollar or one million dollars.If the villain in your story happens to be rich—don’t permit lines of dialoguesuggesting that he is the typical representative of a whole social class, thesymbol of all the rich. Keep it clear in your mind and in your script that hisvillainy is due to his own personal character—not to his wealth or class.If you do not see the difference between wealth honestly produced and wealthlooted—you are preaching the ideas of Communism. You are implying that allproperty and all human labor should belong to the State. And you are incitingmen to crime: if all wealth is evil, no matter how acquired, why should a manbother to earn it? He might as well seize it by robbery or expropriation.It is the proper wish of every decent American to stand on his own feet, earnhis own living, and be as good at it as he can—that is, get as rich as he can byhonest exchange.Stop insulting him and stop defaming his proper ambition. Stop giving him—andyourself—a guilt complex by spreading unthinkingly the slogans of Communism. Putan end to that pernicious modern hypocrisy: everybody wants to get rich andalmost everybody feels that he must apologize for it.5. DON’T SMEAR THE PROFIT MOTIVE.If you denounce the profit motive, what is it that you wish men to do? Workwithout reward, like slaves, for the benefit of the State?An industrialist has to be interested in profit. In a free economy, he can makea profit only if he makes a good product which people are willing to buy. Whatdo you want him to do? Should he sell his product at a loss? If so, how long ishe to remain in business? And at whose expense?Don’t give to your characters—as a sign of villainy, as a damningcharacteristic—a desire to make money. Nobody wants to, or should, work withoutpayment, and nobody does—except a slave. There is nothing dishonorable about apursuit of money in a free economy, because money can be earned only byproductive effort.If what you mean, when you denounce it, is a desire to make money dishonestly orimmorally—then say so. Make it clear that what you denounce is dishonesty, notmoney-making. Make it clear that you are denouncing evil-doers, not capitalists.Don’t toss out careless generalities which imply that there is no differencebetween the two. That is what the Communists want you to imply.6. DON’T SMEAR SUCCESS.America was made by the idea that personal achievement and personal success areeach man’s proper and moral goal.There are many forms of success: spiritual, artistic, industrial, financial. Allthese forms, in any field of honest endeavor, are good, desirable and admirable.Treat them as such.Don’t permit any disparagement or defamation of personal success. It is theCommunists’ intention to make people think that personal success is somehowachieved at the expense of others and that every successful man has hurtsomebody by becoming successful.It is the Communists’ aim to discourage all personal effort and to drive meninto a hopeless, dispirited, gray herd of robots who have lost all personalambition, who are easy to rule, willing to obey and willing to exist in selflessservitude to the State.America is based on the ideal of man’s dignity and self-respect. Dignity andself-respect are impossible without a sense of personal achievement. When youdefame success, you defame human dignity.America is the land of the self-made man. Say so on the screen.7. DON’T GLORIFY FAILURE.Failure, in itself, is not admirable. And while every man meets with failuresomewhere in his life, the admirable thing is his courage in overcoming it—notin the fact that he failed.Failure is no disgrace—but it is certainly no brand of virtue or nobility,either.It is the Communist’s intention to make men accept misery, depravity anddegradation as their natural lot in life. This is done by presenting every kindof failure as sympathetic, as a sign of goodness and virtue—while every kind ofsuccess is presented as a sign of evil. This implies that only the evil cansucceed under our American system—while the good are to be found in the gutter.Don’t present all the poor as good and all the rich as evil. In judging a man’scharacter, poverty is no disgrace—but it is no virtue, either; wealth is novirtue—but it is certainly no disgrace.8. DON’T GLORIFY DEPRAVITY.Don’t present sympathetic studies of depravity. Go easy on stories aboutmurders, perverts and all the rest of that sordid stuff. If you use suchstories, don’t place yourself and the audience on the side of the criminal,don’t create sympathy for him, don’t give him excuses and justifications, don’timply that he “couldn’t help it.”If you preach that a depraved person “couldn’t help it,” you are destroying thebasis of all morality. You are implying that men cannot be held responsible fortheir evil acts, because man has no power to choose between good and evil; ifso, then all moral precepts are futile, and men must resign themselves to theidea that they are helpless, irresponsible animals. Don’t help to spread such anidea.When you pick these stories for their purely sensational value, you do notrealize that you are dealing with one of the most crucial philosophic issues.These stories represent a profoundly insidious attack on all moral principlesand all religious precepts. It is a basic tenet of Marxism that man has nofreedom of moral or intellectual choice; that he is only a soulless, witlesscollection of meat and glands, open to any sort of “conditioning” by anybody.The Communists intend to become the “conditioners.”There is too much horror and depravity in the world at present. If people seenothing but horror and depravity on the screen, you will merely add to theirdespair by driving in the impression that nothing better is possible to men orcan be expected of life, which is what the Communists want people to think.Communism thrives on despair. Men without hope are easily ruled.Don’t excuse depravity. Don’t drool over weaklings as conditioned “victims ofcircumstances” (or of “background” or of “society”), who “couldn’t help it.” Youare actually providing an excuse and an alibi for the worst instincts in theweakest members of your audience.Don’t tell people that man is a helpless, twisted, drooling, sniveling, neuroticweakling. Show the world an American kind of man, for a change.9. DON’T DEIFY “THE COMMON MAN.”“The common man” is one of the worst slogans of Communism—and too many of ushave fallen for it, without thinking.It is only in Europe—under social caste systems where men are divided into“aristocrats” and “commoners”—that one can talk about defending the “commonman.” What does the word “common” mean in America?Under the American system, all men are equal under the law. Therefore, if anyoneis classified as “common”—he can be called “common” only in regard to hispersonal qualities. It then means that he has no outstanding abilities, nooutstanding virtues, no outstanding intelligence. Is that an object ofglorification?In the Communist doctrine, it is. Communism preaches the reign of mediocrity,the destruction of all individuality and all personal distinction, the turningof men into “masses,” which means an undivided, undifferentiated, impersonal,average, common herd.In the American doctrine, no man is common. Every man’s personality isunique—and it is respected as such. He may have qualities which he shares withothers; but his virtue is not gauged by how much he resembles others—that is theCommunist doctrine; his virtue is gauged by his personal distinction, great orsmall.In America, no man is scorned or penalized if his ability is small. But neitheris he praised, extolled and glorified for the smallness of his ability.America is the land of the uncommon man. It is the land where man is free todevelop his genius—and to get its just rewards. It is the land where each mantries to develop whatever quality he might possess and to rise to whateverdegree he can, great or modest. It is not the land where one is taught that oneis small and ought to remain small. It is not the land where one glories or istaught to glory in one’s mediocrity.No self-respecting man in America is or thinks of himself as “little,” no matterhow poor he might be. That, precisely, is the difference between an Americanworking man and a European serf.Don’t ever use any lines about “the common man” or “the little people.” It isnot the American idea to be either “common” or “little.”10. DON’T GLORIFY THE COLLECTIVE.This point requires your careful and thoughtful attention.There is a great difference between free cooperation and forced collectivism. Itis the difference between the United States and Soviet Russia. But theCommunists are very skillful at hiding the difference and selling you the secondunder the guise of the first. You might miss it. The audience won’t.Cooperation is the free association of men who work together by voluntaryagreement, each deriving from it his own personal benefit.Collectivism is the forced herding together of men into a group, with theindividual having no choice about it, no personal motive, no personal reward,and subordinating himself blindly to the will of others.Keep this distinction clearly in mind—in order to judge whether what you areasked to glorify is American cooperation or Soviet collectivism.Don’t preach that everybody should be and act alike.Don’t fall for such drivel as “I don’t wanna be dif‘rent—I wanna be just likeever’body else.” You’ve heard this one in endless variations. If ever there wasan un-American attitude, this is it. America is the country where every manwants to be different—and most men succeed at it.If you preach that it is evil to be different—you teach every particular groupof men to hate every other group, every minority, every person, for beingdifferent from them; thus you lay the foundation for racial hatred.Don’t preach that all mass action is good, and all individual action is evil. Itis true that there are vicious individuals; it is also true that there arevicious groups. Both must be judged by their specific actions—and not treated asan issue of “the one” against “the many,” with the many always right and the onealways wrong.Remember that it is the Communists’ aim to preach the supremacy, the holy virtueof the group—as opposed to the individual. It is not America’s aim. Nor yours.11. DON’T SMEAR AN INDEPENDENT MAN.This is part of the same issue as the preceding point.The Communists’ chief purpose is to destroy every form ofindependence—independent work, independent action, independent property,independent thought, an independent mind, or an independent man.Conformity, alikeness, servility, submission and obedience are necessary toestablish a Communist slave-state. Don’t help the Communists to teach men toacquire these attitudes.Don’t fall for the old Communist trick of thinking that an independent man or anindividualist is one who crushes and exploits others—such as a dictator. Anindependent man is one who stands alone and respects the same right of others,who does not rule or serve, who neither sacrifices himself nor others. Adictator—by definition—is the most complete collectivist of all, because heexists by ruling, crushing and exploiting a huge collective of men.Don’t permit the snide little touches that Communists sneak into scripts—all thelines, hints and implications which suggest that something (a person, anattitude, a motive, an emotion) is evil because it is independent (or private,or personal, or single, or individual).Don’t preach that everything done for others is good, while everything done forone’s own sake is evil. This damns every form of personal joy and happiness.Don’t preach that everything “public-spirited” is good, while everythingpersonal and private is evil.Don’t make every form of loneliness a sin, and every form of the herd spirit avirtue.Remember that America is the country of the pioneer, the non-conformist, theinventor, the originator, the innovator. Remember that all the great thinkers,artists, scientists were single, individual, independent men who stood alone,and discovered new directions of achievement—alone.Don’t let yourself be fooled when the Reds tell you that what they want todestroy are men like Hitler or Mussolini. What they want to destroy are men likeShakespeare, Chopin and Edison.If you doubt this, think of a certain movie, in which a great composer wasdamned for succumbing, temporarily, to a horrible, vicious, selfish, anti socialsin. What was his sin? That he wanted to sit alone in his room and write music![The movie AR refers to is A Song to Remember; her review of it is presentedlater in the chapter.]12. DON’T USE CURRENT EVENTS CARELESSLY.A favorite trick of the Communists is to insert into pictures casual lines ofdialogue about some important, highly controversial political issue, to insertthem as accidental small talk, without any connection to the scene, the plot, orthe story.Don’t permit such lines. Don’t permit snide little slurs at any politicalparty—in a picture which is to be released just before election time.Don’t allow chance remarks of a partisan nature about any current politicalevents.If you wish to mention politics on the screen, or take sides in a currentcontroversy—then do so fully and openly. Even those who do not agree with youwill respect an honest presentation of the side you’ve chosen. But the seeminglyaccidental remarks, the casual wisecracks, the cowardly little half-hints arethe things that arouse the anger and contempt of all those who uphold theopposite side of the issue. In most of the current issues, that opposite siderepresents half or more than half of your picture audience.And it is a sad joke on Hollywood that while we shy away from all controversialsubjects on the screen, in order not to antagonize anybody—we arouse moreantagonism throughout the country and more resentment against ourselves by onecheap little smear line in the midst of some musical comedy than we ever wouldby a whole political treatise.Of all current questions, be most careful about your attitude toward SovietRussia. You do not have to make pro-Soviet or anti-Soviet pictures, if you donot wish to take a stand. But if you claim that you wish to remain neutral,don’t stick into pictures casual lines favorable to Soviet Russia. Look out forremarks that praise Russia directly or indirectly; or statements to the effectthat anyone who is anti-Soviet is pro-Fascist; or references to fictitiousSoviet achievements.Don’t suggest to the audience that the Russian people are free, secure andhappy, that life in Russia is just about the same as in any other country—whileactually the Russian people live in constant terror under a bloody, monstrousdictatorship. Look out for speeches that support whatever is in the Sovietinterests of the moment, whatever is part of the current Communist party line.Don’t permit dialogue such as: “The free, peace-loving nations of theworld—America, England, and Russia ...” or, “Free elections, such as in Poland...” or, “American imperialists ought to get out of China ...”13. DON’T SMEAR AMERICAN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS.The Communist Party line takes many turns and makes many changes to meetshifting conditions. But on one objective it has remained fixed: to underminefaith in and ultimately to destroy our American political institutions.Don’t discredit the Congress of the United States by presenting it as anineffectual body, devoted to mere talk. If you do that—you imply thatrepresentative government is no good, and what we ought to have is a dictator.Don’t discredit our free elections. If you do that—you imply that electionsshould be abolished.Don’t discredit our courts by presenting them as corrupt. If you do that—youlead people to believe that they have no recourse except to violence, sincepeaceful justice cannot be obtained.It is true that there have been vicious Congressmen and judges, and politicianswho have stolen elections, just as there are vicious men in any profession. Butif you present them in a story, be sure to make it clear that you arecriticizing particular men—not the system. The American system, as such, is thebest ever devised in history. If some men do not live up to it—let us damn thesemen, not the system which they betray.CONCLUSIONThese are the things which Communists and their sympathizers try to sneak intopictures intended as non-political-and these are the things you must keep out ofyour scripts, if your intention is to make non-political movies.There is, of course, no reason why you should not make pictures on politicalthemes. In fact, it would be most desirable if there were more picturesadvocating the political principles of Americanism, seriously, consistently, anddramatically. Serious themes are always good entertainment, if honestly done.But if you attempt such pictures—do not undertake them lightly, carelessly, andwith no better equipment than a few trite generalities and safe, benevolentbromides. Be very sure of what you want to say—and say it clearly, specifically,uncompromisingly. Evasions and generalities only help the enemies ofAmericanism—by giving people the impression that American principles are acollection of weak, inconsistent, meaningless, hypocritical, worn-out oldslogans.There is no obligation on you to make political pictures—if you do not wish totake a strong stand. You are free to confine your work to good, honest,non-political movies. But there is a moral obligation on you to present thepolitical ideas of Americanism strongly and honestly—if you undertake pictureswith political themes.And when you make pictures with political themes and implications—Don’t hireCommunists to write, direct or produce them. You cannot expect Communists toremain “neutral” and not to insert their own ideas into their work. Take them attheir word, not ours. They have declared openly and repeatedly that their firstobligation is to the Communist Party, that their first duty is to spread Partypropaganda, and that their work in pictures is only a means to an end, the endbeing the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. You had better believe them abouttheir own stated intentions. Remember that Hitler, too, stated openly that hisaim was world conquest, but nobody believed him or took him seriously until itwas too late.Now a word of warning about the question of free speech. The principle of freespeech requires that we do not use police force to forbid the Communists theexpression of their ideas—which means that we do not pass laws forbidding themto speak. But the principle of free speech does not require that we furnish theCommunists with the means to preach their ideas, and does not imply that we owethem jobs and support to advocate our own destruction at our own expense. TheConstitutional guarantee of free speech reads: “Congress shall pass no law ...”It does not require employers to be suckers.Let the Communists preach what they wish (so long as it remains mere talking) atthe expense of those and in the employ of those who share their ideas. Let themcreate their own motion picture studios, if they can. But let us put an end totheir use of our pictures, our studios and our money for the purpose ofpreaching our exploitation, enslavement and destruction. Freedom of speech doesnot imply that it is our duty to provide a knife for the murderer who wants tocut our throat.[AR later remarked: “When the Screen Guide was first printed, the major studiosgenerally ignored it. Then I began hearing of one studio after another orderingdozens of copies from the Motion Picture Alliance. And the attacks onbusinessmen as villains disappeared; if you watch the old movies, you can seethe difference. ”] 1947[The following was probably also written by ARfor the Motion Picture Alliancefor the Preservation of American Ideals.]The pictures reviewed below are offered as examples of the technique ofimplications. There are many other pictures which contain scenes, episodes orlines of dialogue favorable, wittingly or unwittingly, to the general cause ofcollectivism. But there is no point in listing all such pictures, nor indenouncing anyone for past mistakes. Our purpose is not to denounce specificfilms, but the methods which they represent. With the help of the points givenabove, anyone who wishes to keep the Red trend off the screen will be able todetect it himself in any particular script or picture.Most of the people connected with the production of the pictures reviewed belowwere not Communists nor Communist sympathizers. That is what makes the situationboth needless and tragic. Any man has the right to produce any picture he wishesand to preach any ideas he believes. But it is shocking to see the talent, theskill, the technical knowledge and the wealth that went into the making of thesepictures, turned to the furthering of a cause which does not represent theconvictions of the men involved and which they are the first to repudiate whenit is named.It is the methods by which this is done that we wish to expose to its victims;not as a reproach, but as a warning. If anyone still wishes to permit thesepractices after he understands their nature—that is his right. And it is ours todenounce him.Nobody has ever been endangered by being offered poison in a bottle bearing alabel with a skull-and-crossbones. Poison is usually offered in a glass of thebest wine—or, modem version, in a quart of the milk of human kindness.THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVESMany passages of this picture preach patriotism and sympathy for veterans; thishelps the unwary to accept, under the guise of patriotism, the attacks on thefree enterprise system which this picture also contains.1. A returning war hero is denied a seat on a plane, to make room for anoffensive businessman who is obviously rich. What is the point of thisepisode—if not the implication that the vicious, unpatriotic rich are grosslyindifferent to war heroes? What impression can this leave with the audience—ifnot resentment against businessmen? The episode is the more offensive when weremember that it implies a distortion of real facts. It was not the businessmen[during World War II], but the bureaucrats who controlled priorities on airtravel. If any plane seats were obtained unfairly, it was not money that boughtthem, but political pull. And the only instance of this kind that attractednationwide attention involved soldiers who were thrown off a plane, not to makeroom for a businessman, but for a dog belonging to an amateur politician ofpronounced left-wing tendencies. If the picture episode had no such counterpartin real life, it would be bad enough. But to attach to a businessman thespecific offense committed by a prominent business-baiter is an act of cynical,sickening dishonesty.2. The returned war hero takes a job in a drugstore owned by a national chain,where he is treated unfairly, offensively and antago nistically. What does thisimply—if not the idea that businessmen discriminate against veterans? Whatimpression will this give to nerve-wracked young soldiers—if not the idea thatthey will get no chance in civilian life so long as jobs depend on privatebusiness and private employers? There is another distortion of facts here: mostof the drug companies give special preference to veterans applying for jobs; andso do most other business concerns. If anyone claims that this sequence in thepicture is not to be taken as a reflection upon business—let him answer whetherhe would make a picture showing a labor union discriminating against veterans,and then claim that it is not to be taken as a reflection upon labor.3. The picture denounces a banker for being unwilling to give a veteran a loanwithout collateral, a refusal which is treated as if it were an act of greedyselfishness. This is a demagogue’s conception of economics. Nobody but a moroncould really believe that the money involved in a bank loan belongs to thebanker; that he refuses loans out of personal heartlessness, and that he oughtto hand out the money not on the basis of his depositors’ security but on thebasis of the applicant’s need. If some banker took the admonition of thispicture seriously, who would suffer most and lose their life-savings but thevery people that the Leftists love to cry over—the small depositors, the widowsand orphans? [This idea was later dramatized by the character of Eugene Lawsonin Atlas Shrugged] This incident is, perhaps, the all-time low in irresponsibledemagoguery on the screen. To spread such ideas of economics is to takeadvantage of the most naive and least educated members of the audience. It canhave no result except to arouse the worst instincts—the desire to loot—in somehelpless illiterates who might get the idea that the banks are holding out onthem.4. In the drugstore fight episode, an obnoxious character is presented as beinganti-Communist, and he soon turns out to be anti-Semitic and anti-Negro as well.It is implied that these two attitudes go together, that anyone who isanti-Soviet is pro-Nazi. When we consider that the majority of people in thiscountry are now most bitterly anti-Soviet, the consequences of what this episodesuggests to them are frightful to contemplate.Americans are often confused about economics, and they may be uncertain onwhether this picture is or is not an attack upon the American economic system.So we shall quote from an expert. An Associated Press dispatch of May 12, 1947,from Moscow, states that the Soviet newspaper Culture and Life denouncedAmerican movies for spreading propaganda favorable to capitalism and theAmerican way of life. Commentator Yuri Zhukov wrote that American producers werecooperating with the State Department and “monopoly capital” to glut the worldmarket with films “giving a distorted sweetened picture of life in the UnitedStates.” Zhukov, however, praised one American film—The Best Years of Our Lives.He ought to know.[The Best Years of Our Lives won seven Academy Awards in 1946.]A SONG TO REMEMBERThis is a curious and revealing phenomenon—a philosophical picture. It presents,not superficial politics, but the fundamental essence of the philosophy ofcollectivism. If anyone thinks that collectivists are merely out to destroy somesort of “bloated bankers” or “economic exploiters”—let him see this picture andlearn what they are really after.In order to present a vicious theory, the picture distorted historical eventsand characters—but this is not astonishing, since a vicious theory cannot betrue to facts. The story presents Chopin’s struggle between good and evil, aspersonified by a young Polish girl on the one side and by George Sand on theother. George Sand, according to the picture, is evil because she provides abeautiful, private retreat where Chopin can live in peace and luxury, becauseshe takes care of his every need, attends to his health, and urges him to forgetthe world and devote himself exclusively to the work of writing music, which heis desperately eager to do. The young Polish girl, according to the picture, isgood because she urges Chopin to drop the work that he loves and go out on aconcert tour in order to make money. (Yes, money—strange as this may sound in astory representing an ideology that damns the capitalist system for inducingartists to be commercial.) The girl, in this case, is collecting money “for thepeople,” for a cause that is identified as national or revolutionary or both,and this is supposed to justify anything and everything; so she demands thatChopin renounce his genius, sacrifice his composing and go out to entertainpaying audiences—even though he hates concert playing, is ill with tuberculosisand has been warned by the doctors that the strain of a tour would kill him.When Chopin locks himself in his room to avoid his nagging friends and to work,the picture treats it as an act of selfishness. When George Sand tells hisfriends to leave him alone, the picture treats her as a vicious, anti socialcreature. The Polish girl and a sniveling old music teacher are held up assamples of self-righteous virtue, the virtue being granted to them by the factthat they demand the sacrifice of another man’s life and do not balk atsacrificing the life of a genius to a fund-raising campaign.After much inner suffering, Chopin escapes from Sand’s “selfishness,” goes ontour, breaks under the strain—and dies. This monstrous self-immolation ispresented as an apotheosis of virtue. There is even a final scene where GeorgeSand asks one of the collectivists what they gained by destroying a great life.The answer is that they gained the inspiration given to thousands of humblepeople. To translate this into specific and modern terms, one would have tosuppose that they meant they gained propaganda value—and the audience issupposed to feel: What’s the life of a genius, or of any man for that matter, ascompared to “inspiring” the masses?There you can see collectivism in the raw. There you have it stripped of all thehumanitarian trimmings and dialectic contradictions. This is the concreteillustration of the collectivist doctrine which holds that man exists to serveothers, that he has no right to any personal aim, motive, desire or life, andthat his only proper purpose is to sacrifice himself to the needs of thecollective; therefore, a creative artist is a selfish monster, not because hehurts or exploits anybody, but because he wants to be left alone to do his ownwork; and the creative artist’s proper place is in a gang of fund-moochers orditch-diggers, if the collective so demands.Now, this much is true: creative work is a personal, individual, totallyindependent endeavor; his art means more to the creative artist than any socialproblem, more than anything or anybody. But who—outside the ideologies of SovietRussia or Nazi Germany—will dare to hold the creative artist as evil?October 20, 1947[The following is AR’s testimony before the House Un-American ActivitiesCommittee on October 20, 1947, as reported in the Government Printing Officerecord (“Hearings Regarding Communist Infiltration of the Motion PictureIndustry”). The Committee’s chairman was J. Parnell Thomas; Robert Stripling wasChief Investigator.] The Chairman: Raise your right hand, please, Miss Rand. Do you solemnly swearthe testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothingbut the truth, so help you God?Miss Rand: I do.The Chairman: Sit down. [...]Mr. Stripling: Where were you born, Miss Rand?Miss Rand: In St. Petersburg, Russia.Mr. Stripling: When did you leave Russia?Miss Rand: In 1926.Mr. Stripling: How long have you been employed in Hollywood?Miss Rand: I have been in pictures on and off since late in 1926, butspecifically as a writer this time I have been in Hollywood since late 1943 andam now under contract as a writer.Mr. Stripling: Have you written various novels?Miss Rand: I have written two novels. My first one was called We the Living,which was a story about Soviet Russia and was published in 1936. The second onewas The Fountainhead, published in 1943.Mr. Stripling: Was that a best-seller—The Fountainhead?Miss Rand: Yes; thanks to the American public.Mr. Stripling: Do you know how many copies were sold?Miss Rand: The last I heard was 360,000 copies. I think there have been somemore since.Mr. Stripling: You have been employed as a writer in Hollywood?Miss Rand: Yes; I am under contract at present.Mr. Stripling: Could you name some of the stories or scripts you have writtenfor Hollywood?Miss Rand: I have done the script for The Fountainhead, which has not beenproduced yet, for Warner Brothers, and two adaptations for Hal WallisProductions, at Paramount, which were not my stories but on which I did thescreen plays, which were Love Letters and You Came Along.Mr. Stripling: Now, Miss Rand, you have heard the testimony of Mr. [Louis B.]Mayer?Miss Rand: Yes.Mr. Stripling: You have read the letter I read from Lowell Mellett?Miss Rand: Yes.Mr. Stripling: Which says that the picture Song of Russia has no politicalimplications?Miss Rand: Yes.Mr. Stripling: Did you at the request of Mr. Smith, the investigator for thiscommittee, view the picture Song of Russia?Miss Rand: Yes.Mr. Stripling: Within the past two weeks?Miss Rand: Yes; on October 13, to be exact.Mr. Stripling: In Hollywood?Miss Rand: Yes.Mr. Stripling: Would you give the committee a breakdown of your summary of thepicture relating to either propaganda or an untruthful account or distortedaccount of conditions in Russia?Miss Rand: Yes.First of all I would like to define what we mean by propaganda. We have all beentalking about it, but nobody has stated just what they mean. Now, I use the termto mean that Communist propaganda is anything which gives a good impression ofcommunism as a way of life. Anything that sells people the idea that life inRussia is good and that people are free and happy would be Communist propaganda.Am I not correct? I mean, would that be a fair statement to make—that that wouldbe Communist propaganda?Now, here is what the picture Song of Russia contains. It starts with anAmerican conductor, played by Robert Taylor, giving a concert in America forRussian war relief. He starts playing the American national anthem and thenational anthem dissolves into a Russian mob, with the sickle and hammer on ared flag very prominent above their heads. I am sorry, but that made me sick.That is something which I do not see how native Americans permit, and I am onlya naturalized American. That was a terrible touch of propaganda. As a writer, Ican tell you just exactly what it suggests to the people. It suggests literallyand technically that it is quite all right for the American national anthem todissolve into the Soviet. The term here is more than just technical. It reallywas symbolically intended, and it worked out that way. The anthem continues,played by a Soviet band. That is the beginning of the picture.Now we go to the pleasant love story. Mr. Taylor is an American who came thereapparently voluntarily to conduct concerts for the Soviets. He meets a littleRussian girl from a village who comes to him and begs him to go to her villageto direct concerts there. There are no G.P.U. agents and nobody stops her. Shejust comes to Moscow and meets him. He decides he will go [with her], because heis falling in love. He asks her to show him Moscow. She says she has never seenit. He says, “I will show it to you.”They see it together. The picture then goes into a scene of Moscow, supposedly.I don’t know where the studio got its shots, but I have never seen anything likeit in Russia. First you see Moscow buildings—big, prosperous-looking, cleanbuildings, with something like swans or sailboats in the foreground. Then yousee a Moscow restaurant that just never existed there. When I was in Russia,there was only one such restaurant, which was nowhere as luxurious as that andno one could enter it except commissars and profiteers. Certainly a girl from avillage, who in the first place would never have been allowed to come to Moscowwithout permission, could not afford to enter it, even if she worked for tenyears. However, there is a Russian restaurant with a menu such as never existedin Russia even before the revolution. From this restaurant they go on to thistour of Moscow. The streets are clean and prosperous-looking. There are no foodlines anywhere. You see shots of the marble subway—the famous Russian subway outof which they make such propaganda capital. There is a marble statue of Stalinthrown in. There is a park where you see happy little children in white blousesrunning around. I don’t know whose children they are, but they are really happykiddies. They are not homeless children in rags, such as I have seen in Russia.Then you see an excursion boat, on which the Russian people are smiling, sittingaround very cheerfully, dressed in some sort of satin blouses such as they onlywear in Russian restaurants here.Then they attend a luxurious dance. I don’t know where they got the idea of theclothes and the settings that they used at the ball and—Mr. Stripling: Is that a ballroom scene?Miss Rand: Yes; the ballroom—where they dance. It was an exaggeration even forthis country. I never saw anybody wearing such clothes and dancing to suchexotic music when I was there. Of course, it didn’t say whose ballroom it is orhow they got there. But there they are—free and dancing very happily.Incidentally, I understand from correspondents who have left or escaped fromRussia later than I did, that the time I last saw it, which was in 1926, was thebest time since the Russian revolution. At that time conditions were a littlebetter than they have become since. In my time we were a bunch of ragged,starved, dirty, miserable people who had only two thoughts in our mind. That wasour complete terror—afraid to look at one another, afraid to say anything forfear of who is listening and would report us—and where to get the next meal. Youhave no idea what it means to live in a country where nobody has any concernexcept food, where all the conversation is about food because everybody is sohungry that that is all they can think about and that is all they can afford todo. They have no idea of politics. They have no idea of any pleasant romances orlove—nothing but food and fear.That is what I saw up to 1926. That is not what the picture shows.Now, after this tour of Moscow, the hero—the American conductor—goes to theSoviet village. The Russian villages are so miserable and so filthy. They were[that] even before the revolution. What they have become now I am afraid tothink. You have all read about the program for the collectivization of the farmsin 1933, at which time the Soviet Government admits that three million peasantsdied of starvation. Other people claim there were seven and a half million, butthree million is the figure admitted by the Soviet Government as the figure ofpeople who died of starvation, planned by the government in order to drivepeople into collective farms. That is a recorded historical fact.Now, here is life in the Soviet village as presented in Song of Russia. You seethe happy peasants. You see they are meeting the hero at the station with bands,with beautiful blouses and shoes, such as they never wore anywhere. You seechildren with operetta costumes on them and with a brass band which they couldnever afford. You see the manicured starlets driving tractors and the happywomen who come from work singing. You see a peasant at home with a close-up offood for which anyone there would have been murdered. If anybody had such foodin Russia in that time he couldn’t remain alive, because he would have been tornapart by neighbors trying to get food. But here is a close-up of it and a linewhere Robert Taylor comments on the food and the peasant answers, “This is justa simple country table and the food we eat ourselves.”Then the peasant proceeds to show Taylor how they live. He shows him hiswonderful tractor. It is parked somewhere in his private garage. He shows himthe grain in his bin, and Taylor says, “That is wonderful grain.” Now, it isnever said that the peasant does not own this tractor or this grain because itis a collective farm. He couldn’t have it. It is not his. But the impression hegives to Americans, who wouldn’t know any different, is that certainly it isthis peasant’s private property, and that is how he lives, he has his owntractor and his own grain. Then it shows miles and miles of plowed fields.The Chairman: We will have more order, please.Miss Rand: Am I speaking too fast?The Chairman: Go ahead.Miss Rand: Then—Mr. Stripling: Miss Rand, may I bring up one point there?Miss Rand: Surely.Mr. Stripling: I saw the picture. At this peasant’s village or home, was there apriest or several priests in evidence?Miss Rand: Oh yes; I am coming to that, too. The priest was in the villagescenes, having a position as sort of a constant companion and friend of thepeasants, as if religion was a natural and accepted part of that life. Well,now, as a matter of fact, the [policy on] religion in Russia in my time was, andI understand it still is, that for a Communist Party member to have anything todo with religion means expulsion from the Party. He is not allowed to enter achurch or take part in any religious ceremony. For a non-Party member it waspermitted, but it was so frowned upon that people had to keep it secret if theywent to church. If they wanted a church wedding they usually had it privately intheir homes, with only a few friends present, in order not to let it be known attheir place of employment because, even though it was not forbidden, the chanceswere that they would be thrown out of a job if it was known that they practicedany kind of religion.Now, then, to continue with the story, Robert Taylor proposes to the heroine.She accepts him. They have a wedding, which, of course, is a church wedding. Ittakes place with all the religious pomp. They have a banquet. They have dancers,in something like satin skirts and performing ballets such as you never couldpossibly see in any village and certainly not in Russia. Later they show apeasants’ meeting place, which is a kind of marble palace with crystalchandeliers. Where they got it or who built it for them I would like to be told.Then later you see that the peasants all have radios. When the heroine plays asa soloist with Robert Taylor’s orchestra, after she marries him, you see a scenewhere all the peasants are listening on radios, and one of them says, “There aremany millions listening to the concert.”I don’t know whether there are a hundred private individuals in Russia who ownradios. And I remember reading in the newspaper at the beginning of the war thatevery radio was seized by the Government and people were not allowed to ownthem. The idea that every poor peasant has a radio is certainly preposterous.You also see that they have long-distance telephones. Later in the picture,Taylor has to call his wife in the village by long-distance telephone. Wherethey got this long-distance phone, I don’t know.Now, here comes the crucial point of the picture. In the midst of this concert,when the heroine is playing, you see a scene on the border of the U.S.S.R. Youhave a very lovely modernistic sign saying “U.S.S.R.” I would just like toremind you that that is the border where probably thousands of people have diedtrying to escape out of this lovely paradise. It shows the U.S.S.R. sign, andthere is a border guard standing. He is listening to the concert. Then there isa scene inside a guardhouse where the guards are listening to the same concert,the beautiful Tschaikovsky music, and they are playing chess. Suddenly there isa Nazi attack on them. The poor, sweet Russians were unprepared. Now,realize—and that was a great shock to me—that the border that was being shownwas the border of Poland. That was the border of an occupied, enslaved countrywhich Hitler and Stalin destroyed together. That was the border that was beingshown to us—just a happy place with people listening to music.Also realize that when all this sweetness and light was going on in the firstpart of the picture, with all these happy, free people, there was not a G.P.U.agent among them, with no food lines, no persecution—complete freedom andhappiness, with everybody smiling. Incidentally, I have never seen so muchsmiling in my life, except on the murals of the world’s fair pavilion of theSoviets. If any one of you have seen it, you can appreciate it. It is one of thestock propaganda tricks of the Communists, to show these people smiling. That isall they can show. You have all this, plus the fact that an American conductorhad accepted an invitation to come there and conduct a concert, and this tookplace in 1941 when Stalin was the ally of Hitler. That an American would acceptan invitation to that country was shocking to me, with everything being shown asproper and good and all those happy people going around dancing, when Stalin wasan ally of Hitler.Now, then, the heroine decides that she wants to stay in Russia. Taylor wouldlike to take her out of the country, but she says no, her place is here, she hasto fight the war. Here is the line, as nearly exact as I could mark it whilewatching the picture: “I have a great responsibility to my family, to myvillage, and to the way I have lived.” What way had she lived? This is just apolite way of saying the Communist way of life. She goes on to say that shewants to stay in the country because otherwise “How can I help to build a betterand better life for my country?” What is meant by “better and better”? Thatmeans she has already helped to build a good way. That is the Soviet Communistway. But now she wants to make it even better.Taylor’s manager, an American, tells her that she should leave the country, butwhen she refuses and wants to stay, here is the line he uses: he tells her in anadmiring, friendly way that “You are a fool, but a lot of fools like you died onthe village green at Lexington.”Now, I submit that this is blasphemy, because the men at Lexington were notfighting just a foreign invader. They were fighting for freedom and what Imean—and I intend to be exact—is they were fighting for political freedom andindividual freedom. They were fighting for the rights of man. To compare them tosomeone fighting for a slave state, I think is dreadful.Then, later, the girl or one of the other characters says that “the culture wehave been building here will never die.” What culture? The culture ofconcentration camps.At the end of the picture one of the Russians asks Taylor and the girl to goback to America, because they can help them there. How? Here is what he says,“You can go back to your country and tell them what you have seen and you willsee the truth both in speech and in music.” Now, that is plainly saying thatwhat you have seen is the truth about Russia. That is what is in the picture.Now, here is what I cannot understand: if the excuse that has been given here isthat we had to produce the picture in wartime, just how can it help the wareffort? If [the goal] is to deceive the American people, if it is to present tothe American people a picture of Russia that is better than it really is, thenthat sort of an attitude is nothing but the theory of the Nazi elite—that achoice group of intellectual or other leaders will tell the people lies fortheir own good. I don’t think that is the American way of giving peopleinformation. We do not have to deceive the people at any time, in war or peace.If it was to please the Russians, I don’t see how you can please the Russians bytelling them that we are fools. To what extent we have done it, you can seeright now. You can see the results right now. If we present a picture like thatas our version of what goes on in Russia, what will they think of it? We don’twin anybody’s friendship. We will only win their contempt, and as you know theRussians have been [treating us with contempt].My whole point about the picture is this: I fully believe Mr. Mayer when he saysthat he did not make a Communist picture. To do him justice, I can tell you Inoticed that there was an effort to cut propaganda out. I believe he tried tocut propaganda out of the picture, but the terrible thing is the carelessnesswith ideas, not realizing that the mere presentation of that kind of happyexistence in a country of slavery and horror is terrible propaganda. You aretelling people that it is all right to live in a totalitarian state.Now, I would like to say that nothing on earth will justify slavery. In war orpeace or at any time you cannot justify slavery. You cannot tell people that itis all right to live under it and that everybody there is happy.If you doubt this, I will just ask you one question. Visualize a picture [set]in Nazi Germany. If anybody laid a plot just based on a pleasant little romancein Germany and played Wagner’s music and said that people are happy there, wouldyou say that that was propaganda or not, when you know what life in Germany wasand what kind of concentration camps they had there. You would not dare to putjust a happy love story into Germany, and for every one of the same reasons youshould not do it about Russia.Mr. Stripling: That is all I have, Mr. Chairman.The Chairman: Mr. Wood. [John Stephens Wood was a Democratic congressman fromGeorgia.]Mr. Wood: I gather, then, from your analysis of this picture your personalcriticism of it is that it overplayed the conditions that existed in Russia atthe time the picture was made; is that correct?Miss Rand: Did you say overplayed?Mr. Wood: Yes.Miss Rand: Well, the story portrayed the people—Mr. Wood: It portrayed the people of Russia in a better economic and socialposition than they occupied?Miss Rand: That is right.Mr. Wood: And it would also leave the impression in the average mind that theywere better able to resist the aggression of the German Army than they were infact able to resist?Miss Rand: Well, that was not in the picture. So far as the Russian war wasconcerned, not very much was shown about it.Mr. Wood: Well, you recall, I presume—it is a matter of history—going back tothe middle of the First World War when Russia was also our ally against the sameenemy that we were fighting at this time and they were knocked out of the war.When the remnants of their forces turned against us, it prolonged the FirstWorld War a considerable time, didn’t it?Miss Rand: I don’t believe so.Mr. Wood: You don’t?Miss Rand: No.Mr. Wood: Do you think, then, that it was to our advantage or to ourdisadvantage to keep Russia in this war, at the time this picture was made? MissRand: That has absolutely nothing to do with what we are discussing.Mr. Wood: Well—Miss Rand: But if you want me to answer, I can answer, but it will take me along time to say what I think, as to whether we should or should not have hadRussia on our side in the war. I can, but how much time will you give me?Mr. Wood: Well, do you say that it would have prolonged the war, so far as wewere concerned, if they had been knocked out of it at that time?Miss Rand: I can’t answer that yes or no, unless you give me time for a longspeech on it.Mr. Wood: Well, there is a pretty strong probability that we wouldn’t have wonat all, isn’t there?Miss Rand: I don’t know, because on the other hand I think we could have usedthe lend-lease supplies that we sent there to much better advantage ourselves.Mr. Wood: Well, at that time—Miss Rand: I don’t know. It is a question.Mr. Wood: We were furnishing Russia with all the lend-lease equipment that ourindustry would stand, weren’t we?Miss Rand: That is right.Mr. Wood: And continued to do it?Miss Rand: I am not sure it was at all wise. Now, if you want to discuss mymilitary views—I am not an authority, but I will try.Mr. Wood: What do you interpret, then, the picture as having been made for?Miss Rand: I ask you: what relation could a lie about Russia have with the wareffort? I would like to have somebody explain that to me, because I really don’tunderstand it, why a lie would help anybody or why it would keep Russia in orout of the war. How?Mr. Wood: You don’t think it would have been of benefit to the American peopleto have kept them in?Miss Rand: I don’t believe the American people should ever be told any lies,publicly or privately. I don’t believe that lies are practical. I think theinternational situation now rather supports me. I don’t think it was necessaryto deceive the American people about the nature of Russia.I could add this: if those who saw it say it was quite all right, and perhapsthere are reasons why it was all right to be an ally of Russia, then why weren’tthe American people told the real reasons and told that Russia is a dictatorshipbut there are reasons why we should cooperate with them to destroy Hitler andother dictators? All right, there may be some argument to that. Let us hear it.But of what help can it be to the war effort to tell people that we shouldassociate with Russia and that she is not a dictatorship?Mr. Wood: Let me see if I understand your position. I understand, from what yousay, that because they were a dictatorship we shouldn’t have accepted their helpin undertaking to win a war against another dictatorship.Miss Rand: That is not what I said. I was not in a position to make thatdecision. If I were, I would tell you what I would do. That is not what we arediscussing. We are discussing the fact that our country was an ally of Russia,and the question is: what should we tell the American people about it—the truthor a lie? If we had good reason, if that is what you believe, all right, thenwhy not tell the truth? Say it is a dictatorship, but we want to be associatedwith it. Say it is worthwhile being associated with the devil, as Churchillsaid, in order to defeat another devil which is Hitler. There might be some goodargument made for that. But why pretend that Russia was not what it was?Mr. Wood: Well—Miss Rand: What do you achieve by that?Mr. Wood: Do you think it would have had as good an effect upon the morale ofthe American people to preach a doctrine to them that Russia was on the verge ofcollapse?Miss Rand: I don’t believe that the morale of anybody can be built up by a lie.If there was nothing good that we could truthfully say about Russia, then itwould have been better not to say anything at all.Mr. Wood: Well—Miss Rand: You don’t have to come out and denounce Russia during the war; no.You can keep quiet. There is no moral guilt in not saying something if you can’tsay it, but there is in saying the opposite of what is true.Mr. Wood: Thank you. That is all.The Chairman: Mr. McDowell. [John McDowell was a Republican congressman fromPennsylvania.]Mr. McDowell: You paint a very dismal picture of Russia. You made a great pointabout the number of children who were unhappy. Doesn’t anybody smile in Russiaany more?Miss Rand: Well, if you ask me literally, pretty much no.Mr. McDowell: They don’t smile?Miss Rand: Not quite that way; no. If they do, it is privately and accidentally.Certainly, it is not social. They don’t smile in approval of their system. Mr.McDowell: Well, all they do is talk about food.Miss Rand: That is right.Mr. McDowell: That is a great change from the Russians I have always known, andI have known a lot of them. Don’t they do things at all like Americans? Don’tthey walk across town to visit their mother-in-law or somebody?Miss Rand: Look, it is very hard to explain. It is almost impossible to conveyto a free people what it is like to live in a totalitarian dictatorship. I cantell you a lot of details. I can never completely convince you, because you arefree. It is in a way good that you can’t even conceive of what it is like.Certainly they have friends and mothers-in-law. They try to live a human life,but you understand it is totally inhuman. Try to imagine what it is like if youare in constant terror from morning till night and at night you are waiting forthe doorbell to ring, where you are afraid of anything and everybody, living ina country where human life is nothing, less than nothing, and you know it. Youdon’t know who is going to do what to you because you may have friends who spyon you, and there is no law or rights of any kind.Mr. McDowell: You came here in 1926, I believe you said. Did you escape fromRussia?Miss Rand: No.Mr. McDowell: Did you have a passport?Miss Rand: No. Strangely enough, they gave me a passport to come out here as avisitor.Mr. McDowell: As a visitor?Miss Rand: It was at a time when they relaxed their orders a little bit. Quite afew people got out. I had some relatives here and I was permitted to come herefor a year. I never went back.Mr. McDowell: I see.The Chairman: Mr. Nixon. [Richard Milhous Nixon was a Republican congressman andfuture U.S. president from California.]Mr. Nixon: No questions.The Chairman: All right.The first witness tomorrow morning will be Adolphe Menjou. (Whereupon, at 4:20p.m., an adjournment was taken until 10:30 a.m. of the following day.)[AR planned to testify further on The Best Years of Our Lives, as well as on thewider issues discussed in her Screen Guide. However, she was never given theopportunity. Later, she recalled: “The Best Years of Our Lives was the big hitof the period and the movie I particularly wanted to denounce.... It was muchmore important to show the serious propaganda about America—not some musicalabout Soviet Russia that would not fool anybody, and that had failed at thebox-office.... But the Congressmen told me that they would not dare come outagainst a movie about an armless veteran—there would be a public furor againstthem. ”] 1947[At some point after her testimony, AR wrote the following notes to herself onwhether the Thomas Committee had violated the civil rights of the HollywoodCommunists.]SUGGESTIONS REGARDING THE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION OF COMMUNISMThe whole conception of civil rights (of free speech, free assembly, freepolitical organization) applies to and belongs in the realm of ideas—that is, arealm which precludes the use of physical violence. These rights are based onand pertain to the peaceful activity of spreading or preaching ideas, of dealingwith men by intellectual persuasion. Therefore, one cannot invoke these rightsto protect an organization such as the Communist Party, which not merelypreaches, but actually engages in acts of violence, murder, sabotage, and spyingin the interests of a foreign government. This takes the Communist Party out ofthe realm of civil law and puts it into the realm of criminal law. And the factthat Communists are directed and financed by a foreign power puts them into therealm of treason and military law.The Thomas Committee was inquiring, not into a question of opinion, but into aquestion of fact, the fact being membership in the Communist Party.The Thomas Committee did not ask anyone whether he believed in Communism, butasked only whether he had joined the Communist Party. Membership in theCommunist Party does not consist merely of sharing the ideas of that Party. ThatParty is a formal, closed, and secret organization. Joining it involves morethan a matter of ideas. It involves an agreement to take orders to commitactions—criminal and treasonable actions.The Communists have been trying to claim that belonging to the Communist Partyis the same as belonging to the Republican or Democratic Party. But membershipin the Republican or Democratic Party is an open, public matter. It involves noinitiation, no acceptance of an applicant by the party, and no card-bearing. Itinvolves nothing but a voluntary and open declaration by a citizen that hewishes to be registered as a Republican or a Democrat for the next primaryelection. It is a membership which cannot be refused to him and which he is freeto abandon any time he chooses. It commits him to nothing but an expression ofhis ideas at the ballot box, and he is free to change his mind even about that.Thus, it is truly a matter of a citizen’s personal ideas and convictions,nothing more.Membership in the Communist Party is a formal act of joining a formalorganization whose aims, by its own admission, include acts of criminalviolence. Congress has no right to inquire into ideas or opinions, but has everyright to inquire into criminal activities. Belonging to a secret organizationthat advocates criminal actions comes into the sphere of the criminal, not theideological.It is extremely important to differentiate between the American conception oflaw and the European-totalitarian concept. Under the American law, there is nosuch thing as a political crime; a man’s ideas do not constitute a crime, nomatter what they are. And precisely by the same principle, a man’s ideas—nomatter what they are—cannot serve as a justification for a criminal action anddo not give him freedom to commit such actions on the ground that they representhis personal belief.Under most systems of European law a citizen’s beliefs, if contrary to those ofthe government in power, are considered to be a crime punishable by law.Consequently, an act of violence or a murder committed for a political motive istreated differently from an act of violence or murder committed for a plaincriminal motive. Incidentally, prior to World War I, most European governmentstreated crimes committed for political motives much more leniently and almosthonorably in comparison with the same crimes committed for criminal motives. InAmerica, no man can be sent to jail for holding any sort of ideas. And no man isallowed to demand a consideration of his ideas as a mitigating circumstance whenand if he has committed an act of violence.The entire conception of American law is based on the principle of inalienableindividual rights. This principle precludes the right of one citizen to doviolence to others—no matter what ideas or convictions he may hold. Therefore,any man may preach or advocate anything he wishes, but if he undertakes acts ofviolence in pursuit of his beliefs, then he is treated as a common criminal.American law is not asked to share his conviction—his idea that his rightsinclude the right to use force against other men. (As an example: Americancitizens have freedom of religion; but if some sect attempted to practice humansacrifices, its members would be prosecuted by law—not for their religiousbeliefs, but for murder; their beliefs would not be considered or recognized aspertinent to the case.)Therefore, it is totally irrelevant to Congress whether a man enters a criminalconspiracy for criminal reasons or for reasons he considers political orideological. This is precisely where his ideas do not concern Congress at alland do not enter the question. When Congress investigates the Communist Party,it is investigating a factual matter, a criminal conspiracy, and not a matter ofideas.If it is asked why the Communist Party may be objectively classified as acriminal conspiracy—the answer lies in the factual record of the Party, which isa record of proven criminal activities, in its own professed aims, methods, andintentions, and in the fact of its secrecy. Congress was not inquiring whobelieves in Communism. It was inquiring who belongs to an organization that hasdefined itself, by its own acts and statements, as criminal.If the Communist Party were a purely national American organization, the abovepoints would be sufficient to give Congress the right to inquire into itsactivities. But when we add to it the fact that the Communist Party is anorganization which owes allegiance to a foreign power, then it becomes not onlya matter of crime, but also of treason. A party which is the agent of a foreignpower cannot claim the same rights as an American party—just as a foreignsubject cannot claim all the rights and privileges of an American citizen, nor avoice in the conduct of America’s internal affairs. An investigation into aman’s or an organization’s allegiance to a foreign power is not an ideologicalmatter, but a military one.It is extremely important not to let this whole issue be considered as an issueof the freedom of speech. Nobody has interfered with the right of the HollywoodTen to their freedom of speech; quite the opposite: they raised a howl becausethey were asked to speak. No legal penalties of any kind were to be imposed onthem for their admission of membership in the Communist Party, if they hadchosen to admit it. Yet they are screaming that they were asked to incriminatethemselves. To incriminate themselves in what manner?The Communists claim that the Congressional investigation caused them personaland professional damage, by revealing their political ideas to the public whensuch ideas are unpopular. Freedom of speech means precisely that a citizen hasthe right to hold and advocate his own ideas, even when they are unpopular, andthat no legal penalty (no restraint by force) will be imposed upon him for it.Freedom of speech is the protection of his right to be an unpopular dissenter,if he wishes, without becoming the subject of any violence by any popularmajority. But that same freedom of speech grants other citizens the right toagree or disagree with his ideas.This is exactly why any man’s freedom of speech is no threat or danger to othermen: they are free to consider his ideas and not to cooperate with him, if theydo not agree. They cannot use force against him, but neither are they forced toassist him in his activities against their own interests, ideas, or convictions.Now if the Hollywood Ten claim that a public revelation of their Communist ideasdamages them because it will cost them their Hollywood jobs—then this means thatthey are holding these jobs by fraud, that their employers, their co-workers andtheir public do not know the nature of their ideas and would not want to dealwith them if such knowledge were made available. If so, then the Communists, ineffect, are asking that the government protect them in the perpetration of afraud. They are demanding protection for their right to practice deceit uponothers. They are saying, in effect: I am cheating those with whom I am dealingand if you reveal this, you will cause me to lose my racket—which is aninterference with my freedom of speech and belief.It is not the duty of Congress to inquire into anyone’s ideas—but neither is itthe duty of Congress to protect deceit by withholding from the public anyinformation which may involve someone’s ideas. If, in the course of an inquiryinto criminal and treasonable activities, Congress reveals the nature of thepolitical beliefs of certain men—their freedom of speech or belief has not beeninfringed in any manner. If, as a consequence, their employers—who had beenfoolish, ignorant, or negligent before—now decide to fire these men, that is theemployers’ inalienable right. It is also the inalienable right of the public notto buy the product of these men—in this particular case, not to attend themovies written or directed by the Hollywood Ten. The damage which the Ten claimto have suffered in this case is a private damage, not a legal one, a damagewhich consists of the refusal of private citizens to deal with a Communist, ifthey learn that he is a Communist.And this is another instance where the Communists are attempting to foist atotalitarian conception upon our courts of law, in place of the Americanconception. They are attempting to claim that there is no difference betweenprivate action and government action—that a citizen’s refusal to deal with aCommunist is equivalent to a government order forbidding him to be aCommunist—that a citizen’s refusal to employ a Communist is equivalent to apoliceman’s arresting him—that the disagreement of his fellow-citizens with hisviews and his consequent unpopularity are equivalent to a concentration camp anda firing squad—that the refusal of his victims to cooperate with their ownself-admitted murderer, expropriator, and enslaver is an infringement of hisfreedom and his rights.The Constitutional guarantee of free speech reads: “Congress shall pass no law...” It does not demand that private citizens lend any form of support to thosewhose ideas they do not share.The Communists have perverted the issue of free speech into the following sortof claim: Since a man has the right to hold any ideas he wishes, he must notsuffer any kind of loss, discomfort, damage, or penalty, legal or private, as aconsequence of his ideas. This is the totalitarian conception which recognizesno difference between public, government action and the private actions ofprivate citizens. This is not the American conception of legality, rights, orfree speech.Under the American system, a man has the right to hold any ideas he wishes,without suffering any government restraint for it, without the danger ofphysical violence, bodily injury, or police seizure. That is all. Should he haveto suffer some form of private penalty for his ideas from private citizens whodo not agree with him? He most certainly should. That is the only form ofprotection the rest of the citizens have against him and against the spread ofideas with which they do not agree.Should the Hollywood Ten suffer unpopularity or loss of jobs as a result ofbeing Communists? They most certainly should—so long as the rest of us, who givethem jobs or box-office support, do not wish to be Communists or accessories tothe spread of Communism. If it is claimed that we must not refuse themsupport—what becomes of our right of free speech and belief?"},{"pageContent":"PART 4ATLAS SHRUGGED"},{"pageContent":"11THE MIND ON STRIKEAR organized her journals for Atlas Shrugged by subject Her handwritten noteswere put in folders marked “Philosophical,” “Plot,” “Characters,” “Outlines,”“Research Material,” and “Miscellaneous.” Here the notes are presentedchronologically without regard for subject, so the reader may see theprogression of her thought in developing the novel. AR originally envisioned Atlas Shrugged as a shorter novel than TheFountainhead. In a 1961 interview, she recalled:Atlas Shrugged started with the idea of the plot-theme: the mind goes on strike.At first I saw it more as a political and social novel; I remember thinking thatit will not present any new philosophical ideas, that the philosophy will be thesame as The Fountainhead. It will be individualism, only now I’ll show it in thepolitical-economic realm. The action will tell the philosophic story with aminimum of comment from me; it will show that capitalism and the propereconomics rest on the mind. Then I started working on the philosophic aspect of it, with the assignment tomyself to concretize the theme. Why is the mind important? What specificallydoes the mind do in relationship to human existence? It’s then I began to seethat this is going to be a very important and new philosophical novel. There wasa great deal more to say than merely what I had said in The Fountainhead.Most of the notes in this chapter are from her “philosophical” file. We can seethe novel growing in scope as she elaborates and concretizes the theme.Although AR had thought of the plot-theme in late 1943, she did not begin tomake notes until January I, 1945, and only began full-time work on the novel inApril 1946. The notes in this chapter are largely from this last month -the mostprolific monthofjournal-writing in her life. Nearly all of her notes from thismonth are included here; I omitted only a few pages in which she was rewritingand condensing earlier material. As with The Fountainhead journal, I have used the names of characters as theyappear in the novel. In the course of writing, AR changed the first names ofseveral characters. Dagny’s name was Mamy for a while; Francisco was originallyspelled Francesco because AR thought of the character as more typically Italianthan Spanish; Rearden’s name was Andrew, then William, before she settled onHank; Danneskjöld’s name was Hjalmar, then Ivar, then Kay, before it finallybecame Ragnar.Atlas Shrugged was a chapter title until 1956 when AR’s husband, Frank O‘Connor,suggested that it be the title of the novel. Her working title throughout wasThe Strike. January I, 1945THE STRIKETheme: What happens to the world when the prime movers go on strike.This means: a picture of the world with its motor cut off. Show: what, how, why.The specific steps and incidents—in terms of persons, their spirits, motives,psychology, and actions—and, secondarily, proceeding from persons, in terms ofhistory, society and the world.The theme requires showing who are the prime movers and why, how they function;who are their enemies and why, what are the motives behind the hatred for andthe enslavement of the prime movers; the nature of the obstacles placed in theirway, and the reasons for it.This last paragraph is contained entirely in The Fountainhead. Roark and Tooheyare the complete statement of it. Therefore, this is not the direct theme of TheStrike—but it is part of the theme and must be kept in mind, briefly restated inorder to have the theme clear and complete.The first question to decide is on whom the emphasis must be placed—on the primemovers, the parasites, or the world. The answer is: the world. The story must beprimarily a picture of the whole.In this sense, The Strike is to be much more a “social” novel than TheFountainhead. The Fountainhead was about “individualism and collectivism withinman’s soul”; it showed the nature and function of the creator and thesecond-hander. The primary concern there was with Roark and Toohey—showing whatthey are. The other characters were variations on the theme of the relation ofthe ego to others—mixtures of the two extremes, the two poles: Roark and Toohey.The story’s primary concern was the characters, the people as such, theirnatures. Their relations to each other—which is society, men in relation tomen—were secondary, an unavoidable, direct consequence of Roark set againstToohey. But it was not the theme.131 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_131_r1.gif]Now, it is this relation that must be the theme. Therefore, the personal becomessecondary. That is, the personal is necessary only to the extent needed to makethe relationships clear. In The Fountainhead I showed that Roark moves theworld—that the Keatings feed upon him and hate him for it, while the Tooheys areconsciously out to destroy him. But the theme was Roark—not Roark’s relation tothe world. Now it will be the relation.In other words: I must show in what concrete, specific way the world is moved bythe creators. [I must show] exactly how the second-handers live on the creators,both in spiritual matters and (most particularly) in concrete physical events.(Concentrate on the concrete, physical events—but don’t forget to keep in mindat all times how the physical proceeds from the spiritual.)(A new sidelight here: the dreadful desolation of the world, not only in closedfactories and ruins, but also in the spiritual emptiness, hopelessness,confusion, dullness, grayness, fear. As keys to that: L. L. and M. K. joiningthe Catholic Church. Or: the relation of people to me, what they seem to seekfrom me—think of Marjorie [Hiss], Faith [Hersey], all my girl friends—and evenPat [Isabel Paterson].)However, for the purpose of this story, I do not start by showing how thesecond-handers live on the prime movers in actual, everyday reality—nor do Istart by showing a normal world. (That comes in only in necessary retrospect, orflashback, or by implication in the events themselves.) I start with thefantastic premise of the prime movers going on strike. This is the heart andcenter of the novel. A distinction carefully to be observed here: I do not setout to glorify the prime mover (that was The Fountainhead). I set out to showhow desperately the world needs prime movers, and how viciously it treats them.And I show it on a hypothetical case—what happens to the world without them.The difference from The Fountainhead here will be as follows: in TheFountainhead I did not show how desperately the world needed Roark—except byimplication. I did show how viciously the world treated him, and why. I showedmainly what he is. It was Roark’s story. This must be the world’s story—inrelation to its prime movers. (Almost—the story of a body in relation to itsheart—a body dying of anemia.)I do not show directly what the prime movers do—that’s shown only byimplication. I show what happens when they don’t do it. Through that, you seethe picture of what they do, their place and their role. (This is an importantguide for the construction of the story.)Now to state the theme consecutively: the world lives by the prime movers, hatesthem for it, exploits them and always feels that it has not exploited themenough. They have to fight a terrible battle and suffer every possible torturethat society can impose—in order to create the things from which societybenefits immeasurably and by which alone society can exist. In effect, they mustsuffer and pay for the privilege of giving gifts to society. They must pay forbeing society’s benefactors. That is what happens in [practice] and what societydemands and expects in theory, by the nature of its altruist-collectivistphilosophy.The course of each great cultural step forward runs like this: a genius makes agreat discovery; he is fought, opposed, persecuted, ridiculed, denounced inevery way possible; he is made a martyr—he has to pay for his discovery and forhis greatness, pay in suffering, poverty, obscurity, insults, and sometimes inactual arrest, jail, and death. Then the common herd slowly begins to understandand appreciate his discovery—usually when he is too old, worn, embittered, andtired to appreciate that which they could offer him in exchange, i.e., money,fame, recognition, gratitude and, above all, freedom to do more. Or [theappreciation of the genius comes] long after he is dead; then the herdappropriates the discovery—physically, in that they get all the practicalbenefits from it, and spiritually, in that they appropriate even the glory. Thisis the most important point of the book. The public monuments erected to thegreat men in city squares (for the pigeons to dirty) are only an empty gesture—ahypocritical concession, a bribe. Just like the acknowledgment of the greatmen’s achievements in school books—to bore children with. Nobody takes itseriously. Nobody gives it any thought. Nobody takes it into any spiritualaccount. Children go on being taught and men go on believing that the“collective” is the source of all virtue, greatness, and creation. Theachievements of the great men are embezzled by the collective—by becoming“national” or “social” achievements.This is the subtlest trick of “collectivization.” The very country that opposedand martyred a genius becomes the proud author of his achievement. It starts byusing his name as the proof and basis of its glory—and ends up by claimingcredit for the achievement. It was not Goethe, Tchaikovsky, or the Wrightbrothers who were great and achieved things of genius—it was Germany, Russia,and the United States. It was “the spirit of the people,” “the rhythm of thecountry,” or whatever. The great man was only the robot—he “expressed theaspiration of the people,” he was “the voice of the country,” he was “the symbolof his time,” etc.The intent in all this is single and obvious: the expropriation of the greatman’s credit. After taking his life, his freedom, his happiness, his peace, andhis achievement, the collective must also take his glory. The collective wantsnot only the gift, but the privilege of not having to say “thank you.” Thecollective hates the man of genius—because he is a man of genius. It wants totorture him and expects him to struggle against [the collective] —in order tobring it the gifts, without disturbing its vanity and inferiority. Then it wantsto steal the gifts and the giver’s glory—so that it would not have to admit toits own filthy, petty, twisted mind that it is an inferior, a charity object, adebtor, a beggar.(Good examples of this: the Wright brothers against the Smithsonian Institution;any country’s boasting of the great artists it martyred, such as France andVictor Hugo; the radio program’s slogan—“In a democracy art belongs to all thepeople”; the Soviet boast about its miserable North Pole expedition beinggreater than the achievements of individual enterprise, i.e., greater than theman who first discovered the North Pole, and greater than the Wright brotherswho created the airplane; the “Zola” movie—where you see France putting Zolathrough hell for fighting against the collective France of his time, then hearit said at his funeral that Zola represented “the heart of France.” This is howthe genius is made the victim of the collective’s crime and the whitewash forthat crime.)Such is the relationship between the prime mover and the collective. It has beensuch all through history—and it is sanctioned, demanded, expected, held to bevirtuous by mankind’s moral codes and philosophies. It is against this that theprime movers go on strike in my story.This part has to be kept in mind clearly and covered thoroughly. This is thebasis of the whole story. I must decide in what way I present it—but it must bepresented. (I’ll have to think over the prologue in this connection.) It is notjust that the prime movers go on strike—it’s why they go on strike and againstwhat. The “against what” must be made crystal clear—or the story is pointless.On the basis of this beginning, the story then proceeds like this: The primemovers say to the world, in effect: “You hate us. You don’t want us. You putevery obstacle in our way. Very well—we’ll stop. We won’t fight you or botheryou. We’ll merely stop functioning. We’ll stop doing the things you martyr usfor. And see how you like it. ”The complete statement of the strike’s objective is: “We have had enough of yourexploitation, persecution, insults, stealing, and expropriation. Go ahead andtry to exist without us. We will not come back until you recognize andacknowledge the truth of the matter. Until you admit what we are, give us fullcredit for what we do, and give us full freedom from your chains, orders,restrictions and encroachments—physical, spiritual, political, and moral. Untilyou accept a philosophy that will leave us alone to function as we please. Untilyou take your hands off us—and keep them off. We ask nothing but the freedom towork and live as we please. You will get gifts and benefits from us such as youcan never imagine. But you will not get them until you leave us alone. We aredoing this in the name of all the great men whom you martyred in the past—andfor the sake of all the great men you intend to martyr in the future. In thename of and for the sake of man’s greatness and man’s dignity. Once and for all,we will put an end to the torture of the best by [means of] their best—thepenalizing of genius for [being] genius.”This is the theme of the novel.The story then shows what happens to the world when its heart stops. This pointmust be thought out carefully, in every detail, in every aspect. In a generalway, what happens is total paralysis. Spiritually and physically. The wheelsstop—and thought stops. All life, hope, and joy go with them. All energy, fire,color, imagination, enthusiasm. It is a kind of slow, creeping, progressive“rigor mortis.” Not horror and violence—but slow disintegration. Slow rot. Thegray horror of dullness, stupidity, incompetence, inertia. Most particularlyinertia.Show how the world stops entirely. And when it has stopped, when the collectivehas destroyed itself—the world learns its lesson. The prime movers can comeback.132 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_132_r1.jpg]To be thought out in detail: (1) every representative aspect of the prime moverwho is martyred or stopped by society; (2) every representative aspect of thedifferent way in which prime movers stop and go on strike—the kind of peoplethey are and how they do it; (3) every representative aspect of the way in whichthe second-hander cannot function by himself and paralyzes the world. Everyaspect of how and why and in what way the world has to stop without the primemovers—and does stop.DISCONNECTED BITS:John GaltDagny TaggartFrancisco d‘AnconiaJames TaggartEddie WillersThe opening of the story proper with: “Who is John Galt?” The bum in a desolatecity street at twilight. The first signs of a city’s disintegration. The“afternoon” uneasiness. The calendar on the tower. Eddie Willers thinking of thegreat oak stricken by lightning, hollow inside—as he comes to the great buildingof Taggart Transcontinental. The marvelously efficient offices—and the heart ofthe building, the office of James Taggart. “Don’t bother me, don’t bother me,don’t bother me,” said James Taggart.The introduction of Dagny Taggart as she walks through the offices like a gustof fresh wind.Dagny and Francisco d‘Anconia. “Who is John Gait?”—“Stop using that cheap figureof gutter legend!”Dagny and the engineer who quits mysteriously.The girl writer at the book store window: “No, it’s not in that window. It willnever be in that window.” [The girl writer is the fishwife in the valley; ARinitially planned a larger role for the character.]The radio talk: “Don’t bother trying to choke it off. It can’t be done. This isJohn Galt speaking.... How did I do it? You could have had that secret and many,many others.”About John Galt’s invention: “In the eighteenth century, it could have been thesteam engine. In the nineteenth—the automobile. In the twentieth—the airplane.In our day—you’ll never learn.”John Galt’s answer to the offer of planned power over the world: “Get the hellout of my way.”The last scene: in the mountains of their valley, looking down at a wreckedroad—like the roads left of the Roman Empire. A house with a roof caved in—theskeleton of an automobile with its wheels in the air—and in the distance thestubborn fire fighting the wind. John Galt said: “This is our day. The road iscleared. We’re going back.” June 26, 1945The key points which will have to be dramatized (in concrete events, not merelyby implication and exposition):The nature of the prime movers’ martyrdom. That must be shown. (There must besome equivalent of the prologue—some figure such as the composer—either inaction or in flashback, but preferably in direct action.) This is needed notonly because it is such an important point, never before covered anywhere—butalso because it gives meaning to the strike itself. It is the spirit of thestrike—and the justification. It is the very thing that made me want to writethis novel. Without that point, the story would become merely a recital of thephysical aspects of the strike, just plot events of a struggle which could notinterest us very much because we are not let in on its essential purpose andmotive. It would actually feature the second-handers—what happens to them, notto the strikers. The predominant emotion left by the book would be contempt,hatred, ridicule, gloating over the second-handers and their plight—but nouplift to the spirit of the strikers. The strikers would become only a kind ofplot means to expose the parasites.I must consider very carefully the statements I made in my [earlier] notes tothe effect that the world is featured in the story, and the relation of societyto its prime movers. There is a fine balance of theme and construction which Imust achieve here. It is somewhat the same problem as in The Fountainhead: thesecond-handers must not be allowed to steal the show, to become the stars of thestory. Even though I do not here treat of the nature of prime movers, but oftheir relation to society—it is still the prime movers who are to be the stars:it is still their story. The balance must be: what happens to the world withoutthe strikers—but also, what happens to the strikers.The general scheme, then, is: society’s crime against the prime movers—the primemovers go on strike—society collapses—the prime movers come back.A question to decide here is: whether there should be a concrete act ofrepentance on the part of society, an act of acknowledgment, the issueunderstood once and for all—or whether the strikers win merely by default,coming back because their road is cleared. This last is what actually happenshistorically—but then the implication would be that once the strikers haverebuilt the world, the whole process would begin all over again. The first (therepentance) is difficult to conceive; who is to do the repenting? Aresecond-handers capable of such an act, of understanding and justice? This mustbe thought out.[In my notes of January 1], I have the sentence “the world learns its lesson.”As a possibility, I might have a specific villain in the story who symbolizedthe parasites and society, who exploits the prime movers—and who repents at theend. It might be James Taggart. Or it might be several men, each representing akey aspect of society and of the parasite.The theme stated in its simplest form: it is John Galt saying to an inefficientstenographer: “You presumptuous fool! I have no desire to work for you nor to bemartyred for that privilege. You think I should and you think you can force meto. All right—try it.”(A possible lead in thinking out the construction: the story could actually betold in the terms of one life—the personal relationship of one creator to onesecond-hander. Try to visualize it as that—then translate it into a socialpicture, by individualizing the separate key aspects of the conflict.)Keep in mind throughout the story the realistic aspect of the fantastictheme—the actual ways in which prime movers do go on strike, though it is not aconscious, organized strike. By stressing that, keeping it as the foundation ofthe characters’ psychology, using it consistently for concrete cases, asillustration—I will make the story profoundly real, spiritually real. The plotdevice of the strike will then become only an exaggeration of that whichactually happens, an emphasis for purposes of clarity and eloquence—not purefantasy.The two realistic ways in which prime movers go on strike are: (1) what happensto talented and exceptional men under dictatorships; and (2) how sensitive,talented people stop functioning when they are disgusted by the society aroundthem, as at the present time here in America.This last form of striking always happens when gifted men find themselves in amorally corrupt society. (And such a society is always collectivist, or on itsway to collectivism, because morality and individualism are inseparable. Thedegree of individualism in a society determines the degree of its morality.) Ineffect, the gifted men find themselves dealing with men and conditions that theydo not wish to deal with. So they do one of three things: (1) they do notfunction at all and become drifting, aimless bums; (2) they function in somefield other than their proper one and produce only enough for their ownsustenance, refusing to let the world benefit from their surplus energy; or (3)they function in their proper field but produce less than one tenth of theiractual capacity—it is a strained, unhappy, forced effort for them—their naturaldesire and their energy demanding an outlet, in conflict with their disgustagainst the conditions under which their energy has to function.Examples to keep in mind: (1) Gus Vollmer, Linda Lynneberg (?); (2) Frank[O‘Connor], Pat’s publisher (Earle Balch), Dr. Kramer and all the doctors whowish to retire if socialized medicine is passed; (3) Pat.April 6, 1946QUESTIONS TO THINK OUT1. The actual plot must contain emotional conflict. There is the danger ofhaving mere action, without emotional content, if I start with the strikersalready on strike. Their decision is then undrama tized, behind the scenes—andthe story can become passive, like their action of just doing nothing.(Here—show that it is not easy for them to break the ties.)2. The strikers must have something to do more than just strike. Otherwise, theparasites will carry the story by carrying the action. It still must be thestrikers’ story—they must carry and motivate the plot.FOR MAIN LINE (PLOT)The main activities of mankind.The three attitudes [described at the end of the June 26, 1945, notes].The steps of growth—reverse [to find] steps of disintegration (and destruction).(Stress “purposelessness” in the progressive steps ofTT’s [Taggart Transcontinental‘s] destruction.)The specific (concrete) form of the final catastrophe. (Specific second-handers,or is it beyond that point? Beyond that point—panic and collapse.)April 7, 1946John Galt tells one of those who is unconsciously on strike from bitterness anddisillusionment: “You think the world is essentially a mixture of good and evil,and one must compromise with the evil, and you’re sick of that, so you’re givingup the world? Nonsense. Evil, by definition (if we have made the rightdefinition), is the impotent, the impractical, the powerless, that which doesnot work. So it is no threat to us, it cannot stand in our way—unless we permitit and help it to do so. It cannot poison the world for us—unless we carry thepoison and spread it. The parasites cannot exploit us or rule us—unless wevoluntarily agree to be exploited and hand them the tools with which to rule us.Let us withdraw the tools.“We permit it, and we have suffered this long, for one essential reason: thegenerosity of the creator. It is our nature that we wish to give, prodigally,recklessly, because we know that the source—our creative energy—isinexhaustible. Being self-sufficient, we cannot conceive of dependence, so weare modest in relation to others, we never think that we are indispensable tothem or superior, because we do not consider them indispensable or superior tous. We act as equals toward equals—and an exchange between equals is a proper,natural activity. We are glad to give because our creation is a discovery orembodiment of truth, and when others respond to truth we welcome their response,we are happy—not because of the good it does them, not because their approvalgives us pleasure or is of any importance to us—but because their response is avictory for truth, and what we welcome is their entrance into our world, intothat world which we know to be good and true.“We see no danger in giving—we think we’re giving to men as rich as we are; wethink of it as gifts, not alms. And whenever we come up against an inferior—thathe is an inferior is the hardest thing for us to believe; we see the evidenceand we think it is a misunderstanding or a temporary misfortune that hasaffected the man; then we throw ourselves to the rescue, we give, we help, welet him lean on us and bleed us, we carry him—‘why not?’ we say, we are sostrong, we have so much to spare. We are incapable of conceiving of theparasite’s mind, so we can never understand him. We are incapable of hatred andmalice. We will not accuse him without cause or reason—and we can’t find thecause, since we can’t understand him.“So we become helpless and bewildered before him. We never accuse him, no matterwhat he does to us. He yells that we are selfish, cruel, tyrannical by reason ofthe very abundance and magnificence of our talents. And we almost come tobelieve this. ”Almost“—because no power on earth can really make us believethis; we are the men of truth, we cannot fall that far into lying; and since ourtalents, our creative energy, are our sacred possessions, the source of our joyin living, we cannot commit so great a sacrilege against them.“We allow ourselves to become torn. In a vague, unstated, indefinable way, webegin to feel that we must atone for something, make amends to someone, paysomeone for something in some manner. What? We don’t know. We can never know. Werefuse to admit to ourselves the truth in a clear statement: that we are beingdamned for the best within us, and that the creature making the accusation issmall, inferior, and truly evil. We are generous, and we do not pronounce such ajudgment upon a fellow human being. Hatred and anger are unnatural to us;contempt for a human being is totally unnatural to us, perhapsimpossible—because we think and act as if we were dealing with men, and it isnot proper to despise men, we are worshippers of man, because we are men andthis is the logical implication of our self-reverence. One’s opinion of mankindcomes from one’s opinion of oneself, which is the only first-hand knowledge ofman one can have. The man who respects himself, will carry the respect to hisspecies, to others. The man who despises himself, with good reason, carries thecontempt, the malice, the hatred, the suspicion to all humanity. We, thecreators, cannot conceive of this. We are bewildered by the parasite’s malice—wedo not even recognize it as malice, because we don’t really know malice.“But so long as, for any reason, we do not recognize the truth—we are bound tofail and to suffer, in the whole sphere and in all our actions where we haveleft this truth unrecognized. Our generosity is a good motive? Nothing is goodif it motivates lying, falsehood, or evasion. There is no morality except anunbending, absolute recognition of the truth, in relation to everything; anabsolute will to find, face, and grasp the truth, to the utmost of our capacity,then to act upon it. Nothing is moral but this cold, ruthless, rational pursuit.“But we have not faced or recognized the truth about the parasites—so we fail,we’re helpless, we’re disarmed, and they’ve got us. Did they win over us? No, wewon the battle for them. They rule the world? No, we handed it over to them. Theguilt is ours, but not in the way they think; in the exactly opposite way. Theguilt is that we have refused to see the truth about us and about them.“What makes a man a parasite? Nothing and no one but himself. We do not classifyhim as an inferior—he classifies himself. He is the only one who can. What isthe specific action of doing this? The recognition by a man, stated or unstatedin his mind (and I think it is usually stated), that he is the creature and theproduct of others, dependent upon them for the content of his soul. The negationby a man of his primary human attribute (his essential attribute, the one andonly attribute that makes him human): his independent rational judgment. This isall that’s necessary; the rest—all the evils, corruptions, perversions—followautomatically.“When a man rejects his independent rational judgment he has rejected himself asan entity, as a man, as an end in himself. Whatever happens to him from then oncan be nothing but failure and tragedy; he is functioning against his ownnature, he is acting against the laws of his own survival. And by the very factthat he is a man (or was born to be and can’t be anything else), some lastconscious remnant of [his betrayal] makes him hate himself.“He does not know why he has this deep conviction of his own inferiority, of hisbasic worthlessness, of his being essentially contemptible. He runs, by everymeans possible, from admitting this conviction to himself, but he knows it’sthere. He says, in effect, ”I feel it.“ He ascribes every possible cause toit—his feeling of helplessness against the universe of which he knows so little,his fear of others, his envy of them, his knowledge that he’ll never be able toequal their achievements, that he doesn’t possess their talents, or that they’llsurely fail to recognize his own. All of it is evasion, beside the point, and aconsequence, not a cause. He despises himself because he has willfully negatedhis nature as a man.“Were he actually incapable of being an independent rational entity, there wouldhave been no feeling of hatred, evil, misery in him from this negation; he couldhave no conception of what he had betrayed and no uneasiness about it; acreature cannot hate itself for being what it is. It cannot exist in perpetualpain; pain is a warning of disorder, of the improper, physically or spiritually.A creature born as a physical freak, incapable of survival, would not survive;and such time as it had, would be spent in constant pain, the warning thatsomething is improper, the sign of the misfit in the most basic, essentialsense. Man survives through his mind, i.e., his spirit. If his spirit weredoomed, by its essence and nature, to constant pain, to hatred of himself, hewould not survive. If it was proper for a parasite to be a parasite, if he wasby nature incapable of independent rational judgment, he would be happy in thatstate, happy on his own terms. He would go on copying the motions and repeatingthe ideas of others, as his natural function, like a monkey. A monkey does nothate itself, nor those it imitates. The misery of the parasite is the proof hewas not intended to be a parasite; he was not doomed to it by the cruelty ofnature—he did it to himself.“What caused him to do it? That does not matter to us too much.Fear—laziness—the desire to escape the responsibility of rationality—the beliefin a malevolent universe and, from that, the conviction that if he learns thetruth about the universe he will discover the evil and disasters [surrounding]him, therefore he must avoid knowledge of the truth, therefore he must get ridof his means of knowledge, i.e., his reason—the half-digested teachings ofothers to which he succumbed in childhood before he had begun to think, thewhole vicious mess of irrationalism, altruism, and collectivism—all of that canbe and is the cause of his pronouncing the verdict of parasite on himself andrejecting his nature as man. These are his reasons, but what concerns us hereare the results as they affect us, the results of our relation with theparasite.” April 10, 1946“In what manner do we allow the parasite to rule us, and what happens when hedoes? He rules us by the break we allow him to make within us. We accept him asan equal, i.e., a rational being. Then we are torn by the awful spectacle of theirrational around us. We find ourselves in a world we cannot understand, we arehelpless and lost. We have allowed him to create around us the kind of world helives in, or imagines, or fears: the senseless, malevolent universe. We begin todoubt the power of the human mind, the reality or practicality of truth, thepossibility of good or justice. We suspect that we might be living in an insanechaos, but that is a supposition with which we cannot exist or function. Yet wemust function, that is the basic law of our nature, and so we are caught in acivil war within ourselves and we become objects of perpetual suffering, made soby that very thing which is our life source, our happiness, the moving force ofman’s survival—our spiritual independence and creative energy. And when wesuffer within ourselves in this essential, primary way, we cannot function atour best—and we are disarmed. The parasite has us where he wants us: functioningonly enough to support him, but not enough to be happy, to be strong, to shakehim off and get forever out of his reach.“We become like the parasite in every respect save our work. That neither he norany form of suffering nor even our own will can corrupt. That remains untouched.In the sphere of our work we remain ourselves, functioning as we should, true toour nature. But in every other sphere—in our private lives, in our relationswith men and the world—we adopt the methods and convictions of the parasite, weare just what he is: torn, uncertain, self-contradictory, vicious, lying,evasive—because we’re doing the same thing, running from the truth, trying toescape from something we don’t want to face. And in such a role, we are,perhaps, more evil than the parasites—if there can be degrees in such a matter.It is then we who poison the world, we who make it evil, we who work for our owndestruction. This [applies to] anyone who does not live up to his highestcapacity, who betrays his own talent and makes of it his own torture rack. Howhave we done this? By admitting the parasite into our own soul. By allowing himto be a major concern within us.“What happens when he rules us? The kind of vicious world you see, in which thebest has been turned into a source of evil, in which competence is the source offailure, life energy is the source of destruction, and the capacity for joy isthe source of the most terrible suffering. In this kind of corrupted world, theparasite can survive comfortably without reproach, he can enjoy it, he canexploit us and he can rule.“This is what we have done. Now let us stop it.“Withdraw the tools. Put yourself apart. Cut every spiritual connection with theparasite, every emotional tie, and every practical cooperation. Cooperation withthem on their terms (those of collectivism) is not cooperation, butsurrender—the voluntary offer to be beaten. Stop it. Face them for what theyare. And let them learn what you are. ”133 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_133_r1.jpg]“Carry to your personal life the same principles on which you function in yourcreative life. All of you live on the premise of one kind of universe when youwork—and of quite a different kind in every part of your existence outside ofwork.”The above is the actual secret, key and definition of Roark. He was theembodiment of the perfect man acting consistently on the right moral principle.That moral principle (the mortality of independence) is most eloquently obviousin creative work, and actually in every kind of work; this is proper, since work(creation, production, achievement, purposeful activity) is man’s primary andgreatest function. But the same principle applies to all of a man’s life andactivities—personal, social, emotional, etc. Roark functioned consistently andconsciously on that principle.The actual case of the genius is often the tragedy of [an internal] civil war:the principles of the creator in his work, the principles of the second-handerin every other aspect of his life. Why? All the reasons Galt states above, plusthe fact that no consistent morality of the creator had ever been formulated.This is what has made geniuses so tortured and so tragic, when they should havebeen the ecstatic representatives of humanity. The world is responsible fortorturing them? Yes—but that torture would be easy to bear, if the genius hadnot brought upon himself the torture within. It is he who does the world’s dirtywork against himself. Otherwise, the pain would go only down to a certainpoint—and the genius would triumph, essentially, even if locked in a jail cell.The world is responsible for the [external] torture of the genius—and as a causeor source of the much greater torture which he imposes on himself by his wrongconception of the world.Now it is this aspect of genius which I must show—not the pure, consistentgenius that Roark is—but the divided victim which most geniuses have been. JohnGalt is the Roark in the story, but the others are not, and it is against theexploitation by the world, particularly this spiritual exploitation, that Galtteaches them to strike.134 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_134_r1.jpg]CHARACTERS NEEDEDJohn Galt—energy. Activity, competence, initiative, ingenuity, and above allintelligence. Independent rational judgment. The man who conquers nature, theman who imposes his purpose on nature. Therefore, Galt is an inventor, apractical scientist, a man who faces the material world of science as anadventurer faces an unexplored continent, or as a pioneer faced thewilderness—something to use, to conquer, to turn to his own purposes. Inrelation to the creators—he is the avenger. (He is “the motor of the world.”)A man who is the most tragic victim of collectivist exploitation. He is the onewho finds it so hard to break the ties. Hank Rearden—possibly a great, self-madeindustrialist, torn by the naivete of his own generosity.The martyred artist. The composer (Dietrich Gerhardt, who supports his owntorturers); the girl-writer. [AR replaced Gerhardt with the somewhat differentcharacter of Richard Halley.]The great man made into a parasite in his private life (or made miserable). Aman who thinks he must pay a price for selfishness.The great man who refuses to function and is destroying himself.Probably a minor character.The genius who accepts anything if only he’d be left free to function.This is Dietrich Gerhardt.The young girl who supports a whole family (or the honest kind of tough workerlike Mike). The industrialist’s secretary. The worker who fights against Taggartand for Rearden. (She understands the issue.)The philosopher. A kind of Ortega y Gasset—vaguely. A kind of Aristotle if hecame back to life today. Or even Thomas Aquinas.The farmer. A man of action [who opposes] the parasites in the most basic,simplest terms.Dagny’s employee. The ship owner who sank his ships rather than let them benationalized (probably an Englishman). (Gerald Hastings) The priest. Father(medieval name), who is the last of the strikers. He withdraws the moralsanction from the world of the parasites. (He represents the last stand forpity.)The traitor. The man in-between who has both potentialities, could go both ways,tries to see both sides, attempting a compromise. He turns out to be the onemost destructive to the side of the creators, the one contributing most to theparasites—which he himself cannot stand, therefore he destroys himself. (Heaccomplishes James Taggart’s triumph over him.) Stan Winslow. (He is also anexample of the two potentialities in the lesser man.)The man who goes insane on the idea of charity—a kind of “Dostoyevsky.”The average man. The actual in-between, who goes to the good in a society ofproducers, to the bad in a society of parasites. He can be an older executive ofTT—who, at the end, realizes the horror of his position.The man who makes a virtue of evil—who claims that his lack of conviction is avirtue, a sign of some sort of breadth of vision: “To have convictions is towear blinders.” The damn fool confuses a view of the opinions of others with aview of reality.The mystic of parasitism—another “Mr. Smith” of Washington.James Taggart’s “best friend,” “pull,” and guide.James Taggart’s wife (“the Cinderella girl”). She may be an example of theaverage woman going to pieces without spiritual guidance (and going through hellwith J.T.).The man corroded by envy of genius—because he knows that his miserable littleachievement is swamped out by the magnificent achievement of the genius. Heknows enough to recognize the difference—yet his conclusion is that the geniusmust be destroyed to protect him. That means, by his own definition, that thebest must be destroyed for the sake of the worst. This is the monstrous kind ofsecond-hander’s selfishness—the primary consideration here being in the othersand in measuring one’s value by comparison. He considers his own talentworthless, because the talent of the genius is greater—therefore, to be best, hemust destroy the genius; his standard of perfection is not absolute, butrelative, he wants to do, not the best possible, but the best others will see.([Note added later:] No.The man who does this has no “little” achievement—whatever he has is stolen.)This [latter] man against Galt in the final climax is a good possibility. Hismost revealing line: “The genius destroys the individuality of the lesser men.”(?!) (But the god-damn “lesser men” feed on the genius—and that’s why they hatehim. This is the fable of the pig and the oak tree.) [In the fable, the piguproots the oak tree to get the acorns, thus destroying his source of food.]If the “lesser men” don’t want to imitate or follow the genius—then he can’tdestroy their “individuality.” But if they do want to follow, if it’s to theiradvantage—then what is it that they resent? Obviously—the impression in the eyesof others. They become “followers,” not “great innovators” in the eyes ofothers. And what “others” does he want to fool? “Lesser men” or “geniuses”?Both, of course, and, above all, himself.No—not quite. One type simply wants to steal; the other—this type—wants himselfand others brought down. (Or are both motives intermixed?) This is the man whohas a direct interest in the destruction of genius—steal their achievements,take the credit for your two cents’ worth of “improvement,” and destroy them, sonobody can challenge you. And then look for another victim.THE LINE-UP SO FAR:The creators:135 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_135_r1.gif]The parasites:James TaggartThe industrialist’s wifeThe industrialist’s mistress and other friendsA “head of the State”—on the order of Truman [President at the timeof these notes]Businessmen on the order of Bobbs-MerrillThe in-between:Eddie Willers (to the good)Stan Winslow (to the bad)The man of charity (to the very bad)The strikers (in order of importance):John GaltFrancisco d‘AnconiaRagnar DanneskjöldThe philosopherThe composerGerald Hastings (the ship owner)136 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_136_r1.jpg]Have characters (or incidents or both) dramatize a world in which: the best hasbeen turned into a source of evil (Danneskjöld); competence is the source offailure (the young engineer or the girl-writer); life energy is the source ofdestruction (Francisco d‘Anconia); the capacity for joy is the source of themost terrible suffering (the composer, the girl-writer, the industrialist).“This is what we have done. Now let us stop it.”Here, in effect, the pattern is this: when men refuse to live according to theprinciples of the good, the principles proper to them, the best among them areforced to turn against them, to become a danger, an enemy, a source of evil tothem. (Because the good has been declared to be the evil.) In a proper society,Danneskjöld would have been a Columbus, the source of infinite benefit to lessermen; in a society of collectivism, he is forced to become a smuggler. Nothingwill make him act against his own nature; he will rather act against mankind andall their laws. Danneskjöld doesn’t even bother to argue about it; he just acts.(This is important.) April II, 1946The worst victim: the industrialist (probably steel): self-made, extremelyactive, extremely generous, extremely naive.His wife: a decadent society bitch—neither too beautiful, nor too rich, nor toowell-born, but some of all of it. She does not need his prestige or money—hersole aim in life is to keep him down spiritually, to snub and ridicule him,destroy his every personal aspiration, humble him so that she may feel her ownpersonal superiority through the sense of crushing a giant.His sister: a clever, charming, and empty bitch who uses him unmercifully inevery way—socially, professionally, financially—under guise of her“understanding.” Her one concern is always to make him feel that she gives himmore than she receives, to keep him thinking himself “under obligation”—[shedoes] this by means of the “spiritual,” as against his gifts which she considers“grossly material.”His brother: a swindling [failure] who is “ashamed of his brother” and droolsthat he has no chance because his brother “crushes” him. A socialist.His mother: an empty old bag who will never let go of the pretense that her son“owes everything to his mother”—who much prefers her younger son, a worthlessfailure—and who makes the industrialist’s life miserable by constant demandsthat he “make up to his brother” for his own success.Assorted poor relatives and friends—who “knew him when”—whose sole theme-songis: “Don’t you go high-hat on us,” and who feel that he’s betrayed “his people”by rising above them. And they use him unmercifully. To not “go high-hat onthem” means to turn his soul and pocket-book over to them.His secretary: his exact parallel on a smaller scale. As competent and honest ashe is, and plagued by the same set of parasites with the same motives, thoughsuperficially different.The scene where the [industrialist and his secretary] realize the similarity oftheir tragedy. This is either the final or one of the important scenes leadingto both of them joining the strike.DISCONNECTED BITS:For Eddie Willers and the last train: “Dagny, in the name of the best within us!...”137 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_137_r1.jpg]For Dagny’s first meeting with Galt: When she opened her eyes, she saw sunlight,green leaves and a man’s face. She thought: I know what this is. This is theworld as I thought it would be when I was sixteen. Now it is beginning—and therest of it was just somebody’s senseless joke. She smiled, as to afellow-conspirator, in relief, in deliverance, in radiant mockery of all thatshe would never have to take seriously again. And the man smiled back, inexactly the same way.(“We never had to take any of it seriously, did we?” “No, we never had to.”)Part I—“The End”Part II—“The Beginning” [AR planned the novel in two parts. There is noreference in her journal to a Part III until September 1952.]Some names of chapters:“This is John Galt Speaking”“In the Name of the Best Within Us” (Last chapter)“The Calendar” (First chapter)138 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_138_r1.jpg]John Galt (probably in broadcast): “I am the first man of ability who hasrefused to feel guilty.”139 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_139_r1.jpg]The story of the worker who remembers the factory meeting, about twelve yearsago, when a slave-labor measure was [passed], and a young man got up to leavethe meeting. He was an unknown young engineer. He stood alone against thehundreds, yet he made them afraid. He said: “I’m going to put an end to this,once and for all.” As he turned to go, someone asked: “How?” He answered: “I’mgoing to stop the motor of the world.” Then he walked out. No one’s heard of himsince. The factory is long since closed. But... “You see, his name was JohnGalt.” April 13, 1946CLUES AND LEADS (FROM “REAL LIFE”)Philip H.—the insane malice toward me; the dependence on M., yet his desire tocrush her and hold her down. (This for James Taggart and the industrialist’swife.)Linda L.—the teachers who refused her a scholarship she had earned and gave itto a less deserving girl “because she needed it more, while Linda could takecare of herself.” This is the deliberate, specific rewarding of mediocrity andpenalizing of competence. (For the policy of James Taggart and others of hiskind.)The school policy of grading papers according to [effort] and not according toan objective standard. This is the most essentially vicious and corrupt measureever devised; it is based on the premise of “to each according to his needs” (atwhose expense?) and on the denial of an objective reality, which, in effect,amounts to training children for insanity. It is a denial of the simple factthat a man’s need will not grow his food, only a man’s ability will. It is adenial of the fact that results come from causes, that the achievement (orproduction) of the able man will be in proportion to and the result of hisability and effort, that the equal effort of a man of lesser ability will not[result in equal] achievement regardless of how the lesser one feels about it,that this is a fact of nature—and that the lesser one had better actaccordingly, rather than attempt to harness the better man to an equality whichis contrary to nature, reality and justice. (To carry out such an attempt theinferior man must accept the principle of slavery, with himself as master andthe better man as slave. What is rewarded here? Incompetence. This is pure moralcorruption.) This method is the total triumph of the irrational.Walter [Abbott]—the sensitive, poetic kind of writer who spends his time writingbloody thrillers; he thinks this is all he has a chance at. That is his form ofbeing on strike.Pat—a person wrecked by a fierce sense of injustice, which she has neveranalyzed or defined as such. Knowing that she is right and that right must berecognized, yet getting no recognition, she has turned to a violent hatred ofthe world, to an exaggerated pride, to assuring herself too much that she is nothurt by the world—in order not to admit how badly hurt she is. And this isbecause she will not examine the exact nature of the reasons and motives ofthose who have hurt her. Also, she has turned to an insane arbitrariness—“I amright because I’m right”—since she has given up the hope of proving rightness inrational terms and having it understood or recognized. (In her particular case,the acceptance of the irrational has a great deal to do with this and with herfailure. But that aspect does not concern me here, except to note an interestingquestion: did she accept the irrational early, because of observing what seemedto be the failure of the rational in the world, and being afraid to face such auniverse—or did she accept the irrational first, through some personal fear orfeeling of shortcoming, and this destroyed her whole proper life, which shouldhave been that of a great rational thinker? I believe this last.)The above arbitrariness has turned to hurting those whom she likes, by somepeculiar multiple-inversion, like this: the irrational people have hurt her; therational are the ones whom she needs and likes, the ones who speak her languageand with whom she can deal; but she is fiercely determined to avenge herself;she knows that she cannot reach her enemies, the irrational ones, by her properweapon, the mind; so she turns upon her friends, upon the rational ones,wreaking upon them the very thing she should hate, the thing which has hurther—the irrational.This is a frightening kind of “collective judgment,” of revenge against theworld—taking the world as a whole and trying to avenge oneself against its bestfor what has been done by its worst. It denies the whole conception ofindividual guilt and individual responsibility. One might say that this isextreme individualism—holding oneself alone against the world as a solid outsideunit. But the error here is in considering the world as a “solid unit,” indenying individualism as a basic absolute of man’s nature, in actuallyconsidering the world as a collective, with collectivism as the natural law ofthe universe, and oneself as a noble but doomed outsider, a freak, a kind ofByronic damned, who is damned heroically because he will not accept realitywhich is evil. (Pat has hinted just that.) This is the same mistake as thinkingthat an individualist is a man who recognizes only his own rights. Anindividualist must recognize man as an individualist.I am not sure I want to use this—it belongs in the novel about the mind. [ARthought of writing a novel showing the primacy of reason over emotions, but iteventually became obvious that this theme was included in Atlas Shrugged.] Imight use only the first part, the terrible bitterness created by injustice; notthe second part, not the revenge through the irrational.Frank Lloyd Wright—a man who is a Roark in his professional life, and a Keatingin his private life. How does one get to that? Strangely enough, in this case: alack of self-confidence, personal uncertainty. It seems as if all forms ofconceit are sure signs of the exact opposite. Whatever one chooses to express,or achieve, through social means is the denial of that very thing withinoneself. If the method is that of the second-hander, this negation isunavoidable. For instance, to make a point of impressing one’s superiority uponothers is to attach importance to their recognition of one’s superiority; if oneattaches importance to it, one needs it. Why does one need it? Either asconfirmation or as proof of one’s own greatness; therefore, one’s own convictionof that greatness is either uncertain or totally lacking. If one merely wishedto find the understanding and appreciation of friends, one would not exhibitconceit toward them, nor stress one’s superiority. One can’t wish to haveinferiors as friends; nor is the appreciation of inferiors of any sensiblevalue. Therefore, conceit exhibited toward people can only mean a desire toestablish superiority by comparison; if so, the primary determinant ofsuperiority is not in oneself, but in others, not in what one can do, but inwhat they can’t do; therefore, one’s conviction of superiority has no realbasis, no objective standards, no proof, no reality.Apparently, FLW was hurt and frightened early in life by the hostility andstupidity of people toward his work. Then here was where the principle ofcollectivism entered: if people stood in the way of his work, it was people thathe had to conquer to break his way through. Therefore, people became a crucialobjective—and an enemy. On the one hand, he became extremely concerned to winthem, to impress them, to get their recognition. On the other, since they arethe enemy, he became convinced that he must deal with them on their ownterms—through deceit, lying, flattery and rudeness, high-pressure, etc. Heconcluded that the terms applying to his work—honesty, beauty, intelligence,purposeful clarity, courage, directness—all of that could not apply to hisdealings with people, since they were the enemies of his work whom he had todefeat. This is granting a crucial or decisive power to others, actuallygranting them superiority, at least in what he thinks are the regrettablepractical matters, by adopting their terms and methods. (If one must deal withthe collective—deal on your own terms, not on theirs. You’ve accepted thesupremacy of the collective and defeated yourself when you accept their terms.)Here there is a basic misunderstanding of the nature of individualism and of therational. First, people do not hold the decisive power over you, no matter whatthey do or how you have to deal with them. Second, you can’t expect to achieveanything through cheating—you only get what you asked for, a fake something thatdoesn’t actually exist. (This might explain FLW’s [constant] trouble withclients. Sure, he lies or flatters them into giving him the commission. Then hepays for it by cases such as Aline Barnsdall, or all the abandoned and rushedbuildings. Those clients who lasted as a proper source of satisfaction to himwere not snared by lies, but by whatever honest argument appealed to the best,the honest or the intelligent within them.)Most importantly and profoundly, there is again a misunderstanding and fear ofthe rational. He does not know that his own judgment—exercised to the extreme ofhis capacity and honesty—is the only criterion of the rational upon which he canact, possible errors included. He does not know that the number of others hasnothing to do with the truth of an issue. He sees the majority disagreeing withhim about his work. He presumes that they are rational beings, like himself,with rational reasons for their opinions. But nothing on earth will make himchange his convictions about his work (and rightly so). Then what happens? Hecan say one of three things: “to hell with my own convictions”—“to hell with thecollective”—or “to hell with reason” (because it is reason that tells him thedilemma is unsolvable, contradictory, and he must take a stand). He says: “Tohell with reason” (as most of them do). Note how often he makes cracks atreason-the stuff about the sunrise not being logical—yet how everything abouthis work is based on reason, on function, on purpose.In the clash between a man and the collective, the loser is reason (for mostmen). A man cannot give up himself—and he dreads to give up the collective,because he doesn’t understand it. So he thinks the safe thing is to give upreason; then the dilemma is not irreconcilable—then nothing is irreconcilable,since nothing has to be logical or make any kind of precise sense. (Then theworld can dissolve into a kind of haze of overlapping shadows without edges ordefinitions. And it does.) Actually, of all three choices, giving up reason isthe most dreadful and the most fatal. It amounts to giving up all three, andeverything: all of life, the whole universe (or the ability to recognize theexistence of a universe). The first choice is impossible (to give up oneself).This third choice is monstrous and impossible; but it takes a long time to workout its implications, particularly since no man can actually function on such achoice, since he remains rational to the extent that he exists at all, since heonly lapses into the irrational occasionally, when he needs escape—and so it isa poison that works slowly, in a prolonged agony. Only the second choice (togive up the collective) is possible—and moral.(The above is more [relevant] for my novel about the mind.)Also, FLW is playing at living in the kind of world he would like—the effective,dramatic world. But he won’t admit to himself that it’s only playing. He wantsother men to live up to his buildings—to the kind of existence his buildings areintended for (and which, incidentally, he has never defined). He thinks this isup to other people, or depends on them, or he can force them into it. He doesn’trealize that none of it is real—since it is forced on people through theiracceptance of his superiority (and since there is no conscious rational grasp ofit in those people, hence no actual reality as far as they’re concerned).Inferiors do not lead a heroic life, nor do they actually contribute anything tothe hero. How can they? So his version of the beautiful, dramatic life becomes ashow to impress those he despises—the vicious circle of second-handedness. [...]His desire to be “god” or the representation of some sort of universal force is,of course, the desire to be something more than himself. He does not consider itenough to be a great man. This is also, perhaps, the desire to impose himselfupon others in a way that the rational terms of man’s equality will not permit:to be an authority, not by reason of achievement or rational proof, but just tobe an authority: “It’s so because I say it’s so.” Again, the dreadful desire forarbitrary power over others. Isn’t the root of that the knowledge or fear thathe could not prove or defend all his convictions in rational terms and onrational grounds? (Pat does the same, too.)All of this leads only to evil, failure, and suffering. While hating people,using and cheating them—he has become completely dependent upon them, constantlybegging them for admiration or attention. Trying to make them the means toachieve his world, he ended by living completely in their world, in its worstaspect pretense and deceit. This is an example of the fact that ruling others isstill living for and through others, still collectivism. He tried to use thecollective—he has become completely dependent upon it.(The worst part of it is the spectacle of a great man constantly begging others:“Please show me how great a man I am!” It almost amounts to: “Please prove it tome!”)The girl reader—a horrible creature—homely, sloppy, physically dirty andunfeminine, unintelligent and inefficient—a person with no single grace torecommend her, but with an insidious bitterness and malice toward the world. Shedeclared smugly that of course she is just a product and creature of herbackground, of her family, of her race, class, etc.—and of whatever “ideas” shehas absorbed from others. She admits her own inferiority, pronounces it avirtue; she sneers at the possibility of anyone being better, regarding anyone’sclaim to independence as a presumption and a delusion—since she has decided thatit is a delusion in her case.Nellie Berns—when she said it’s right that she should be compelled to pay forher own social security, by force and law; it’s better for her, since she’dnever have the character to save or provide for her future voluntarily. This isan admission of weakness and, again, the attaching of one’s own sin to the restof the world. Like this: I deserve to be pushed into line by means of awhip—therefore it’s all right for others to be whipped, too, whether theydeserve it or not. I need to be led on a leash—therefore, let’s put others on aleash, too.The publicity boy who—being a weak, hysterical, touchy kind of failure, the kindwho never really made an effort toward anything—criticizes men like Henry Fordand other industrialists of the great school, calls them stupid, considers theirsuccess undeserved and in some way expropriated from him, and feels that menlike Ford should be controlled by men like him.I. L. [Ivan Lebedeff]—[a type] that is rather frightening—[he has] the idea thatthe man of whom he takes advantage must not only help him, but also pretend thatno advantage is being taken in order to spare his feelings. This is a case wherea man acts like a parasite, but does not want to pay for it even to the extentof admitting that that’s what he is, and expects the man he exploits to keep upthe pretense for his sake. He denies reality—and expects his victim to deny it,too. He wants to do evil—he knows that it’s evil—without paying the price ofadmitting that it’s evil and of having others know it. This is a “compoundsecond-handedness”: not merely accepting the judgment of others to estimate hisown action, but knowing the nature of his action, expecting others to fake theirjudgment of it, and then feeling free to accept this faked judgment and to beabsolved and vindicated by it. This is an extremely important point—it has aplace in every variation of second-handedness, in every second-hander’s soul.This is for the priest—it shows how he helps to perpetuate evil, the evil hethinks he’s fighting.GENERAL DIRECTION FOR PLOTTwo main lines to follow for the key events of the plot:The progressive paralysis of the world, the growing disintegration—each timebecause independent thinking, initiative, originality, fresh judgment werelacking; each time through the cowardly, senseless, automatic repetition of aroutine that no longer applies. (This in connection with TT and those businessesthat need it or that it needs. TT is acting here as the blood vessels of theworld—and we see what happens when the heart is no longer pumping.)The progressive disappearance of the prime movers. As the paralysis grows, theyvanish, adding to it. This ties in with the first line—in each specific key casethere is a prime-mover involved, who is either disregarded, or hampered, orrefuses to make the crucial step and leaves the parasites to their natural fate.John Galt must [embody] that which is lacking in the lives of all the strikers.It is he who specifically (in events essential to and proceeding from hisnature) solves their personal stories, fills the lack, gives them the answer.Here, then, I must decide who are the key strikers of the story and what istheir relation to Galt. What they need, what he supplies, in what events thistakes shape. (“The man innocent of all sense of guilt.”) Most particularly: whatdoes he give to Dagny?The climax must be an event that shows the breakdown of the world. It will bethe end of TT—but there must be a specific event that finishes off Taggart andall those connected with TT. This event must be based on and tied to the lastmajor striker—the one who held out the longest, whose tie was hardest to break,but broke at last. (It would be best if this were Dagny.) In connection withthis, start by asking yourself: which, of all their ties and reasons, is themost excusable and the hardest to break?(The men who are “mixed” on the problem realize, as the story progresses, thatthey must take a stand.)What does Galt do, once he enters the story? Is there no conflict for him? (Thisshould be Dagny.) April 14, 1946TO THINK OUT:Dagny’s motive. (What makes her tick?)Galt’s conflict, if any? (In connection with above.)Representative strikers.Representative parasites. In what exact way do parasites perish when left ontheir own? (Representative aspects of this—and from that, the characters neededand the events.)The genius-envier as a possible connecting link from Galt’s beginning to theclimax.Representative businesses—the key activities of mankind. (And how they areconnected with TT.)FOR DAGNYThree lines of approach:Her hunger for her own kind of world. She works so fiercely because she knowsshe can have her world only by creating it—but she makes mistakes about people.(Her consequent bitterness.)Her attempt (or desire) to be “the spark of initiative and the bearer ofresponsibility for a whole collective.”Her conflict (it must be concrete, emotional, dramatized, personalized).April 17, 1946Note: The creators work silently, their contribution unknown and theirprinciples unstated, while the parasites climb to the forefront on stolenachievements (by concentrating on the social, second-hand sphere of activity,and therefore getting the publicity and the credit). [The parasites] preachtheir principles to the world, thus making these principles the stated or publicpolicy of mankind. Example: the real, competent businessman who [said] that aPeter Keating could not be successful in the business world, that this is nothow business success is made; while every parasite screams that Keating is thepractical man, that any kind of success is made only by the Keating methods,that his technique is realistic and necessary, and that the world forces us toadopt his method. The question here is: what world? The world of the parasite,the world which he imagines and according to the principles of which hefunctions. But that world (like the parasite) is a surface sham, an illusion, amildew on the real world, made possible only by the real world, by its silent,active creators who support the surface mildew and have no time to protest.Of course, there are more parasites than creators—so the parasites’ creed is theone heard most often and spread most widely. Plus the fact that the creators donot talk at all. The terrible thing here is the influence this creed has on an“in-between,” average young man who starts out in life open-minded, with noparticular convictions, and is taught at once that idealism (or any kind ofsincerity) is impossible and impractical, that the world belongs to the PeterKeatings and he had better act accordingly. If he’s not strong and independentenough to rebel against this teaching, he goes the way of all parasites—and apotentially decent, average man is turned into another scoundrel, his bestpotentialities are killed, his worse brought out and encouraged.[Further,] the creators themselves are left in a kind of bewildered muddle. Theycannot accept the idea that the world is made and moved by the PeterKeatings—they know better—but they come to believe, with a kind of helpless,unanalyzed bitterness, that they themselves are freaks or martyrs, that theymust go on functioning in a hostile, vicious world unsuited to them. Well, theworld they see is vicious, but it’s neither real nor essential nor necessary—itis permitted only by their own inattention, indifference, or lack ofunderstanding of it and of themselves. They can shake it off—like anightmare—any time they wish, if they understand their own nature, function andplace in the world, if they accept their proper morality, declare it to all menand then act upon it. Let them awaken. (This is what John Galt tells them.)The man who thinks that the world demands corruption is the man who iscorrupting the world. And note that he places his prime motive in others; theydemand corruption, he claims, and he has no choice but to accept their methodsand live on their terms. This is an eloquent demonstration of the viciousness,the moral corruption, brought about by second-handers.Make a point to stress the fact that creators function in silence—both theirwork and their creed unknown.Here, tell the creators that they are really functioning on my morality and areafraid to admit it. It’s time they admitted it. (It’s never been stated forthem. But now it’s stated.)(No great man ever says that success is made through fraud; every small man saysthat. A man’s idea of what makes success defines the nature of the man.)140 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_140_r1.jpg]The creator’s greatest tie to the world is the fact that he will not surrenderthe world to the parasites. He realizes that it is his proper function to shapethe world to his wishes. And he struggles to do it no matter what obstacles theparasites put in his way. But by tolerating them or compromising by acceptingtheir terms, he succeeds only in creating their world—or in keeping it going. April 18, 1946General theme in regard to the creators: the creators cannot work or liveagainst their own principles. They only achieve their own destruction and thedestruction of everything dearest and most important to them, including theirwork. This is their error and the cause of their tragedy. This is what they muststop—by defining, understanding, and accepting their proper principles. (Theyusually try to pay the price in their private lives. They say, in effect: “I amevil in my selfishness—I’ll pay for it in my [private] life. I’ll accept mysuffering—but I’ll go on working and being selfish about my work.”)If Dagny is the leading figure and carries the story, then the climax must bethe destruction of TT (and almost the destruction of John Galt) by her attemptto deal with the parasites.(Galt’s ultimatum: “Do not function on the collectivist-altruist premise.”)The question here is: In what specific way and for what excusable reason doesshe refuse to accept the right philosophy? (Not stupidity, but a legitimateinner conflict.)In real life, the creators stop functioning in a collectivist society—but theydo it either as victims, forced to stop, or in helpless pessimism, simplybelieving that collectivism is natural, the law of the universe, and that theuniverse is evil and they are hopeless, doomed rebels against it. Galt makesthem go on strike as a conscious, deliberate protest, with full knowledge oftheir being in the right; [they] thus demonstrate to themselves and to theparasites their function, their power in the world, and the true nature of theuniverse.(As a possibility: flashbacks (e.g., Dagny or Eddie reading about it) of whathad been, in effect, the strike of the creators in the past, throughouthistory.)Two aspects of the theme (to keep integrated):1. What happens to the world without the creators.2. Why the creators go on strike (against what). This shows the manner of theirexploitation by the world. Here there are two aspects: (1) materialexploitation—by stealing and expropriating their achievements (Dagny); (2)spiritual exploitation—by what is done to the creators inside their souls (theindustrialist). This last is made possible by the creators accepting thealtruist-collectivist philosophy. They must reject this philosophy—and refuse togive to the world. (Then the world sees what happens to it, and whether it canforce the gifts it needs out of the givers.)141 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_141_r1.jpg]The actual form of relationship between men is as follows: in an exchangebetween two men of equal ability (two creators), the exchange is even; in anexchange between a man of greater ability and a man of lesser ability (a creatorand an average man), the lesser one actually receives much more than hegives—and it’s all right if he leaves the creator alone; the creator doesn’t robor sacrifice himself, it’s only that his ability and his contribution are sogreat.As an example: a good, able engineer is needed by a railroad to drive a trainengine, and if he works to the best of his ability he makes an honestcontribution and he earns the salary which the head of the railroad pays him;it’s not charity, it’s his, he’s earned it, he’s produced its equivalent invalue. But he has earned it because the genius [who runs] the railroad hascreated an industry in which the engineer’s native ability can earn much morethan it could on its own. The exchange of wages and services between the two menis fair. But the capacity of one has made the capacity of the other greater. Ifleft on his own entirely, the engineer would not produce the equivalent (incomforts or advantages or consumption for himself) of what he produces with thehelp of the superior capacity of the head genius. (When the head of a company isnot a genius, but inferior to his employees, something else happens. In a freesociety, it will not happen for long. To make it stick, compulsion is necessary.This is the case of James Taggart.)The relationship works like this: a great, cooperative enterprise of many men islike a pyramid, with the single best brain on top, and then [at lower levels]the ability required is less and the number of men in that category is greater.Even though each man (assuming all work to the best of their ability) earns hisliving by his own effort and his wages represent his own, legitimatecontribution—each has the advantage of all the strata above him, whichcontribute to the productive capacity of his own energy and raise that capacity(without diminishing their own); each man of lesser ability receives somethingextra from the men of greater ability above him; while the man at the top (thegenius, the originator, the creator) receives nothing extra from all those underhim, yet contributes to the whole pyramid (by the nature of his [work]). Nowthis is the creative over-abundance of the genius, this is the pattern of how hecarries mankind, properly and without self-sacrifice, when left free to assumehis natural course and function.(What does the genius want for this? Just “Thank you.”)As a parallel example: it’s the same process as when a worker makes a hundredpairs of shoes a day with the help of a machine. He gets paid on the basis ofhaving produced a hundred pairs of shoes (the share of the factory owner,inventor, etc., being taken out); but left on his own (without the machine, themanagement, etc.) he would be able to produce, say, only ten pairs of shoes aday. His productive capacity has been raised by the inventor of the machine. Yetneither of the two men robs the other one; it’s a fair exchange; but the workergives to the inventor less than the inventor has given to him.A similar relationship and process takes place in the spiritual or intellectualrealm among the better and lesser thinkers of the world. All production comesfrom and is based on first-hand, independent thought. The man who contributes tothe world a new thought (whether in invention, philosophy, art, or in any humanactivity) has made an invaluable contribution, for which no material returns areever quite an equivalent. And when men deal through free exchange, no matterwhat fortune a man makes on his new thought, he has still given to other menmore than he has received from them.142 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_142_r1.jpg]In connection with this: my idea about an exchange between a writer and acomposer; the fact that each reader of a book (or listener to a symphony) getsthe whole of a tremendous value, for very little in return; each gets the whole,without diminishing it (and this is not just a matter of “mass production”—therecan be only one book in existence and it can make the rounds of millions of men,and this still holds true). This has to do with the nature of an intellectualcreation.143 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_143_r1.jpg]To be exchangeable among men, a creation has to be put into a material shape—andonly that material shape is exchangeable (through a material medium of exchange,like money). The spiritual is non-exchangeable. Is it collective? Quite theopposite; it is completely individual, and not subject to exchange. A man whoreads my book can get out of it only what he is able to get; I can give himnothing more; and he can give me nothing in exchange; he can give meappreciation and understanding, which are of value to me as a person, but he cangive me nothing to help me with that book, or with the next one; my contributionhas to be made by me alone, and those who want it, take it, for whatever theycan get out of it. I do not write it for them; they do not read it for me. WhatI can get out of a book spiritually, I get it by writing it. When I give it toothers, it’s a gift (but without defrauding or sacrificing myself), it’s theextra, I can get nothing in return spiritually, it can’t be an exchange. (Thesame pattern applies to me when I listen to a symphony—with me the receiver andthe composer the giver.)I can sell a story when I have put it into a material form, the form of a book.And all I actually sell is the material book—say, for three dollars. The actualcontent of it, the story, cannot be sold or exchanged.A composer can sell music sheets of his symphony, or records, or performancerights (in this last case, the orchestra, instruments and players are thematerial form). He cannot sell the content as such—the music.An inventor sells the physical machine he has devised (or the right to use hisidea by putting it into a physical shape or machine). He cannot sell the idea.A philosopher or theoretical scientist can only sell the book in which hepresents the new knowledge he has discovered. He cannot sell the knowledge.In economics, the realm of material exchange, collectivists demand that a mangive his idea as well as its physical consequences or manifestations, keepingnone of it for himself. He can’t get any spiritual payment for his creation—andhe is expected to renounce even the physical payment. The physical objects ofexchange among men come from someone’s ideas, but all men are expected to sharein them equally—which [implies] a complete denial of the source of physicalwealth and of the rights of its creators. The creators, then, keep the othersgoing for nothing—receiving neither spiritual nor physical reward. And theparasites get the material benefits for nothing, for the mere fact of beingparasites—and enslave the creator, besides.Since the creator needs the material world in order to embody his idea and inorder to exist, he is denied the means of creation and of existence by those whocould not have these means and could not exist without him.But in a society of free exchange, the creator gets his fair material reward (byvoluntary exchange)—and the rest of mankind gets his idea as a priceless gift.The spiritual (the realm of consciousness) is the completelyindividual—indivisible and unsharable. (I do not divide my book among many men,nor do I give it to all men as a collective, to enjoy together, collectively. Itis one single book, and it is given individually to single men—those who want itor can get anything out of it.)The spiritual can be given indefinitely, without diminishing the creator’swealth, because its value depends upon each individual recipient, his spirit,and what his spirit can do with the idea. This is individualism again. Therecipient has to have the spirit with which to make use of the idea. Still, theidea remains the great gift.It may be said that a spiritual exchange would be this: I receive all the greatinventions, great thinking, great art of the past; in exchange, I create a newphilosophy or a new novel. But this is more poetic than exact; there is nodirect exchange; there is no way to measure one against the other. [...] I donot give anything to the actual source of the gifts I received—to the greatcreators of the past, each as an individual. I pay the debt to mankind? Whyshould mankind collect that debt? “Mankind” as a species is only an abstraction.The men living today are not the great individuals of the past, to whom I maysay I am indebted; the men of today did not create these great gifts; mankinddid not; the gifts were created by specific men, individuals, not by anabstraction; and the pinkish stenographer who may get a copy of my book from thelibrary (and who may hate it) is not a substitute for Aristotle (nor the properheir to collect his debts).144 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_144_r1.jpg]Re: Economics. Since the material proceeds from the spiritual, production fromideas, men must conduct their material existence and their productive activitiesaccording to the principles of their source—the principles of the spiritualrealm, of man’s free, rational thinking. To preserve the effect, one mustpreserve the cause; to have a river, one must keep free and open the“fountainhead,” the source which produces the water. If one attempts to managethe cause by the rules applicable only to the effect (and actually notapplicable [even to the effect]), one stops the cause. If one uses the water inthe river as the spring gives it, one has both river and spring. If one attemptsto regulate the spring by rules derived from considerations of the river withoutthought of its source, one loses both spring and river. Another example of thecollectivist-altruist reversal of cause and effect, of the primary and thesecondary.JAMES TAGGARTHe tries to make his able employees feel that they are dependent upon him, thathe does them a favor by giving them a job. He loses all his good employees thatway (among other reasons). He doesn’t do that with the incompetent ones, whom heprefers and encourages; in fact, he is “a friend of the workers,” he likes tostress his dependence upon them and yelps a lot about “team work.” He tries tocrush the individual—and fawns over the collective. He tries “to keep in hisplace” any man on whom he knows himself to be dependent.DAGNY TAGGARTHer error—and the cause of her refusal to join the strike—is over-optimism andover-confidence (particularly this last).Her over-optimism is in thinking that men are better than they are; she doesn’treally understand them and is generous about it.Her over-confidence is in thinking that she can do more than an individualactually can; she thinks she can run a railroad (or the world) single-handed,she can make people do what she wants or needs, what is right, by the sheerforce of her own talent, not by forcing them, not by enslaving them and givingorders—but by the sheer over-abundance of her own energy; she will show themhow, she can teach them and persuade them, she is so able that they’ll catch itfrom her. (This is still faith in their rationality, in the omnipotence ofreason. The mistake? Reason is not automatic. Those who deny it cannot beconquered by it. Do not count on them. Leave them alone.)On these two points, Dagny is committing an important (but excusable andunderstandable) error in thinking, the kind of error individualists and creatorsoften make. It is an error proceeding from the best in their nature and from aproper principle, but this principle is misapplied (through lack ofunderstanding of others and of their own relations with others). This isexcusable, since it is their nature not to be too concerned with others,therefore not to understand them, particularly when the creators are unsocial bynature, and also could not possibly understand the psychology of a parasite, norwish to bother wondering about it.The error is this: it is proper for a creator to be optimistic, in the deepest,most basic sense, since the creator believes in a benevolent universe andfunctions on that premise. But it is an error to extend that optimism to otherspecific men. First, it’s not necessary, the creator’s life and the nature ofthe universe do not require it, his life does not depend on others. Second, manis a being with free will; therefore, each man is potentially good or evil, andit’s up to him to decide by his own reasoning mind which he wants to be; thedecision will affect only him; it is not (and should not be) the primary concernof any other human being. Therefore, while a creator does and must worship Man(which is reverence for his own highest potentiality), he must not make themistake of thinking that this means the necessity to worship Mankind (as acollective); these are two entirely different conceptions with diametricallyopposed consequences. Man, at his highest potentiality, is realized andfulfilled with each creator himself, and within such other men as he findsaround him who live up to that idea. This is all that’s necessary.Whether the creator is alone, or finds only a handful of others like him, or isamong the majority of mankind, is of no importance or consequence whatever;numbers have nothing to do with it; he alone or he and a few others like him aremankind, in the proper sense of being the proof of what man actually is, man athis best, the essential man, man at his highest possibility. (The rational beingwho acts according to his nature.)It should not matter to a creator whether anyone or a million or all the menaround him fall short of the ideal of Man; let him live up to that idealhimself; this is all the “optimism” about Man that he needs. But this is a hardand subtle thing to realize—and it would be natural for Dagny always to make themistake of believing others are better than they really are (or will becomebetter, or she will teach them to become better) and to be tied to the world bythat hope.It is proper for a creator to have an unlimited confidence in himself and hisability, to feel certain that he can get anything he wishes out of life, that hecan accomplish anything he decides to accomplish, and that it’s up to him to doit. (He feels it because he knows that his reason is a [powerful] tool—so longas he remains in the realm of reason, i.e., reality, and thus does not desire orattempt the impossible, the irrational, the unreal.) But he must be careful todefine his proper sphere of desires or accomplishments, and not to undertakethat which is contrary to the premise of independence and individualism on whichhe functions. This means not venturing into second-handedness (which will end incertain failure).Here is what he must keep clearly in mind: it is true that a creator canaccomplish anything he wishes—if he functions according to the nature of man,the universe, and his own proper morality, i.e., if he does not place his wishprimarily within others and does not attempt or desire anything that is of acollective nature, anything that concerns others primarily or requires primarilythe exercise of the will of others. (This would be an immoral desire or attempt,contrary to his nature as a creator.) If he attempts that, he is out of acreator’s province and in that of the collectivist and the second-hander.Therefore, he must never feel confident that he can do anything whatever to, byor through others. He must not think that he can simply carry others or somehowtransfer his energy and his intelligence to them and make them fit for hispurposes in that way.He must face other men as they are (recognizing them as essentially independententities, by nature, and beyond his primary influence), deal with them only onhis own, independent terms, and deal only with such others as he judges can fithis purpose or live up to his standards (by themselves and of their own will,independently of him). He must not deal with the others-and if he does, he mustnot fool himself about them, nor about his own power to change them.Now, in Dagny’s case, her desperate desire is to run TT. She sees that there areno men suited to her purpose around her, no men of ability, independence, andcompetence. She thinks she can run it with incompetents and parasites, either bytraining them or merely by treating them as robots who will take her orders andfunction without personal initiative or responsibility, while she, in effect, isthe spark of initiative, the bearer of responsibility for a whole collective.This can’t be done. This is her crucial error. This is where she fails.But both these errors—of over-optimism and over-confidence—are excusable andunderstandable, because they proceed from a creator’s nature and virtues,because they proceed from strength and courage, not from weakness and fear.145 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_145_r1.jpg]Note (for Dagny or any executive): cooperation is possible only on terms ofequality, i.e., between ability and ability (though one man’s ability may begreater than another’s), not between ability and incompetence, nor betweenintelligence and stupidity. Cooperation must be between equals in kind, whomight differ in degree—but it can’t be between opposite kinds. Cooperation ispossible only among independent men, by free, voluntary, rational agreement tomutual advantage, each being concerned primarily with his own personal benefit,and being concerned with the benefit of the other only to the extent of notmaking himself a parasite, not getting something from the other for which hegives nothing in return.But you wish to do something involving a great number of men, like running arailroad? It can’t be done, except on the above terms of cooperation betweenrational, independent individuals. If you can’t find them—don’t wish to do it;hold your work to the “non-social” scale (that’s all your work actually is,anyway); you can’t force the ability of others; let the scale of your workdevelop naturally, without your participation or concern; if it doesn‘t, itmeans that you’re living in a world where it can’t—a collectivized world. April 19, 1946Dagny is an example of the material exploitation of the creator, in the sensethat her life in the world, with others, is made miserable—but she is nottouched inside. They use her only in the sense of expropriating the materialbenefits which are the result of her ability, and robbing her of credit for it.She has to give up (in effect, not quite knowing it) all hope of a real world ofher own kind, and live alone in her own world, seeing its expression only in herwork.The industrialist is an example of the spiritual exploitation of thecreator—exploitation within his soul, by his acceptance of thealtruist-collectivist philosophy, therefore his feeling of guilt, therefore hisspiritual unhappiness. (This, probably, is also the case of the composer, orsome other of the martyred artists.)146 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_146_r1.jpg]The main, concrete dramatization of the methods and forms of how the worldexploits the creators must be in the lives of Dagny and the industrialist.147 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_147_r1.jpg]Dagny, who is considered so hard, cold, heartless and domineering, is actuallythe most emotional, passionate, tender and gay-hearted person of all—but onlyGalt can bring it out. Her other side is what the world forces on her ordeserves from her.148 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_148_r1.jpg]The plot line—the collapse of TT (and of the world).The emotional line—Dagny’s quest for John Galt.The philosophical line—Dagny vs. James Taggart (or John Galt vs. James Taggart).April 20, 1946THE LINE FOR DAGNY:A disappointing attempt at a romance at the age of eighteen.The railroad worker.

(The greatest scientist and the ablestwoman in the world are a subway guard and a housewife in a garret.)James Taggart finds her there. She breaks down once—by coming back to giveadvice in an emergency, to run the railroad, almost in spite of herself.James Taggart gets Galt through Dagny (using Galt’s love for her in someway—[perhaps] through threat).Dagny saves Galt (probably with Francisco d‘Anconia and Ragnar Danneskjöld).149 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_149_r1.jpg]Dagny cries in the subway because she remembers Galt’s lines: “We hold, in theworld, the jobs which the world wishes us to hold.” (The world of the parasitesdoesn’t know or admit that its place for a genius is the job of a subwayguard—but that is what the parasite’s philosophy implies—so the strikers areliving up to it, by way of a demonstration and a lesson.)THE GRADUAL DESERTIONS:John Galt, Francisco d‘Anconia, and Ragnar Danneskjöld are the charter membersof the strike.Show them in action, withdrawing the creators from society, “stopping the motorof the world”—particularly Galt doing it.The strikers who have stopped by the time the story opens are (in addition tothe three leaders): the philosopher, the missing millionaire, the ship owner.The strikers who will stop as the story progresses: the composer, the youngengineer, the girl writer, the secretary, the industrialist, Dagny Taggart, andlast—the priest.(Also show the incidents when the help of the missing strikers would have savedthe situation—but they’re not there; only the James Taggarts are.)April 23, 1946OUTLINE: THE STRIKE PART I: THE END[A restatement of the first scene, already given in her January 1945 notes,then:]Introduction of the issue which is threatening TT.

She sees the subway-guard: John Galt. He looks at her,and walks on without a word. She sits there, sobbing. A bum tries to consoleher. (The sight of a lady in evening clothes, sobbing in the subway, seems quitenatural to him. “Oh well, who is John Galt?”) Towards morning, Galt comesback—“All right, come on.” Their walk in silence, through the streets in earlymorning, to his home. At the door, he turns and looks at her for the first time.The same smile as on their first meeting: “We never had to take any of itseriously, did we?” “No, we never had to.” They climb the many flights of stairsto his room; she doesn’t remember how she climbed the stairs, she knew only thatshe was rising; she doesn’t remember whether it was a long climb—it had takenher thirty years to reach this room.

(“Dagny, in thename of the best within us ... !”)The strikers, in the mountains of their valley, look down at a wrecked road: theruin of a house, the skeleton of an automobile—and, in the distance, thestubborn fire fighting the wind. John Galt says: “This is our day. The road iscleared. We’re going back.”150 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_150_r1.jpg]THE PROGRESSIVE COLLAPSE OF TAGGART TRANSCONTINENTALThe key steps, each worse than the one before and progressively interconnected,are:Part IFirst stage:In the first chapter—the trouble.This leads to the d‘Anconia disaster. (?)End on botched achievement.Second stage:This leads to Dagny’s attempt to deal with Ragnar Danneskjöld.The train wreck.The events in connection with Gerald Hastings.The problems which Dagny fights together with Stan Winslow.This leads to her following Danneskjöld to the valley.End on first major disaster—the double-cross.Part IIThird stage:In the opening chapter—the serious disaster which will precipitate the collapse.(Here the chain of events must be unbroken and accelerated.) This is the resultof Dagny not getting the help she needed from Danneskjöld. (The parasite whogets caught can’t supply what she needed—she knew he wouldn‘t, that’s why shewent to Danneskjöld.)End on parasite’s crash.Fourth stage:The trouble at Rearden Steel, caused by the above disaster of TT—and, in turn,when Rearden Steel collapses, TT is in its final emergency (and so is theworld).End on new executive’s looting.(This leads to President’s broadcast.)Fifth stage:The panic and the threatened final collapse of TT and everything, which they tryto avert through Galt’s help. (The psychology of looters and animals—“We onlyhave to last through the next five-year plan.”)The actual crash—which comes while Galt is being tortured.The consequences of the crash—the state of the world after it.151 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_151_r1.jpg]The disaster of Part II is actually one single development in progressive steps.(Decide what it is that the steps must lead to.)In Part I, there are three key points: the original trouble—the problems ofDagny and Winstow—the emergency when Dagny needs Danneskjöld’s help.The pattern of the last emergency must be something like this: if (for a certainexpected cause) TT doesn’t deliver the ore to a steel factory, there will be nosteel; if so, there will be no trucks; if so, there will be no grain transportedto farms; if so, there will be no wheat; if so, the country starves.152 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_152_r1.jpg]An important point: The lesser man thinks he would be president of the companybut for the better man. He’s wrong. There wouldn’t be any company. He thinksbetter men crowd him out of the better jobs—and all he has to do is destroy thebetter men, then the jobs will be his. But he destroys the jobs when he destroysthe better men. They were not made by these jobs—these jobs were made by them.The lesser man can neither create the jobs of the genius nor keep them. (Thereis an important difference of viewpoint: the creator knows that he makes his ownjob—the parasite thinks that he can be made by a job prepared for him; thecreator knows that wealth is produced by him—the parasite thinks that he ischeated out of his “chance” without the wealth which came out of nowhere. Thecreator makes his job; the parasite takes over.)153 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_153_r1.jpg]Since the essence of the creator’s power is the ability of independent rationaljudgment, and since this is precisely what the parasite is incapable of, the keyto every disaster in the story—to the whole disintegration of the world—is asituation where independent rational judgment is needed and cannot be provided.(Cannot—in the case of the parasites involved; will not—in the case of thestrikers.)NOTE ON CHARITYCharity to an inferior does not include the charity of not considering him aninferior. (This is so by definition.) This is what is demanded by thecollectivists now. If the inferior is to be helped on the ground that he is weakand you are strong—let him remember and acknowledge his position (and this isthe premise of any voluntary charity).But charity as a basic, overall principle of morality does lead to this viciouscircle: if charity (or mercy, as distinguished from justice) is the conceptionof giving someone something he has not deserved, out of pure kindness or pity,and if this is considered good (a virtue, a moral imperative), then thecollectivists are right and consistent in demanding that the principle beapplied to the primary sphere, the spiritual, as it is applied to the materialsphere, which is only secondary. If, in the material sphere, you give a man aloaf of bread he has not deserved nor earned, so his only claim to it is hismisfortune and your pity; then the equivalent in the spiritual sphere would bethe kindness of considering him your equal, a status he has not deserved,ignoring his actual worth as a man and handing to him the moral or spiritualbenefits, such as love, respect, consideration, which better men have to earn,handing these to him for the same reasons that you hand him a loaf ofbread—because it is a desirable possession and he is too weak to earn it.The collectivists (and all parasites) now demand this kind of charity: give methe bread, because you’re strong and I’m weak, and also do me the courtesy ofpretending that I’m just as strong as you are, don’t hurt my feelings bytreating me as if I were weak, hand me an alms of the spirit as you hand me onein physical shape—else you’re cruel, selfish and uncharitable.This is the ultimate logical conclusion and the ultimate viciousness of charityas an absolute principle.Help to a deserving friend is not charity—by definition. First, you personallywant the friend to succeed or overcome his misfortune, you have a reason for it,you consider him good or worthy or valuable, so you have a personal interest inhis succeeding. Second, you consider that there is a just reason why the friendshould have help—either because his misfortune is accidental, or greater than hedeserved.Charity implies that its object does not deserve help, but you give itnevertheless, as a bonus; you are not being just, but magnanimous or merciful.When you help a genius in distress, you’re kind, but not charitable. When youhelp a bum from the gutter whom you loathe—that is charity. You help, not out ofcompassion for an equal, but out of contempt for an inferior—[you help] becauseof your contempt. And on this premise (which is the exact definition of charity)the collectivists are right when they demand the worship of inferior [menbecause] of their inferiority; then you do end by rewarding failure, admiringincompetence, loving vices—and penalizing success, achievement, virtue.This is what happens whenever one attempts to depart from facts, i.e., to departfrom justice (which is to depart from reality). [Regardless of] your motive, theresult is still faking reality, evading facts—and the consequences will be thoseof any lie: corrupt, destructive, and monstrous. There is no good motive forlies. Nor for evading reality. There can’t be, by definition. What is the goodin such a conception? There is no good except truth to facts—which means, therational method as an absolute.There is the same kind of vicious intellectual sloppiness in the idea of“charity” as there is in the idea of brother-love. From the idea that you mustlove your brother men as a reward or recognition of merit or of lovablequalities (therefore you should love the men who exhibit these qualities,[because that] is only just)—it has become the idea that you must love, period,without cause or reason, just love everybody and anybody because he is born inhuman shape—and from that, it has gone “below zero,” into “love a man for hisvices, love a man precisely because he shouldn’t be loved.”From the idea of: “When in doubt about the evidence, be merciful, lean towardgiving a man the benefit of the doubt, be a little kinder rather than a littleharsher when you are not sure of the exact justice”—it has become: “Be kind, nomatter what the evidence, do not even dare to look at the evidence, just bekind”—and then: “Look at the evidence and be kind only to those who deserve theworst punishment; their evil is their claim upon your kindness.”It’s like this: first, “Love the hero, hate the knave and be kind to the averageman, giving him credit for such good as he does possess, and not hating himaltogether for such bad as there is in him.” Then: “Love everyone equally andindiscriminately, their personal virtues or vices must have nothing to do withthe love you owe them all without questions or reasons.” And then: “Love theknaves, because they’re the unfortunate ones and misfortune is the only claim tolove. Hate the heroes—they cannot claim love, since they cannot claim pity orcharity. Love is a coin used only for alms, never for exchange or reward. ”That is your logical altruism and charity. (And the parasites want it becauseit’s an escape from the responsibility of acquiring virtues to be loved for, anescape from free will.)From the idea of respecting another man’s rights because he is a human being,and these rights are his by nature and not subject to your grant or sanction,therefore do not ever rob or cheat another man nor obtain anything from him byforce without his voluntary consent, nor expect anything from him withoutearning it by a free, mutual exchange—it has become: “Give him the shirt offyour back, if he wants it—he has a right to it, that is how you must respectother men’s rights.” From: “Do not take that which is not yours,” it has become:“Take nothing and give away anything to anyone who wishes to take it. Misery andmisfortune are the only claim checks he must present.” (Nothing isyours—everything is everybody else’s.)God damn it, I must put an end to the idea of misfortune as an all-embracingpass-key and a first mortgage on all life! That’s what I must blast.The idea behind this damnable worship of misfortune is the denial of free will.Men are not considered responsible for their fortune or misfortune.Dagny’s and Galt’s attitude should be a profound mistrust of suffering. There isa difference between the way Dagny bears pain inflicted on her by others, bearsit defiantly, never allowing it truly inside her, hating the idea of pain, inherself or others—and the way James Taggart, who is a “solid screaming pain”inside, [uses] his suffering to make himself a mortgage on better people.(This aspect has to do with the final dilemma of the priest.)154 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_154_r1.jpg]James Taggart makes use of the idea of charity—on the receiving end.On the giving end, it is the priest. But the priest cannot go to the depths ofdepravity which this idea demands. If there is room for it, I might have to haveanother character to exemplify that—a man going insane in the attempt to live bythe idea of charity, which he has accepted as a basic premise and axiom,accepted intelligently and consistently, i.e., with all its implications. Thiswould be a kind of Dostoyevsky.Line for the “man of charity”: he starts by loving Galt and hating JamesTaggart; then, to be charitable, he makes himself love Taggart as much as Galt,love them both equally—hating himself in the process and considering his ownsuffering as a sign of virtue. Then, to be more consistently charitable, heloves Taggart and hates Galt—at which point he commits one of the worst acts(against the strikers) in the whole story, one of the most irrationally twisted,corrupt, monstrous acts—and he ends up insane (and probably dies in some bloodyhorror which he has brought about).Starting from hatred of suffering, and from his motive of pity for and desire torelieve suffering, he ends up by becoming a complete sadist.THE PATTERN OF THE PARASITESThe primary attribute of the parasite is his inability or unwillingness toproduce.Since all production rests on original thought and personal effort— these arethe two qualities lacking in a parasite: he cannot produce an original thoughtand he will not exercise any personal effort.In respect to thinking, there seem to be two different (though related) aspectsof it: original thinking and assimilating thinking, i.e., the ability todiscover new knowledge and the ability to understand a new thought discovered bysomeone else (not merely to memorize principles or knowledge, but to assimilatethem through full rational understanding). The necessary rational process seemsto be similar in both instances—the ability to grasp and connect a rationalchain—but it is here, I think, that the degrees of men’s intellectual ability,the degrees of intelligence, become apparent: a great mind is able to make newrational connections, never made before by anyone else, from objective evidence;the lesser mind is able to grasp the connections made by others when theseothers present their conclusions to him. (He must be able, when an argument ispresented to him, to know whether it is correct or not, rationally tenable ornot, and accept or reject it accordingly; but he cannot initiate a new chain ofreasoning.)Of course, there are infinite degrees of intellectual ability. A sane but verystupid man will never understand higher mathematics—simply because it would takehim too long to absorb all the logical steps and knowledge necessary for suchunderstanding. He has the potential capacity to understand it—if he went step bystep and if a better mind guided his understanding all along the way (this isalso supposing that he could retain and assimilate that much logic andknowledge). But since such a long effort is not necessary for him, and since nogenius is going to help him in that way, it is safe for him just to leave thesubject alone and exercise his mind in a smaller sphere, to the extent of hiscapacity. And if it is true that there is a limit to a man’s capacity forintellectual absorption (this is a matter of which I am not certain), [suchthat] even if he were to start studying higher mathematics slowly andconscientiously step by step, he would reach a point where he could not hold itall—then the advisable practical conclusion is the same: he must leave thisfield alone, leave it to those who can handle it, and deal only with suchmatters as he can handle by the independent rational process of his own mind. Ifhe ventures beyond that, he is venturing into second-handedness.Here may be the source of a certain kind of collectivist’s resentment againstgenius. The collectivist makes the following argument: a world geared to thegenius is impossible for the lesser man to live in; in theory, it demands of thelesser man a mental effort that he is congenitally incapable of performing—andin practice, the genius hoards all the material wealth produced as reward forhis genius, since his genius produced it; so the lesser man has no way tosurvive, his meager little contribution has no market in competition with thetremendous production of the genius. Therefore, down with the genius, let us alllive on a lesser scale, on a more miserable standard, both spiritually andphysically—otherwise, we cannot live at all, we’re doomed to destruction, sincemost of us are only average men and the genius, by the nature of his relation tous, will destroy us. (This is the pattern of what lies behind all the anti-city,anti-machine-civilization, back-to-the-soil, back-to-handicraft movements.)But this argument is based on a parasite’s view of genius, a parasite who doesnot understand the nature of genius. By the nature of cooperation among men andthe nature of intellectual achievement, the genius always gives to others morethan he receives from them; no matter what material wealth he gets from men inexchange for his idea, he has given them more than he receives; he has raisedtheir own capacity to produce wealth. He cannot “hoard the material wealth ofthe world, leaving nothing to the lesser men.” Being the source of materialwealth, he always leaves to others the greater part of the material consequencesof his idea, the greater part of the material wealth he has made possible—byincreasing their own capacity to produce it, by augmenting their physical andmental ability through the gift (or lesson) of his discovery.Besides, it is precisely the differences of intelligence that make cooperationamong men possible, fair to all and beneficial to all. For example, a genius whomakes an abstract scientific discovery turns it over to the lesser, but stillbrilliant man—the practical inventor—who discovers a way to make a machine basedon it; [the inventor] turns it over to the lesser, but still talented man—thebusinessman—who starts an industry based on the machine; and so on—down to theman of least ability, the unskilled laborer who only turns a crank, or digs aditch for the factory, or sweeps the factory floors. The least of these menreceives more material benefits through this cooperation than he could get ifleft on his own (or, in corresponding degree, if any of the better abilitiesabove him had been eliminated).And, of course, the idea that the intellectually strong crushes or exploits theweak is sheer nonsense. By definition, if he is stronger in ability, he does notneed the inferior talent or contribution of the weak and has no cause to exploithim. The weak, of course, has every cause to exploit the strong. In any specificprofession, the better man will, of course, crowd out the lesser one, e.g., agood engineer will get a job away from a bad one. But the bad one has nobusiness competing with the man of superior ability—nor expecting his rewards.Let the bad one go into some lesser line of endeavor; let him be foreman,instead of company president; or plain worker, instead of foreman—whatever hisability permits in free competition in a free society.Never mind the instances of injustice, of ability being passed up andsecond-handers making a success through pull or palaver—in a free society, suchinstances defeat and eliminate themselves (though not instantaneously); abilitywill be rewarded, the second-hander will fail—if you leave men alone. But thegreater the spread of the principles of second-handedness, parasitism, andcollectivism in a society—the more injustices occur and the longer they hold.Make collectivism permanent and the injustices are frozen in place, madepermanent. But then society collapses. [...] April 24, 1946A man incapable of producing an original thought (or [not in sufficient] degreeto affect his practical life or contribute to general knowledge) can still be amoral man and a valuable member of society, if he exercises his own intelligencehonestly and to the best of his ability. He can be a good “absorber.” He becomesan excellent—and needed—executor of the ideas of others. He does not become ascientist, but a good engineer; or, he does not become an engineer, but a goodmechanic.And he cannot be considered a second-hander, if he does not indulge in any ofthe second-hander’s motives or “social” [methods], if he is honest about himselfand his work, does not wish or pretend to be an innovator, but understands hisown sphere, his own work, likes it and does it well. In this way, he is beingperfectly moral, since he does not place his prime concern within others or intoany comparison. He says, in effect: “Others may be men of greater ability, butthat is not my primary concern; they offer me an idea in exchange for my work; Igive them my best honest effort in return; we’re dealing as equals in freeexchange to mutual advantage. I like my work in carrying out their ideas—and thework does require a first-hand, independent effort of intelligence on my part. Iam happy in my own effort, work, and life. That is all that matters. Thatsomebody is a greater man than I am is none of my concern—except that Iappreciate him, I like him for his genius—and, perhaps, I am also a littlegrateful to him (though not in the primary manner of a dependent).” This is thestand applicable to all good, moral men of average ability.But the parasite does not take this stand. This is not his attitude nor hismethod. (The above man is an active man; the parasite is not. The above man is aproducer; the parasite is not.)The parasite discards his status as a human being, his attribute of survival—theindependent rational mind. Only those who discard it are incapable of producing,since the independent rational mind is the source of all production. Theparasite is not insane nor a congenital idiot; he has his rational mind; hecould function as the moral average man above (call him “the executor”); but hedoesn’t want to function as an executor—so he does not exercise even suchability as he has. Now what makes the parasite do it?It is the desire to get more than he deserves, in both the spiritual and thematerial realm. It may have started only with the material, but now, in thisstage of civilization where material abundance is so lavish for all, due to thework of the geniuses of the ages, the desire for more than one deserves has gonemainly into the spiritual realm—and there it is most vicious and deadly (this isnot to discount plain grafters and looters, but they are not the real menacetoday). This is the root of all modern collectivism.The man who renounces (by statement or by implication) the basic axiom of livingby his own independent rational mind has, in effect, announced his desire formore than he deserves and his status as a parasite. (This applies to everyphilosophy or attitude that is anti-reason.) The axiom [of living by reason]implies most powerfully, without room for escape, that each man standessentially on his own and get nothing except what he deserves. (Which means:what he earns, what he produces, what qualities he possesses—all of his claimsmust be based on reality, on objective fact.) The escape from reason is theescape from reality.Now if a man declares that he wants to discard reality, it means that he wantsto acquire something that reality can’t give him; something more than hedeserves in hard fact. (To admit this is to admit his own inferiority, to say:“I want to be more than I actually am, because I know I’m small, inferior,rotten,” but this does not bother a parasite. In fact, it is to escape just sucha realization that he discards the validity of reason, logic, or any kind offact, so that he does not have to face or accept this conclusion. He says: “Oh,it may be so—in reason. But reason is an illusion. Reason doesn’t work. Life isnot reasonable. Nothing is reasonable. I can say that I am an inferior andconsider myself a superior at one and the same time.”)What does the parasite want? Anything that is of value, spiritually ormaterially.Materially—he wants more wealth than his own effort is worth; here we have anybureaucrat or politician, any man who wants to gain through restrictingcompetition, any man who seeks economic advantages through political power,i.e., through force, any man who tries to make a success through pull, throughthe “human” rather than the business angle, through friendship rather thanmerit, any Peter Keating, or any man who chooses his profession because of thereturns he sees others getting from it, not because of his actual ability ordesire to do that work (the man who wants to be a writer, not to write).Spiritually—the parasite wants an immense, vague, undefined field of advantages,and it is here that his attitude has that peculiar quality of viciousness,corruption, weakness, touchiness, and hysteria. This is the real sphere of thecomplexes and the neuroses. A Peter Keating is healthy and even active comparedto the primarily spiritual parasites. (P.H. is the best example of such aparasite that I know personally.) This type wants a sense of superiority, whichhe lacks. (Note that he wants, not greatness, but superiority.) Therefore, thissense must be given to him by others, second-hand; but this is impossible—so theparasite is never satisfied, never reaches any kind of happiness, his demandsgrow, the more others give him the more he demands of them, and, in fact, hehates them for giving (actually hating himself for accepting).He wants, from others, any reward given to human values or virtues—withoutpossessing these values or virtues. Above all, he wants admiration (without anachievement to admire, without even giving to himself any reason why he shouldbe admired). He wants authority, unearned and causeless; he wants to be obeyed,he wants power and the feeling of influencing others. He wants love andaffection—[while] never loving anyone himself. He wants prestige—of thecomparative kind, being considered better than others. He wants fame. He wantsfawning, kowtowing and the sense of having inferiors around him. He wants,hysterically and forever, to beat somebody at something; not to do somethinggood, but to do something better than somebody else has done it. (This last isindicative of his motive, of the basic cause that made him a parasite.)He wants, actually, to reverse cause and effect—thinking that the effect willcreate in him the cause. He doesn’t think that admiration proceeds fromachievement—he thinks that achievement can be made to proceed from admiration;only he isn’t really concerned with achievement.Where would a parasite get the conception of more than he deserves? Fromobserving others, of course. [...] The “material” parasite in modem life is theman who wants to get more than he deserves, by riding on the achievements ofothers: the hack popular writer who makes a comfortable living by thinlydisguised variations on the writings of others; the dress designers who stealfrom Adrian, etc. (An inferior dress designer isn’t satisfied with the income hecan make on “Broadway Shoppe” designs; he wants to get some of the incomebrought in by Adrian dresses—without possessing Adrian’s ability; the only wayto do that is to steal Adrian’s ideas.)In the spiritual realm, the parasite wants every reward he has seen being givento better men. He would have no conception of admiration, since he neverproduced anything to admire, if he hadn’t seen the genius being admired for hisachievements. He wants the reward, without the reason; the effect, without thecause. He wants the admiration—for nothing. His irrationality makes such aconception or desire possible. (Conception?—that belongs to reason. He doesn’teven have to consider whatever it is that’s going on in his head as a“conception”; nor to state it, nor to define it. Just want it. Just “feel. ”)What does all this do to the parasite’s relation with other men?The parasite began by being a second-hander. His first premise was accepted onthe second-hander’s basis—the basis of comparison. He said: “I am inferior,because I see others who are better than I am. I must escape from myinferiority—and from those hated men who made me conscious of it, from thosebetter ones.” Then he becomes an irrationalist in order to achieve this[escape]. A man’s estimate of and attitude toward himself will, of course,determine his attitude toward everything else: others, life, the universe.Having started with the idea that value is established by comparison (or elsehaving started by hating himself for some flaw and considering himself inferiorwithout comparison—the result being the same when he confronts others), theparasite will naturally hate the genius, and any man of ability, virtue, orsuperiority of any kind. In effect, he will have the insane idea that he canbecome great simply by eliminating those who are better. Values have no absoluteexistence for him; they are all relative. He doesn’t want to grow ten bushels ofwheat; he will be happy if he grows two, [as long as] everybody else grows onlyone. (Marcella B. and her “two cars.” [AR is referring to a young woman she metwhile working at RKO in the early 1930s. When AR asked the woman about hergoals, she said: “I’ll tell you what I want. If nobody had an automobile, then Iwould want to have one automobile. If some people have one, then I want to havetwo.”]) (Of course, a second-hander can have no absolute values; they have to berelative; his standard and measure is in others, or in his own comparison ofhimself to others; absolute values require an independent rational judgment.)The parasite hates competition—because he sees all life as a competition. Heknows he can’t hold his own, on his own independent terms (he has none), againstthe genius; hence his desire for “security,” “controls,” and “collaboration.”Yet, as a non-producer (who has discarded the necessary precondition of aproducer: the independent rational mind) he sees all life as a race for astatic, given amount of benefits. He doesn’t think that material wealth iscreated by the energy and intelligence of men—an inexhaustible source; he thinksthat there’s just so much material wealth (a static amount) and whoever getsrich takes that much away from him; his “share” is that much smaller. (Hedoesn’t realize that in a free society of producers each wealthy man adds to thetotal wealth, that each creates his own new wealth, and also adds to the wealthof others by his ideas and his energy. But to realize this would be to ceasebeing a parasite.)He thinks the same in the spiritual realm; he sees spiritual values as a staticsum total, so anything gained or possessed by another man is taken away fromhim. If another man is loved, this reduces his chances of being loved. Ifanother man is admired, it reduces his possible share of admiration. If anotherman has any personal virtue—intelligence, courage, integrity, beauty—his ownvirtues are thereby diminished or destroyed (as if virtues were somethingdistributed around out of a common grab-bag-and there’s only so much of it todivide). This is the non-producer‘s, the irrationalist’s, the collectivist‘s,the parasite’s view of the world, spiritual and material. (This is the miserabletrembling for one’s share of the “common pot”—since everything is common,collective, isn’t it?)If it is said that what the parasite dreads is competition for a specificgoal—such as one particular job, or the love of one particular woman—and what hefears is that the better man will beat him in that specific instance, then it’sstill second-handedness. The creator (or any “active” man) attaches no crucialimportance to anything that comes from others, from the will of some one otherman; he may regret losing a job or losing the woman he loves to someone else,but it is not a crucial tragedy for him, nor the breaking of his life, since itnever was his primary concern. He wants a job in his particular line of work,but not necessarily any one specific job. He may love only one woman in his lifeand he may lose her, and this is a tragedy—but not the end of him, since he didnot exist primarily for that woman, nor for any other human being. His primarygoal is within himself.It is said that this is fine for the genius who’s sure of his superiority andchance to win out against others in any competition for a specific object—butwhat about the lesser men who know they’re doomed to be the losers? The answeris: If such are the facts, there’s nothing they can do about it; hatred anddestruction of the genius will not change anything. They must face the facts andaccept the lesser rewards, those they’ve deserved; they can have nothing moreanyway. If there is no genius (or better man) around, it does not mean that thewoman whom the lesser man wants will necessarily want him; she may not wantanyone at all—the lesser one will never satisfy her. (Personal love is thenearest one can come to a situation where the gain of one consists of the lossof another—and even then it doesn’t quite hold; in fact, it doesn’t hold atall.)If the competition is for jobs, the lesser man cannot hold the job which isactually above his capacity—the job which the genius would have taken, if thelesser man had not decided to destroy the genius. Here, in fact, is one of thekey pillars of my story: if the lesser man is afraid of the competition of thegenius for a top job, and thinks that the job would be his, if it weren’t forthe genius, and so all he has to do, in legitimate self-interest andself-preservation, is to destroy the genius—he will learn that the job, createdby genius for genius, is not for him. Such a job—created by superior ability andrequiring superior ability to be filled, in an advanced civilization whichrepresents the accumulation, the end product, of centuries of thought, effortand genius—cannot be filled by him. (And he ought to know it by his owndefinition of himself, the genius, and the job.) If he forces his way into it—bycompulsion, collectivism, and destruction of the genius—he will not hold the jobor get its advantages; he will merely destroy the job—and himself. (This isimportant—James Taggart.)From such premises, it’s logical that the parasite’s most frequent and strongestemotion is envy. Envy of ability, of achievement, of virtue, of happiness. Thisis why the parasite comes to wish ill to everyone, to rejoice in anyone’smisfortune and resent anyone’s happiness. This is why he will hate any successand relish every failure. This is why he will love the incompetent. This is whyhe will hate the men of ability, try to crush, stop, or destroy them—and why hewill surround himself with mediocrities, with his inferiors, why he will helpthem, encourage them, push them forward. (And since he is a dreadful mediocrityhimself, and has quite a sensitive instinct about recognizing his superiors—boy!how low he has to go in order to find inferiors!) Envy is his constant,corroding, consuming emotion—and his strongest motive (perhaps his only motive).Since emotions come from reason, from the premises one has accepted, this islogical and unavoidable: the premise of second-handedness can produce only themost second-hand of all emotions: envy. If that is his dominant principle, thatwill be his dominant emotion.Now what is the exact pattern of the parasite’s actions in exploiting thegenius?The simplest and most primitive: if there were only two men in the world and thegenius were producing the food needed to exist—the parasite, who producesnothing, would do one of two things: he can descend upon the genius, kill himand seize his food, but then he himself will starve when he’s consumed the foodand can’t produce any more; or, he can try to enslave the genius and make himwork, taking as much of the genius’ production as he can get away with.The last is the basic pattern of what has been done to the genius throughouthistory.But the genius doesn’t work under compulsion; the nature of his genius is theindependence of his mind, so the necessary condition for the exercise of hisgenius is destroyed when he is enslaved. The greater his genius—the greater hissense of independence, of being an end in himself, and not the means to anyoneelse’s ends, not anyone’s servant. Whatever altruist-collectivist theory hemight have absorbed merely makes him miserable, tortures him and causes a civilwar within him. With respect to his work, and to the extent to which he lives inaccordance with and by the principles of his genius—he will maintain hisindependence, fiercely and passionately.Also, an incompetent ruling a genius, a non-producer trying to control anddirect the productive work of a producer, can result only in disaster. Theactual performance of men in society is a constant, fierce, undefined strugglebetween the genius and the parasite. [In order] to function, the genius musthave his freedom and his independence—whether by stated, accepted principle, orby unstated default, or by open rebellion against the stated principles ofcollectivism in society. To the extent of his actual independence, he is able tofunction. But he is crippled, hobbled, tied, held back constantly by theencroachments and restrictions of the parasites who get their unearnedsustenance from him.How do the parasites do it and what is their long-range policy?They do it by two means: through actual force—this is political power, theregulated society, collectivism; and by spiritual poisoning—this is thephilosophical means to disarm and enslave the genius from within, the corruptionby the parasite’s morality of altruism.(My story must show both methods. Galt leads the revolt against both.)As parasites, they have no long-range policy. Long-range planning belongs to theproducer. The parasite acts on the psychology of the animal or the savage: grabthe kill or the bananas of the moment and don’t worry about tomorrow; tomorrowyou will start looking for another victim.The parasites will not face the fact that they are destroying their ownproviders, their own means of survival. If they think anything at all on thesubject, it’s something like this: there will always be some genius around, wecan milk one of them dry, destroy him, and then pick on the next one. Thegeniuses will always come along to be picked—it’s only a question of how much wecan get away with. And this has always been true: the geniuses did come alongand the parasites got away with as much as the traffic of any particular timewould bear. When the parasites went too far, a civilization collapsed into darkages; then the geniuses were free (by default, by the parasites’ impotenceamidst ruins) to rebuild the world, and then the parasites climbed on theirshoulders—and it started all over again. (This is what Galt wants to stop onceand for all.)How do [the parasites] act toward any man of ability in practical life? In a waywhich is as contradictory as their philosophic premise. First, they hate him.Second, they want to get all they can out of him. They want to destroy him andto use him at the same time. They put every possible impediment in his way andwant as much production as they can get out of him. They refuse to recognize hisrights—but they want him to recognize and accept their right to exploit him.They act on the premise of exploiting the better man—yet refuse to admit that heis better. They act on the premise of exploiting his productive genius—yetrefuse to admit that production comes from his genius.Above all, they want him to think (and they want others to think it and wouldlike to fool themselves into thinking it) that what they get out of him is notcharity and alms, but is theirs by right. The theories and methods to achievethis and the rotten trickery involved are infinite—but it all comes down tocollectivism and altruism. (They do not mind so much if their exploitation isthought of as loot—this gives them a sense of having bested the genius in someway—but they do not want it to be called charity. This is the touchy vanity ofthe parasite.)(This is the attitude of James Taggart toward Dagny, Rearden, the youngengineer, and any man of ability he encounters.)Now-what happens in a world where there is nothing but parasites left? Whathappens in a world run by parasites? What happens to the parasites when they areleft on their own, left to their own devices and methods? April 25, 1946Before answering the last question, one more note on the parasites. Isparasitism basically a desire for undeserved material wealth, which then leadsto the spiritual parasitism? Is the basic motive material—and the spiritual evilonly the means to an end, the justification, a result of and a disguise for it?No. The material proceeds from the spiritual, not vice versa. The material isthe expression of the spiritual, the form of the idea, the flesh of the soul.The spiritual intention determines its material expression. Not the other wayaround.Therefore, the parasite’s basic motive, premise, and evil is spiritual. It is,of course, self-hatred [caused by] the discarding of his rational faculty and ofthe kind of life (the only kind possible to man) which the rational facultyimplies and demands. The first crime is against his own ego. All the othercrimes follow.What makes a man do that? This is a huge question by itself. It seems thatself-reverence (which is the root of self-confidence, which is the root ofindependence) is a primary axiom for man—the axiom of survival, the lifeprinciple. This must be thought out in detail. Here, I trace the course of theparasite from that first crime on. (Nowadays, of course, the reason is the hugepressure of the teachings of altruism. But what is the essential cause here?What was the reason of the primary, original error? Was it fear? If so, whatcases that kind of fear?)If a parasite hates himself, he has to become an irrationalist, in order tosurvive. Otherwise, he would have to destroy himself, to be consistent.Once he has [rejected] reason, he has lost or discarded his capacity to produce,his understanding of the source and nature of production, and also his spiritualentity, his self, and the entire realm of his spiritual life. No spiritual lifeis possible without the mind, without reason; the spiritual is the rational. Onthe irrationalist premise, there is nothing but a sickening chaos left, sincethe man is doing constant violence to himself, acting contrary to hisnature—and, of course, suffering constant pain, as he would physically if heinsisted on acting contrary to the requirements of his body. Also, no spirituallife is possible [to a man who] hates himself; spiritual life has to begin witha strong, proud, happy sense of identity; but that is precisely what theparasite has discarded and is trying to escape. Without the rational faculty, noindependence is possible, i.e., no inner existence at all. The parasite istrying to escape from any inner reality; he has discarded the essence of whatconstitutes life.But he goes on existing. So he has to find a substitute [for reason]—he thinksthat’s possible, just as he thinks it’s possible to exist without self, withoutidentity. (The process without object? The movement without that which moves?)The obvious substitute of the spiritual is the material. The reversal is similarto what he has already done. As a second-hander, he placed others first, aboveself. Actually, all relations with others are secondary, and a result of one’sentity, one’s attitude toward oneself; but he decided that his entity will bedetermined by and emerge from that relation. (“My virtue is to be determined bythe good I do for others,” etc.) So now he performs another reversal: instead ofrealizing that man’s material activity and production is the result of hisspiritual entity (his thinking, his desires, his purposes) and that the materialis meaningless except as the form given to the satisfaction of a primarilyspiritual need—he decides that his spiritual happiness will proceed from thematerial, that the material will give him a spiritual entity. He places thematerial first.A simple example of this reversal is the man who wants a big, beautiful,luxurious house—without realizing that the [value] of such a house depends onwhat he wants to do in it. What if it’s big—but he has nothing to do in therooms and all that space is wasted? What if it’s beautiful—if he has nostandards, understanding, or appreciation of beauty? What if it’s luxurious—whenluxury is the lavish satisfaction of desires, and he has no desires? Thematerial is only an answer to a spiritual need, an expression of it, a tool ofit. Otherwise—it’s meaningless. Without a purpose in his activity, withoutstandards of judgment, without desires—the man might as well live in a rottingshack (or not live at all). He won’t acquire these spiritual possessions fromthe house—the house had to come from them, be an answer to them.(Sex is a very eloquent and complex example of that, too. Think it over indetail sometime.)The parasite thinks that the material will give him, not only the happiness helacks, but also the capacity for happiness which he has discarded. And notunderstanding (or not admitting to himself) the source of material wealth, hethinks that he can acquire wealth second-hand, through others (as he expects tofind virtue, happiness, or importance through others). (He is not asecond-hander because he wants to be fed by others; he wants to be fed by othersbecause he is a second-hander; the spiritual reversal, or crime, was first.)From this [reversal], the parasite acquires two qualities: first, an exaggeratedgreed for material wealth, with no purpose for which to use it, wealth as an endin itself, and not as the means to an end (which is all that material wealth canbe); second, the conviction that the way to get wealth is through others, thathis activity must be directed toward the human, not the objective, productiveaspect. (This is the source of: “A creator’s concern is the conquest of nature.A parasite’s concern is the conquest of men.” [This quote is from Roark’sspeech.])This is why the parasite wants, not to make, but to “take over.” This is why heis concerned not with merit, but with pull; not with actual performance, butwith faking a performance for someone else’s eyes. That is why he sees nonecessity to produce anything—but only the necessity of convincing someone thathe’s gone through the motions, so that he gets paid. That is why he doesn’tthink it necessary to do a good job, but only to please the boss; and it doesn’tmatter whether he fools the boss into thinking it was a good job—he aims toplease the boss through means not connected with the job, such as personalflattery or social charm; he even thinks that the safe way to please the boss isone unrelated to the job, to the actual performance and result; wealth, hethinks, is acquired through these side-means, through any means, exceptproduction.How—in view of this attitude—he manages to escape facing the implication thatsomebody else produces the wealth he wants to expropriate, by quite differentmethods, is an interesting question. Of course, he never quite escapes it. Hencehis miserable uneasiness and uncertainty. Hence, also, the disgusting,undefined, untenable theories (they are really shouted slogans, not theories)about wealth being a matter of natural resources (forgetting who and what maderesources out of matter that was useless per se), about wealth and success beingjust a matter of luck, and all the variations of determinism. (Underdeterminism, nothing has to be explained too clearly: other men produce wealthin some unstated manner, because they’re predetermined, or conditioned, thatway; he, the parasite, isn’t; he’s predetermined to his method, and it’s all amatter of fate, nothing can be changed, it works that way because it has to workthat way, so it’s quite all right.) Besides, irrationalism helps him to avoidthe implications and the contradiction. A “contradiction” is a rationalconception; an irrationalist doesn’t have to make sense.Now, then, the parasite concentrates his ambitions and activities on gettingmaterial wealth. He may invent all sorts of minor spiritual justifications tocover up his material parasitism, but these are secondary; the parasiticalconvictions are not accepted in order to permit him to loot; the desire to lootwas the result of the original parasitical conviction, the primary spiritual actof second-handedness. And since no “existence through others” is possible, thenearest a parasite can come to it is to exploit others materially, gettingphysical sustenance or unearned wealth from them, expropriating the results oftheir work, enslaving them.[As part of the] proof that the parasite’s primary motive is not material:material wealth never gives him any happiness and he doesn’t know what to dowith it if he gets it.It is not a paradox that the creator, who is not primarily concerned withmaterial wealth, can and does enjoy it when he has it, and the parasite, whoplaces wealth first, goes to pieces with it.This is why the successful parasites, the Peter Keatings, are completelymiserable when they reach success; this is why [so many] celebrities turn todrink, dope, or dissipation at the height of their success; this is [the sourceof] the vicious talk about success being only a disappointment, and the strivingis better than the achievement, and the striving is all there is to do, we mustalways strive, never succeed, and “a man’s reach should exceed his grasp,” etc.Of course, the parasite’s kind of success is the deadliest disaster for him.(Since the goal is improper, its achievement can only be disastrous.) He hashunted wealth as a substitute for his inner entity; he has thought that he wouldget a spiritual life out of his material possessions, that he would get virtue,happiness, inner satisfaction, all the spiritual values which he lacks. Hediscovers that he doesn’t get any of it; that he has not escaped from himselfnor found a substitute for himself. He has nowhere else to seek and nothing todo. He is in a blind alley. From this point on, the parasite goes to pieces.This is why those who preach “selflessness” spiritually are so inordinatelyconcerned with material wealth—why the collectivists think that material“security” is the supreme ideal that will solve everything, while theindividualist, who defends a system of private property and so-called greed,attaches little importance to material wealth, can do without it and is notafraid of poverty; he is the man who makes wealth and he knows its exactmeaning.Therefore, the “material parasite” and the “spiritual parasite” are interrelatedaspects of the same thing, different stages of the same disease (and the twostages are never quite separate—one is merely more pronounced than the other inany particular man at any particular time). The “material parasite” seemssomewhat more pleasant, more healthy, than the spiritual one; at least he isactive, though in his own disgusting way; he works at being a parasite—likePeter Keating. The spiritual corruption and second-handedness are there, ofcourse, but total disintegration has not yet set in. When Peter Keating succeedshe reaches the stage of P.H. or M.F., who were born with money, and he discoverswhat they have already discovered—the impotence of material wealth in regard totheir problem. Then he goes to pieces, as they did in the first place. Then heturns to their neuroses, their purposeless existence, and their malice towardthe whole universe. They are merely advanced stages of his disease.So there is no essential difference between the two types of parasite, not inwhat they do if they succeed, nor in their ultimate goal and fate.There is one more stage for the parasite, the third and final stage, which theydo not always reach (some may die before they reach it or succeed in avoiding itall their lives). This is their real hell and their real retribution. It is thestage when a parasite discovers—or is forced to face—the truth about himself.His whole, twisted, tortuous, miserable performance has been a search forpersonal value; he wanted personal virtue—but he tried every possible substitutefor virtue; he ran from the realization of his own worthlessness or inferiority,and he has spent his life trying to fool himself about that, in every waypossible, including the attempted denial of any value, virtue, or objectivereality. In his stage of spiritual parasitism, he was still fighting against anyrealization of the truth—hence his malice, his mysticism, his collectivism, etc.But if and when some event forces him to see the truth—to see himself as hereally is—to see and admit to himself, in full, his own evil-that is probablythe worst thing a human being can go through. This is Peter Keating afterToohey’s speech. This is James Taggart after the priest’s refusal. In thatstage, there’s literally nothing left of the parasite—not even the activity ofmalice. Then it’s total indifference—the passive—the Nirvana.I suspect that a parasite who reaches this stage either goes insane, commitssuicide, or soon dies from a lack of the will to live. (He doesn’t know that heactually discarded that will long ago in his first act of second-handedness,when he discarded his rational faculty, man’s means of survival; now theultimate consequences have caught up with him in the only form that waspossible, the form he asked for: self-destruction.)Since success is the worst punishment for a parasite (the success of a manfunctioning on the principle of destruction has to be destruction), the worstthing the creators could possibly do to the parasites is precisely what JohnGalt does: let the parasites succeed, turn the world over to them—and let themsee what happens.Of course, the parasite’s greatest wish (in practice) is to exploit and enslavethe creator, but the wish is a contradiction in terms: the creator cannot beenslaved, he cannot function that way; what we see in actual life is only hismiserable struggle for the scraps of freedom he tears out of the parasites’hands, and he functions only to the extent of those scraps. So the parasite’swish, in factual terms, is to destroy the creator. To enslave the creator is todestroy him. (“The purpose of the fraud was to destroy the creators. Or toharness them. Which is a synonym.”)Therefore, John Galt grants the parasite his wish: he removes the creators. Hedoesn’t destroy them, of course, but they do not exist as far as the parasite isconcerned; they take no part in his world, they contribute nothing, they do notinterfere with him or oppose him. He gets what he wanted—a world withoutcreators. Then the horror follows—the destruction of the world—the logicalconsequences of the parasite’s principle of death; and the parasite’s innerhorror must match, if not surpass, the horror of the world’s material collapse.(This is for the last scene with James Taggart and the priest.)The parasite could exist only so long as he had the creators to lean on, to befed by, to exploit; in this sense, the creators were responsible for him—bypermitting him to do it. This is just like totalitarian economics that can existonly on the energy stolen from the free economies, who thus create their ownFrankenstein monsters. This is what John Galt wants the creators to understandand to stop.This, then, is the meaning of John Galt’s strike. This must be shown clearly,explicitly, and unmistakably (in detail, in more and broader ways than just thedisintegration of James Taggart).NOTESDietrich Gerhardt-as the composer on the pattern of Shostokovitch (but not ofthat nature), who, by dealing with his enemies, helps to perpetuate their holdon him, to perpetuate his own slavery and precipitate his own destruction (thislast, in symbol, through the destruction of a woman he loves, a singer, or of atalented young composer-protégé).James Taggart’s hysterical fear of Galt—before he even sees him or hears of him,just fear of someone like Galt, from his own knowledge that such a person mustexist, his knowledge that this is what is missing in the world and this is theretribution that will come some day. Taggart’s insane, irrational attempts toavoid that day—and the climax is when he comes face to face with Galt. (That isGalt’s place in his life.) (Taggart hates the expression “Who is John Galt?”—instinctively, without reason.)As a possibility: the scene where James Taggart finds Dagny in her garret,scrubbing the floor. (He’s had detectives looking for her.) He finds that hecannot beg, bribe, or force her back—that he has nothing to offer her. He wantssomething from her—he has nothing to give in return. The position of anyparasite—the exploitation made possible only by the generosity of the creator.And Dagny is cured of that. (This scene can show the exact nature of charity.)Dagny tells him that the cleanliness of her floor means more to her than themillions of bushels of wheat in the stomachs of the millions of people who needthe train to get the wheat. What do those people intend to do to her with theenergy they’ll get from the wheat she gives them?155 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_155_r1.jpg]For the politicians: Do not name their exact political positions. Keep it vagueand general—as it deserves. They are nonentities and their titles or jobs do notmatter—all that matters, the essence of it, is that they are useless, facelessmediocrities, parasites and exploiters—as exemplifying the kind of governmentthey represent. Therefore, avoid the honorable connotations attached to such atitle as “President of the United States” by another era and a differentprinciple of government. All you have is “Head of the State” or “WashingtonOfficials.” The Head of the State is known and referred to throughout as just“Mr. Parker” (or Mr. Smith, or Mr. Johnson, or the most typicallyundistinguished name you can find). So are the other officials: always Mr.so-and-so, and no first name. The anonymity of mediocrity.As to Europe—keep it in a gray, ominous, evil fog. Nothing clear about it—onlyintimations that Europe is finished, there’s only a chaos of impotentcollectivism left. If you refer to their forms of government, it’s always only:“The People’s State.” (You do all this by hints about the breakdown ofcommunications—there’s little left of the radio, the telegraph, the mail, theboats, any kind of press, any kind of reliable source of information. People inthe story take this for granted, as normal, matter-of-fact, implying that Europehas been like that for a long time.) April 26, 1946[In the following notes, the collapse of a society run by parasites is analyzedinto five stages. Later, AR refers to this analysis as the “Pattern ofDisintegration. ”]Now to answer [my earlier] question: What happens in a world run by parasites?Since the parasite’s basic premise is escape from reason, since he has discardedhis capacity for independent rational judgment (and dreads the necessity of suchrationality), the most evident and all-embracing manifestation of a parasite’sworld will be the miserable scrambling to evade personal decisions and personalresponsibility.In every issue—business or personal—the parasites will, primarily, try to stall.They will neither say “yes” nor “no”—on anything. They will evade—in effect,hoping that their inactivity will somehow eliminate the issue. It is not even aconscious decision to wait or temporize—that’s still a decision—but just plainevading, which means giving the issue no thought at all and thus avoiding thenecessity of examining it or even of admitting its existence.The pointless stalling everywhere will be appalling; the kind of shifty-eyed,edgy, uneasy stalling that bursts into inexplicable, resentful, disproportionateanger whenever anyone as much as mentions the issue, let alone asks for adecision. This—everywhere, on any matter, big or little, in business offices andin homes, in professional relations and in love-affairs, in public speeches anddrawing-room conversations. Nobody will make a definite statement. Nobody will“commit himself,” since nobody is sure of anything. Everything is said byindirection, circumlocution, vagueness, a kind of tangled ceremonial emptyverbosity, in which the only thing that is clear is the absence of anythingdefinite having been stated.The one unforgivable sin that makes everyone jumpy, venomous, suspicious, makesthem consider you a dreadful boor of bad manners, is to say anything definitely.It is a crime to be sure that the sun is shining and say so. The preferred formis: “It seems that the sun is shining,” or “I believe the sun is shining,” or“It is generally conceded that two and two make four.” (The theories about“nothing is absolute,” “nothing is certain,” “nothing is real” are enormouslypopular.) It is not any particular statement they dread, but the mere fact of adefinite statement, and of a man being able to make it-because this impliestheir own need to make [such statements].Such a world must be first bewildering, then totally unbearable to anintelligent person—like an insane asylum, which it is. Only, the insane cannotdeal with reality because of their inherent incapacity to do it; these peoplerefuse to deal with it by intention, which may be even more dreadful. (And, ofcourse, everyone is extremely pleasant to everyone else, smilingly blank,because anger is a definite emotion, a definite stand.)When things catch up with the parasite and he can stall no longer, he scramblesto pass the buck and shift the responsibility. The parasite will not make adecision; he will look for someone else to make it, then he will subscribe toit—halfway, cautiously, always leaving himself an out, an “escape clause.” Ifthe decision turns out well, he will take all the credit and be extremely touchyabout minimizing the credit for the man who made the decision. If the decisionturns out badly, he will be the first to turn upon the decider and tear him topieces. This kind of double-crossing, patsy-finding, pushing cat’s paws to pullchestnuts out of fires is a general policy, almost expected and taken forgranted as normal procedure. Imagine the feelings of an honest, honorable personin the midst of this! And all this is done under that vapid blanket of a fixed,empty, mealy-mouthed smile; everybody suspecting, hating, and fearing everybodyelse (as they have to, since the double-cross is the general policy), yet alwaysspeaking softly and shaking each other’s hands limply. It is not the manner ofmy kind of brotherly love or benevolence—but the manner of cowards wearing aprotective coloration in order not to be hurt: a manner that is automatic,emotionless, lifeless.Another form of shifting responsibility—when it is not a matter of shifting itto a person—is the scramble for substitutes for thought, for “automaticthinking,” for guaranteed security without rational judgment or proceduresdecision. This is the miserable reliance on precedent and routine, the copyingand imitating of anything that was or seemed to be successful, the judgment byany irrelevant side-issues, rather than by rational examination of the evidence.The devotion to routine is everywhere: “I’m doing it this way because so-and-sodid it this way successfully in 1910.” Business procedures have come down to anincredible, senseless mess of wasted motion, inconvenience, inefficiency—justbecause it was done that way fifty years ago, and circumstances have changed,but nobody’s taken the initiative to notice it and change proceduresaccordingly.The “judgment by side-issues” is on the pattern of thinking that a movie is goodbecause its particular locale was popular; or because “the theme is timely.”Opinion polls [are used] as substitutes for judgment and as guides for action,on all issues, on the most preposterously inapplicable occasions.Also—the desperate worship of authority (what authority and how “authorities”appear is another matter, to be analyzed later). Once somebody is an“authority,” everything he says or does is right, without questions orexamination, not because it is right, but because he says or does it. It isnever what is said, but who says it. The strict method of judgment by and frompersonality. To discredit an idea, one must discredit the speaker or his motives(the smear technique). The attempt to discredit an idea by examining it istreason against the code of the parasite, a breach of the general method of theparasite’s world. The examination of an idea can’t be done without independentrational judgment.The attempts to substitute mechanical devices for judgment (like machines tostudy audience reactions) are fantastic and extend into the most preposterousspheres. (Like, say, a machine to measure your reactions and tell you whetheryou really love your wife or not.)And the first question asked, before any action, is: “Who has done it that way?”The statement: “It’s never been done before” is pronounced everywhere as thefinal, unanswerable expression of disapproval, the self-evident defeat of theman who made the proposal, the ultimate damnation, in the same way that we wouldsay: “It’s impossible.”The attempts to agree on everything with everyone are sickening. “Why raise anissue?” “Do you have to be disagreeable?” “Do you have to be difficult?” are theconstant phrases. A disagreement, of course, implies the need of taking a stand.It’s easy to think oneself safe, so long as everybody agrees; it must be so,since everybody thinks it is and there are no dissenters; but a dissenter bringsup the possibility that it may not be so, and that brings up the possibilitythat you may have to decide what is so.The contradictions and inconsistencies—in speeches, ideas, policies andactions—are unbelievable. They’d rather contradict themselves all over the placethan face a contradiction; to face it means that one must resolve it, choose,and make a decision. Nobody says today what he said yesterday. Nobody means whathe says—nor says what he means—nor knows what he means when he says it. This, ofcourse, makes all personal relations disgusting. But when this is applied tobusiness matters—the disasters follow. (When they discard the rational faculty,they have to live in and for the moment, without connection to the rest of theirlives; they break the continuity of an identity—since they have no identity. Thepower of reason is the identity.)Nothing and nobody is reliable. There is no way to pin a man down to anythingdefinite, nor to count on him. He has no character—he has no identity, no fixedentity. It is not a world of crooks and dishonesty—crooks have a tangible,definite purpose, robbery, and one could even deal on the basis of that as asolid starting point; it is much worse. It is a world in the exact image of aparasite’s soul—a gray, shapeless fog. A world with a treacherous quicksandunder one’s feet—and no defined outlines, no solid shapes, no fixed entities; aheavy, passive, stagnant fog in which something moves, as if trying to form, butdissolves the moment you attempt to focus on or touch it; a world without focus,blurred, not to be reached, never quite in existence. It is something like thespectacle one would see if one’s power of central, focused vision were gone andonly one’s marginal side-vision was left; one would then be in the awful[position] of knowing that one can’t function or remain that way, it’s anunbearable state, worse than blindness, because one would have to make constantefforts to see clearly, while knowing that it’s impossible.There is only clear attribute of the fog—pain. Suffering. It’s not even aspecific suffering—how can anything be specific in such a fog?—but a pervadingsense of suffering, perhaps more awful for not being defined (if it weredefined, one could perhaps combat it). It is as if one heard screams (or soundsapproximating screams) among the vague, floating shapes, and whenever theseshapes seemed to jell into forms of something for an instant, the forms werethose of open wounds. The Hegelian-Marxist process without an object that doesthe “processing”? There it is.There is never an event of success, achievement, completion, fulfillment, orhappiness in this world. Whenever a definite event emerges from the rottenstagnation, it’s a disaster-a failure, a breakdown, destruction, suffering,disappointment, frustration, misery. This—in business life, in public life, inpersonal life. (Since the parasite functions on the death principle, thepositive events are impossible in his world; only the negative ones, theprogressive steps to final destruction, can be achieved in reality, the realityhe asked for.)In this world’s productive life, nothing is ever done successfully, everythingis botched, halfway, doesn’t quite come off; but the disasters and failures areclear-cut and definite enough; after each, the productive activity falls a stepbelow the previous level; there is no power of recovery. In personal life, theattempts at happiness are dismal failures—forced, unconvincing, unsatisfying, apretense at joy rather than real joy—everything is bloodless, in half-tones, infaded, washed-out, blotched pastels—the love affairs, the marriages, thefriendships. (Emotions proceed from reason—and where there are no firm rationalconvictions, there can be no real emotions; their feelings are an exactcounterpart of their intellectual state, of the content of their minds.)The misery of these people is real enough—but not sharp enough to make themstop, scream, rebel and do something about it; that, too, would be a definiteemotion. It is more like a chronic state of dull pain, almost as if they hadcome to take for granted that pain is man’s normal state of existence.Occasionally, it becomes unbearable; one of them breaks. And the specific eventsor results of their personal relationships are all disastrous, each leaving therelationship worse than it was before.Now, as to their “authorities.” It is, of course, part of the basiccontradiction of the parasite that he must hate the creator and need him at thesame time, that he must destroy the creator and seek him out. So the behavior ofmen in the parasite’s world has both aspects, viciously and ludicrously mixed.First, they try to discard, ignore, hamper, destroy any man of ability and grabhis ideas, his property, his position, his prestige. They sense genuine ability,they fear and resent it, and one way of fighting it is the Toohey method of“enshrining mediocrity”: while they sneer at heroes and heroism, they practice amaudlin, sickening kind of half-abject, half-sneering hero-worship of their ownkind of celebrities, and they eagerly push their mediocrities onto publicaltars, blow nonentities into giants—while proclaiming their resentment of andthe nonexistence of giants. (And don’t we see that today?) They scramble for thespotlight themselves—and also push their own kind into prominence, into theplaces of the destroyed or missing creators.The second stage is when the parasites discover what the positions of thecreators entail. There is a period of bewildered hesitation and uncertainty. Tobe “a great man” means to have to take action, make decisions and bear theresponsibility. This the parasite cannot and will not do; he will run from themere thought of it. So now there comes the period of the ghost-writer, the frontand the patsy. The parasites try to keep their “prestige” and positions, butswitch the work and the actual responsibility to someone else. (My story opensjust before the beginning of this period.) That’s the stage equivalent to theSoviet custom of liquidating factory heads for the failure of a five-year plan,the heads who are placed there for that purpose, who have the responsibility oftrying to produce under impossible conditions, who never get credit for success(the Commissar does) and get executed for failure. (This is precisely what JamesTaggart does with his key employees. There is one concrete, dramatic issue inhuman terms.)The parasites are not concerned with the results, i.e., the actual performanceor production that their high position demands. They are concerned only (andfiercely, hysterically) with faking a performance—in the eyes of others and intheir own eyes. They maneuver themselves into positions and situations where theresponsibility for actual results is not theirs—and they have a plausible alibifor it not being theirs, for their right to put the blame on somebody else, foreven being the injured party (on the “I work so hard—and here’s what people doto me—I can’t help it” pattern).This is what the parasite has always done in the world of creators—but then hepassed the buck to the creators and was able to ride along safely on theirenergy, on their performance and production. But now he passes the buck toanother parasite—and is aghast to find that it won’t work. The parasite merelyrepeats the top parasite’s gesture, passing the buck further down. (But there isnow no man to stop this chain—to take responsibility and action.)When this starts with the head of a firm, it spreads on down, in ever wideningcircles. First, because this is the type of men the parasite would surroundhimself with, particularly in top positions; he’s fired and rejected thecreators long ago, the creators “don’t belong, they’re inharmonious, they’redifficult.” Second, because the lesser employees (who are actually bettermen—honest average men—working under the orders of their inferiors, bewilderedand embittered under the command of presumptuous, pompous phonies) realize whatis expected of them and what is the only way to keep the job they need. They seethat the bosses neither want nor understand an actual performance, but arescrambling with one another for the better position from which to fake aperformance; they realize that if they attempt to do good honest work it wouldmean being tagged with the responsibility for somebody else’s mistake (and thesemistakes are constant, all around them, they see the all-pervading reign of themindless); so they conclude, in excusable self-preservation, that the safe,practical thing to do is not to work, but to fake a show of working and play thegame of passing the buck.(This is excusable for honest average men because they are not creators orinitiators, they cannot go into business, start an enterprise, make a living ontheir own, and they never pretended they could. And it’s not possible in theircollectivized, frozen, regimented world. They are, by nature, only goodemployees, and they have no other place to go; the situation, methods, andpolicy are the same in every enterprise run by the parasites. This is the pointat which average men are forced to discard their best and exist by means oftheir worst—in a society of parasites.)So these lesser employees start passing the buck to still smaller ones, untilonly the office boy is certain of his proper job and is performing it (he has noone smaller to use as a front). Then, in a crisis, it is the office boy who getsblamed for the company’s ten-million-dollar failure—and it’s all proved,explained, alibied, stated in the press, by everybody down the line, in thelanguage of parasites to parasites, in the disgusting, deliberately inexactdouble-talk that passes for convincing argument. (But then, nobody is convincedof anything anyway, one way or the other, and nobody argues; the explanation,too, is only a show.)And don’t we see this today! This is the exploitation of the weak by thestrong—when strength is [based] not on the intellect, but on plain force; theparasites hold their jobs by compulsion or fraud, not by merit.(The pretense of an explanation in this case is only a routine remembered fromthe world of the creators, performed but no longer understood or takenseriously. This is one example of the sickening way in which remnants of arational world still persist in this insane asylum, in the shape of meaninglesshulks, automatic routines gone through for no particular reason, just because noone took the initiative to stop it. It is the letter without the spirit,something like the maintenance of an airport for which there are no longer anyplanes (they do that, too). There must be many examples of this in the story—intheir business and personal lives.)The third stage is when nobody wants a position of responsibility any longer.Nobody wants a top job. The desperate competition is for small jobs, the smallerthe safer; it is a scramble for anonymity in a world aimed at and geared toanonymity, the world without a person, without identity, without individuality.It has now become dangerous to be important, even important only in show, evento be only an inflated windbag or figurehead. They don’t liquidate “thespecialists,” as in Russia, but the public figures; the big-shot figureheads arebeginning to be blamed for the accelerating failures and disasters, for thestate of the world (even if no specific personal responsibility can be pinned onany one of them). The big shots collectively (didn’t they want that?) arebeginning to be tagged with a collective blame, there are cries of: “Somethinghas to be done. ” (Nobody knows what to do—everybody knows that it has to bedone.)There have been a few cases when top parasites got caught in their ownstupidities and criminal negligences, when they weren’t able to wriggle out ofthe responsibility, and were publicly exposed and disgraced, and lost theirfortunes, factories, or positions. This has scared the rest of the topparasites. So now there are gaping vacancies in top jobs; the parasites areafraid to take them, the honest average men won’t take them, because they knowthat the job is hopeless, no honest work can be done in this kind of world,particularly not in any responsible executive position. The rules andregulations, which the parasites erected earlier for their own “protection,” arenow such that no one can untangle them or make a step, or know where hestands—and an honest man cannot accept responsibility when he knows he won’t beleft free to perform the work for which he is responsible. (Nor will he allowhimself to be held responsible for the actions and mistakes of others, whom hecan’t control, who control him; a slave or a robot cannot be responsible.)And, of course, the creators are not there to take these top jobs. (Theywouldn‘t, in these conditions, even without a strike—as we see today. It’sstrange that Soviet Russia has such trouble getting experts and top executives,isn’t it?) At this point in the story there must be some important desertions ofthe few remaining creators to the ranks of the strikers—with disastrous resultsfor the parasites left behind, causing the beginning of the parasites’ panic.The performance of the “authorities” and celebrities begins to be grotesquelyludicrous during this period (which is just a little worse than it is rightnow). Authorities are picked by mere chance and sheer accident. At first, theparasites were pushing themselves and their friends into celebrity [status]; nowthey are afraid of it. So the field of fame is open to anyone and everyone, byblind chance; fame without any cause, achievement, or reason (merely becausepeople have to talk about somebody, so somebody’s got to be a celebrity). Thisis fame by default—and another remnant of a better world, the remnant of theconception of greatness, without content. (Something like the way books becomebest-sellers now, practically without merit, by sheer accident; something’s gotto sell, one is no better and no worse than another, it actually makes nodifference, nobody really cares.)So any adventurer, ambitious empty-headed bitch, or naive second-hander can leap(or stumble accidentally) into the class of celebrity. Then he or she becomes an“authority”—and people grasp avidly at their opinions or advice, for guidance,never questioning what is said or why the celebrity became a celebrity orwhether there is any reason to respect his opinion. The chance remark of almostanybody can convince people that almost anybody else is a reliable authority.Nobody questions who made the first remark nor who started the “authority run.”People really don’t want to question that; it is so much safer to believe thatyou’re dealing with an expert and not to look into his [qualifications] tooclosely; everybody is eager to rest on somebody else’s assertion and to thinkthat the somebody else knew what he was talking about, since no person knowsthat in regard to his own talk. The pattern is: “Why, sure, Joe Blow is thegreatest expert on economics—John Doakes said so and John must have hisreasons—so I don’t have to look into the reasons, it’s perfectly safe to followthe advice of Joe Blow.”This is another example of evasion—and another distorted remnant of a betterworld: the realization that there are such things as experts, that they must beindividuals, not a nameless collective, since any judgment can proceed only froma mind, and an expert is a man with trained, self-confident judgment, who knowsfirst-hand what he is talking about. That much of a form is left in people’sminds, but an empty form, without content, with no realization of whatspecifically constitutes an expert on how to recognize him, so that the publicattitude is a desperate search for a leader, without any understanding of whathe must be or where or how he must lead them. The blind search for a greatindividual in a world that has discarded the concepts of individualism andgreatness. And of the whole crazed herd, the celebrities and authorities are, atthis point, the most frightened ones of all.At this stage, the awful staleness of society is becoming apparent andunbearable to all; this is when they go in for revivals of the past (like thetheater now), because nothing new is being produced.The [fourth] stage is the hysterical compromise, in a growing panic. Theparasite begins to see that his principles won’t work—but he can’t abandon them.He needs the creators—and he can’t admit that he needs them. He can’t do thework, but it’s got to be done—so he wants somebody who’ll do it for him. Heproceeds in his usual twisted, irrational way—his halfway. He wants creatorswithout having to call them creators or give them the conditions they require inorder to function. He wants creators as tools—a contradiction in terms; but hethinks it’s only a matter of finding some who are willing to be tools.He embarks upon a course compounded of flattery and insults, bribery andthreats, incentives and [punishments], all at the same time. He attempts todevelop experts and leaders, but to keep them in check, safely harnessed. Hefosters a kind of “home-grown substitute for creators,” a kind of “ersatzcreators.” He features individuals too much, offers exorbitant rewards (usuallymaterial), names movements and public monuments after them—yet sits guard overthem, fiercely and jealously, to see that the “leader” has the propercollectivist spirit, the proper humility, no independence, not too muchinitiative that could flame into a rebellion; in other words, he wants theperformance of a creator with the soul of a parasite, a timid, cowardly soullike his own, a soul that won’t demand too much nor develop an actual ego. Hewants these alleged creators to function, yet “be kept in their place.” And allthe rewards and incentives he offers are of a blatantly collectivist,second-handed nature (money, titles, public honors)—he could not venture tooffer personal rewards, such as freedom, choice, actual authority andresponsibility.Under these conditions, one can imagine what kind of leaders he gets. Those whoswim to the top now, those boosted into leadership, are the criminal element—thetype of Soviet commissars or G.P.U. agents, the real gangster type, without eventhe saving grace of a neurosis (if that’s a saving grace). These new figures arethe reemergence of the savage, the harbingers and symbols of the finalretrogression. They have no scruples, principles, or anti-individualist complex;they don’t even have a conception of what any of that means; they don’t mindcarrying out the orders of the parasite and they don’t care about his reasons ormotives; they know they are not actually carrying out anyone’s orders—they arethere to loot. They are beasts of prey in the simplest and lowest sense of theword. They are the savages who have no other conception of existence except tograb what they can, where they can, at and for the moment—the exponents of manwithout a mind, trying to exist through naked brute force. [This type isrepresented in the novel by the character of Cuffy Meigs. ]Their relation to the parasite, who is their official boss and who is now merewindow dressing in public top positions of alleged authority, is that of G.P.U.agents to [Communist] Party theoreticians; public strutting and abject fear onthe side of the latter, a silent leering contempt on the side of the former;both know who is doing whose dirty work and who is the real boss. (Or, somewhat,the relation of Toohey and Gus Webb.)And whenever (not often) one of these new leaders turns out to be more naive ora better man than the rest of them, whenever he shows signs of something likereal ability, sincerity or popularity, he is promptly liquidated by theparasite. The vicious paradox of the parasite’s position is that he must destroythe man who could possibly save him, the moment that man shows signs of such apossibility—and he must leave the field clear to those who are [his own] realdestroyers. In an unstated, unadmitted way, the parasite knows this. This is oneof the reasons for his growing hysteria, his panic, and his desperate attemptsto escape from any thought, from facing any facts. (There must be a concreteincident and relationship like that for James Taggart and some of his lastemployees.)Men like these new leaders, with no force to oppose them, would destroy theworld quickly, in any stage, at any time. But when it is attempted to have themrun the remnants of an industrial civilization, the end comes that much quicker.So this stage does not last long. It is merely a period of accelerateddisintegration and destruction.The [fifth] and final stage is the abject surrender to the creators—without anhonest admission or realization of it. The parasite who admits or realizesanything ceases being a parasite. By now, he is not capable of that, if he everwas. But the surrender is there, and the parasite knows it, and his panic atthis stage is sheer running from himself, the screaming panic within. Thesurrender is in the attempts to find Galt, to beg him for help, then to torturehim—torture being the last and only resort of the parasite’s method: bruteforce, man expected to act without mind, with pain as sole impetus andmotivation. This is the climax, the revelation, the parasite showing his trumpcard, the thing he has been holding in reserve all this time, his claim upon theworld-this is the symbol of what he has considered as the source of his right toloot, exploit, rule and devastate the world all these centuries—this is hisbadge, his banner, his essence: torture.And this is the realization that even James Taggart cannot escape, nor bear.This is the meaning of the scene with the priest. The end of James Taggart isthe end of the parasite.156 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_156_r1.jpg]Consider: since the theme is, in a basic way, that the material comes from thespiritual and the collectivists cannot even feed themselves without the mind—itwould be interesting and proper to show the same relationship for sex, as per mynote on the “Pattern of the Parasites.”[AR’s grasp of the relation of sex and economics is evidence of her uniquecapacity for integration; she was expert at identifying the common essence thatunites seemingly different facts or areas. The above integration of sex andeconomics was not only one of the outstanding philosophic achievements in AtlasShrugged—it was also crucial to her development of the plot. After completingthe novel, she remarked in an interview:Rearden, as I first saw him, was the abstraction of the martyred industrialist.He had to be the Atlas who carries the world and receives nothing but torture inpayment. But I saw him only as this abstraction, and I could not get anywherewith the idea. I could not get the center of any kind of plot until I changedthe conception ofRearden.The [above] note about the issue of sex and its relationship to economics wasmade before I had thought of the Rearden-Dagny relationship.... Then one day itsuddenly struck me what type Rearden should be and that the romance betweenRearden and Dagny should be the central plot line. And it’s from that decisionthat the rest of the plot fell into place quite easily. That seemed to tie thewhole story.]157 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_157_r1.jpg]To [work out]:The specific, detailed parallel between the methods of a totalitarian economyexploiting a free one and the personal methods of a parasite toward thecreators.

Or it might be that there is a metaphysical mistakein considering animals as pure matter. There is, scientifically, a most profoundbreak between the living and the non-living. Now life may be the spirit; theanimals may be the forms of spirit and matter, in which matter predominates; manmay be the highest form, the crown and final goal of the universe, the form ofspirit and matter in which the spirit predominates and triumphs. (If there’s anyvalue in “feelings” and “hunches”—God! how I feel that this is true!)If it’s now added that the next step is pure spirit—I would ask, why? Purespirit, with no connection to matter, is inconceivable to our consciousness; andwhat, then, is the sense, purpose or function of matter? That division intospirit and matter as antagonists or opposites, that idea of “setting man freefrom matter,” is untenable, irrational, and vicious (and has led only to man’sagony on earth, to rejection of his joy in living—the highest expression of hisspirit). The unity of spirit and matter seems unbreakable; the pattern of theuniverse, then, would be: matter, as the tool of the spirit, the spirit givingmeaning and purpose to matter. [...]Also to be noted here: the spiritual is the totally individual, since it is aconsciousness and a consciousness is an “I.” (Whether it’s God, man, or ananimal, a universal consciousness or the faintest flicker of it—it’s anindivisible “I.” This is why the Oriental idea of consciousness dissolving intoan impersonal universal spirit is nonsense, irrational, and a contradiction interms. Once the indivisible unity, integrity, continuity of an “I” is broken,there’s no “consciousness” to speak about.)159 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_159_r1.jpg]Men’s intellectual capacities have always been so unequal that to the thinkersthe majority of their brothers have probably always seemed sub human. And somemen may still be, for all the evidence of rationality, or lack of it, that theygive. We may still be in evolution, as a species, and living side by side withsome “missing links.” [...]We do not know to what extent the majority of men are now rational. (They arecertainly far from the perfect rational being, and all the teachings they absorbpush them still farther back to the pre-human stage.) But we do know thatmankind as a whole and each man as an individual has a chance to survive andsucceed only to the degree of their general and individual intelligence. That isall that a rational man can deal with, count on or be concerned with. Let him,without wondering about actual numbers or percentages of intelligence in others,act on the basis of “addressing himself to intelligence” —and he will win. Andhe will find that he does not have to fear stupidity. (Most men now are rationalbeings, even if not too smart; they are not pre-humans incapable of rationalthinking; they can be dealt with only on the basis of free, rational consent.)If it’s asked: what about those who are still pre-human, or near enough to it,and incapable of rationality as a method to guide their lives? What if such doexist among us? The answer is: nothing. Their way of living is not ours; infact, they have no way of living, no method or means of survival—except throughimitating us, who have acquired the human method and means. Leave us to our wayof living, man’s way—freedom, individual independence-and we’ll carry them alongby providing an example and a world of safety and comfort such as they can neverquite grasp, let alone achieve.We do this—but even if we didn‘t, so what? If those creatures incapable ofrational existence are sub-human, are we to sacrifice ourselves or be sacrificedto them? Are we to descend to their level? Are we to make them the goal of ourexistence, and service to them our only purpose? If these pre-humans areincapable of rational thinking and of independence, and therefore they need anenslaved, controlled, regimented, “protective” society in order to survive—wecannot survive in such a society. By definition, we are then two differentspecies. Their requirements are opposite to ours. They’ll perish without us,anyway. But we will not be sacrificed to them. We will live in freedom—whetheror not others will or can live that way. April 27, 1946SPECIFIC INSTANCES OF PARASITE METHODS TO BE DRAMATIZED (FOR JAMES TAGGART, ANDOTHERS LIKE HIM)Overall: the escape from the necessity to make an independent rational judgment.(The escape from decision, from responsibility.)The parasite with a two-cent achievement, who wants to destroy all greatachievements, so that his will be tops (and even his achievement is notauthentic, not original, but a borrowed composite). On a railroad, this would bea man who makes Taggart reject a great improvement, in order to adopt his sillylittle one. (Or it can be Taggart himself.)The parasite who thinks that in order to get a top job he only has to destroythe creator holding it. He succeeds—and merely destroys the job. This can beTaggart himself—if he got his position not through inheritance, but special pull(against Dagny), such as government pressure. (His share of inheritance did notentitle him to be president of the company; he forced his way into that.) Ifnot, then it must be a specific, important case of a parasite who thus destroysa business needed by TT. It is also Taggart forcing a competing, rising newrailroad company (which is only a branch so far) out of business throughpolitical means—then finding that passengers won’t use his substitute, he hasmerely destroyed the market, and it has cost him more than he could afford (thusweakening TT).This is also a number of lesser parasites: a critic who forces his way into theplace of an honorable one—and finds that people no longer pay attention toreviews. The pseudo-philosopher, who takes the place of the philosopher onstrike—and sees his classes shrinking, people losing interest in philosophy, andwonders why it is that he can’t be “an influence,” as the other man was. Theno-melody composer, who takes the place of Gerhardt—and wonders why people don’tgo to concerts any more, why records of old classics are so popular. Thegirl-writer’s publishers—who see the public reading fewer and fewer books. Theautomobile manufacturer who sees the public going back to horse-buggies. (Thispoint is eloquent and important, so it can be used in many typical instances,some in detail, some just indicated, as small “bits.”)The parasites who try to “protect” themselves by restricting and destroyingcompetition (by stopping others). [Hence, the] unions with their rules for theperformance of useless duties, and quotas of admission, to keep their professionlimited. Also, James Taggart and other businessmen like him ganging up on anewcomer in their line, to drive him out (and then TT needs the product he wasmanufacturing—and the whole damn gang can’t deliver it).James Taggart, in his quest for superiority, goes to great lengths to beat somecreator, instead of performing some needed achievement of his own. (This mightbe the railroad which he destroys.)In his personal relations, the more Taggart gets, the less satisfied he is andthe more he demands.Taggart gives orders for the sheer sake of being obeyed (sometimes even knowingthat the order is preposterous—that is why he wants to force an abler man toobey it), and he causes untold damage to TT that way. Dagny is fighting thatconstantly.[Regarding] Taggart’s desire to “influence others”: he gives advice to somehelpless person (perhaps a poor girl he’s trying to have a “romance” with),finds that the advice is wrong and detrimental to her—and insists that she carryit out, just because it’s his advice and he wants to see his influence realized.The actual result of his advice means nothing to him. (Here is the parasite’sunreality: the girl asked him to save her, instead he’s destroyed her, but heconsiders that beside the point; she took his advice, doesn’t that make himgreat and powerful?)Taggart’s nagging jealousy and his insistence on beingfirst in the affections ofany woman or friend is sickening and becomes unbearable even to the weaklingswhom he picks for affection.Taggart is always surrounded by inferiors—a kind of personal court of fawningmoochers. When he brings them into his business (forcing them on TT in themanner of and for exactly the same motive as Caligula and his horse) the resultsare disastrous. This may be one important incident in the contest betweenTaggart and Winslow: Taggart forces an offensive mediocrity into the position ofWinslow’s boss.Taggart steals someone’s invention or idea for TT—then tries to destroy thecreator, in order to take the credit (like the designers who steal from Adrian).Taggart is extremely “touchy” about his “feelings.” He believes [subconsciously]that all he has to do is want something and he should get it; if he doesn‘t,then he hates the universe. It never occurs to him that before you can wantanything, you must have defined standards, purposes, and reasons; that is,desires proceed from the rational faculty and, therefore, will be (and must be)based on reality. The rational man will not want the impossible, the undefined,the self-contradictory; nor will he merely sit and want something, but will knowclearly what he wants and how to get it, and will act to get it. But Taggart’sattitude is a chronic damning of the universe, because he just wants and nothinghappens.Taggart’s hatred for the creators is an all-pervading theme-song in his actions.The immediate objects of it are Dagny, Rearden, Winslow. (And in the background,there is always his dread of John Gait.)An incident when Taggart, after having eliminated a better competitor, stunsDagny by declaring (she forces this out of him) that he has no desire to improveTT or to make more money now. He wanted to run three trains a day when hiscompetitor ran two, and he wanted to make two million dollars to thecompetitor’s one. But now he is perfectly satisfied to run just one train a dayand to make just half a million. It’s not the fact that counts, not the actual,objective value—but the relation of beating that other man. (This is toward theend of the story, and Dagny begins to realize the horror of a parasite’s nature;she sees a faint hint of an explanation for what’s wrong with the world—and shebegins to hate her brother.)Taggart is forever engaged in forming “collaborations,” “cooperatives,”“agreements,” gangs and cliques—and forever running to Washington to have lawspassed for “protection.” Toward the end, he no longer has any clear sense ofwhat it is that he must be protected from, and his efforts have no practicalmeaning at all, they are like the convulsions of an animal getting more and moretangled in the thread he has unraveled.Taggart hates any success or happiness, even of those unrelated to him.Incidents when he double-crosses friends or protégés, just because they seemedhappy or had succeeded in something.Taggart will always sneer and make disparaging remarks whenever anyone ispraised in his presence--even if it’s only some professor of botany or someprize-cattle farmer. (He likes all the “debunking” biographies, the news andgossip about “feet of clay.”)Taggart’s envy—of everything and everyone—is constant, ever-present, andmotivates most of his actions.Taggart loves to talk about and gloat over any misfortune.Taggart hates Dagny and needs her. He wants to destroy her and to get all he canout of her. One way of doing this is to try to ruin her personal life, make herunhappy, yet permit her to function in business, even hoping that this wouldmake her function better. This is what Taggart does in relation to Stan Winslow.Taggart’s dependence on the material (like the big, luxurious home) reflects hiscrazy half-notion that his spiritual greatness will come from that. Yet he isextremely stupid about spending money on luxuries (flat, no imagination) and hegets no pleasure from it.There must also be one of the parasites who will start poor, make a PeterKeating kind of career, and go to pieces when he reaches the top, when he seesthat money does not give him what he wanted.Examples of parasites who don’t want to make but to “take over.”Taggart always talks about “striving being better than achievement” and “andman’s reach should exceed his grasp,” etc.Examples of collectivists that are inordinately concerned with material wealth,and of creators that are calmly indifferent about it—not really indifferent, butself-confident.Important incident (near the end of the story) showing James Taggart’s abjectterror of some of his own gangsters.April 28, 1946Note for Galt, while he is being tortured:He tells them that torture is the only weapon they have—and this is limited byhis own will to live. “You can get away with it only so long as I have somedesire of my own to remain alive, for the sake of which I will accept yourterms. What if I haven’t? What if I tell you that I wish to live in my own kindof world, on my own terms—or not at all? This is how you have exploited andtortured us for centuries. Not through your power—but through ours. Through ourown magnificent will to live, which you lack, the will that was great enough tocarry on, even through torture and in chains. Now we refuse you that tool—thatpower of life, and of loving life, within us. The day we understand this—you’refinished. Where are your weapons now? Go ahead. Turn on the electric current.”(The electric current was invented by one of the creators—and this is the useparasites put it to, when the creators give it to them.)160 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_160_r1.jpg]Even in Dagny’s suffering there is a sense of beauty, strength, and hope. Evenin Taggart’s joys there is a sense of guilt, shame, and disgust.Important: dramatize the connection between joy in living and the rationalfaculty. The reason is clear: the basic sense of joy in living [arises from] thefirm realization and conviction that you have the means to satisfy your desires,to achieve joy. Joy is the emotional reaction to a satisfied desire. Reason“produces” the desire and the means to achieve it; joy is the “consumption” ofthis production. The parasite, who has discarded reason as impotent in hisdesire to escape reality, is left with the unadmitted, but implicit, conclusionthat he has no means to achieve joy—hence his chronic sense of frustration andmisery. This primary joy in living is present and shown in all the strikers, butmost eloquently in John Galt and Dagny.161 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_161_r1.jpg]For the “reversed process of expansion”: just as Henry Ford opened the way(created the chance) for scores of new industries, James Taggart kills thechances of any attempted endeavor that comes in contact with his business. Showlesser, but potentially important, inventions that are killed through hisrejection, and more important, through his retrenchment of the particular linewhere they would be useful. Example: somebody suggests lunch cars on trains;somebody else has a gadget that would make quick, compact lunches possible andcould have many uses besides those on trains, could grow into a valuableindustry; Taggart declares that there’s no reason to give the passengers quicklunches, let them carry lunch boxes, they have no other means of transportation,they’ll ride on floors in boxcars if necessary, why should he give them lunches?The gadget and the unborn industry are killed. (This example is not necessarilythe one to use, but this is the pattern.)In clear connection with that, show the method of Hank Rearden, who expandseverything he touches (and gets penalized for it in the parasite’s world), and[perhaps] have flashbacks to the career of Taggart’s great-great-grandfather,founder of TT, who functioned like Henry Ford. Show the spreading creativenessof the creators-and the contracting destructiveness of the parasites.Show instances of the irrational state of the world in retrogression. Progressproceeds logically and new industries grow when and as they are needed, butthere can be no logical retrogression. The economy in the parasite’s worldpresents all the senselessness of destruction: [the attempt to maintain]difficult, complex industries, while primary necessities are gone. They’remanufacturing—with difficulty and at incredible cost—a few botched tractors ayear, when the farmers have no simple plows. They manufacture double-deckobservation cars, and have no passenger coaches. There are (botched) televisionsets for the officials—and no safety pins for the public. It is the spectacle ofan erratic, unnatural, irrational shrinking; the signs of the break up, ofretrogression. For man, retrogression can only be unnatural; it has to beirrational, because where reason is in control, there is expansion and progress.Show an instance of penalizing ability: early in the story, Taggart rejects anable employee (the young engineer?) for reasons such as: “He’s too good—toobrilliant—which will make it difficult for the other employees—there will be noharmony, no balance—we’ll do better with a lesser, milder man who’ll fit in.”Then show the specific results: what the brilliant one would have done, and whatthe “milder” one does (and the consequences for TT). (In connection with theTunnel catastrophe.)Show an instance of an employee (of medium importance) forced to act on hisworst, not his best (toward the end of the second stage)—with results disastrousto TT. This, in a higher, more complex sense, also applies as a main line forStan Winslow.Show specific, repeated instances when the honest average men (particularly inthe later stages) run to the “thinkers” of the period (the pseudo-philosopher,the pseudo-critic, etc.) for spiritual guidance in their growing bewildermentand despair. What they actually need is the basic, profoundly philosophicaladvice which the thinkers who are on strike could have given them; the advicethey get only pushes them into the general horror.In each instance of creators working with the parasites, show where and how thecreators contribute to their own destruction (like Dietrich Gerhardt). Thepattern is that of Soviet Russia stealing foreign ideas and inventions, hiringforeign engineers and experts, repudiating loans and debts. The free enterprisesmust not deal with anyone except free enterprises, otherwise they are workingfor their own destruction. This means: you cannot work against your ownprinciples, there is no “middle road” or compromise here; if you do, you’ll payfor it. Principles are absolute. And, applied to the creators on strike: youcannot compromise or work against the basic life principles of the creators. April 29, 1946NOTES FOR TOMORROW (FOR DETAILED THINKING OUT):A society of parasites is like a body with hemophilia: the slightest cut can befatal and lead to bleeding to death; the slightest error, failure of routine, ornew circumstance can destroy a whole industry (or society)—there is no power ofrecovery in the body, no thinking mind.162 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_162_r1.jpg]Pat is an example of the penalizing of ability. The conservatives actuallyreject her for being too good; they prefer [Edgar] Queeny, who is “milder,”i.e., less good. Their purpose is to save capitalism. Their result is to[further] the spread of collectivism.163 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_163_r1.jpg]Earle Balch [Isabel Paterson’s publisher] is an example of the average man whocould be good, efficient and productive in a society of creators, but not in asociety of parasites. The reasons? Either his disgust, or discouragement, orgiving in. Either he’s not good, strong and brave enough to buck a society ofparasites, or else he swims with the current and delivers just what the societyaround him requires. This is an example of how a society of producers brings outthe best in the average man by rewarding him for his best—while a society ofparasites brings out the worst in him by penalizing his best and rewarding hisworst. One rewards him for producing, the other for faking. How long can asociety go on in that last way? (This is an important point.)164 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_164_r1.jpg]The average man doesn’t have the strength to do what is right at any cost,against all men. Only the genius can do that. The genius clears the way for theaverage man. But when the genius goes, the best in the average man goes withhim. (John Galt and Stan Winslow?) [This is AR’s last reference to the characterof Stan Winslow.]The general pattern of the crack-up is this: first, the ground is cut from underall men and all professions; i.e., the primary base—the metaphysical,philosophical, moral, political premises—are undercut. These are discovered,formulated, stated and defended by the thinkers, the geniuses, the creators.They are the necessary first premises for all men, before they can even begin tolive and work properly as men. These are destroyed—and the thinkers, who couldfight the destruction, do nothing about it, they let their work be destroyed,they offer no other [premises] and no resistance. In the place of the thinkers,there appear the Marxists, the Fadimans [Clifton Fadiman was book editor of TheNew Yorker], and such others. Instead of [reason], individualism, and capitalismmen get mysticism, determinism, altruism, and collectivism.The average man is stopped and destroyed right there. He cannot correct thepremises himself—and the genius won’t help him. Therefore, the spiritual life ofmankind becomes a hopeless, joyless, purposeless, senseless, cynical muddle ofbewilderment and helplessness. From then on, [economic events] follow suit; thematerial is the expression and consequence of the spiritual. [This continues]until men can no longer maintain their material existence, i.e., can no longerfeed themselves. (And the average man becomes the helpless prey of anyparasite—only the genius and the proper principles could protect his humanrights, his status as a man.)In the material realm, the crack-up will embrace the whole [society], everyactivity. It is only a matter of selecting the key points, of illustrating themost important, the most eloquent, the most representative aspects of it (andshowing it progressively, in logical sequence, in order of importance).165 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_165_r1.jpg]Here’s what I say to the parasites, in effect: “You miserable little bastards!You can’t conceive of or value our scale of living—but you think you can get itsadvantages without its essence, by enslaving and destroying us. You think youcan enjoy our advantages on your level. All right. Try it.”166 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_166_r1.jpg]When a man destroys a competitor and takes his place, he does not get the placebut merely destroys the market. For instance: if a bad writer destroyed all goodwriters, he would not get their public and market; people would stop readingbooks. The manufacturer of a bad car, destroying the better manufacturers, wouldstop people from using cars. (All the parasite can count on is the interimperiod of disintegration, while people struggle with his bad product, then giveup.) This process can be seen now very eloquently in book publishing, thetheater and movies. People do not take the trash: they merely stop reading newbooks, or going to the theaters. April 30, 1946Note on the basic theme: The basic process of a man’s life goes like this: histhinking determines his desires, his desires determine his actions. (Thinking,of course, is present all along the line, at every step and stage. His desiresare a combination of thought and emotion (the “production” and the “consumption”sides being involved), and all his emotions are determined by his thinking, mostparticularly by his basic premises.)So the process is: the right thinking creates the right desires, which createthe proper activity. One of the aspects of man’s activity must be materialproduction, in order to feed himself and exist. Feeding himself, the economicactivity, is just one of the aspects of the fact that he has to give a physicalexpression or form to his spiritual aims, desires, and needs. This is the basicpattern, or “circle,” of man’s life on earth: the spirit (thought) through thematerial activity (production) to the satisfaction of his spiritual desires(emotions). (He must eat in order to think, but he must first think in order toeat.)The wrong thinking leads to the wrong desires, which lead to the wrongactivity—and a wrong activity means that man functions improperly in thematerial realm of production and cannot even feed himself. A spiritual error(wrong thinking) makes it impossible for him to handle the physical world or topreserve his body.Now, on the general scale of mankind as a whole, here is how the pattern isrepeated: the right philosophy leads to the right ethics, which lead to theright politics, which lead to the right economics. The wrong philosophy createsthe wrong ethics, which create the wrong politics, which create the wrongeconomics (they stop production dead).Therefore, here is what men must be told: if, through improper thinking due toinadequate mental [capacity], you start down the wrong way—you need thecreators, the best minds, to correct your errors and show you the right way. If,through inability to do any basic thinking at all, you find yourselves open toscoundrels and parasites who push you toward destruction—you need the creatorsto save you and show you the right way. If you are one of the scoundrels, thosewho consciously devise systems of thought as tools of exploitation, you stillneed the creators. By the nature of your own systems, you can exist only so longas the creators are still there to be fought and looted. The day of your victorywill be the day of your own destruction.PATTERN FOR JAMES TAGGART AND TT (FOLLOWING THE GENERAL “PATTERN OFDISINTEGRATION ”)First stage. An issue at TT in which James Taggart stalls, then hides behindDagny and another executive, leaving the two decisions to them (particularlyobjecting to Dagny’s decision). Taggart’s stalling (and timidity, playing-safe)hampers both lines of endeavor. Dagny wins, the executive fails. Taggart takescredit for Dagny’s achievement, and fires the executive, ruining him. Theachievement comes out half-botched, due to the interference.Second stage. An issue at TT in which James Taggart discovers the responsibilityof being a “great man.” He makes an arbitrary decision, then creates adeliberate victim to ruin (“just in case”), and also leans on one of his petparasites. The new executive, the victim, is in a position where he has to say“yes” to Taggart. But it doesn’t work, the buck passing spreads to the bottom.The issue ends in a real disaster (the first major one). Taggart wriggles out ofit, ruining the chosen victim and some very minor employee (almost theequivalent of an office boy).Third stage. TT can’t get top executives. Lesser disasters are accelerating,like a fabric cracking to pieces. Taggart depends on his suppliers, instead ofvice versa. (The dependence on dependents.) An issue at TT in which Taggart’sbest friend in a contributing business (one of the top parasites, one of thesesuppliers) gets caught in criminal negligence, is publicly exposed and ruined.His crash is a bad blow to TT. (Here Taggart runs his business for the sake ofhis suppliers—like a publisher who would publish “for critics.”)Fourth stage. Taggart brings in a “criminal type” executive to TT. An issue inwhich the executive aims at nothing but personal looting (blatantly andcynically double-crossing TT). Taggart knows it—and can’t fire him.Fifth stage. The issue which destroys TT. May 3, 1946IDEAS FROM RESEARCH:If possible, tie Galt to transportation work, i.e., transportation science.(Ragnar Danneskjöld owns a plane designed by Galt, handmade in the valley. Itsdesign attracts Dagny’s attention; this is one of the reasons she followsDanneskjöld. The plane could even be called the John Galt. The engine could beone that would be extremely valuable if applied to railroad use.) [This is thefirst mention of Galt inventing a new type of motor.]For Dagny’s childhood: she tells Eddie Willers that the rail lines vanishing atthe horizon are held in a man’s hand, like reins; they come from one man’s hand.What man? She doesn’t know. No, not her father, not any big man in the office.Someday she wants to meet that man. How will she recognize him? She will.Use the grass growing between the tracks as a sign of disintegration.The progressive neglect of maintenance work, the relaxation of vigilance, causesminor defects that lead to major disasters. Here we see James Taggart’s (and allthe parasites‘) psychology of living in and for the moment, like a savage or ananimal; he is incapable of long-range planning, foresight or continuity, just ashe is incapable of integration as a person.A major flood (like the 1938 one) can be used—only the railroad affected doesnot recover, and neither do the communities it served. There is no power ofrecovery in that society.The examples of following routine and precedent with disastrous results—sinceevery particular problem on a railroad is new and different, to be solved on thebasis of the particular, specific case.[Show] a section of the country killed off when TT closes a branch of theirnetwork. Just as new railroads created new sections, brought prosperity tosemi-deserted, barren stretches of primitive wilderness—so now we see thereverse process, the failure and shrinking of railroads kills whole sections,creates abandoned ghost-towns, ghost-ranches, ghost-mines, and forces thehandful of remaining inhabitants in such areas back into primitive subsistence,poverty, hard [manual] labor—back to savagery, but a desolate savagery, withouthope. There are such dying sections (“blighted areas”) when the story opens;they are taken for granted—they have been spreading slowly for years. They arethe first creepers of the advancing jungle. But there must also be a specificplot sequence showing the destruction of such a section-through the railroadfailures traceable to James Taggart (this will be one of the turning points ofTT’s disintegration). May 4, 1946PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES ON THE CREATIVE PROCESSThe creative process is, in a way, the reverse of the learning process. It’s theother part of the circle [that goes] from the concrete to the abstract to theconcrete. Abstractions are derived from the concrete—and then applied to theconcrete in order to achieve one’s own purpose. The process of learning has asits purpose to acquire knowledge. The process of creation is the process ofapplying one’s knowledge to whatever purpose one wishes to achieve. Knowledgeprecedes creation; without knowledge of some sort (no matter how general) onecan’t choose and set the purpose one wishes to accomplish. So the first, basicpurpose (a kind of first sub-purpose) preceding every other specific purpose isthe purpose of gaining knowledge. (Before you decide to create, you must knowwhat you want to create and how you must [proceed] in order to create it.)One may stop at the purpose of acquiring knowledge; theoretical scientists andphilosophers do. But it seems to me (I have no clear definitions here as yet)that the complete cycle of a man’s life includes the application of hisknowledge to his particular goal. Knowledge per se is the base of allactivities; it seems to be only a part of a completed cycle. Yes, the functionof the theoretical scientist and the abstract philosopher are more crucially,basically important than that of the applied scientist (inventor) or thepractical moralist; these latter men rest their achievements on those of theformer (and if one man combines both functions, the one of discovering newknowledge precedes that of applying it). But one cannot quite say that thediscovery of new knowledge is more important than the application of existingknowledge; “important” here would imply the question: “Important to whom?” andinvolves a question of values.Nor can one say that a theoretical scientist is necessarily a man of greaterability than the applied scientist; both functions require a process of new,original thought. One can say only that for any given step in the discovery ofnew knowledge and its use, the discovery precedes the use; the correct theoryprecedes the practical application. And also, one can say that the theoreticalscientist or the philosopher perform the most obviously first-hand act ofthinking, of rational deduction—drawing, from concrete experience, a newabstraction, the statement of new knowledge, never drawn by any other personbefore.Still, it seems to me—no matter what great, original first-hand effort ofthought is required in these functions—that theoretical science or abstractphilosophy are “unfinished” spheres of human endeavor. (I said “it seems to me”:I may be wrong; this requires more thought and the most careful definitions.)The complete sphere must lead to man. It’s another completed cycle: from man toabstract knowledge to the satisfaction of man’s purposes and desires. Man’sessential nature is that of creator—within the reality of an objective universe;before he can act or create, he must study this universe (this is the process ofacquiring knowledge); then, he uses his knowledge to set his purpose and toachieve it (this is the process of creation).In my own case, I seem to be both a theoretical philosopher and a fictionwriter. But it is the last that interests me most; the first is only the meansto the last; the absolutely necessary means, but only the means; the fictionstory is the end. Without an understanding and statement of the rightphilosophical principle, I cannot create the right story; but the discovery ofthe principle interests me only as the discovery of the proper knowledge to beused for my life purpose, and my life purpose is the creation of the kind ofworld (people and events) that I like, i.e., that represents human perfection.Philosophical knowledge is necessary in order to define human perfection, but Ido not care to stop at the definition; I want to use it, to apply it in my work(in my personal life, too—but the core, center and purpose of my personal life,of my whole life, is my work).This is why, I think, the idea of writing a philosophical non-nction book boredme; in such a book, the purpose would actually be to teach others, to present myideas to them. In a book of fiction the purpose is to create, for myself, thekind of world I want and to live in it while I am creating it; then, as asecondary consequence, to let others enjoy this world, and to the extent that,they can.It may be said that the first purpose of a philosophical book is theclarification or statement of your new knowledge to and for yourself; and then,as a secondary step, the offering of your knowledge to others. But here is thedifference, as far as I am concerned: I have to acquire and state to myself thenew philosophical knowledge or principle I use in order to write a fiction storyas its embodiment and illustration; I do not care to write a story with a theme[based on] someone else’s philosophy (because those philosophies are wrong); tothis extent, I am an abstract philosopher. I want to present the perfect man andhis perfect life—and I must also discover my own philosophical statement anddefinition of this perfection. But when and if I have discovered such newknowledge, I am not interested in stating it in its abstract, general form,i.e., as knowledge; I am interested in applying it, i.e., in stating it in theconcrete form of men and events, in the form of a fiction story. This last is myfinal purpose, my end; the philosophical knowledge or discovery is only themeans to it. (I state the knowledge to myself, anyway; but I choose the finalform of it, the expression, in the completed cycle that leads back to man.)I wonder to what extent I represent a peculiar phenomenon in this respect; Ithink I represent the proper integration of a complete human being. Anyway, thisshould be my lead for the character of John Galt; he, too, is a combination ofan abstract philosopher and a practical inventor; the thinker and the man ofaction, together.Now, back to the process of creation. In learning, we draw an abstraction fromconcrete objects and events. In creating, we make our own concrete objects andevents out of the abstraction; we bring the abstraction down and back to itsspecific meaning, to the concrete; but the abstraction has helped us to make thekind of concrete we want. It has helped us to create—to re-shape the world as wewish it to be for our purposes.Example: I draw the abstraction “individualism” from observing men, their life,society, the universe. I translate that abstraction into a concrete figure, aspecific man: Roark. [I do this by] a complex process of making abstractionsconcrete in details, characteristics, attributes, events; in each step and inthe total result the essential process is the same: from the concrete to anabstract principle to the kind of concrete reality I want.Thinking, i.e., the rational process, is involved in both functions: in theactivity of acquiring knowledge (getting the abstractions) and in the activityof creating (translating the abstraction back into the concrete).The same principle (or completed cycle) applies to all of man’s activities, notonly the specifically creative ones such as art or invention. (I wonder whetherthis is the point where there is an indication that every activity of man iscreative, in basic principle and essence. This is to be thought out further.) Inorder to think at all, man must be able to perform this cycle: he must know howto see an abstraction in the concrete and the concrete in an abstraction, andalways relate one to the other. He must be able to derive an abstraction fromthe concrete (either by his own new discovery, or by knowledge presented to himby others but rationally understood and accepted by him), then be able to applythis abstraction both as a guide for his specific actions and as a standard bywhich to judge the specific ideas or actions of others.Example: a man who has understood and accepted the abstract principle ofunalienable individual rights cannot then go about advocating compulsory laborconscription or nationalization of property. Those who do have not performedeither part of the cycle: neither the abstraction nor the translating of theabstraction into the concrete. The cycle is unbreakable; no part of it can be ofany use, until and unless the cycle is completed (that is, clear in a man’smind, in his rational grasp). (A broken electric circuit does not function inthe separate parts; it must be unbroken or there is no current; the parts, inthis case, are of no use whatever, of no relevance to the matter of having anelectric current.) This is the basic pattern and essence of the process ofthinking.Now, in the basic pattern of man’s life as a whole, there might be theindication of a similar cycle: man must think, first and above all, but he mustalso act. (Keep in mind here that thinking is the base and constantaccompaniment or determinant of all action.) By action—in this basic sense—Imean the setting of one’s purpose (that’s the creation of one’s desire) and thenthe achievement of that purpose (and the satisfaction of that desire). Atheoretical scientist (or a philosopher) thinks; his purpose is the gaining ofknowledge; when he discovers a new answer, a new step in knowledge, he hasachieved his purpose. But the process of gaining knowledge underlies all otheractivities; so I wonder about the [possibility that] the purely abstract thinkeris actually incomplete (since there is no abstract without the concrete, and noconcrete (for man) without the abstract).Incidentally, as an observation: if creative fiction writing is a process oftranslating an abstraction into the concrete, there are three possible grades ofsuch writing: translating an old abstraction (known theme) through the medium ofold fiction means, i.e., through characters, events, or situations used beforefor that same purpose (this is most of the popular trash); translating an oldabstraction through new, original fiction means (this is most of the goodliterature); or creating a new, original abstraction and translating it throughnew, original means. This last, as far as I know, is only me—my kind of fictionwriting. May God forgive me (metaphor!) if this is mistaken conceit! As near asI can now see it, it isn’t. (A fourth possibility—translating a new abstractionthrough old means—is impossible; if the abstraction is new, there can be nomeans used by anyone else before to translate it.)"},{"pageContent":"12FINAL PREPARATIONSAfter the notes presented in Chapter II, AR took a six-week break from writingin her journal. She spent much of the time that spring thinking about the plotwhile strolling the grounds of her ranch home in California. The present chaptercontains the notes she wrote in the summer of 1946, after this break and beforebeginning to write the novel.AR had thus worked full-time on Atlas Shrugged for only five months (Aprilthrough August, 1946) when she completed her outline and was ready to startwriting. This is a remarkably short time; the corresponding period for TheFountainhead was two and a half years. There are two main reasons for thedifference. First, less research was required—the knowledge of railroads andsteel mills needed for Atlas Shrugged was much less extensive than the knowledgeof architecture needed for The Fountainhead. Second, she had far less difficultyin working out the plot.More than 80 percent of her notes from the summer of 1946 are presented here. Ihave omitted some research notes in which she simply copied factual materialfrom a book, Economic Geography, by R. H. Whitbeck and V. C. Finch. I have alsoomitted a plot outline of the last part of the novel, which merely summarizesevents described in earlier notes. Finally, I have omitted several pages of“Notes on Notes,” in which AR catalogued the contents of her journal. June 20, 1946As the story progresses, the parasites are increasingly concerned with andafraid of natural phenomena and disasters. This is extremely significant andlogical—they have lost control over nature. They are returning to the state ofbeing helpless before nature. But man cannot exist at the mercy of nature—hisbasic essence (his “means of survival”) is the fact that he must exist bymastering nature, by controlling it for his purposes.It was the accumulation of the creators’ work that gave mankind protection fromnature. (This point is an illustration of: “The creator’s concern is theconquest of nature.” The creator is concerned with nature and reason—his ownwill, thinking, actions, and purposes—not with men.) When mankind destroys orrejects the creators, when the parasites are in the saddle (those unable to usetheir independent rational judgment, therefore unable to deal with facts ornature), nature takes over once more and becomes an enemy, a menace, instead ofa servant. And the world of the parasites has no means of defense. When man isfree—man is the master and nature is his servant. When men are enslaved—naturebecomes the master.Examples: every variation in natural phenomena and every possible disaster isdreaded, progressively more dreaded throughout the story—and the consequencesare worse each time. The creators’ civilization had been making menprogressively more independent of variations in natural phenomena, preparedagainst and able to deal with any eventuality. In agriculture, many variableconditions of nature were corrected artificially (fertilizer, irrigation, etc.)and it would take a major and rare disaster (such as extreme drought) to causereal hardships to men (and mankind was moving slowly to counteract even themajor natural disasters). In transportation, men could travel and run trains inalmost any weather, short of a flood or tornado. In their cities and buildings,men did not have to be concerned with natural variations at all—only in extreme,freak disasters, and then to a limited degree. And when an unusual disaster didstrike—men recovered quickly (and the more quickly the more advanced theircivilization). (Examples: the rebuilding of a railroad within a few days after aflood; the rebuilding of San Francisco after the earthquake.)Now, in the story, men are returning to fear of and dependence on nature. Theirfood (agriculture) depends more and more upon weather conditions. Show signs ofthe return to savage superstitions—prayers and rites, instead of rationalaction, science, and invention—a sign of sheer despair and helplessness. When amajor disaster strikes (flood, earthquake, tornado, etc.) there is no recovery;the town or railroad line or factory has to be abandoned (always“temporarily”—but men begin to see that such “temporary” conditions arepermanent). Therefore we see the return of the constant, cringing dread ofnatural disasters.(In connection with this—the Taggart Bridge.)This is the process of “the encroaching jungle”—the signs of the return tosavagery in material life, since men have returned to the principles of savageryin their spiritual life.167 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_167_r1.jpg]An interesting point to make is the parasite’s misunderstanding of the machine.Unthinking men ([including] any second-hander, parasite or collectivist, sincethey are the men who have rejected, suspended, or left undiscovered the conceptof independent rational judgment) see a machine performing many tasksautomatically, with perfect logic, which eliminates the need for the machine’soperator to think (in certain specific respects only). They then imagine thatthe machine is a mechanical, automatic substitute for thought; that the productof reason is a substitute for its source, that it can be preserved and usedwithout its source, and that all one has to do is take over that product; thenthe unthinking man will become the equivalent of the thinker. (He will not needthe thinker any longer, in fact, he must destroy the thinker in order to seizethis substitute, the thinker’s product, the machine, which will then make him asgood as the thinker.) That is the crucial mistake of the collectivists. Showthat only intelligence can deal with automatic aids to intelligence. (They areonly aids, not substitutes.) The greater the intelligence and ingenuity thatwent into the creation of a machine, the greater is the intelligence required tokeep that machine functioning. Destroy the intelligence—and you will not be ableto operate or keep the machine. Destroy the source—and you cannot keep itsresult. Destroy the cause—and you cannot have the effect.In society as a whole, the machines are not independent entities, finished andcut off from their creators, which will continue functioning by themselves. Themachines are products of the creator’s energy, which are kept alive, keptfunctioning by a continuous flow of that energy (or intelligence); that energyis the spiritual fuel which the machines need in order to work, just as theyneed physical fuel; cut off the energy (the intelligence, the capacity ofindependent rational judgment) of the creators—and the machines stop dead; themachines will fall apart and disintegrate in the hands of the parasites, justlike a dead body without the energy of life. The machines are extensions ofman’s intelligence; they are aids to intelligence; when that which they werecreated to aid is gone, they are useless. Then they go, too. They cannotfunction on their own. They are not independent of intelligence.It is only the presence of creators that permits a fool to use a machine he doesnot understand and could not make, creators whose intelligence is free to keepthe machines (and the whole world) going for everybody. The creators are theeternal motor, the continuously functioning “fountainhead.” When the parasitesstop them—everything stops. (And the parasites destroy themselves.)This is important. Be sure to bring it out.In relation to the story, this is the basic reason and pattern of TT’sdisintegration.To use any machine—an automobile, a Mixmaster, or a railroad system—one mustknow how to use it and for what purpose. The machine will not give you theknowledge or the purpose. The machine is a wonderful slave to take orders. Butit cannot give you the orders. The collectivist, like the savage, expects themachine to give him orders and set a purpose for him, a purpose for its ownfunction and for his. (Another collectivist reversal.)James Taggart knows neither how to run a railroad nor for what purpose it shouldbe run. He thinks—“for the public good.” But the purpose of the railroad is not“the public good.” When the railroad (or any machine) stops serving thespecific, individual good (or purpose) of any man connected with it (of thosewho run it and those who use it), it stops having any purpose at all; whenthere’s no purpose or end, there is no way to determine what means to use toachieve it; there is then no standard of means at all, therefore one can’t knowwhat to do even at short range (the parasite’s range), even at any one givenmoment (the given moment must be determined by the long-range purpose, by theend, by its relation to the whole). Therefore, the whole system (or machine)stops.Stress this “purposelessness ” in the progressive steps of TT’s destruction.168 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_168_r1.jpg]A sidelight on the parasite’s methods:Holding the productive ability of the creator down to the level of the parasite;the holding down of the strongest to the level of the weakest. Such as: unionrules to the effect that better workers must not work faster or produce morethan incompetent or weaker workers (“unfair competition”); the barber’s unionthat forbade ambitious barbers to keep their shops open on Sunday—it was“unfair” to the barbers who wished to loaf.This is an eloquent [illustration] of the fool’s idea of where wealth andproduction come from (he has no idea—he thinks it’s just there, to be “dividedup”). The consequences to society as a whole and to the parasites themselves areobvious. Show specific examples of this and trace the results in concrete steps.169 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_169_r1.jpg]For the plot construction, consider key activities of mankind (all connectedwith the railroad): food, clothing, shelter—as represented by wheat, cotton,lumber. Connect them with the story of TT.170 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_170_r1.jpg]The three attitudes of the parasites toward the creators are: (1) “We don’t needyou at all”; (2) “We need you—therefore you must serve us” (the appeal throughweakness and pity); (3) “Never mind any reasons, or who’s right or wrong—we’lljust force you to serve us.” Show concrete illustrations and examples of allthree attitudes.James Taggart alternates between (1) and (2) [in his attitude] toward Dagny (andeveryone else). At the end, James Taggart and the rest of the parasites try toresort to (3) in regard to Galt.Hank Rearden is a constant victim of (1) and (2) from all his relatives andassociates throughout the story.(You may need more, and more specific, examples and incidents of this.)Actually, the parasite’s attitude is: first, “Help me, because I’m weak andyou’re strong, I need you so much”; then second, when he got what he wanted:“Don’t be so damn conceited, I don’t need you at all.” Here, the parasite gotthe effect and forgot the cause. In regard to his appeal, the parasite is humbleand begs for charity—so long as the creator will not permit him anything else.The moment the creator is demoralized and disarmed through the creed ofaltruism, the parasite turns arrogant and demands help as his rightful due, asthe creator’s duty. “Help me because I need you,” then becomes an order, acommand—not a plea.The parasite considers himself defrauded of his personal property—the creator’shelp. Thus the creator’s energy and its products are assumed to be the propertyof the parasite. Virtue—strength, intelligence, competence—has no propertyrights (to itself), but vice—weakness, stupidity, incompetence—has propertyrights (to virtue). Altruism does this. This is implicit in altruism, logicallyand consistently. But it is only the creators who make this possible by theiracceptance of altruism. The responsibility here is that of the creators; it isup to them to stop the vicious procedure; they are the cause of their owndestruction. (This is for Hank Rearden.)As to attitude (3)—it comes about when (1) and (2) have destroyed all sense,morality and decency in human relations. Then parasites come to (3)—to thebelief in plain force, to the bestial arrogance of the criminal moron (“thedrooling beast”). Without the groundwork laid and prepared by (1) and (2), theparasites would not think of (3), or would not dare to think of it. The plaincriminal types, who exist in any society at any time, would be of no danger orconsequence (certainly not spiritually), since they would be regarded andtreated as what they are: the plain criminal, the anti-rational or sub-human.171 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_171_r1.jpg]Keep this firmly in mind as a lead:By associating with the parasites and a world living on the principles of theparasites, the creators offer themselves up for unspeakable suffering, andachieve, in the net total result, the opposite of that which is their purpose.They suffer in order to be able to do their independent creative work—and onlygive their enemies the means to torture them and to destroy their work. (Theirwork survives or is achieved only to the extent to which their principles ofindependence are followed, actually or by default. And to have these principlesfollowed even to that extent, the creators purchase that possibility by theirown suffering.)This is what the creators must stop. Don’t give your enemies the means todestroy you. Don’t accept the enemy’s terms. You are the power. Deliver anultimatum to the parasites: take my terms—or nothing. And my terms here mean:individualism, egoism, independence. [This means] the recognition of the primarylife principle—the faculty of man’s independent rational judgment; thetranslation of this into concrete morality—the principle that each man existsonly for his own sake (and can claim nothing from others); the translation ofthis morality into politics—a society of individualism and capitalism. Thecreators destroy themselves by any acceptance (complete or partial) of the creedof altruism. June 21, 1946Civilization (which means everything made by men, not nature—all physicalwealth, all ideas and spiritual values) was made by man’s intelligence. It canbe used and maintained only by man’s intelligence. (And this applies to any partof it, any product—industry, machines, art, anything.) It has to vanish whenintelligence vanishes. But intelligence is an attribute of the individual; itfunctions individually, it cannot function under compulsion ; it cannot be tiedto the decisions of others and, therefore, is destroyed in a collectivistsociety. That is why collectivism cannot produce or survive.Besides, the intelligent man does not live for others. The higher theintelligence, the greater the self-sufficiency. (Your need of others can be usedas a measure of your intelligence—in inverse ratio.)172 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_172_r1.jpg]As a clue to the net effect: The book could be dedicated “to all those who thinkthat material wealth is produced by material means.”173 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_173_r1.jpg]Minor note: Since the material is an expression of the spiritual, the physicalstate of the world in the story (their physical assets, capital goods, means ofproduction, tools, machines, buildings, etc.) must be a reflection of men’sspiritual state: incompetent, weak, falling apart, disintegrating, uncertain andsenselessly contradictory, maliciously evil, dull, gray, monotonous—above all,decaying.174 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_174_r1.jpg]Re: looting. The primitive form of looting is to seize the end products of thework of others, consume them and then look for another victim. This is thepattern of the plain criminal, the most primitive savage tribes, and the earlyAsiatic nomadic invasions, such as Attila or Genghis Khan. The modern form is toloot the means of production and try to carry on (which is only a variation ofthe same thing, actually more stupid, more vicious, and less practical). This isthe pattern of Soviet Russia.What makes it less practical is the fact that grabbing an industry and expectingit to run without intelligence is like grabbing an automobile and expecting itto run without gas. It rests on a savage’s misunderstanding of the nature ofproduction, his ignorance of the fact that intelligence is the energy that keepsthe tools going, that tools cannot go by themselves, and that intelligence canneither be taken over nor forced.If the primitive looter left his victims alive, he at least left them alone tostart production again—he took over the product, not the means of production(the chief of which is freedom). The modern collectivist looter takes over theproduct and the means. He enslaves men. He seizes and stops the source.Therefore, after he has consumed the existing accumulated wealth, no more can beproduced, neither for him nor for his victims. This is how he destroys the worldand himself.So the pattern of disintegration in the story must be the increasing consumptionof capital assets, without replacements. (Here the last emergency of taking upold rails fits quite well.)175 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_175_r1.jpg]A savage invader also enslaved the conquered population (which is taking overman as the means of production); but then he established a slave society, whichcould just barely exist, in the most primitive way, without intelligence. Youcannot enslave intelligence—only brute, physical force, only muscle power.Actual looters, such as the nomadic tribes, grabbed property and departed. Nowthe modem collectivist is attempting the impossible; he is not a slave master,in the ancient sense of a slave economy, an economy that produced something bymeans of slaves; he is actually a perpetual looter, and what he wants to loot,continuously, is the source of production—man’s intelligence. This can’t bedone.THE PATTERN OF THE RAILROADS’ GROWTHThe basic scientific invention: the steam engine.The application of this invention to transportation: the designing of a steamlocomotive.The parallel growth of two elements (two lines of endeavor, integrated by onepurpose): the entrepreneurs who organize railroads, the inventors who improvethe technical equipment.Main developments here:1. Enterprise: branching into new territories, laying out new lines, acquiringbetter equipment, giving better and more service cheaper, planning betterorganization of the whole system.2. Invention: scientific progress in an immense number of lines, the four mainones being: track (rails, ties, grade, tunnels, bridges, terminals), motivepower (engines: steam, oil, electric, diesel-electric), rolling stock (cars,brakes), signals (telegraph, radio, semaphores, automatic safety devices).Main purposes: speed, safety, economy, comfort, reliability.Results: the creation of new territories, the birth of new industries and growthof all industries due to rapid transportation permitting exchange of rawmaterials for production and exchange of produced goods over vast regions,opening up huge new markets.THE REVERSE: THE PATTERN OF DISINTEGRATIONAs the parasites take over a huge, working system, the first thing to stop isprogress. No improvements made, no new lines opened, no new inventions accepted(or made).Lack of judgment makes Taggart incapable of grasping the needs of the system.Routine makes him keep lines, activities, and procedures no longer necessary;this is a drain on the system and hampers the needed activities.When the smallest thing goes wrong, he has no idea how to repair it—like a moronoperating a dishwasher when he wouldn’t know and couldn’t think of how to washdishes by hand; if one small screw falls out, he has no idea how to mend it.Taggart is a moron in relation to TT—a moron with an immense, complex machine.His smallest attempt at “mending” only grows into major destruction of themachine.Lack of judgment makes Taggart adopt new policies (when forced to by obvioustrouble) that are disastrous and only aggravate the trouble (by transferring itto other points and problems).Unnecessary branches are kept going for irrelevant reasons at great expense andeffort. Needed branches curtail their services, dislocating needed industries,while the unneeded ones are artificially kept alive for political and othersecond-hand reasons.As needed industries are crippled or dying off, the railroad suffers from lackof the materials and products that it needs.The vicious circle: bad railroad service leads to bad industries, bad industriesmake the railroad service worse—and all go down together, disintegrating.In the realm of enterprise, the process is: branches being closed off, thesystem contracting, the service getting worse and more expensive, theorganization falling apart with consequent confusion, inefficiency, hit-and-misspolicy, a growing chaos.In the realm of invention, the process is: as the technical equipment wears out,it is replaced by older, inferior models of the preceding technical stage, goingback to easier, more primitive methods (but not for long, since this can’t bedone); [there are progressively more] accidents and breakdowns of equipment.Track: rails deteriorate and replacements are made of inferior steel; ties rotand some are not being treated; grades worn by floods and weather conditions areneglected; tunnels collapse and are closed; bridges collapse and cannot berepaired or replaced; terminals deteriorate—switching causes endless delays,confusion, loss of freight. Motive power: as locomotives wear out, older andweaker ones are put into service, promptly breaking down, too; locomotives areused without necessary repairs, or on a shoe-string, with patched-up “fixing,”just to complete one run—with the result that at the end of the run thelocomotive has to be junked, worn out beyond repair (beyond their capacity torepair it, anyway); crucial shortages of fuel—and inferior fuel that ruins theengines.Rolling stock: the same deterioration and same vain make-shifts as with engines.Cars for special purposes vanish first—such as refrigerator cars, huge specialflat cars, then stock cars, tank cars, grain cars, until nothing but a few oldstandard boxcars and flats are left. Passenger cars get more and moreuncomfortable. Diners are eliminated (“economy”), then sleepers (except a fewfor politicians).Comforts are eliminated, in reverse order from that in which they came: firstair-conditioning goes, then heating, then water (and toilets), then lighting.Brakes are defective and shaky, causing endless accidents.Signals: breakdowns, mainly (or at least ostensibly) through inefficientpersonnel. Breaks in telegraph service leave schedules and trains in confusion,and cause traffic snarls. Automatic safety devices are long since gone.Automatic signals are replaced by manual ones—going back to lanterns andflags—and these wreak total havoc in the hands of semi-moronic collectivist“lower labor.” There are dreadful accidents—the kind that could have beenprevented by intelligence.Main direction of the process: railroads become slow, dangerous, expensive,uncomfortable, unreliable.As they go down to the preceding stage of progress, that stage is not like itwas in the past, on the way up, but much worse; it worked then—but it does notwork now, quickly leading only to the next stage below. The contradictionbetween needs and means grow wider, worse and more destructive; a freightdelivery of two days worked fine for an industry geared to that; it does notwork for an industry that needs goods delivered in two hours; as the industrycollapses, it adds to the growing collapse of the railroad.On the way up, producers were counting on the intelligence of others with whomthey had to deal. Now they have to count on stupidity—so they are forced tostop.Results: the dying off of whole territories, first the distant, outlying, lessdeveloped ones, then coming closer and closer. (Here—the parallel to a weakheart. As the heart grows weaker, first the capillaries (the outlying, smallerdistricts) atrophy; then the paralysis closes in, growing, in contractingcircles, closer and closer to the heart and center.) Industries cannot get rawmaterials and cannot reach a market for their products. Farmers cannot grow rawmaterials—there is no way to transport them to market. Production becomeshysterically sporadic, like speculation: make so much if you can get thetransportation through special (mainly political) pull, take the profit, thenrun; no planned, continuous, long-range effort is possible. This brings theworst type, the gambler-speculator type, into momentary industrial leadership;and the methods of this type cannot run a working industry. (Here is the pure“money” motive—just quick “money,” not production.)Insane “deals” are made—so many cars for such-and-such a shipment—for reasons ofpull, in total disregard of the needs, rights, and contracts of particularshippers. Rivals destroy each other through “transportation pull” (that is,parasites destroy the few remaining producers) by making senseless dealsdestroying whole potential trainloads of freight—hurting both the shippers andthe railroad. All these “deals” are made for every possible second-handreason—everything except rational sense and the profit motive. [They give]reasons such as: the public good, help to a needy section, help to a friend, thecountry ought to take this product even if there’s no demand for it, so let’scondition people by delivering sets of “psychological games” when there is nobread, etc.The result: the cars used for some such fool freight hold up a perishableharvest, the harvest rots, the farmers (who had counted on the railroad) go outof business, and the railroad (who needed the business of this section) findsitself running empty trains at a loss. As industries shrink or vanish, producersstop counting on railroads altogether. There is less and less transcontinentaltraffic. Production tries to shrink to a local exchange—going back to watertransportation, a few old trucks, covered wagons, horses and buggies. But theremaining industries were not geared to be local and cannot go back to thatstage. (Just as our house could not exist without electricity; it would be nogood for pre-electric living, particularly when no rebuilding can be done.) Andno new industries, on a small, local, more primitive scale, can be born—who’sgoing to start them?—the parasites are only trying to run with what they lootedand it’s falling apart in their hands.So—in accelerating progression—things stop, industries close, unemployment andcrime grow, men have neither products nor work, they don’t know what to do andcan’t do it, there is no work for anyone, only the approaching prospect ofstarvation that becomes obvious to all. There are starvation areas all over thecountry, epidemics, outbreaks of violence and hysteria (apparently causeless), agrowing chaos. The obvious picture? Hunger, disease, rags, ruins. The spiritualpicture (as far as the parasites are concerned): all the variations of panic anddespair.176 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_176_r1.jpg]Choose from these concrete suggestions the key points to illustrate the specificsteps of TT’s collapse. But remember that what you need is the illustration ofthe working and results of stupidity (of non-judgment)—not all the details ofthe specific railroad collapse, only enough of these to make the process and itsnature clear. June 22, 1946Types of creators who work for their own destruction (and that of other creatorsand the world):Frank Lloyd Wright: The creator who is overly concerned with others for the sakeof their admiration. His achievement is authentic and first-hand, he does notlet others into this sphere—but he still wants their admiration, afterwards, andit is an important concern to him. By enjoying his role of benefactor and makingthis role of importance to himself, he sanctions their right to exploit him, totake, to demand from him.He puts himself into the role of the exploited, [conceding] that this is hisproper role and function; [he assumes the role of] the giver, the superior onewho has riches which others don’t have and which they can get only from him,with the added implication that these riches are there to be taken by theseinferior others. (Taken only by his voluntary gift? That is what he may say. Butthe others would be justified in saying that once he establishes the principlethat these riches, by their essential nature and purpose, are to be given tothem, then they are justified in demanding or seizing them when some creatordoes not give them in the manner they wish, or does not give enough [and isthus] withholding what is theirs. He has established the principle of service toothers and exploitation; the form is then only a secondary matter of detail.)Prof. Otto Hahn (as a guess at the type I think he is) [Otto Hahn was a Germanphysicist who collaborated with the Nazis; AR did not know Hahn personally, butshe had done some research on him for the screenplay Top Secret (see Chapter9)]: A man of ability who despises the lesser men around him, the stupid or lessable—and decides that he must seek power (or associate himself with those whoseek power, and support them—such as the Nazis) in order to have his way in astupid world that will never share his intelligence and can only be dealt withby force. In doing this, he destroys the very people with whom he could deal,whose rareness he deplores—the intelligent ones; they cannot be ruled by force,they are the first ones destroyed in a dictatorship. And all that is left arethe stupid ones, the worst among them, the corrupt and evil, those who will takeany order, accept any horror and just obey, like unthinking brutes. And only theworst among them would be capable of holding the jobs of rulers in adictatorship of force, the Gestapo jobs.So by this kind of reasoning, a man like Hahn would destroy that which he valuesand needs (intelligence), preserve that which he dreads (corrupt stupidity), andgive power (over himself and others) to the worst kind of human element, his ownworst enemies. Dr. [J. Robert] Oppenheimer (my guess about him and his motives):A man extremely conceited about his own intelligence (either honestlyconceited—or maliciously so, i.e., with enjoyment of the inferiority of othersand of his own superiority by comparison). He decides that he is so sure of whatis right and that he is capable of deciding it, while others are not, that hemust force it on those inferior others, for their own good. In such an attitude,there is the natural impatience of the intelligent man who can’t bear to seethings done wrong, when they can be done right and he knows how to do it. Butthis attitude is applied to a crucial error in thinking—that one man can decidewhat is right (or good) for another, and that the material (as a value) isabsolute per se, so that a comfortable house for a ragged bum is “a good”without further consideration or relation to anything.Man being a rational creature, the only good possible to him is that which hehimself has accepted rationally; his primary evil is to do anything without hisown independent rational acceptance and understanding. A bum forced to accept ahouse he does not understand, and has not built or earned, is committing an evilif he accepts it “because the leader says it’s good,” or if he simply accepts itas an unearned alms; and that house will not do him any good.But, more importantly, Oppenheimer is committing the same error as Hahn: theforcing of his ideas on those who, by his own definition, are inferior andcannot achieve or know what’s good for them. [This policy] might be viewed asmerely futile when applied to them; actually, it’s worse than futile—it’s apositive evil—putting them into a subhuman position, into the class ofnon-rational beings, whereas they can exist or be happy only on the basis ofwhatever rationality they possess. They would have to be total morons or insaneto be benefited by forced benefaction—but then, of course, it can’t work andthey can’t be benefited. This forcing of his ideas on others is monstrouslydestructive of the best among them, of the intelligent, of those he would defineas his equals. (Is a possible reason here the fact that he recognizes no one ashis potential equal in this sense? Is it that kind of conceit?)The intelligent men cannot be forced—only destroyed. So this attitude, again,leads to the destruction of that which he values (and of himself as one amongthe intelligent), and to the perpetuation of that which he wants to eliminate orcorrect (stupidity, incompetence, misery).If he argues like this: “Well, those lesser people work and struggle on theirown, but stupidly; let them have the benefit of my superior intelligence anddirection; let them be forced to accept my directives whether they agree or not,whether they understand or not; the result will be to their own benefit”—theanswer is: To accept or obey blindly is the only original sin for man and thebasic source of his destruction. Then a man cannot work well, not even in hissmall job. Within the specific sphere of his own action, his job, his life, hisactive concerns, he must understand what he is doing to the best of his ownintelligence—or he can’t do it; his degree of understanding determines thequality and success or failure of his performance.If a very stupid type of unskilled laborer takes a job turning a crank in afactory, without understanding or concern for what the factory is manufacturingor why—that is quite proper and safe; there is no obligation on man to venturebeyond the limits of his intelligence; in fact, it is his moral law and theessence of his nature not to touch that which he cannot judge first-hand, not toact without intelligence.Such a laborer knows his own reasons for taking the job—need of money, ease ofthe work, or whatever—and that is his proper and only possible motive. To forcehim against his wishes or understanding into some wonderful atomic factory wherehis limited skill can be used to best advantage (by the master’s decision) willnot do him, the factory, or the master any good. It is forcing him into asubhuman state.And what about this kind of forcing when applied to a better, more intelligentman of high ability, who can form his own judgments and conclusions? And howdoes the master here judge human ability—or whom to force, when, into what, howmuch, and for what purpose?The basic mistake here is in judging the nature of man—in not understanding whatprecisely constitutes a rational being, and how this applies to degrees of humanintelligence and ability; in not understanding the nature of force and itsrelation to intelligence; in not understanding the nature and significance ofvoluntary consent; and in assuming that any material good can be objective,i.e., factually absolute for all men, without considering the most objective andfactual part of any “good”—the reaction of the human mind involved. (“The good”is a matter of standards; standards are determined by purpose. Who, then, sets aman’s purpose here? Another creature, a master. By what right? It is the natureof man’s intelligence, of survival by means of rationality, to function throughpurpose. But he himself must set the purpose.)This last, of course, is an error or confusion in the conception of “the good.”What is good for man? Nothing except that which he finds of value through theindependent judgment of his rational mind. He’s making an error in judgment?Then he must correct it rationally. He can’t judge for himself at all? Thennothing can be good for him at all; [in this case], he is either a moron orinsane. And human “good” can be based on nothing except human intelligence. Thatis man’s basic, determining attribute (his “faculty of survival”). Andintelligence is his act of independent rational judgment.177 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_177_r1.jpg]Moral to these men: Concern yourself with virtue, not vice; with intelligence,not stupidity; with strength and ability—not weakness and incompetence. June 24, 1946How do these last types of men affect my theme?Are my “creators” (in the story) complete men or abstractions of a practicalhuman quality? (They are “men of ability.” When they make mistakes, theyfunction on the principles of the parasites. But in the sphere of their workthey function on the principles of the creators.)The parasites in my story are motivated by hatred and exploitation of ability.What is the attitude of the above men [i.e., creators who sometimes function onthe principles of parasites] toward ability? (Men of ability are not vicious;parasites are. Men of ability make mistakes; parasites are consciously evil. Butit’s the mistakes of the men of ability that are most disastrous and pave theway for the evil of the parasites.)The two basic qualities of the parasite: (1) method—refusal to exercise hisindependent rational judgment, substituting for it the judgment of others; and(2) motive—desire to get the unearned (spiritual values which he doesn’tdeserve, more material wealth than he can produce).These men [i.e., the mistaken creators] are not second-handers, but their great,basic error is in considering other men second-handers (or the desire to makethem so).They want others to substitute their (the master’s) judgment for their own.They want others to admire them, without understanding.They want unearned material wealth from others (taken away by force) for theirown purposes (art, research, etc.) Unable to justify this last, they claim: “ButI’m working for your sake”—and this is how they enthrone the principle of theexploitation of creators. June 25, 1946The progressive steps of TT’s destruction must be integrated on three lines: thephysical failures and contractions of the railroad must be connected with (comefrom and lead to) the personal relationships of the characters involved (showingthe variations of parasitism) and the progression of their “life lines,” theirspecific, particular fates (such as Dagny moving towards shaking herself free ofparasites, James Taggart moving toward spiritual destruction, etc.).178 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_178_r1.jpg]TWO POSSIBLE CHARACTERS FOR THE PARASITE’S SIDE:The “traitor creators”: the desperate, violent young inventor who accepts forceout of despair at stupidity, who thinks that this is the only way to deal withthe world—and is destroyed early and violently, unable to stand his own mistake;the more subtle and dangerous professor of physics [Robert Stadler] who wantsunearned material wealth for his laboratory, fools himself and others intobelieving that he works “for the common good,” and who supports and makespossible all the brutal police methods of the parasites’ government. Theprofessor invents a deadly weapon—and is violently destroyed by the verymachinery and the very principles he has created.179 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_179_r1.jpg]FOR ONE OF TT’S DISASTERS:A parallel to [MGM’s plans to] build a $3,000,000 studio in England: Taggartspends a small, badly needed fortune to build a new branch through a territorythat has been moving to seize his railroad; his reason—“I’ll outsmart them byplaying with them.” He builds the branch—and it is seized, causing great damageto the remaining lines of TT and their operation, [in addition to] the cripplingfinancial loss. (Or should it be a “creator” competitor who does this forTaggart?)180 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_180_r1.jpg]Re: Robert Sherwood writing a biography of Harry Hopkins. This is such ashocking example of a parasite feeding on a parasite (in the intellectual realm)that a parallel must be found and used. [Robert Sherwood was an Americanplaywright who won the Pulitzer Prize for Idiot’s Delight (1936); Harry Hopkinswas a politician who served as a special assistant to President Roosevelt duringWorld War II. ]181 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_181_r1.jpg]The looter, the man who wants to grab some material wealth and run, living forthe profit of the moment (or the man who is only after money, not production),wants the effect without the cause—that is why he is doomed to fail, isdestructive and acting contrary to nature, his action being irrational.Reason is the ability to understand the connections of fact and to use them byacting accordingly. Man must act through “final causation” (the choosing of hispurpose) and must use “efficient causation” to achieve his purpose. The lootersets his purpose at “getting money” and tries to get it without the necessarysteps of the cause that produces the effect of “money”—the cause beingproductive activity. That is why the looter usually fails himself (though notimmediately, and the chain of steps and reasons is not always obvious) and why asociety built on the principles of looting, a society that leaves man no freedomfor anything else, will fail and destroy itself.The productive man wants material wealth or money as the natural, logical,rational, inevitable result of his productive activity—and that is why he won’twork without the profit motive; consciously or unconsciously he knows that suchwork is evil, being unnatural and irrational. Even if he were free to function(which he can’t be in a collectivist State without property rights), even ifsuch a situation could be achieved, he would not work without the profitmotive—indifferent as he may be to money, his love and interest being in hiswork, in his creative activity. (Besides, he knows that money, the privateownership of the wealth he has created, is his means to further work.)The parasite, true to his perverted basic premise and his irrationality, wantsthe money, with no concern for the productive process, for the work; in fact,with an active hatred for work and those who work—the hatred of dread (anddependence). This is the psychology of the looter-executives in the fourth stageof collapse.SPECIFIC STEPS TOWARD A RAILROAD’S DESTRUCTIONThe last one: a crucial branch is closed to get track for the last, main line.Without the industries served by the branch, the main line cannot exist forlong. (This is “living off capital.”)The collapse of TT’s freight train bridge: the last break. Most of the otherrival lines are gone by then. (This is the “helplessness before nature.”)Disorganization (chaos): no fuel where fuel was expected for theComet’s last ride. (This is the plain moron’s inability to understand the needof work and action.)The “transportation pull” deals: Major (and fatal) example of it—“help to aneedy section which has an industry the country ought to [support].” At acrucial harvest time (when there is a good harvest after several bad years),Taggart unexpectedly refuses trains and cars to the farming section involved anduses these trains for the “preferred” section. Result—hunger for the country,farmers go bankrupt and quit, banks close, endless industries suffer—and TT,returning to its old branch, finds itself running it at a loss, yet unable (andafraid) to close it—“the section must be revived, this is just temporary.”Minor examples of the same method—deals on a smaller scale, involving individualshippers, through which the “gambler-speculator” industrialists ruin the fewremaining producers. Each time—there is a final loss to TT.(These are the “second-handers’ motives” in action.) Incident of the death of asection (the first one in the story, as part of the plot): TT closes itsbranch—one man in the section attempts to organize a pony express—the collectivebegins to hamper him with rules—John Galt tells him to stop—the section dies.(This illustrates parasite methods and [what happens in] the absence of acreator.) Specific incident of an industry closing because of the railroad’sfailure: Loss of crucial, irreplaceable freight in switching yards’ tie-ups andsnarls. Later—freight found in some most incongruous place. (Incompetence.)A major traffic snarl: through break-down of signals or telegraph service.(Incompetence.)The return to flags and lanterns. (Retrogression.)The progressive disappearance of: diners, sleepers, air-conditioning, heating,water, lighting. And of: refrigerator cars, stock cars, tank cars.(Retrogression.)The progressive deterioration of motive power: The use of old locomotives, andlocomotives ruined just to make one run. (The parasite’s “range of the moment.”)The looting chicanery to get locomotives from other systems—a barely veiledhighjacking called “nationalization,” which the looters claim is “temporary,just for the emergency.” [They pass] some law such as that the remaininglocomotives belong to the one who can “prove” the biggest “public good,” agrotesque kind of “priorities.” (The absence of inventors and “living offcapital.”)In connection with this: an incident of a locomotive high-jacked by Dagny(against priorities). Their own locomotive was taken through “priorities” bysomeone else.The tunnel collapses—it cannot be repaired and reopened—miserable, shaky,make-shift steps to run the railroad around it by going back to the rustedremains of an older, pre-tunnel era. (The “return of nature.”)One incident of a disastrous flood in which a line is destroyed and cannot berepaired. The section dies. Memories of how such disasters were repaired in thepast. (The “return of nature.”)One incident of a crucial train run in which a great deal is at stake (in theplot), and the failure of the train destroys it. The failure is due to a causethat seems infinitesimal on the surface (like one loose screw in the rails), butis really huge as an indication of the cause behind it, of the second-handers incharge and the bestial idiocy of their methods. (Incompetence.)In connection with lumber industry—the untreated ties and the result. (Lack ofinventors.)The “equal rates” introduced by Taggart (“for democracy”) that ruin the moredistant farming sections (or a distant but growing and heathy industry thatshould have had a future). (Second-handers’ motives.)Incident of Taggart deciding that a competitor is ruining him, that everythingwould be all right if it weren’t for “unfair competition”—so he ruins thecompetitor (with political help) and finds that he can’t run the line and thatpeople won’t use it. This one can be connected with the first death of asection. (Second-handers’ envy, and idea that the job creates the man.)Accidents: one major railroad wreck directly connected to Taggart’s methods, anda few lesser ones (each progressively worse than the one before). Minoraccidents and breakdowns—constantly. (This is plain, eloquent, screamingdestruction—the direct physical expression of the essence, purpose, and finalresult of the parasite.) One incident of a new invention taken over and theinventor kicked out. Then the parasites don’t know how to use it and have toabandon it. It can be a young engineer with a new engine as a solution to theirpower problems. Or it can even be an invention of Galt‘s, possibly an earlyone—and he has now vanished—and Dagny looks for him, not knowing his name, shemerely wants “the man and the brain who could do this.” (This is “the moron withthe dishwasher.”)June 26, 1946KEY STEPS (RAILROAD)1. Taggart ruins a competitor—and destroys the line.2. Taggart introduces the “equal rates”—and the consequences.3. Invention taken over and young inventor kicked out, with the invention thenfailing.4. Dagny finding Galt’s early engine in abandoned factory.5. Factory (needed by TT) closes when irreplaceable freight is lost inswitching. Later—freight found in incongruous place.6. The first death of a section and the young man of the pony express.7. The crucial train run that fails (due to an infinitesimal reason [that is aconsequence] of the parasites’ technique).8. The looting of one another’s locomotives—and the incident of Dagny’s stolenlocomotive.9. The “transportation pull” deal for “preferred” section that kills off afarming section and a branch of TT.10. The tunnel collapse—and the return to an old rusted track.11. The major railroad wreck.12. Last: branch closed, track ripped for main line—and collapse of bridge.KEY STAGES (“PATTERN OF DISINTEGRATION ”)First stage: Stalling on decisions, evading, routine, destruction of creators.Smaller disasters. Steps 1, 2, and 3.Second stage: Parasites discover responsibility and are scared. Buck-passing,double-cross, parasites leaning on parasites. First serious disasters; parasitesalibi themselves. Consequences of steps 1 and 2. Also—step 4.Third stage: Nobody wants top positions of responsibility. Disasters becomecrashes. Some parasites caught. Almost no creators left. Beginning of parasites’panic. Steps 5, 6, 7, and 8.Fourth stage: The “ersatz-creators”—the emergence of the criminal type asexecutive, the looter. Now it is plain, accelerating “living off capital.” Steps9 and 10.Fifth stage: Surrender to the creators—the plea to John Galt. Steps 11 and 12.182 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_182_r1.jpg]Incident: the professor, who stole one of Galt’s early inventions (he was Galt’steacher in college). “Who is John Galt?” has become the professor’s secrettorture (his conscience), growing violently, pathologically unbearable to him asthe story progresses. Late in Part I, in a scene with Dagny, the professor talksabout this slang-sentence, involuntarily betraying more than he cares to. Inanswer to Dagny’s wonder about the meaning and origin of the phrase, he saysthat he knew John Galt, but Galt must have died long since. He had a brain suchthat: “If he had lived, the whole world would be talking of him now.” “But thewhole world is talking of him.” This had never occurred to the professor before;he is struck and stunned. “Yes ...” he whispers softly, terrified. “Why? ...What is he doing?”But as Dagny tries to question him, he drops the subject, telling her that it’sall preposterous, just a coincidence, the name is common enough, it’s a popularpiece of slang without significance. He will give her no clue to Galt’s identityor profession. She thinks that this is just another one of those occasions whenpeople claim first-hand knowledge of John Galt.183 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_183_r1.jpg]Note: J.H. as one of the typical parasites. He is mild and friendly toeveryone—he admires anything and anyone who makes money (or is popular),indiscriminately, without analysis or understanding or reason-then he acts todestroy the very things and people he wants to use. He feels sad and bewilderedabout this—but he becomes mean and evil on one point only: any suggestion of thenecessity for him to think about it, i.e., for him to assume the responsibilityof an independent rational judgment. (His preoccupation with “polls” and“trends.”) He is truly the “moron with a dishwasher,” the savage thrown intocivilization—understanding nothing about it, not even that understanding isnecessary.184 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_184_r1.jpg]More for the professor: He stole Galt’s invention, early in his career (shortlybefore Galt vanished) for the following reason: in the growing poverty of theworld, there is less and less endowment of science; the professor waspassionately devoted to his work, paid little attention to anything else andunderstood nothing about men, principles or the world; he wanted the governmentto finance his scientific research work and he had sold himself the idea that hewas working for “the common good”; the bureaucrats in charge wanted concreteproof of the practical importance of his work; so he stole Galt’sidea—justifying this to himself by the notion that he stole it “for the commongood,” that “science belongs to the people,” that he can do so much for mankindif he gets his laboratory, therefore stealing Galt’s idea is all right, since itwill give him the laboratory, etc. He got the laboratory.Later he is forced by circumstances to invent the deadly weapon which he did notwant to invent. Show the gradual disintegration of his conscience and of hiswork (or its direction) in the course of one collectivist compromise afteranother.In the end—he betrays and destroys everything he had lived for, everything forwhich he made his compromises (he thought of them as “sacrifices”): science,rationality, intelligence. He upholds: brutality, violence, evil, stupidity. (Todecide: either circumstances force him to this, i.e., the parasites [force him]through the very power he has given them; or—his own mind and convictions, beingtotally perverted now, bring him to this and lead him to demand the destructionof John Galt.) June 27, 1946ADDED POINTS:The dreadful state of TT’s research laboratory. Routine and second-handedness :the alleged scientists spend their time proving that new things “can’t bedone”—this in order to justify their inactivity and keep their jobs, which isall they are concerned with. Dagny’s constant clashes with this, her helplessanger and indignation. (This ties to and leads to her interest in Galt’s oldengine.)James Taggart discontinues the research laboratory. The excuse: “Why look forthe new when everybody hasn’t got everything of the old? Let’s stop progressuntil everybody is equal, then we will all go forward together slowly.”James Taggart tries to have the whole economy frozen and stopped, so that hewill have “security”—a set market, a set amount of traffic, a set routine. (“Howcan I do anything when things change all the time? I would be a great executiveif only people weren’t so unreliable and unpredictable.”) The attempt [to freezethe economy] takes place toward the last third of Part I.GALT’S RELATION TO THE OTHER CHARACTERSHere is what Galt represents to them (in specific story terms): For Dagny—theideal. The answer to her two quests: the man of genius and the man she loves.The first quest is expressed in her search for the inventor of the engine. Thesecond—her growing conviction that she will never be in love (and her relationswith Rearden).For Rearden—the friend. The kind of understanding and appreciation he has alwayswanted and did not know he wanted (or he thought he had it—he tried to find itin those around him, to get it from his wife, his mother, brother, and sister).For Francisco d‘Anconia—the aristocrat. The only man who represents a challengeand a stimulant—almost the “proper kind” of audience, worthy of stunning for thesheer joy and color of life.For Danneskjöld—the anchor. The only man who represents land and roots to areckless wanderer, like the goal of a struggle, the port at the end of a fiercesea voyage—the only man he can respect.For the composer—the inspiration and the perfect audience.For the philosopher—the embodiment of his abstractions.For Father Amadeus—the source of his conflict. The uneasy realiza tions thatGalt is the end of his endeavors, the man of virtue, the perfect man—and thathis means do not fit this end, that he is destroying his ideal for the sake ofthose who are evil.To James Taggart—the eternal threat. The secret dread. The reproach. His guilt.He has no specific [connection] with Galt—but he has that constant, causeless,unnamed, hysterical fear. And he recognizes it when he hears Galt’s broadcastand when he sees Galt in person for the first time.To the professor—his conscience. The reproach and reminder. The ghost thathaunts him through everything he does, without a moment’s peace. The [man] thatsays “No” to his whole life.June 29, 1946NOTE ON PROPER COOPERATION (FOR DAGNY’S ATTITUDE)The principle of proper cooperation among men is that no man should be forced todo anything, within the specified province of his job, that he considers wrong[by his own judgment].The decision here must be his. His superiors must not expect him to obey againsthis own reason. Of course, they must have the right to decide when they areacting properly or improperly. But if they know they are forcing him (throughsheer obedience to an order, not through his rational consent), they are actingimproperly (but strictly within their legal rights). His protection—and hisproper course, in this last case—is to resign.Now, this presupposes that in proper cooperation, the specific job of eachindividual man is clearly and objectively defined. It has to be—and, forsuccess, the definitions must be rationally accepted by all the men involved(rationally accepted—not merely accepted because it’s a majority decision, orthe boss’s decision).Any boss has the legal right to establish the rules for the organization heheads—and his employees have the choice to work for him on his conditions ornot. But the rational definition of jobs is crucially necessary for the successof any organization; the boss (if he is good at his job) is the one who has towork out the proper definitions, make them clear to his employees and make ithis policy to see that all of them (including himself) act accordingly. Thefailures, inefficiencies, hard feelings and chicaneries going on in bigcorporations, particularly the less efficient ones, are probably due to the lackof such definitions, explicitly or implicitly, in the company’s policies.No work (neither mental nor physical) can be done collectively. All work is doneindividually. All human energy is individual—generated by and within one man:spiritual energy, mental energy, physical energy. A “collective” piece of workis only the sum of the individual work involved. (And “a collective piece ofwork” is a sloppy, meaningless corruption; what is meant by it is something likean automobile that comes out of a factory where thousands of men have worked andcontributed to the production of the automobile. Well, they didn’t “blend” or“fuse” their work, their minds, bodies, or energies into a collective whole orprocess; they worked individually as individuals.)Since all work is done individually, a cooperative work is divided into specificparts, each of which has to be done by an individual; when these parts and thespecific individual jobs are not consciously defined by the men involved,inefficiency, friction and trouble follow. An organization is successful to theextent that it functions on such specific division of labor and responsibility,even if unstated and arrived at pragmatically, not consciously and rationally.The extent to which jobs and responsibilities infringe on one another and blend“collectively,” with the decisions and judgment of one man interfering with orbeing forced on another, determines the degree of the organization’sinefficiency and failure.(“Division of labor” must also be “division of responsibility.”)As example of the absence of such clear definitions, with awful results: themotion picture industry. In their stated theory, the movies have no suchdefinitions; they merely hold the producer as omniscient and omnipotent. Inpractice, they are forced to observe definitions, sort of by default, “bootleg”definitions—and only to that extent do they or can they function successfully.As example of proper definition on a railroad: it is the president’s job to setthe general policy of the road; it is the job of each subordinate to carry outhis part of the work toward the accomplishment of that policy. A freight agenthas no business deciding what the railroad as a whole should do; his job,specifically, is to see that freight is handled in the best manner possible. Anengineer on a train must understand and accept the conditions of his job, whichis to run the engine of a train. It is not his job to decide when the traingoes, what it carries, what it charges and to whom. His job is only to make itmove, on a certain schedule, from a certain point to another certain point.If he thinks the conditions imposed on him for the operation of the engine arewrong (in strict relation to his job of running it, and only to that), he shouldnot hold the job; he should quit. For instance, if he thinks the rules ofstopping, accelerating, watching signals, etc., are wrong—he must not hold thisjob, because he cannot hold it successfully. If he does not understand the rulesand just obeys automatically, he’s no good at the job. If he thinks the rulesare wrong, and he is mistaken about it, he still cannot be good at the job byobeying the rules blindly. If he thinks the rules are wrong, and he’s rightabout it—he shouldn’t keep the job, because the result will be disastrous to himand to the company that enforces the wrong rules. (He is, of course, free tomake suggestions to his superiors at any time; but if they disagree and he isconvinced that he’s right, he should quit.)How can an average man know whether he’s right or wrong? By never attempting ajob where, in the specific performance of his duties, he has to venture beyondthe limit of his own capacity of independent rational judgment, and act withoutunderstanding. If he understands a problem, he is sure of whether he’s right orwrong; if he isn’t sure, and can’t arrive at any certainty with the most carefulstudy, he must leave the problem and the job alone.Within the province of his job, no man should do anything for a reason such asthe desire or opinion of another man, or of a number of other men. Certainly notanything that he himself rationally considers wrong. But more than that: if hehas no rational grounds for an action, one way or another, still he must not doit if the only reason is the desire or order of another man.Dagny’s job (if not by title, then in fact—I must check on that, as far as herofficial position on TT is concerned) is to run the whole railroad. She acceptsthe interference of James Taggart and government “regulators” as an unavoidablepart of her job, an unavoidable evil. She thinks she can work in spite of thatinterference, or get around it, or compromise with it, and still make therailroad successful. That is her mistake. It can’t be done.By accepting Taggart’s decisions, which she knows to be wrong, then by helpinghim to carry out bad ideas well (such as efficiently delivering the “soybeanfreight,” when it should never have been attempted at all), she only helps himto run the railroad badly and thus contradicts and defeats her own purpose,which is to run it well. She postpones the natural consequences of his baddecisions (which would be disastrous) and thus leaves him free and gives him themeans to do more damage to the railroad by even worse decisions.A bad thing done well is more dangerous and disastrous than a bad thing donebadly. An efficient robbery is worse for the victim than an inefficient one. Thefool Republicans who help the New Deal to enforce unworkable regulations destroytheir own industries—because unworkable regulations inefficiently enforced wouldgive the industries a better chance to function and survive.This is Dagny’s mistake—based on an imperfect understanding of cooperation withmen, of her need of their services in her own aim, and on the difficulty ofdefining the job of an executive in charge of a huge organization that involvesthousands of men. But when she accepts Taggart’s stupidities and tries to makethem work (for the sake of the railroad, hoping to get around them or counteracttheir bad effects), she is doing the equivalent of what I would do if I agreedto put something into a book of mine which I considered bad, but which thepublishers, critics or public demanded, and if I justified myself by an argumentsuch as: well, they want it, and after all I have to deal with them, etc. Icould not say (like all the damn Republican fools) that I would accomplish mypurpose in spite of such compromises: if I consider the outside suggestions bad,that means they are bad for my book and its purpose, therefore by accepting themI defeat my purpose. (Yet this is just what all men mixed by “social”considerations are doing nowadays. And this, in a more complex form, is whatDagny does.)185 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_185_r1.jpg]The pattern of the proper cooperation among men goes like this:First, the basic premise, without which men cannot deal with one another safelyor rationally: that each man lives only for his own sake; therefore, he actsonly for his own personal profit, respecting the same right and motive in everyother man; therefore, they can act together only if the action is personallyprofitable to each man involved; and the objective test of that is each man’sown free decision and voluntary consent.Second, the objective, general purpose of the organization is understood andaccepted by all men involved in it—and it is a “selfish” purpose in the same wayas the purpose of each man involved.Example: The purpose of every man working on a railroad should be, generally, todo productive work, which is the proper moral purpose of a human being; morespecifically, to do the kind of work he likes or has chosen, and to earn his ownliving through that work (which means, in effect, to produce and keep theproduct of one’s own work). No man can expect anything from others as a“sacrifice,” i.e., as a one-sided advantage, a consideration of his own desireswith no selfish compensation for or advantage to the other party. (The objectivetest? Voluntary mutual consent.) No employee can expect ten dollars a day,because he needs it, if his boss can get men willing to do the same work for onedollar. No boss can expect an employee to work for one dollar, if the worker canget ten dollars elsewhere. Any forced freezing, or artificial agreements, or themere confusion of this principle (“no sacrifice of anyone to anyone”), will notwork. It only leads to hatred, injustice, disaster, and destruction.The relation of a railroad as a whole to the other industries of the country, toits customers and to the whole nation, is the same as that of each man workingon it to each other man; here the railroad may be considered as a unit amongother units. The purpose of a railroad is to produce a certain commodity(transportation) and to keep the product of its work (profit). Its purpose isnot to “serve the nation” nor to “serve its shippers.” You do not run a railroadjust because sharecroppers need train rides; their need is none of yourconcern—unless they can pay their fare, i.e., give you something of value inexchange for what you give to them.And it is not the purpose of the nation or of the shippers to serve therailroad. Men deal with the railroad only when their mutual interests agree andthe exchange is to mutual selfish advantage. The objective test? The voluntaryconsent of both parties involved—the railroad and the shippers. But if therailroad is considered and run as a “service” (i.e., service to others being itsprimary purpose, and profits being ignored), then there is nothing but greed,exploitation, inefficiency, failure, and destruction ahead.This is so by definition: if a railroad is to be run without regard for profit,this means without regard for cost or efficiency; if it serves some project forsubnormal charity objects and this service does not pay its cost, someone has topay for it. The railroad then consumes more than it produces. When allproduction and all industries are run on such a principle—there is soon nothingleft to consume.Yet the above is precisely what James Taggart tries to do—both in relation tothe purpose and policy of TT as a whole (“public service”), and in relation tothe duties of employees within the organization (“the strong must serve theweak,” “the interest of any employee must be sacrificed to the interest of therailroad,” “team-work,” etc.). Instead of the growing prosperity that comes froma principle that makes each man profit by cooperating with others, Taggartcreates misery and growing poverty by a principle that demands, within, thesacrifice of each man to the organization, and, without, the sacrifice of theorganization to other organizations (or collectives, or “the nation”). This isblatantly evident in one simple statement: One system is based on the principleof profit, the other—on the principle of sacrifice; therefore, one will achievegeneral prosperity, the other—general misery.This is what Dagny deals with and accepts (if not explicitly, at leastimplicitly). This is what she hopes to work with and around. That is her mistakeand her failure. It can’t be done.186 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_186_r1.jpg]Here, also, is the difference between Dagny and Roark: Roark had no concern forothers, and kept them out of his work (and when they did interfere, he tookaction against them); Dagny has no concern for others and lets them interfere inher work, accepting the interference. The proper concern for others isself-protection-the protection of one’s own principles and inalienable rights,and above all, the protection of oneself against being anybody’s “servant,” thekeeping of one’s moral principle of living for one’s own sake.187 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_187_r1.jpg]Regarding Dagny’s determination to function as a creator at all costs: Dagnydoesn’t understand the difference between the relation of the creator to natureand to people. In relation to nature, the creator must function to shape theworld to his wishes—against every obstacle. In relation to people, he must notallow them (and their rules, stupidity, or force) to come between him andnature—because then he destroys his first function, he makes it impossible, sothat he can no longer master nature, but becomes helpless before it, like theparasites.A creator must function at all costs—but not at the cost of his own principles,not at the cost of his independence, because then he makes it impossible forhimself to function; he destroys his base and premise.188 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_188_r1.jpg]PLOT LINES FOR CHARACTERS(To illustrate, dramatize, and integrate their individual progressions)JOHN GALTNo progression here (as Roark had none). He is what he is from thebeginning—integrated (indivisible) and perfect. No change in him, because he hasno intellectual contradiction and, therefore, no inner conflict.His important qualities (to bring out):Joy in living—the peculiar, deeply natural, serene, all-pervading joy in livingwhich he alone possesses so completely in the story (the other strikers have itin lesser degree, almost as reflections of that which, in him, is the source).His joy is all-pervading in the sense that it underlies all his actions andemotions, it is an intrinsic, inseparable part of his nature (like the color ofhis hair or eyes). It is present even when he suffers (particularly in thetorture scene)—that is when the nature and quality of his joy in living isstartling and obvious, it is not resignation or acceptance of suffering, but adenial of it, a triumph over it. (This is extremely important to convey—clearly,unmistakably.) And this quality of his is particularly what is lacking in theparasites and in their whole world, in the world as it has become. (He laughs,as answer to the crucial question of the torture scene.)(The worship of joy as against the worship of suffering.)Self-confidence, self-assurance, the clear-cut, direct, positive action, nodoubts or hesitations.The magnificent innocence—the untroubled purity—a pride which is serene, notaggressive—“the first man of ability who refused to feel guilty.”DAGNY TAGGARTProgression from enthusiastic activity, joy in working, brilliantself-confidence and belief in the triumph of the right (of intelligence andcompetence) —to a helpless bewilderment in the face of the parasites’ behaviorand motives—to a teeth-clenched determination to go ahead, ignoring them (end ofPart I, beginning of Part II)—to a slow realization of the truth, with a slowanger growing with the steps of this realization.Her full understanding of the issue and of the parasites is retarded because, asher anger grows, she comes to a stage of bitter contempt for them and refuses tothink about them any longer. Her attitude becomes: “To hell with all ofthem—they are not worth considering or examining—I am not interested in them andnever have been—so I will live for and think about my only interest: my work. Iwill deal with them only as I need them for my work, and I will use them forthat. I can use them, not vice versa, because I am intelligent and they’re not.They’ll serve my purposes, not I theirs.” And this is true, so long as she doesnot accept their terms or compromise with their principles anywhere in her workand in her relations with them. When she does—they win and they use her, becausethey are more consistent in the application of their own principles and becauseshe has placed her intelligence in their service, in the furtherance of theiraims and principles, and thus she has turned her great and only weapon—herintelligence—against herself.Thus, it is she who defeats herself—who makes it possible for her enemies todestroy her, to win. This is the pattern of the creators’ destruction ofthemselves through cooperation with parasites. You do not cooperate withparasites at any time. When and if you cooperate with a man, you can properly doso only to the degree that he can or is willing to act on the principles andterms of a creator in the particular activity or exchange involved. And no morethan that. No further. And the terms of a creator are: “Man as an end inhimself,” therefore every action must have a personal, selfish purpose oradvantage for every man involved in it, recognized and accepted as such by theothers involved in it.Does this mean that you depend on them, on waiting for their recognition of yourrights? No. You don’t have to deal with them; never primarily—only secondarily.So you merely refuse to deal with them, if they do not accept your terms. (Yourattitude is: “Take it or leave it.”)Those who can really be of help in the execution of your interests are onlythose who share your terms (or only to the extent that they do); they are theonly ones capable of being of value to you. The others are of no use to youwhatever. But you are of use to them (on your terms). (Their mistake is inthinking that they can make you of use to them—on their terms.) Hold out—andthey will accept your terms to the extent to which they can survive at all. Butgive in, compromise—and you destroy your work, aims, desires, happiness, andlife—you help them to last a while on the terms of evil, you postpone thejustice of [reality‘s] retribution against them, you serve as their shield—andthe end is only total destruction for you and for them. June 30, 1946To illustrate the preceding: Dagny’s whole problem is that she cannot find ablemen to work on the railroad she runs. Her very predicament disproves her ideathat she needs others, the stupid or inferior ones, for her purpose, andtherefore she must find some way to deal with them, must consider them orcompromise with them (she does not really believe it, only wonders about it, isbewildered on this point—but so many others do believe it, particularly theprofessor). The fact is that she cannot do anything with inferiors—the“cooperation” she wants can be achieved only with men of intelligence (to theextent of intelligence she needs from them).Cooperation can be done only on a level; if one attempts to do it “down,” onefails. If a person’s attitude is: “My superior intelligence has a great goal orproject in mind, but unfortunately I need dumbbells to carry out my orders, so Imust adjust myself to them in some way, scale down my ideas, principles andmethods”—that person is doomed to fail. If your project requires the services orcooperation of others, your only chance is to find those equal to the particulartask it requires of them; adjusting the great project down to those inferior totheir proposed part in it does not raise them, but merely destroys the project.Dagny needs men with whom she can deal on her own terms, the terms of thecreator, the terms of intelligence, capacity and independence—or she can donothing. What, then, is the proper interrelationship of men working on aproject, such as the building of a great skyscraper? They cooperate through andare held together by their various capacities—not their inferiorities. Thebricklayer has contributed his ability—but the architect has contributed a muchgreater ability: [he has provided] the opportunity for the exercise of theabilities of the others involved, and this must be acknowledged.What is the message to all men, implied in this? Live honestly and honorablywithin the limits and to the limits of your own ability—and give thanks to themen whose greater ability has made such a magnificent world possible for you(but remember that you were not the great man’s goal or motive). July 1, 1946HANK REARDENProgression: He works fiercely, enthusiastically—then feels guilty about it; heattempts to make up in the altruistic sense; he gives in to every accusation ofhis family. He loves Dagny and considers this his sin, his guilty passion—whilehis forced love for his wife he thinks to be virtuous, pure, idealistic.Part II: his slow awakening to the truth—his understanding of the parasites (hisfamily) and their motives—his understanding of his own value and that his sinshad been virtues. His realization that his love for Dagny was his best emotion(after he loses her). His anger against his family then becomes implacable,cold, set, merciless—with the same sense of justice which he had earlier turnedagainst himself. [This is AR’s first note on the romance between Rearden andDagny. ]JAMES TAGGARTProgression: from a smug, yet uneasy, satisfaction with his parasitical “topposition”—to bewilderment—to malicious restlessness (with people and inbusiness)—to a growing fear (Part II)—to panic, hysteria, and collapse.THE PROFESSORProgression: From a righteous (if slightly forced) idealism—to an attempt todrown himself in his work and shut out his uneasiness about the world—to thegradual, growing surrender to the parasites’ authority (spiritually and in hiswork)—to a growing fear of Galt (Part II)—to the cold viciousness of“self-protection,” accepting anything to justify his fatal mistake—to disaster. July 4, 1946EMOTIONAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS PART IThe love affair of Dagny and Rearden: first the mutual understanding—then hisefforts to avoid her—the affair—his sense of guilt—her simple, naturalacceptance—his growing love for her—her growing restlessness.Rearden and his wife: the last of his former love for her, now bewildered andforced. Her subtle campaign of torture, to pull him down.His efforts to atone to her for his love of Dagny.Rearden and his family: mother, sister and younger brother. The torture by theparasites—his constant “atonement.”The romance of James Taggart: his former unsatisfactory love life—meeting withCherryl—the romance and the “Cinderella Girl” campaign—their marriage—Cherryl’shatred and fear of Dagny—the first indication of what the marriage will be.Dagny and Eddie Willers: the comradeship.Dagny and James Taggart: all the stages of exploitation—deceit, cruelty, hatredon his part, bewilderment and contempt on hers.Dagny and Francisco d‘Anconia: the reluctant friendship.Taggart and the priest: the spiritual crutch.Dagny and Gerald Hastings.Rearden and the parasite whom he builds up (the mines).Rearden and his secretary.Taggart’s hatred for Rearden, and dislike for Mrs. Rearden, who despises him.The priest and the professor: a kind of spiritual cooperation.The professor’s disintegration: his “forced” idealism at his governmentlaboratory—flashback to how he got laboratory—progression of his work and of hischaracter toward [the support of] totalitarianism.PART IIDagny’s break with Rearden (and search for Galt).Dagny meets Gait—their night together.Dagny’s ultimatum to Galt.Dagny joins Galt.(Dagny and the professor.)(Dagny and d‘Anconia.)(Dagny and Eddie Willers.)(Dagny and Cherryl.)Scene where Rearden realizes that Dagny is his real love.Rearden discovers Mrs. Rearden’s affair with James Taggart.Taggart’s gradual destruction of Cherryl—and scene where she realizes his realnature.The love affair of Taggart and Mrs. Rearden.(Scene where Taggart confesses affair to priest, who forgives him.)Scene where professor realizes that Taggart is his master.Professor’s attempt to destroy Dagny.(Scene where professor curses priest.)Destruction of the professor.(Scene: the priest and Galt.)July 6, 1946OUTLINE PART II: THE BEGINNINGThe valley—John Galt.The “transportation pull” deal—TT gives its last grain cars to a soybean projectin the south, instead of to the desperately awaited wheat harvest in Minnesota.The deal is arranged by Cuffy Meigs, TT’s new executive (the looter), whoreceives huge, secret rake-off from the head of the project, his friend, one ofhis own kind. (Chester is involved in this and is behind the project. Itsannounced aim—“teach people to sacrifice,” to live on a lower standard.)James Taggart, by now, does anything Meigs tells him to. Taggart’s growing fear.Cherryl’s attempts at self-improvement. Dagny breaks with Rearden; she tells himshe loves another man—she does not say who. (“It was my fate to love theimpossible.”)Dagny fights desperately, ferociously against the southern deal—but undertakes,personally, to see that the soybean freight is delivered. Here is her crucialmistake—she does it to save the railroad; she contributes to its destruction,instead.The ride of the soybean freight: the tragic irony of magnificent energy andcompetence wasted on doing well a worthless and vicious undertaking. (Dagny, herbest engineers, Eddie Willers. The weather, the bad track, the last of the railreserves wasted to fix a useless line.) This is the last run of a train shown inthe story—showing a dying system, all the difficulties, impossibilities,inefficiencies involved. The next one—“The Comet”—cannot finish its run.The disaster resulting from this deal. The collapse of the whole farmingdistrict in Minnesota (“the last granary”): the rotting wheat, the bonfires ofwheat, the bankrupt farms, the desertions of whole families, trekking away intonowhere, the lines of carts on the roads (like war refugees, but much worse).Rearden loses heavily on the farm machinery—credits he had extended. (He wascounting on “help to success,” but help was given to failure.) The famine in therest of the country.The famine and desertions of workers at the ex-Rearden mine in Michigan.Parallel developments: Dagny’s search for Galt (Francisco d‘Anconia, the emptyvalley).Rearden and his wife—his realization that Dagny was his real love. His scenewith Dagny when he tells her that.James Taggart crushes Cherryl’s attempts to rise—she understands his realnature.Cherryl’s drowning plea to Dagny—the attempt to hang on to a living power.The circumstances (the result of their mutual problems above) that lead to theaffair of James Taggart and Mrs. Rearden. Their ghastly night together—thehorror of sex as second-handedness, as hatred, malice, and self-contempt.Taggart confesses the affair to the priest. The priest forgives him, but feelscrushingly uneasy afterwards.The tunnel collapse. The return to old tracks—the pre-tunnel era. The desperateneed of new track. Dagny’s worry over the Taggart Bridge.The professor. Reduction of his laboratory funds. Talk of using his“vibration-ray” against “isolationist” sections. The scene where the professorrealizes that Taggart is his master. The professor is demoted—the “determinist”assistant is put in charge of the laboratory.The rebellion of [Rearden‘s] secretary against her family—her decision to quitand marry.Rearden discovers Mrs. Rearden’s affair with Taggart. Connected with sameevent—he sees the real nature of his mother, brother, and sister, and of theirattitudes toward him.Immediately following—the crucial emergency conference: Rearden, Taggart,mine-owner, businessman, bureaucrat. Subject—the new rails for TT. Taggart hasraised the rates on the Minnesota line, due to the farm collapse. The mine-ownerhas raised the price of ore. The bureaucrat does not allow Rearden to raise hisprices on rails (“TT can’t afford it”). The squeeze-play in the open. Rearden isgiven an impossible burden—because he is the strongest; it is made impossiblefor him to function—because they so desperately need him to function. Thecrucial line (from Taggart): “You’ll do something.” Now Rearden sees (though notyet in words). He says nothing and walks out of the room.Rearden in his office—the crushing realization that he will know the truth(which he already knows) at any moment now. His secretary comes in for thepromised appointment. She tells him she is quitting—and why. He sees thesimilarity of their tragedies. He understands everything.... He is ready toleave the office, when she tells him about the man waiting to see him. The namein the sealed envelope. “It must be a gag.... Send him in, I’ll see him. Whatdoes he look like?” “Like something made out of a kind of aluminum-copperalloy.”The news that Rearden has quit. The reaction of Dagny and Taggart— Taggart’sterror. He rushes to Lillian Rearden—to make her beg Rearden to remain.The scene where Lillian Rearden, his mother, brother, and sister beg Rearden toremain. His immovable coldness—they are dead for him, the sense of justiceturned against them. He goes away (to the valley).The scene with his brother and Rearden’s superintendent. The superintendentquits, with his staff.The scene in which a lawyer reads Rearden’s deed to the collective: Mrs.Rearden, mother, brother, sister, and the publicity punk. The parasites “withtheir clothes off”—the naked truth about them. (Mrs. Rearden wishing to sell hershare—the predicament of collective ownership.)The collective hires a friend of Cuffy Meigs as executive. Half the workers havedeserted. The executive sells the remaining supplies and crucial machinery, onthe side, then vanishes. The collapse of Rearden Steel.The final emergency to TT—no Rearden rails to come. The small banquet—Dagny,James Taggart, bureaucrat, businessman, Meigs, Mr. Jones. The decision to closethe Wisconsin-Michigan ore line. Dagny’s desperate, almost screaming protests.Their arguments about “sharing hardships” and “the government needs atranscontinental line.” They outvote her. She escapes from the room in horror.Dagny in the subway. John Galt. She sits crying—and the bum who consoles her(“Oh well, who is John Galt?”). Toward morning, Galt comes back—they go to hisroom—their night together.Dagny’s challenge to him—his explanation. (“No, there is no conflict—there nevercan be—as you will learn.”)The closing of the ore line announced—the riots—the fights for the rails—thegeneral panic.Dagny-Galt: the “enemy romance.”(?)The announced president’s broadcast. In radio studio—president, Dagny, Taggart,the professor (perhaps some of the lesser ones, too). The machinery won’tfunction. Then—John Galt’s voice. (A gasp and a scream in the studio—the gaspfrom Dagny, the scream from the professor.) John Galt’s broadcast.Scene in subway with phone booth, afterwards.The panic—the country falling apart. The professor’s hysteria—scene where hedemands that the priest curse Galt—the priest refuses.Government’s attempts to negotiate with Galt, by short-wave. His refusal. Secretorders to find him.The scene: Galt and the priest, in the restaurant. The appeal through pity. Hisrefusal.Dagny comes to Galt’s garret. The appeal through love—his refusal. Then shewarns him—he hands her the phone. (“I was waiting to be found—I didn’t know itwould be you. But it had to be.”) She notifies the government.Dagny returns to Galt’s room, with the police, hoping he will be gone. But he isthere. The “polite” arrest—the wreck of his laboratory. (“What was in it? You’llnever know.”)Galt in a luxurious hotel room. The private bargaining: Galt and Mr. Jones—“Whatare you after?” Galt’s refusal. When Mr. Jones asks is there anything he wouldlike, he answers: yes, he would like to speak to the professor.The scene: Galt and the professor. “John, I had a good motive!” The boy ofeighteen and the sentence about the supremacy of reason. “Why don’t you saysomething?” “You’ve said it all.” The professor escapes from the room, in totalspiritual collapse.The professor tells the others that they cannot let Galt rule, they must destroyhim. Professor is placed under “protective custody.” He escapes.Scene: Dagny and Rearden. Rearden is on Galt’s side—Dagny confesses to him thatshe is Galt’s mistress.Scene: Dagny and Eddie Willers, when he leaves for California (by plane) to“save” the Comet. He realizes that he’s always loved her.Galt is ordered to dress in evening clothes and driven to a banquet room. Thebanquet. The appeal through flattery. The miserable and ludicrous mixture ofcrawling before him and arrogance in the implication of the value of theiradmiration. His answer, over the radio: “Get the hell out of my way.”The professor hears the broadcast over his car radio as he speeds toward thelaboratory. He realizes that Galt’s refusal is more frightening than hisacceptance would have been. The “determinist” and Meigs-types of “guards” willnot let the professor into the laboratory. He wants the ray to destroy Galt.(“He’s won! Don’t you understand? He’s won, because he’s refused!”) He screamsthat Galt is the enemy, because he is the mind. “That’s right,” says one of theguards. “And what are you?” The explosion of the laboratory—the end of the rayand of the professor. (The “thing of screaming pain”—and the greater horror ofone spark remaining within it to remember that this had been a great mind.)The scene is a bare hotel room—Taggart, businessman, bureaucrat, Meigs, Dagny.Galt has been locked back in his room. The “soundless hysteria” : the quiet,brief discussion, which has but one meaning, they all know it—the resort toforce (with the unstated knowledge that the mere premise of such an attempt isinsane). They avoid Dagny—her presence is restraining them, they don’t want herto understand. But Dagny is cold, silent, emotionless—strangely detached. Sheunderstands, and much more than they do (she understands what they willunderstand in the torture scene). She gets up unexpectedly, without a word, andwalks out of the room.Dagny alone in her office in the TT building (night). The emotionless,methodical burning of her papers. The long-distance call from EddieWillers—trouble for the Comet. She tells him, quietly, to quit. He can’t. (Buthe knew she would: “You, too?”)As she hangs up and proceeds with her burning, an executive rushes in with areport on danger to the Taggart Bridge: a new crack is reported—a storm isrising on the Mississippi—and a crucially awaited heavy freight train isapproaching the bridge. Before the man finishes, she leaps to the phone; in thetime it takes her to reach her desk, she sees the consequences of the bridge’scollapse and the remedy to save it; she sees Nat Taggart and the whole ofTaggart Transcontinental. Then, slowly, with a twisted movement of her arm, shereplaces the receiver. “What are we going to do, Miss Taggart? We don’t knowwhat to do!” She thinks: This is it ... I didn’t know it would be so hard....She answers: “I don‘t, either.”The torture of Galt. The reaction of the parasites—particularly Taggart. Galtlaughs at them, pointing out the contradiction of their predicament. Theirconcern not to kill him (except Taggart: he is passive here—he is seeing thefirst hints of what he is to discover). The electric engine breaks down. Galttells them about holding creators through their joy of living. “Go ahead, turnon the electric current.” The mechanic cannot repair the machine—he asks forTaggart’s instructions. The parasites’ answer—“Do something.” Galt tells himwhat to do. The mechanic obeys dazedly—the machine works. The mechanic looks atGalt—at the parasites—then drops his tools and runs away in terror. Galt laughs.Meigs seizes the engine, to operate it. The businessman whines: “Don’t killhim!” Taggart cries suddenly: “Make him scream!” The stunned, embarrassedsilence; they all sense what Taggart sees completely in that moment. Taggartfalls back against the wall, white-faced; he is done for. Meigs turns on thecurrent. A man rushes in to announce the collapse of the Taggart Bridge. Galt’smoment of involuntary temptation. They stop the torture and rush out, realizingthe implications, each to save himself. Taggart has not even heard the news; heis fixed on his discovery.Taggart and the priest. The confession of total evil and the plea forabsolution. “I have nothing to say, James. I’m on strike.”The rescue of Galt by Dagny. (Brute force against mind and force.) He looks upat her, smiling in that complete deliverance which she knows. He says: “We neverhad to take any of it seriously, did we?” Tears streaming down her face,smiling, she answers: “No, we never had to.”The flight of Galt and Dagny to the valley, over a world where the lights aregoing out.The last run of the Comet. Eddie Willers—against the world. The stop in thedesert. (“Dagny, in the name of the best within us! ...”) The encroachingnature—the return of the jungle. Eddie Willers sobbing on the tracks, under themotionless ray of the headlight that shoots out to get lost in a dead night.The music of the composer’s “Heroic Symphony” filling the valley and rising outof it to the night sky. Rearden, d‘Anconia, Danneskjöld, Hastings at work—thecontrol of nature, the triumph over nature. Talk about future plans, startingeverything from the beginning, in a small, selfish way. “Galt will run the localrailroad from New York to Philadelphia.” Galt and Dagny on the rocks above thevalley—looking off at the wrecked road and the stubborn fire in the distance.Galt says: “The road is cleared. We’re going back.” July 7, 1946THREE MAIN LINES FOR PART II. THE GRADUAL DISAPPEARANCE OF THE CREATORS.They are pulled out on strike at crucial moments in the story—in connection withTT’s disintegration. Each time, the loss is a specific blow to TT (as inRearden’s quitting). Preferably, each desertion must cause a specific step lowerfor TT. The men can be TT’s big executives, or key suppliers, or key shippers(or one of each). Each time, the loss of one man in a business causes failurefor all the others in it. (Probably four instances, at the most—but clear-cut,crucial ones.)Show Dagny seeing her net of rails breaking and falling apart in her hands. Ifthe strikers are the life blood of the world, then TT is the world’s bloodsystem; as the blood goes, the vessels shrink, emptied, and dry off; then thebody withers, in growing paralysis. By the time Dagny finds that Galt is a minoremployee of hers, she has realized, in despair, that TT is a dying net ofvessels without blood. (And Galt is the one who watches the operations of TT andknows when, where, and whom to strike.)II. DAGNY’S QUEST IN CONNECTION WITH GALT’S OLD ENGINE.There are two lines of search on her part. First, trying to find someone tounderstand the importance of the engine, to restore it and make it work. This isfutile, except for Rearden (or, every time she has a chance at a good engineer,Taggart ruins it). Second, trying to trace its history and find the man whodesigned it. Here there is a chance for flashbacks, in strange, half mysterioushints and conversations, a chance for a gradual movement of Dagny toward Galt.And a chance to show all the variations of the parasites’ attitude toward brainsand achievement, and toward material property.III. “WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE WORLD?”This is the overall, miserably bewildered question in all the minds, butparticularly in Dagny’s (and, next, in Eddie Willers‘). This must be conveyed insmall touches, small but tremendously significant in unstated implications. Herethere is a chance for such things as: the music, “the cigarette made nowhere”(or some such equivalent, an extremely well-made small gadget that could nothave been made in the factories and by the industries which Dagny knows), thegirl-writer’s book “published nowhere,” etc. The feeling of “Ergitandal”—justexactly that—first, with the hopeless yearning of an impossible dream—thengrowing into an ominous reality (ominous in being inexplicably realsomewhere)—leading to and climaxed by Dagny in the valley. [What “Ergitandal”refers to is unknown.]189 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_189_r1.jpg]Galt as a TT employee. Either: night watchman for TT’s research laboratory ; ortrack walker; or switchman on lonely division; or plain laborer in the repairyard, which is connected with the laboratory; or terminal worker in theunderground tunnels of the main terminal in New York. (If this last—then theirfirst love scene is in the underground tunnels that vibrate with the motion ofthe great city above.)Galt’s reason for being an obscure TT employee: he chose TT for the same reasonI did, as the crucial blood system that gives him access to the whole economy ofthe country; by stopping TT and the key industries connected with it, he canstop the world. But while working on TT, he has fallen in love with DagnyTaggart, long before she meets him (he knows all about her activities and hercharacter, and he has seen her in person many times). That is his conflict. Heknows that he is her worst enemy, in her terms, her secret destroyer—but heknows that he must go on. (This is reflected in his attitude toward her in thevalley—but we actually learn it much later, when she does, in Part II.)BITS FOR PART IChapter II: “The Theme.” Dagny on the train—listening to the “Heroic Concerto.”The young porter—his evasive answers. The railroad incident where we learn whoshe is. When they reach the underground terminal in New York—the sense ofexaltation returns to her. As she gets off the train, she is whistling theConcerto. She feels someone looking at her—turns—the younger porter is staringat her tensely.This music is then used twice again: when Dagny approaches the houses of thevalley—and at the very end. (Unless the strikers use it for a code signal.)([Note added some time later:] “The Concerto of Deliverance.”)190 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_190_r1.jpg]The gold dollar sign placed by Francisco d‘Anconia at the entrance to thevalley.191 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_191_r1.jpg]The oil man whose wells are “nationalized” (directly or indirectly) quits andsets fire to the wells. One gusher—the best—cannot be extinguished. It remainsflaming for years, to the end of the story. (The constant reflection of the redglow—the reminder, like the calendar.) At the end—this is the stubborn firewhich Galt sees in the distance. (“Wyatt’s torch.”) July 9, 1946NOTES FOR PART II (TENTATIVE)GALT AND DAGNYHe is the lowest kind of track laborer in the underground tunnels of the TaggartTerminal.They meet when she is called there because the signal-switch system has brokendown; there is no one to repair it—and no one takes the initiative on what todo. (This occurs after a sequence where Dagny was in despair over her inabilityto find intelligence and competence.)The love affair in the underground tunnels.She learns that he has loved her for years—and that he is her worst enemy. (Shetries to stop him from “getting” someone—perhaps Rearden.)The scene where Dagny and important leaders (Mr. Jones) are held up in a trainstalled in the Taggart Terminal tunnels. They are discussing importantcollectivist measures to come. She glances out of the window. Galt is standingby the switch, holding a red lantern.After the broadcast, Dagny returns to her own ofnce—and finds Galt waiting forher. He tells her that she must leave with him—hell is going to break loose now.She wants to remain. Then, he will remain, too; all the others have left; but hewill save her—or go down with her. He tells her she can always find him at hisjob—and leaves.After the desperate search for him—Dagny comes to Galt’s garret. She begs him tohelp them, to save TT—the temptation through love. He refuses. She asks him toescape—or she will betray him. He hands her the phone. July 10, 1946NOTES FOR PART I: THE “THREE MAIN LINES ”I. The gradual disappearance of the creators.Galt “gets”:Railroad men:Dagny’s Operating (?) Manager (which causes traffic snarl).Dagny’s Freight Manager (which causes loss of crucial freight).Dagny’s Traffic Manager (which causes death of section).Chief Engineer (loss of tunnel and bridge).Inventor or young engineer (resorting to old engines).Shippers and suppliers:Oil man—lack of fuel which [leads to the] end of diesels. (The burning well—nearthe future dead section.)Lumber man—lack of ties, cars, terminal buildings.Utility man (electricity)—New York loses electricity near the end (tie withTaggart surrendering power plant to “the city”).III. “What is wrong with the world? ”The music (“Heroic Concerto”).The book (part of a book, found by Dagny, “published nowhere”).The flashlight: the small gadget with immense significance. This is a goodexample of the fact that technical civilization is an end product ofintellectual civilization. (Have d‘Anconia make some crack about this, such as:“Who made this flashlight? The idea that a table is a table.”)The way the key people quit.The actions of Francisco d‘Anconia.The incident of Ragnar Danneskjöld’s refusal.The cigarettes.July 12, 1946Here is the state of TT at beginning of Part II:The system has shrunk to little more than a single transcontinental line—largelyuseless (because the productive areas on its route have been killed) and unableto pay its own cost.The desperate need for Rearden Steel rails—the track is hopelessly worn out.Schedules are hopelessly mixed—nobody now expects a train to be on time.Therefore, people (producers and shippers) are not counting on trains anylonger. (Breakdowns of signals, equipment, and lack of supplies.) Trains areexpensive, dangerous, uncomfortable, unreliable.Most of TT’s main shippers are gone.The Taggart Bridge is in a desperately precarious condition.Refrigerator cars and tank cars are gone. Sleepers and heating are eliminated atthe end of Part I. Air-conditioning is long since gone. (Water and lighting goin Part II.)Diesels are gone—Old steam locomotives are run with coal—and there is a firstreturn to the use of plain wood (if this is technically feasible).The Taggart “research laboratory ” is gone.POSSIBLE LINE:Dagny is searching desperately for the genius who invented the motor. She issearching also for the mysterious enemy who is destroying TT. When she traps theenemy, to deliver him to those who will destroy him, she discovers that he isthe genius who designed the motor, the man she wanted. July 17, 1946FOR PART IThe ending: Either the freight car manufacturer has quit, or Dagny is afraid hewill; he is the last good man left in that line and something has just happenedto “put the burden on him.” Dagny hurries to stop him. She arrives too late; shesees his plane taking off at the airport. She follows.Before that: she hurries by train, but this is “the frozen ride,” so she can’tmake it. She escapes from the abandoned train, steals or buys someone’s plane,and goes on to the small town of the car manufacturer.The “frozen ride”: wrong signals, wrong switches, burned-out brakes—every kindof lesser sabotage. It ends with the train being abandoned in the middle of aplain at night. Half an hour or more passes before Dagny finds out that they areabandoned. Nobody else cares. (This is a complete example, “in a teaspoon,” of afrozen, parasite society.)The “freeze” [Directive 10-289] is applied because Taggart and the otherparasites cannot find people to take positions of responsibility, and there is awave of quitting and pleas for demotion. This happens because of thedouble-cross.The “double-cross” is that Taggart’s executive assistant (a deliberately chosenpatsy) and a train engineer are blamed for the tunnel catastrophe and convictedof manslaughter.The tunnel catastrophe: a parasite, who is in charge at a station where a dieselengine breaks down, sends a passenger train into the tunnel with an old steamengine. The tunnel is in bad condition; its ventilation system doesn’t work. Theengine cannot quite handle the grade in the tunnel—the passengers begin tochoke—a fool panics and pulls the brake-cord—the train cannot get started again.A freight train, loaded with explosives, is speeding through the tunnel (becauseof the poor ventilation) and smashes into the stalled train. The explosionwrecks the tunnel for good. (After this, Dagny has to organize the “return topre-tunnel days,” using the old track.) The oil sequence. A single successful oil man buys a whole section of country.(This is a mountain region, not too far from the valley.) He is using, forshipping, the efficient railroad of Taggart’s competitor. Taggart whines thathis branch line would be all right ( it is losing money) if it weren’t for the“destructive” competition. Taggart has a law passed (or a railroad associationvote) about “duplication” and “seniority.” His line is the oldest, so he remainsand the competitor is forced out. The oil man goes frantic with Taggart’s poorservice: endless delays and uncertainty, no cars when needed, lost cars,accidents. (Accidents are always claimed to be “acts of God.” Here someoneremarks: “Funny how active God’s getting to be lately,” and is answered: “Healways is when man isn’t.”) The oil man loses a great deal of business (andindustries are forced to close) because he cannot deliver the oil on time.(Taggart’s poor freight service makes prices rise in the oil town. The workersdemand a raise, and the oil man is ordered to grant it, while not being allowedto raise the price of oil. Or—the oil man wants to build his own railroad line,and he is not allowed to, on grounds of “monopoly.”) He quits, setting fire tohis wells.Less than a year later, Taggart has to close his branch line because there is nobusiness in this section; the industries supported by and dependent on theoil-field have closed or moved away. This is the “death of a section”—the smallfarmers, shop owners, and workers are left behind and find themselves withouttransportation to the outside world. (These are the people who believe thatsmall private property is all right, but big fortunes should be limited.)The young man who wants to organize a “pony express.” He is asked: “So you wantto make money on the community misfortune?” The community passes rules: specialrates on babies’ milk, priorities on food, free rides for the unemployed, etc.That evening, a stranger comes to town. He is present at the town meeting. Inthe morning, the young man has disappeared with the stranger.There are earlier references to “dead sections.” The first one we see is whenDagny goes to the abandoned motor factory. (So later, in the above sequence, thereaders know what is in store for the inhabitants of the town.) The iron ore squeeze. Parasite steel manufacturers [accuse] Rearden of“destructive competition” because he owns his own mine. Mrs. Rearden’s petparasite enlists the help of Taggart—the deal being that the parasite willacquire the mine and give Taggart the ore freight business, instead of shippingit by lake boats (which is much cheaper). Taggart and the others get a lawpassed that no business can own another business. Rearden has to sell themine—and Mrs. Rearden pushes him into selling it to the parasite. The parasitehas no money (except a government loan for the down payment), so Rearden has totake a time-payment arrangement.Taggart gets the transportation business from the mine and this destroys thelake shipping. Later, in Part II, close to Rearden’s final awakening, there isan emergency when the parasite is making a mess of the mine and it is running ata loss; Mrs. Rearden urges Rearden to “give the man a hand,” teach him how torun the mine—“since, after all, you’ll lose money if the mine goes bankrupt.”This is when Rearden has a fit of fury, his first one against his wife; herealizes that he is asked to make the man a present of the mine that he,Rearden, created, and also teach the bastard how to use his own stolen property.Rearden refuses. This is one of the important steps to his awakening.Later, when the wheat section is destroyed, Taggart raises freight rates on theore (there is no lake shipping available)—the parasite raises the price ofore—yet Rearden is not allowed to raise the price of steel. “You’ll dosomething.”An incident in which Dagny tries to stop an important shipper from quitting—andit is too late. While she waits in the anteroom, Galt is in the man’s office.(We don’t know this, of course.) Galt leaves through another door, not throughthe anteroom. By the time Dagny is admitted into the office, it is too late: theman has decided to quit. The Francisco d‘Anconia disaster: D’Anconia has made a big deal with Taggart tobuild a branch line for his new copper mine in Mexico. Taggart builds it, atgreat expense, because he is appeasing the Mexican government. The Mexicangovernment nationalizes the line and the mine. D‘Anconia loses more thanTaggart, but he has made the mine worthless. Dagny realizes that it was done onpurpose. (Taggart’s motive was the typical one: not any actual facts thatd’Anconia presented, but that d‘Anconia presented them.) (After that, d’Anconiacannot deliver the copper which TT needs. He uses the weakest shipping companyhe can find, in order to “help” them-the ships sink. Previously, he had usedHastings’ ships.)Minor possibility: the cigarettes with the dollar sign are used as a code signalamong the strikers. Possibility: Galt, who is getting most of his information through Eddie Willers,learns from him about Dagny’s affair with Rearden. Eddie is the only one whoknows of it—he is jealous, [but] doesn’t realize it. He confesses it toGalt—while he, Eddie, is drunk. (“What’s that to me—if Dagny Taggart is sleepingwith Hank Rearden?”) Possibility: Dagny calls on Francisco d‘Anconia and Ragnar Danneskjöld to helpher save Galt. They have remained in the city, without Galt’s knowledge orapproval, to stand by him and save him when necessary. When Dagny callsd’Anconia (from a pay booth), he tells her that he expected her call. When hecomes to meet her, she makes the sign of the dollar with her fingers, smiling,even though she wants to cry. July 18, 1946The reason that society does not collapse into civil war and violence in mystory (as it would have in historical reality) is that even a civil war iscaused by some element of independence in men, some active impulse, no matterhow misguided. It is the element of decision which makes men revolt, even ifblindly, because they realize that conditions are unbearable, cannot be allowedto go on and something must be done. So they resort to violence, in sheer angerand despair—violence being the only resort against the parasites (since reasonis what the parasites have discarded, and since they rely on and advocateviolence).So it is still some kind of creator, a man of action or decision to some extent,who is necessary to lead men into revolt and civil war. This is what happens inhistory when collectivism, the rule of the parasite, becomes unbearable.(Besides, it is the parasites who resort to force when they need more loot andhope to make men produce for them through terror.) Actually, in history,societies are a mixture—no principle is observed consistently, and individualismis allowed to function by default. This is what holds the creators in society,their hope for that accidental chance. But this is no longer true of moderncollectivism, such as Russia or Germany.(A good sidelight here: there are only two possible incentives for humanactions: desire for gain, or fear. But fear does not work, except for a while onthe most miserable level of subsistence and then only while there is still theproduction of free men to loot or copy (and it works only on the worst, i.e.,useless, types of men). So, actually, there is but one incentive for men:gain—personal desire.)In my story, the creators do not try to cooperate with a parasite-ruled societyto the point of the unbearable, then revolt, as they do in history. The creatorshave withdrawn. What is left of humanity without them is capable neither ofproduction nor revolt. Therefore, the end of the world, in my story, is not oneof violence, but of slow rot: disintegration, corruption, a dead body falling topieces (and a society without functioning intelligence is a dead body). It mustbe the rot of stagnation, of hopeless decay, of the gray, the dull, the trite.(Keep this firmly in mind. Don’t have too much emotional violence in Taggart andhis kind; even their crises and tragedies are gray rot.) Without the creators,the world simply stops.It is merely indicated that the parasites would like to resort to violence, thatit is their natural course, their essence, and their last hope. This is shown inthe torture scene, in the sequences relating to the professor’s laboratory, andin small, dreadful hints about their intentions, from the Cuffy Meigs types, aswell as from “Chester” or “the businessman.” But they have nothing to doviolence to—the creators have withdrawn beyond their reach and left theparasites to their fate (instead of fighting them in the open), to show themwhat that fate will be. And what’s left of humanity is a miserable, shiveringherd, not worth terrorizing, because they are already in terror and will obeywithout violence; in fact, they ask nothing but to obey; but there’s no onethere to teach the parasites what orders to give. The remnant herd is not worthruling—they can produce nothing for the parasites to loot.All this must be brought out explicitly.192 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_192_r1.jpg]It is the abstract thinkers who go on strike first—since production and all therest stems from them. Therefore, by the time the story begins, the abstractthinkers are gone already: there are no philosophers and no theoreticalscientists. This is shown in the state of the Taggart laboratory, of theprofessor’s State laboratory, and in the prominence of the “Fadiman type” of“philosopher.” [As noted earlier, Clifton Fadiman was book editor of The NewYorker.]Note on Galt (in connection with above): Make clear that Galt is that rarephenomenon (perhaps, the rarest)—a philosopher and inventor at once, both athinker and a man of action. That is why he is the perfect man, the perfectlyintegrated being. One indication of this—the fact that in college Galt was thestar pupil of both the philosopher and the [physics] professor. In fact, Galtwas the only student who took such a peculiar (to the college authorities andthe time) combination of courses.

Galt says: “The road is cleared. We are going back.” The sign ofthe dollar. [The above outline contains AR’s last references to the priest. Years aftercompleting the novel, she explained the meaning of the character and why shedecided to eliminate him.I wanted to illustrate the evil of the morality of forgiveness. Also, I wantedto illustrate that the power of religion consists of the power of morality, thepower of setting values and ideals, and that is what holds people toreligion—and that this is what belongs to philosophy, not to religion. As atype, I wanted [the priest] to be my most glamorized projection of a Thomistphilosopher, of a man who thought he could combine reason with religion. Throughhis relationship with James Taggart I wanted to show the way in which herealized that he was sanctioning evil. And the drama of him refusing to sanctionTaggart at the end appealed to me very much. But it did not take me very long to realize that it would be an impossibleconfusion.

His father was one of TT’s mostimportant and reliable shippers, one of their mainstays. (This can be lumber,cotton, or some other basic commodity.)Possibility—the “crucial train run,” which fails for reasons of parasites’technique, may precede and motivate either Wyatt’s quitting or the closing ofthe oil line.Don’t forget to stress (near the middle of Part I) that Dagny begins to suspectthe existence of an enemy who is destroying TT.

August 31, 1946NOTES FOR RAILROAD BUSINESSJames Taggart: President—head of Executive Department under alleged authority ofBoard of Directors (which is really concerned with corporate, not railroadmatters).One of [Taggart‘s] chief-assistants, or vice-presidents, is the Public Relationsman (extra-parasite) (“not to do, but to give the impression of doing”).Dagny Taggart: Vice-President in charge of Operating Department. (Trafficinvolves selling the service; operating involves producing the service.)Three main jobs of railroads: Maintenance of way, maintenance of equipment,transportation.Divisions, districts, and regions have the same three departments.193 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_193_r1.jpg]PHILOSOPHICAL POINTSThe people in the story are functioning, in their human moments, on old premisesand principles, i.e., on the principles left over from the creators’ world, theprinciples of the strikers—to the extent to which they exist and function ashuman beings at all. They do not realize it, of course. Their avowed principlesare those of collectivism and altruism. But whenever they have to act upon, orrely upon, or appeal to, decency or sense—they are implying the principles ofthe creators. This has a desperate quality—particularly when someone points itout to them; they are counting on the ideas they have denounced and discarded.(Example: any appeal to honesty, honor, integrity, rational sense—or personalprofit. Along these lines: Francisco d‘Anconia pointing out the mistake ofassuming that he wishes to make money.)194 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_194_r1.jpg]Unions and trade-associations are not directed against employers or the publicbut against the best among their own members. (Stress this explicitly—in therailroad association’s vote against Taggart’s better competitor; in the steelassociation’s actions against Rearden and his patent; in the union’s policyregarding the new oil line and its speed.) This is one of the most obviousdemonstrations of the fact that collectivism does not aim at any kind of“justice” or “fair play” or protection of the weak [man] against any actualinfringement of his rights by the strong—but simply at stopping the strong forthe sake of the weak—stopping ability for the sake of incompetence—not justrobbing the production of the able, but stopping him from producing—not raisingthe weak in any way whatever, but simply forcing the strong down to the level ofthe moron. (Of course, if you do that, you destroy the world—weak and strongboth. And the weak do not profit by this—not even for the moment.)195 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_195_r1.jpg]Regarding controlled economies: Man will not produce if all the essentialelements involved are not under his rational control, i.e., if they are notunderstandable to him, and, therefore, predictable, so that he can set hispurpose and plan of action, his end and means, accordingly. Nature is under hiscontrol—“other men” are not. If his productive activity has to depend upon thearbitrary decision or whim of some human agency, against whom he has no recourseand no choice (such as the government)—he will not produce.This is why men can deal with a private utility company; they have an objective,mutual element to count upon—private profit, for both; both have something theother needs. But if electric power were nationalized, its best users, thebiggest industrialists (and particularly new ventures that need electricity),would stop. A great industrialist is not going to venture into a hugeundertaking when the ground can be cut from under him at any moment—when thesole source of electric power, which he needs, can be cut off arbitrarily bysome punk bureaucrat. Never mind the fact that the bureaucrat won’t cut it off,in most likely practice; the fact that he can is enough; he knows it and theindustrialist knows it—and the bureaucrat has the power of blackmail, the powerto demand anything he wishes, without the necessity of making a threat. Yes,second-rate businessmen, of the second-hand kind, would accept such anarrangement and even love it; they’d get special advantages or rates forthemselves, they’d be glad to pay off the bureaucrat, they’d consider him theirtool. But a real industrialist will not do it. He knows who holds the power insuch a set-up.Also: man will not produce if the essential motivation to consider is not hisown profit. In a free economy, no one can ask him to work at a loss; this isonly the economic aspect of a much more important fact—nobody can ask him towork for his own detriment or to struggle toward his own suffering or pain. In acollectivist economy, he must do just that; he must work without reward—and,when the collective wishes, toward his own destruction. The motivation is notprofit—but self-sacrifice.196 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_196_r1.jpg]Rearden realizes that his mistake (about himself and his view of life) was dueto the “strike” of the philosopher.Scene of “common man” crying: “Why are they doing this to us? We thought ourleaders knew what they were doing!”—and someone answering: “Those abstract,theoretical philosophers, whom you have always considered useless, are the onlyones who can give men that knowledge.”197 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_197_r1.jpg]The prevalence of “Oriental” philosophies in the parasites’ world: These are thekind of ideas the parasites would love (and even originate). Show the despairthese ideas create in them and in their world. “Nothing is anything”—“We can’tbe sure of anything”—“Why do you think you think? ”—“Obey, since you can’tthink”—“Feel, don’t think”—“Act spontaneously, don’t think”—“ ‘Immediate’perception, not thinking or reason”—“The present moment, not any long-rangeview”—“You are nothing anyway, so why worry about anything?” —“You are low andvile anyway, so why worry about virtue?”—“Sacrifice and suffering are aUniversal Law”—“The individual is an illusion” —“Total annihilation (Nirvana) isthe supreme ideal.”(Show the influence of this on: Taggart’s wife, Mrs. Rearden, Stacey, Rearden’sbrother, the secretary, Eddie Willers, Taggart and his parasite friends. Alsoshow how the professor comes to this [philosophy].)198 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_198_r1.jpg]The arrogance of the “common man”: he expects “to be convinced,” with no mentaleffort on his own part. When confronted with the most lucid and explicit speech,idea, statement, or book—he simply declares that “he is not convinced,” and thissaves him from the necessity of taking a stand, of pronouncing an independentrational judgment. It saves him even from recognizing that the argument isunanswerable, so he must do something about it; he tells himself that since he’s“not convinced,” there must be something wrong with the argument, it’s notabsolute, he doesn’t have to do anything about it. (So, of course, he will neverlet himself be convinced. Actually, he simply does not think at all and does notgive the argument any sort of rational consideration.)He wants mental food to be pre-digested and automatic. Also—he is firmlyconvinced that the main job of the thinkers (perhaps, the only job) is toconvince him, to educate him. If asked how one could go about educating him (ormaking him understand anything), his answer would be: “I don’t know. That’s yourjob. You’ve got to educate me—both give me the right ideas and invent a way toconvince me that they are the right ideas. I’m the aim of all society and allexistence, ain’t I? You’re the strong, intellectually—I’ m the weak. Your moralduty and only goal in life is to help me. Well, help me.” (This is the “Adrianattitude.”)199 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_199_r1.jpg]An extremely important point of the parasite’s philosophy: the desire to exploitthe creators and also make them take the blame for the moral evil of such asituation.This is more prevalent and more vicious than I suspected. I have mentioned oneaspect of it: the parasite’s demand that the creator, whom he exploits, must notadmit that it’s exploitation; to protect the parasite’s feelings, the creatormust fake reality. There are others. The parasite who accepts an unearned favortries invariably to fake things so as to make it look as if it’s his benefactorwho is accepting favors. This is always the case when a person moves intosomeone’s house, starts doing housework, then yells that the host exploits him(Monica). The parasite cannot accept a favor as a favor—simply and gratefully,as would happen between equals. The parasite resents the favor because he knowshis own motive; it is not a plain favor, or a single incident, or a temporarycondition—but his permanent way of living, which he knows to be exploitation. Hedoes not help his host as a return courtesy; he does it to fool himself in hisown mind, and to reverse the tables—to claim that the host is indebted to him.The desire here is not to return a courtesy, but to make the benefactor evil orguilty; the motive is not gratitude, but malice. And it is not even a desire togain self-respect, except most indirectly and viciously: not through raisinghimself, but through debasing the host.In a wider, philosophical sense, this vicious reversal is shown in all thecollectivist patter about the great men and geniuses being only the product (orvoices, or plagiarizers) of the people (or the nation, or the era, or the race,or humanity). This makes the “common men” the creators or source of everything(in some manner which is never stated, explained, or defined), while the geniusis only their creature, their mouthpiece—the robot directed by their power, fedby their “spirit.” Now, in fact, the exact opposite is true: the “common men”move and live on the ideas, discoveries, and mental energy of the creators, theoriginators, the geniuses.(Perhaps the parasites, the collectivists, are conscious of this—perhaps theyactually know and recognize the theme of my story—and those vicious theories ofreversal are their answer, their protection. Perhaps John Galt’s accusation—andthe awakening of the strikers—is what they dread most.)This parasites’ psychology leads to the attitude which I must blast above all:“It is not only your duty to serve the world, but also to suffer for doing it,to be tortured by those you serve, for the privilege of serving them. ”This is what the parasite offers to the creator as the sublime virtue. “Virtueis all you’ll have, since you’re a hero, aren’t you? I’ll have everything else.”Translated into the parasite’s morality, this is what it amounts to: “I needyou, because you’re my superior. For that same reason, I hate you. If I can havethe satisfaction of torturing you for the advantages you give me, I’ll have bothsatisfactions, the spiritual and the material; I’ll be happy—and you’ll be trulyaltruistic. You’ll let me exploit you—and absolve me of the moral blame. Evilmust be paid for by suffering—so you’ll pay for my sin. You’ll do the suffering.In permitting me to hate you and torture you, you will save me from the painfulknowledge of your greatness and my smallness, of your virtue and my depravity.You will feed both my body and my spirit—at the expense of yours. I am incapableof your kind of happiness and I cannot bear the sight of it, since it is areproach to me—so you will renounce it for my sake. You are a creature ofjoy—and I, a creature of suffering. So you will choose suffering—for the sake ofletting me have my kind of joy, the joy of seeing you in agony. That is the trueself-sacrifice to an inferior. That is real pity. That is altruism.”This is most important and requires special handling, in dramatized events, notjust in implication. (Probably for Galt and “the man of pity.”) Note on style: Nothing must be over-detailed; I want it extreme, simplified,stylized, impressionistic—in main, abstract outlines only—like the drawing of askyline in forms, without details. (Remember the picture of a stylized sky withlong, straight bands of clouds.)"},{"pageContent":"13NOTES WHILE WRITING : 1941-1952AR began writing Atlas Shrugged on September 2, 1946. This chapter presents thenotes she made while writing the novel up to John Galt’s speech.I have included about two-thirds of the material from this period. Most of theomitted notes simply outline events in individual chapters, describing what thereader of the novel already knows. I hove also omitted repetitive notes and someresearch on a book, This Fascinating Railroad Business, by Robert S. Henry, January 18, 1947Note for last chapter (philosophical conclusion): The strikers have won, notbecause the parasites have learned anything or because the parasites havecollapsed physically, but because the last of the strikers (Rearden and Dagny)have learned the lesson that Galt wanted to teach the best brains of theworld—the lesson of not supporting their own destroyers, and of the creators’nature, function, and proper code. From now on, the exploitation of the best bythe worst will never again be permitted by the best. January 20, 1947An important point to stress: blast the fool idea that material production issome sort of low activity, the result of a base “materialistic” impulse—asopposed to the “spiritual realm” (whatever they think that is), which consistsof some sort of vague, passive contemplation of something or other. Show thatmaterial production is the result of and comes from the highest and noblestaspect of man, from his creative mind, from his independent rationaljudgment—which is his highest attribute and the sole base of his morality. Toexercise one’s own independent rational judgment is the essence of man’smorality, his highest action, his sole moral commandment that embraces all hisvirtues. Material production comes from that—it requires the noblest moralaction (independent thought) as its source. It is the result of the highestmorality, of the noblest courage, of the best within man. (Remember this for thelast chapter.)Never mind the weak little second-handers, of all degrees and variations, whocoast on the thinking of the few geniuses, who make a great busy show of a“grossly materialistic” pursuit of money, who manage to amass fortunes throughthe “human,” rather than the creative angle, through the PeterKeating—second-hander‘s—politician’s method of using and exploiting men, notoriginating ideas. They are only the scum on the surface, the free riders on theflow of the genius’s energy. Who originates the ideas, methods, discoverieswhich they exploit? They are not the representatives of the essence of materialproduction. They are not its sources. The genius is.Material production is the result of the highest spiritual quality and activity.That the second-handers ride on it, push themselves to the forefront and oftengrab all the profit, is due to the geniuses permitting it, [which in turn is dueto] the acceptance of the moral theory of altruism and the blindness of thegeniuses to their own nature and function, to the actual principles of their ownexistence.And, in degree, in regard to each particular man involved in materialproduction, he succeeds only to the extent to which he functions on theprinciples of the creators, on his independent rational judgment; to the extentto which he uses the “social” method and functions on the principles of asecond-hander, he fails. (In a free society, he fails personally. As societybegins to get collectivized (controlled), he has a chance of succeeding in thenarrow sense of keeping his graft, loot or profit—but then, and to the extent ofhis success in this, he destroys society and the whole economy. Materialproduction is not the product of the second-hander and cannot be kept going onhis methods and principles.)Show that the real sources, the spark-plugs of material production (theinventors and industrialists), are creators in the same sense, with the sameheroic virtues, of the same high spiritual order, as the men usually thought ofas creators—the artists. Show that any original rational idea, in any sphere ofman’s activity, is an act of creation. Vindicate the industrialist—the author ofmaterial production (John Galt, Hank Rearden, Dagny Taggart).Of course, that cheap snobbery about material production is based on a deeperphilosophical error—on the vicious idea of “matter as sin” and spirit as itsantagonist. And it’s logical that if one accepts that idea (which represents thedebasement of man and of the earth), then one considers the activity ofpreserving man’s survival (material production) as low and evil. To be high, onemust then starve to death—that’s “liberating the spirit.”Tie this to the clear exposition of the fact (as clear as you can make it) thatthe material is only the expression of the spiritual; that it can be neithercreated nor used without the spiritual (thought); that it has no meaning withoutthe spiritual, that it is only the means to a spiritual end—and, therefore, anynew achievement in the realm of material production is an act of highspirituality, a great triumph and expression of man’s spirit. And show thatthose who despise “the material” are those who despise man and whose basicpremises are aimed at man’s destruction.For anyone who gets confused by the spectacle of second-handers “placing thematerial first”—show that these second-handers are not the creators, but thedestroyers of material production. Show that to conquer, control, and create inthe material realm requires the highest kind of spiritual activity and thehighest type of “spiritual” man.And, to go to the roots of the whole vicious error, blast the separation of maninto “body” and “soul,” the opposition of “matter” and “spirit.” Man is anindivisible entity, possessing both elements—but not to be split into them,since they can be considered separately only for purposes of discussion, not inactual fact. In actual fact, man is an indivisible, integrated entity—and hisplace is here, on earth. His “spirit” is his mind—his control over the earth.Incidentally, note that the good industrialists (such as I’ve met) are hightypes of men—whereas the artists (allegedly the “spiritual” men) are neurotic ordepraved weaklings. The material producers deal in, with and through reason(they have to)—and look at the successes they have achieved. The alleged “men ofthe spirit” deal in emotionalism and mysticism, in the irrational (by havingaccepted the irrational or “inspirational” premise)—and look at the sickeningstate and centuries-long stagnation of men’s spiritual life (their philosophies,their morality, their state of misery, futility, and confusion). Theindustrialists are moral because they function on the basis of reason. Theartists are the depraved types. (There’s the tie of reason and morality.) January 22, 1947In connection with above: d‘Anconia’s dollar sign is a symbol of this, and alsoof the sanctity of the profit motive, of the morality of egoism.200 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_200_r1.jpg]For the banker (Mulligan?): he quit because of the squeeze; he was ordered (bylaw) to give unsound credit to some group of the needy (investment as charity,not on the ground of production, but on the ground of need)—and then he would beblamed as a vicious capitalist for the collapse of the bank, for the wiping outof the savings of “the little people, widows and orphans, etc.” 1947DAGNY AND [DAN] CONWAYHis acceptance and resigned indifference.Her indignation—this is worse than Taggart’s attitude.He thinks the decision was right, but on the basis of such morality he has nodesire to go on. He says “it’s right,” but there is no life left in him.His reasons: The world is in a terrible state and if men can’t get together, howwill they solve it? The majority’s got to decide, it’s the only fair way, he hadagreed to abide by the decision of the majority, they had a right to do it, but...He could fight nature, but he can’t fight this. (She knew that it wasn’t JamesTaggart who had beaten him.)Her attitude: “Such a wrong cannot be right.” “One cannot be penalized forability.” “We can’t live in that kind of a world.”It is his honorable attitude, “keeping his word,” that makes the outragepossible for the parasites.This is the good average man up against the morality of altruism. And this is a“real life” example of going on strike. February 11, 1947[The following are AR’s first notes on the romantic relationship between Dagnyand Francisco.]Their relationship—like two people on a desert island. Sex as their celebrationof life. The complete innocence. They are both incapable of the conception thatjoy is sin. They exhaust each other—“Isn’t it wonderful that our bodies can giveus so much pleasure?” His ingenuity at it. She never wore anything but slacksand plain dresses, but she had never been so feminine.He comes to meet her secretly in New York that winter, once in a while.The complete secrecy of their affair. Nobody suspects it, not even Eddie.Dagny’s reason for the secrecy—her hatred for people’s view of sex. Furiousindignation that anyone should dare presume to lay down rules about it for her.Contempt for those who consider it sin—no desire to fight them ([or even] grantthem the right to discourse about it), only to keep away, not even to brushagainst them, because she senses something monstrously unclean about them. February 15, 1947Note: Creators never act with pain as their motive. This is illustrated by Dagnyand Rearden. This is the principle behind the parasite’s accusation that peoplelike Dagny and Rearden “have no feelings.” They feel—and much more profoundlythan any lesser person or whining parasite (the parasites neither think norfeel)—but they are not run by their feelings, and they are not afraid of pain.Nothing they do is ever motivated by a desire to avoid pain or to be protectedagainst it; they act on the motive of happiness, on the desire to get what theywant, at any cost, even if pain is part of the cost.They suffer more than any parasite could ever bear or imagine (except that it’sa different form of suffering, it’s clean, it doesn’t go all the way down nordamn the universe), but they know how to stand pain, and they don’t care toomuch about it, they don’t actually give it any thought, they don’t include it intheir calculations or consideration of cost, they just meet it when it comes,stand it, brush it aside and then go on—and they win. They win over all pain, tothe happiness which they want and which they are.The parasites are motivated by pain. They are the motors and the embodiments ofpain. The parasites, in effect, say to the creators as an accusation, as astatement of damning sin and guilt: “But you don’t suffer—you’re notunhappy—you’ve never been unhappy.”This is the difference between considering suffering an accident, a temporaryexception—and suffering as a basic principle, a major concern, a main motive,suffering as the norm and the nature of the universe.March 8, 1947The progression of a man’s mental (and psychological) development. (Theprogression of a man’s consciousness.)1. He acquires factual knowledge of objects around him, of events, and thereforeconcludes that a universe exists and that he exists (through the evidence givento him by his senses, grasped and put in order by his reasoning mind). Here hegets the materials to grasp two things: objective reality and himself,consciousness and self-consciousness.2. He discovers that he has the capacity of choice. First, he grasps objects,entities—then that these entities act, i.e., move or change. (It may seem to bealmost simultaneous, but actually he must grasp “entity” before he can grasp“acting entity.”) The same [applies to] himself: first he gainsself-consciousness, then he learns that this self can act (or must act) and thathe must do it through choice. (Such as: if he is hungry, he must ask for food,or cry for it, or go and get it, but he must do something, choose what to do,and choose to do it.) Why does he get the conception of the necessity to act?That is his nature as man—he must preserve his life through his own action andthat action is not automatic; he must preserve his life through consciouschoice.The basis of his choice will be self-preservation; this will form his firststandard of values, and give him his first conception of such things as “value”and “a standard of value.” This is his first conception of “good” and “evil.”His physical entity will give him the first evidence and the start towardit—through physical pain and pleasure. He feels pain when he is hungry; he hasno choice about this; but he discovers that he must exercise choice if he wantsthe pain to stop—he must get food; the food isn’t given to him automatically. Ifhe finds pleasure in eating, he learns that he must choose to act in order toget that pleasure, and choose right.This is the basic pattern, and as he grows and discovers other fields ofactivity, the same holds true: he learns that he must choose and act on hischoice; he forms desires according to the standards of value he has established(his own pleasure, satisfaction or happiness—this grows in complexity as hismind, experience, and knowledge grow) and he acts to [satisfy] these desiresaccording to these values.His first desires are given to him by nature; they are the ones that he needsdirectly for his body, such as food, warmth, etc. Only these desires areprovided by nature and they teach him the concept of desire. Everything elsefrom then on proceeds from his mind, from the standards and conclusions acceptedby his mind and it goes to satisfy his mind—for example, his first toys.(Perhaps sex is the one field that unites the needs of mind and body, with themind determining the desire and the body providing the means of expressing it.But the sex act itself is only that—an expression. The essence is mental, orspiritual.)Essentially, and most basically, his standard of value will always be pleasureor pain, ie., happiness or suffering, and these, essentially, are: that whichcontributes to the preservation or the destruction of his life. (This applies tohis most complex, abstract desires later on.)(Note: “life” and “self-preservation” are actually synonyms, in the sense thatthe last is implied in the first. Life is a process, an activity, which theliving thing must perform—that is what makes it a living thing. Man must do itconsciously—the essence and tool of his life is his mind.)This stage, then, is the discovery of choice and values, i.e., of free will andmorality.3. Now that he knows that he can choose (and must choose), can have desires andcan achieve them—he is ready to start forming his conscious convictions aboutthe universe, about himself and about what he intends to do. (These convictions,or basic principles, are already implied in the above process. But now he muststate them.)201 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_201_r1.jpg]These three steps are the essence of the process. But now man must remainconvinced consciously of the validity of what he’s learned in that process. Itimplies: free will, self-confidence (confidence in one’s own judgment),self-respect (the conviction that the preservation of his life and theachievement of his happiness are values, are good), and a benevolent universe inwhich he can achieve happiness (if he remains realistic, that is, true toreality observed by his reason). If his desires are derived from and based onreality correctly observed—they will be achievable in this universe. All hisdesires come from reality, but the wrong ones are due to his mistakes injudgment; if he realizes the mistake, a contradiction or an inherentimpossibility, he will not continue to desire these objects; he won’t damn theuniverse for not giving him the irrational or impossible.Here it must be noted that his self-respect starts as a general axiom, butspecifically must be achieved by him. This is in accordance with the nature ofman: that part where value is possible, the field of choice, the field ofmorality, is open to him. First, he must value himself as a man; then hisself-respect must be based on living up to the standards of value, the morality,proper to man.Another interesting point to be noted here: man is given his entity as clay tobe shaped, he is given his body, his tool (the mind) and the mechanism ofconsciousness (emotions, subconscious, memory) through which his mind will work.But the rest depends on him. His spirit, that is, his own essential character,must be created by him. (In this sense, it is almost as if he were born as anabstraction, with the essence and rules of that abstraction (man) to serve ashis guide and standard—but he must make himself concrete by his own effort, hemust create himself.) Specifically, he is born as an entity: man. But his fieldof action and emotion is open to his choice. He must survive, preserve himselfand achieve happiness through choice, and the choice must be made by his reason,i.e., by his reason learning about and judging objective reality (both the worldaround him and himself). So he must have a code of values by which he mustchoose (he cannot choose without values, and he cannot have values where nochoice is involved or possible).The basic standard by which he establishes his code of values is man’s survivaland happiness. This means man’s survival as man, i.e., in a way proper to man,which is the only way he can actually survive or be happy; mere physical, animalsurvival, at the price of his standards, will give him misery. Happiness,essentially, is the emotion naturally accompanying man’s proper survival.Thus man develops his moral code—with the Ideal Man, man at his highestpossibility, as the final goal of the code. Then he will base his self-respect,his valuation of himself, on how well he lives up to that code.And that is how he creates his spiritual entity, his character—by theconvictions he’s made. If they’re honest, but mistaken convictions (or, rather,limited), he will be an average good man. If they’re honest and correct—he willbe a great man. His reason is the tool and the creator of his character. (Here,the degree of his intelligence might affect his stature as a man. But not hismoral value—that, in proportion to his abilities, is the same for all men.)But now is where the danger starts. The above are the basic, essentially neededconvictions. If he loses any one of them, he’s done for—he ceases actingaccording to his nature as a man, he starts going against himself, which means,toward self-destruction. He must not lose the conviction of free will—if hedoes, he loses the capacity to desire, i.e., to choose a purpose, to actpurposefully as a man must. He must not lose self-confidence—if he does, hebecomes incapable of thought, judgment or action. He must not loseself-respect—if he does, he becomes incapable of morality, of the desire to begood, because he has lost the only possible base of man’s proper morality:self-preservation in the most essential sense of the word. (Here, altruism helpsto ruin him.) He must not lose the conviction of a benevolent universe—if hedoes, none of the rest will make any sense.And above all, above absolutely all, he must not lose the commitment toreason—because if he does, everything crashes. If he does, he is a screamingpain in the midst of terror and chaos. His essence, as a being, is hisconsciousness—not his body, because the body without consciousness is justinanimate matter. Whether he has a soul or is a material being with theattribute of consciousness, in either case his distinctive, essential attributeis consciousness, not matter. And his consciousness is his reason. When herenounces that, he has renounced himself, his essence, his nature—and the resultcan be nothing but horror and self-destruction.Of course, he cannot renounce reason completely. If he did, he would have to goinsane or simply perish. The tricky secret (and key) of man’s nature is that hecan be nothing except reasonable, but he cannot be reasonable automatically,i.e., unconsciously. He has to be reasonable by a conscious decision or effortof his reason (and that effort has to be exercised continuously throughout hislife—in general, as basic conviction, and specifically, as applied to eachconcrete instance, moment, event or action of his life).This is the turning point, the decisive point in a man’s spiritual development.This is the point where most men fail. Yes, this mistake is always open to man’scorrection in later life, since he remains essentially rational, but is merelyacting against his nature, therefore he can retrace his steps and go back to theproper conviction. But the correction becomes harder and harder each year,because the further he goes along the road of irrationalism, the more harm hehas done to himself and his thinking capacity, the more suffering he hasendured, and the more painful and frightening an attitude of honest rationalitybecomes to him. (He is then afraid of having to damn himself factually,irrevocably, of having to pronounce himself evil without evasions or loopholes.)The joke of it is that his only essential evil is the irrationalist attitude,and that no crime which he has committed in the past and which he is afraid toconsciously acknowledge is as evil as his persisting in irrationalism. It’sirrationalism that made his original guilt possible—the guilt and the crime werethe consequence of it, but the irrationalism was the root and the cause, theonly basic evil.The manner in which man remains “irrationally rational” is that he gets caughtin his emotional mechanism. His emotions proceed from his reason, i.e., from hisconvictions (and these convictions were made consciously at some time, but mayhave been forgotten or deliberately evaded), and they proceed logically,following all the implications of his convictions. ([The process is]subconscious and automatic. The conscious is the field of free choice, thesubconscious is automatic; but it is the conscious that determines the contentof the subconscious, the premises which a man has accepted.) So theirrationalist is at the mercy of his emotions, with all the errors,contradictions, conflicts, evil that are contained in them, since they comelogically (consistently) from mistaken premises.But the irrationalist holds his emotions (or “instincts,” “hunches,”“revelations,” “extra-sensory perceptions,” etc.) above his reason; he fightshis reason with them. And of course, he’s done for. Whatever he does, he willachieve nothing but suffering, in one form or another, he will always befrustrated and fail in whatever it is specifically that he thinks he wants inhis own twisted, self-contradictory manner. His whole trend will be towardsuffering and self-destruction, since he is acting against himself, against hisown nature.He will survive, achieve his purposes and achieve happiness only to the extentto which he continues to act rationally, even against his own stated andaccepted premise of irrationalism (and he must remain rational to some extent orcease to exist altogether). To the extent to which he indulges in theirrational, he is working toward his own misery and moving toward his owndestruction. That is the contradiction and civil war within him.The net, total result is still basic misery—because one cannot be part-rationalor unintentionally, unconsciously rational. Here is an issue that demandsperfection. No basic or long-range happiness is possible except to a man who istotally, completely, absolutely, consciously committed to reason.What most irrationalists do consciously is, of course, to “limit” reason; theydon’t deny it outright, or at least not often, even in their consciousconvictions and statements. But that “limit” or “part-time” is enough to do thedamage of basic and complete misery for them (with just a few moments of joy asguilty, uncertain points of relief from the chronic misery). You cannot be“part-insane,” just as you cannot be part-pregnant, or part-cancerous, orpart-honest, or part-dead. These are examples of absolutes.Without going into greater detail now, I must mention only that the real causeof a man going into irrationalism (and then on to mysticism, altruism, themalevolent universe, second-handedness and all the other spiritual diseases) isalways an act of self-condemnation, that is, of judging oneself evil by one’sown standard of values. The accusation of others will not do it, it might make aman hate others or the universe, but not himself—and that is not so disastrousor dangerous to his future. The teachings or values of others will be onlydetails or contributing factors, but not decisive. The decisive act ofcatastrophe is a man’s self-condemnation, i.e., his realization that he has donesomething which he himself has defined as evil by his own standards of value;therefore he then considers himself as evil.How can he do that at all, since no man will do that which he actually andcompletely believes to be evil? He can do it only by suspending his reason, hisconscious rational judgment, at the time of and for the issue when he commitsthe action which he later judges as evil. This is the essence of the only evilact man can really do—that act of shutting off his conscious rational judgment,which is not automatic. (This is a point which I must state in greaterdetail—but that’s the heart of the problem of man’s morality.)After this act of original, initial evil, a man [may] proceed to perpetuate thatevil, to become an irrationalist—in order not to face his own judgment onhimself, since no man can pronounce himself absolutely and irrevocably evil, andcontinue to exist. Is the way to morality and self-respect open to him?Yes—always—so long as he is alive and sane. But the only way is return to aconscious [policy] of rationality, to his own essence and nature as man, tohimself. March 22, 1947Note (be sure and use this): the parasites’ conception of equality is actuallynot “to make even,” but “to get even with”—that is, to get even with a man forthe fact of his ability. March 29, 1947Make use of: “Clearance,” “Right of Way,” “Stop, Look, Listen” signs.Note that men must run to destruction if they ignore the danger signals alongthe way. One of the obvious danger signals of a civilization’s collapse is thefalling off of production, of wealth, a falling standard of living, a growingpoverty (since the material does come from the spiritual and is its expression).But men ignore that because, in their spiritual confusion and growing depravity,they begin to take poverty, discomfort and self-denial as signs of virtue, assigns of strength or courage or future success (as England is blabbering now).This is quite logical—since the morality of altruism is the morality of deathand has to lead to self-destruction. April 29, 1947The tunnels of TT are like the catacombs of the early Christians in Rome—thepower of the spirit hiding from the world that is destroying it while being fedby it, the power of the trains and of the mind that made them, the power of JohnGalt who has to hide as the lowest, most despised kind of worker there. And thesign of the dollar is like the sign of the cross—the secret symbol of the heroesand martyrs. May 31, 1947The strikers’ oath: “I swear by my life and my love of it that I shall neverlive for the sake of another man or ask another man to live for mine.” 1947NOTES FOR REWRITE OF [ “THE CLIMAX OF THE D ‘ANCONIAS”] MAIN PROBLEMS:Dagny-Francisco romance—its actual nature and meaning, the build-up to it, thefour years when she is his mistress. The nature of her feeling for him, what hemeans to her—and of his feeling for her.Francisco’s genius and purposefulness—incidents to show what he was and where heis going—show him as the kind of man who could not become a playboy—show hisreligious zeal for d‘Anconia Copper—show his worship of purpose and his contemptfor drifters. (Particularly, show the period when he is manager of the New Yorkoffice of d’Anconia Copper, at [age] 20-23. He is as swift and efficient at abusiness desk as he was at ballgames or tennis. He drives his business as hedrove a car.)Francisco would despise the conventional, the established, the safe, theroutine—and look for the new, the difficult, the different, the unusual.He would despise repeating and memorizing—he would want to think, discover,create. He wants the created, not the repeated—he would write an essay on hisown ideas, rather than a report on somebody else’s thinking, such as an analysisof some classic. It is the accepted, ready-made, arbitrary standards that hewon’t accept. He’ll make his own standards.With all his wealth, he is not interested in ready-made playthings such asgadgets, cars, etc. He wants to make things. He wants the self made, not theready-made.THE TWO MAIN LINES FOR DAGNY-FRANCISCO PAST:For Francisco: A brilliant, ambitious, violently active, impatient, religiouslypurposeful, self-willed boy—who could not become a drifter.For Dagny: What he represents in her life is the entity of pure joy—the joy ofability. [There are few notes on Francisco’s character. The explanation seems to be givenin a comment that AR made in 1961: “Francisco, more than anyone else, seems tohave been Minerva in my mind—he came in ready made. ”] 1947 [AR made the following notes for the party scene in which Francisco introduceshimself to Rearden.]FOR REARDEN-FRANCISCO:The essential issue of the strike.Francisco’s approach—the key questions.Rearden’s failure.The essential issue is: you support the parasites, you make it possible for themto destroy you and the world, you are responsible for their actions because yougrant them a virtue they don’t possess, you don’t realize your own importanceand their impotence, you act on their terms, not being completely clear aboutyour own.Rearden’s failure is: his generosity, he wants to protect lesser people, hegrants them virtue—his over-confidence, he thinks he can win and produce underany and all conditions—his vitality, he wants to live, work, function, ignoringeverything around him, thus not seeing that he is his own destroyer. [...]Possibility: Dagny sees Francisco as the personification of the kind of gaietythe party could have been. He sees her as truly feminine—what the others can’tsee. (What she wants Rearden to see. Rearden does, of course.) July 1, 1947For Galt’s speech: “What is the objective test of whether a man is a parasite ornot, who determines that? Each man himself. If you think that it is proper (orpossible) to work under compulsion, to take orders from others, and you feel youwould be willing to do it—you are a parasite. If you think that there are noachievements, no distinctions, no ability or genius among men, that one man’swork is as good as another‘s, that all men are interchangeable—you are aparasite who knows nothing about the nature of work. (And you have merelydescribed yourself—and classified yourself thereby.)” July 3, 1947NOTE ON REARDENIncident when his mother wants Rearden to give Philip a job at the mills.Rearden refuses with implacable, icy anger—his mills come first, he will neverdo this for his family. That is precisely what they hate him for. His attitudeis that he would give Philip a job only if he deserved it; the fact that Philipis a relative has nothing to do with it. His mother’s attitude is that that iswhat makes him cruel and heartless: if he loved his brother, he’d give him a jobthe brother didn’t deserve, that is what she would consider true affection,generosity and brotherhood. If the brother deserves the job, there is no virtuein giving it to him—that’s just selfishness. Virtue is to give the undeserved.FOR CHAPTER VIII: THE MATERIALISTSWhile Dagny and Rearden battle alone against tremendous public opposition,staking everything they own on their judgment, with rational truth as their onlymotive—the “writer” (who has talked about the artist’s pure, “non-commercial”search for truth, about the artist’s spiritual concerns and scorn for thematerial) is having fits of panic over the future public reception of his latestbook, is grabbing every opinion and adjusting the book accordingly, is wonderingwhether he should make his thesis and ending the exact opposite of what they arenow—which would go over better?—and is sniveling about the thousand dollarauthentic Mandarin coat now selling for a bathrobe, which he wants. 1947 [AR made the following notes on the scene in which Dagny speaks to Dr. Stadlerabout the State Science Institute’s condemnation of Rearden Metal. ]DR. STADLERThe great mind—and the great conceit; not showoffishness, but the actualconviction that practically everyone else is some sort of vicious, helplessanimal. His attitude is: “I could teach them to live so much better than theydo.... Persuade them? How can I? They have no mind and are not open to reason.There’s nothing anyone can do except force them. That’s all they understand.”(“But I know that I’m right—and I’ve seen so much stupidity in my life!”)His contempt for industrialists—“Oh, yes, the men who make gadgets and areinterested in nothing but the dollar.” Contempt for applied science and materialproduction. Yet—he wants unlimited funds and multi-million-dollar cyclotrons.His cynicism: “Oh, no, you can’t expect industrialists to support science.”(“Who is supporting you now?” “Society.”)He is completely indifferent to the “practical” side of the [State Science]Institute. He is very satisfied with his “abstract” isolation. Dr. Ferris “takescare” of everything—and he prizes Ferris for this reason. (He thinks Ferris ishis servant—he doesn’t know that it’s the other way around.) The Institute wasestablished for Dr. Stadler, on his endorsement and agreement, on the glory ofhis name. But it is Dr. Ferris who established it, who “put it through” thelegislature. Ferris is the “Washington man” of the Institute. (“Washington”leaves Dr. Stadler strictly alone—and kowtows to him as to an idol. So hedoesn’t think that politicians are “difficult” or “a problem.” Does he likedealing with them at all? “Oh, dear me, no—but what can one do in this world?One has to accept some sort of ugliness.” (He [prefers] politicians tobusinessmen.)He is uneasy with Dagny—he wants to enjoy her visit, to be the brilliant man toan appreciative audience, as he used to be with her—but he can’t. There are afew sharp little touches of annoyance, impatience, evasion in his manner. [...]August 12, 1947PHILOSOPHICAL NOTEIf man forms his own character through the basic premises he accepts (hischaracter being the result and consequence of the premises), does this mean thathe has no permanent character at all, no fixed entity, since it is subject toand open to constant change? No. Here is the permanence of man’s entity: thoseof his basic premises which are true cannot change (since premises come fromconvictions about observed reality); it is only the mistaken premises which areopen to change, are constantly challenged by reality and should be changed. The“fluidity” or impermanence of his character corresponds to the number ofmistaken premises he holds; to the extent of such mistakes, he lacks “entity” oris not a complete, perfect, integrated entity, therefore, does not actuallyexist completely. His permanence, his full reality, his existence depend uponhis right premises. The perfect man would hold nothing but the right premises.This process is the key to the secret of man’s character and of theincompleteness of his existence. This is the process of man creating himself,becoming man—the illustration of: “Being a man is given to him, remaining a manis not.” (“Everything is something.” Everything that exists must be an entity.Physical objects are set as entities by nature. Only man has to create himself;his body is only the means; his essential entity is his soul—and that he mustcreate himself. There is the god-like aspect of man. What is his starting point,his tool for creating himself? The rational mind. All the rest is only adevelopment of it, a matter of remaining true to his rational mind.)When I say that a man holds a true premise, I mean that he holds it withcomplete rational conviction, as far as his knowledge goes. Therefore, such apremise cannot be changed in his mind; further knowledge would only amplifyit—it cannot contradict or destroy it. The case of a man who had a rightpremise, then dropped it because of some erroneous new conclusion, is notrelevant here: such a case merely means that the man did not hold or understandthe right premise, or any part of it, in the first place. My statement hereapplies only to actual, full, rational conviction about a basic premise—not to apsychological illusion of conviction, nor to any sort of “faith,” nor to anypartially, provisionally accepted hypothesis.An important point here: the “acting on the most likely hypothesis” rule appliesto and is proper only in relation to the specific and the concrete, such as anyone person, event or course of action, but not to basic premises. In regard tobasic premises, no halfway is possible; anything short of absolute conviction isworthless, is no conviction at all. (In connection with this, I must define thenature and content of basic premises.)NOTE FOR REARDENBoth Lillian and Stacey want Rearden to succumb to an affair with a mistress.Their motives and attitudes are basically identical, both being expressions ofthe parasite, but they are two different variations of the same theme, aboutequally vicious.Lillian wants to see Rearden’s strict moral purity broken, so that she cantorture him through his own guilt, so that she can feel the satisfaction ofseeing a great man degraded, and so that she can assume moral superiority overhim, thus becoming the representative of morality. Therefore, Lillian’s gameincludes an over-stressed, over-grim recognition of morality—in order to holdRearden through his guilt at having betrayed the moral code.Stacey wants to see Rearden abandoning morality so that she and he can be unitedlike gangsters or criminal conspirators against the moral world, a kind ofrelationship expressed by a wise wink at each other. She wants him to becomeimmoral in her way, to hold morality as a convenient hypocrisy with which tofool others, but to acknowledge that he and she know better, are wiser thanthat—in fact, are rotters and satisfied with it. This, in effect, would alsohold him through guilt—the guilt of being self-confessedly and boastfully evil.Thus Stacey’s scheme includes morality only as the thing to defy; she andRearden would be bound together, not within and by morality, but against it.Of the two women, Lillian is smarter: she knows that Rearden is essentiallygreat and pure, that his essence cannot be changed, that she can merely make himsuffer through his recognition of his own sin. Stacey thinks that sensualindulgence can actually turn Rearden into a rotter, become his essence and makehim pleased with, not tortured by, depravity, in the same way that she is.It is important to stress and make clear how wrong both women are: on theirmalevolent, parasite’s premise, they can expect a man’s happiness (asrepresented by sex, its highest expression) to become the means of hisdegradation, of evil, of torture and of their acquiring power over him. Thetruth is that happiness (in the real sense of the word) cannot do this andcannot be used in this way. It is and does the opposite: it is both the meansand the expression of man’s elevation, of his good, his joy, his freedom, andhis independence.That is what Rearden learns from his affair with Dagny. Any suffering involvedfor him in that affair (and only superficially, never tragically or essentially)came only from the fact of his own error about the nature of the relationshipand his right to it; it came only from his own ignorance and mistake —not fromanything done by Lillain or Stacey. Only he made his suffering possible—they,the parasites, could not make him suffer—and he set himself free of thesuffering, when he understood the truth.This is a very important point—an important illustration of the theme, of thefact that any evil done to a good man is done only because, and to the extent towhich, he permits it. (Rearden permitted it by accepting the parasite’s view ofmorality, happiness, and sex.)202 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_202_r1.jpg]Regarding Rearden and Lillian: In their sex life, she held her impotence asvirtue, his desire as vice. This is impotence held as superior to life energy. 1947[AR prepared the following list of questions prior to visiting three steelcompanies. Short answers to some of the questions were added after herinterviews. ]QUESTIONS RE: STEELRegarding Rearden Metal: What qualities would be most valuable in a new metalalloy, besides: tougher, cheaper and longer lasting than steel? Heat resisting.What would Dagny have to see besides “Rearden’s formula and the tests he showedher”?General description of Rearden Steel mills. Watch for characteristic details.What sort of tests and research would be done to achieve ReardenMetal (in a general way)?“Today, the first heat of the first order of Rearden Metal had been poured.” (Dothey call it heat? Yes. Do they call it order? Yes.) Do they pour alloys—is theprocedure approximately the same as for making steel, or is it entirely,basically different—and how much leeway do I have on this? Yes, [they pouralloys.]Difference between mill, foundry and scrap business? (Who manufactures what?)(Mill: sheet steel and plate steel.)Could the bracelet be made from that poured metal that same day? Yes.Would Rearden Ore be referred to as a “mining company”? “Rearden’s startedrolling the rails.” Yes. “The first shipment of rail will get to the site in afew weeks, the last in six months.” (?) (Time element of order okay.)Is it machine tools they need and lack to make Diesels?The time schedule for the Rearden rails order: seven months for the wholeorder—first delivery in two months, second in another two months, last in threemonths after that. Dagny has him cut last five months to three. (?) (About 300miles for line up to Wyatt Oil, more for whole line, though not all of track isbeing replaced.)What is the proper extra price per ton that Rearden would charge for the rush?(10%) What is the price of the best ton of rail now? What would be a steep extrafor rush? What has been the increase in cost of steel rail per each decade?What is the longest credit Rearden would give Dagny on the rail order?What kind of crane would load rails on flat cars? Would it have a jaw that snapsopen and drops the rails? Or a hook, with the rails tied in bunches by chains?Or are rails loaded singly? Overhead crane, rails are tied with chains.September, 1947[AR made the following notes on an interview with Carleton B. Tibbets, CEO ofLos Angeles Steel Casting Company.]The key men in a steel mill are: general manager; superintendent; rollingsuperintendent. (Superintendent coordinates the melting department.)U.S. Steel employs 15,000 men in the largest plant; 300,000 men in all theirplants.Rearden’s plant would employ about 5,000 to 6,000. Plant would disintegrate inabout a month after Rearden leaves.Example of destructive inefficiency: somebody taps steel too soon, which isknown as “taps a cold heat.” Examples of looting: selling cranes, sellingrolling equipment. Example of inefficient management: steel is insufficientlypurified; this causes “progressive fracture” —steel breaks.Oil Pipe Line:Would be ordered from steel mills up to size of 12 inches. If larger, it has tobe ordered from a special foundry. Wyatt’s pipe line would be ready in about sixmonths normally, one or two years in present circumstances.Suggestions for Rearden Metal:Main interest of steel makers at present is heat-resisting steel. Have Reardenmetal be able to stand temperatures up to 3000° (this is almost the meltingpoint of steel). Present limit is 1800°. Have metal hold its strength andductility at the same time. This type of metal would revolutionize themanufacture of internal-combustion engines. Elements to use in Rearden metal:molybdenum or vanadium. Both are rare elements, particularly vanadium. It can beobtained from only one company in this country. Molybdenum is now used in theamount of .4 to .6 percent of steel mixture, or 8 to 12 pounds per ton of steel.Vanadium is now used in the amount of .2 percent of steel mixture, or 4 poundsper ton of steel.203 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_203_r1.jpg]Main customers of steel mills are railroads, oil companies, building industries,and a huge number of manufacturing companies such as agricultural implements,automobiles, etc. October, 1947NOTES ON VISIT TO KAISER STEEL PLANTSite of steel mill [in Fontana, California]: 13,000 acres or about 3/4 squaremile.Plant was completed in 13 months. First coke ovens were in operation in sixmonths.Cost of plant: $123,000,000 in wartime. Present value or normal cost:$35,000,000 to $40,000,000.Geneva plant built in wartime by government. Cost $200,000,000.U.S. Steel bought it from the Government for $40,000,000 (about 20 percent oforiginal value). Defense Corporation’s return on all its war plants which weresold averages about 17 percent.Price of steel in East is $50-$55 per ton. Eastern steel costs about $15 per tonmore in the West, the difference being the cost of transportation. The KaiserCompany owns an iron ore mine and a limestone quarry in California. It leases acoal mine in Utah and operates it.Miscellaneous Information:Blast furnaces are usually named after women. The one at Kaiser’s is named“Bess” after Mrs. Kaiser and is referred to by the workers as “Old Bess.”The big pipe around the belly of the blast furnace is referred to by the workersas the “Bustle” pipe.Possible Technical Trouble:Gas explosions—caused by combustible gases, air or oxygen in a confined spaceand high enough temperature to set it off.Heat going through the floor of the furnace—this is known as a “breakout.” Itcan happen either to the blast or open-hearth furnaces. It is usually caused byclosing the tap-hole improperly.Possibilities for Inefficient Management:Buying strip coal instead of coking coal—the blast furnace will go cold.Foreman stops charging coke for six hours—furnace will freeze up.Foreman feeds nothing but limestone for a whole turn—furnace will becomelime-set.Possibilities for Looting:Selling raw materials; selling pig iron and scrap; selling turning rolls fromrolling mills; selling spare tuyeres on blast furnace.The Essential Staff of a Steel Mill:About 12 percent of the total employees (Kaiser Plant employs 3300 people). Theessential jobs are: vice-president in charge of operations; generalsuperintendent; assistant superintendent; department superintendents; departmentassistant superintendents ; general foreman; turn foreman; blower; open hearthmelter. There are about 100 men in Metallurgical Department.October-November, 1947[AR made brief notes in a memo book while on a train trip from California to NewYork and back to Cheyenne, Wyoming. On this trip, she interviewed employees ofthe New York Central Railroad and visited facilities of Inland Steel.]TRIP TO NEW YORKThe hood of a black car looks like a mirror and reflects objects ahead and thesky.The effect of rocks at sunset—a dark gray, flat silhouette of rocks againstshadows of mountains which are dark gray and barely suggested.The mountains. The approach to a small town. The train and sparks at night. Thefireflies.The mountains in Wyoming. A base of rock, rising from a green slope, with brush,pines and a smooth green cover that looks like moss rising up on the rock. Themoss and brush vanish gradually, and the pines go on struggling up, in thinningstrands, till only a few drops of single trees are left, going up. At the top,there is a naked rock, with snow in the crevices. The snow looks as if a handfulhad been thrown violently into a crevice and had splattered up the sides, insingle rays.The mountain peaks look very close, as if rising a very short distance from theroad—until one sees the tiny size of the pine trees near the top.A small town is seen in the distance, rising from the plain, as a solid line ofbushy green trees, with roof tops among them—and, rising above trees and roofs,a few round, silver water-tanks that look like huge pearls. The water tankscompete in height with the church spires. The water tanks win.A train moving at night looks like a solid streak of lighted glass—the band ofthe windows—and a streak of sparks flying above them in the opposite direction.The fireflies rise from the grass at dusk like slow sparks, moving at floatingangles, just a bit slower than sparks of fire, and paler—they have a cold,white, metallic sparkle.New York skyscrapers look like solid structures of lighted glass, in theevening, when all the windows are lighted. As it gets later, the buildingsassume black shapes again, with only a few lighted windows scattered among them,and an occasional row of vertical lights, like a row of buttons—the lights of astairwell.New York skyscrapers in the fog look as if the closest ones can be seen in everydetail, but behind a thin blue smoke; in the next row, the details are blurred,simplified to essentials; farther on, the buildings are simplified to mereshapes; and beyond that, they become blue shadows, in faint silhouettes.A plain and town, seen from the height, with the unusual effect of long,straight, thick bands of clouds low in the sky above them, at twilight, so thatit looks as if part of the sky were a lake beyond the town, and the clouds werethe strip of the other shore.TRIP BACKThe steel mills. When a heat is being poured, the smoke is semitransparent, likewaves of heat, and the outlines of smokestacks behind it look as if they wereshimmering.There is red smoke, orange-yellow smoke, blue smoke—and thick, rich,satin-lustrous coils of smoke rising out of smokestacks, that look likemother-of-pearl.There is a great abundance of power lines in steel mills, long, many-strandedbands of wire.The silhouette of the steel mills in Lorain, Ohio, standing against the sky.The rust colored water of the river at the steel mills in Johnstown,Pennsylvania.The odor of sulfur and the constant metallic clatter, like the sound of grindingwheels.The approach to Pittsburgh (on the way east): From the parkways, to the old,vertical houses on steep hillsides, to the slums, with narrow, cobblestonestreets—then the sudden view of the river and the blurred silhouettes ofskyscrapers—the rise to the triumphant goal and spirit of the place, of thegreat effort that made it. Pennsylvania—green mountains, some plains, manyhills. Ohio-hills and some plains. (The Patrick Henry University should be on abluff over Lake Erie.)Indiana—flat plains, dull.Illinois—flat plains.Wisconsin—hills in the eastern part, more plains in the west. Wisconsin has agreat many pines; also some birch trees. The road goes up and down, more than incurves. The road going up a hill rises straight up, almost vertically, beforethe driver, then lowers as one approaches, almost as if folding over and lyingdown like a bridge being lowered before you.Minnesota—hills in the eastern part, flat, dull plains in the west. SouthDakota—flat plains and terribly dull up to the Missouri. Desert-like hills andplains west of the Missouri. The hills gather, tighten and grow as oneapproaches the Black Hills region. Here—rock and pines. The view from near theWild Cat Cave—a huge spread of mountains, green and filled with pines. The pineslook small as weeds. The mountains are slashed in places, in straight, verticalcuts, as if cut to show the layers of rock under the smooth green cloth coveringthem.The view of a lake at sunset: straight, thin, black shafts of trees with aspread of gold beyond and above them—the sky and the water of the same glowingyellow color.(For Galt and Dagny: When he carries her to the town in the valley, he does nothold her in the impersonal, wholesome manner of a man carrying a wounded woman.It is an embrace—even though nothing in his manner suggests it and his faceshows no emotion. It is merely the fact that his whole body is aware of holdinghers.) A line of telephone poles at each side of a straight road going off intothe distance: the poles grow shorter and the spaces between them narrower, untilthey become like a picket fence in the distance. Clouds at sunset, covering thesun: only the edges of the clouds are like bright fire—against a clear blue sky,with the clouds faintly grayer, deeper blue; the edges are like a net of thinneon tubes—or like a map of winding rivers (or a map of railroads) traced insilver fire.November, 1947[AR prepared the following questions for her interviews with personnel of theNew York Central Railroad.]How long would it take to lay rails through the Colorado section? How long fromCheyenne to El Paso?How much would the San Sebastian Line cost (300 miles)?Key men of railroad company? Of Operating Department?Day of operating vice-president?Who assigns freight cars?Who supervises the construction of a new line?November 22, 1947[The following notes are from an interview with A. H. Wright, vice-president ofoperation and maintenance for the New York Central Railroad. Describing thisinterview later, AR remarked: “[Mr. Wright] was seventy years old and retiring,and I remember thinking how shocked he would be if he knew that he would becomea thirty-four-year-old woman in my novel. ”][Previous jobs :]Yard clerk during the day, filling in as brakeman at night.Trained crews and examined men on operating rules in office of train master.Assistant train master in largest freight yard (Syracuse, N.Y.).Train master on another division.Assistant superintendent, then superintendent of N.Y. water and marineoperations.Assistant general manager of eastern lines.General manager.Key men:Division superintendents: operating costs and service to the public.General manager: coordinates work of division superintendents.Engineer of maintenance of ways: maintenance of tracks, buildings and bridges.General superintendent of motive power and rolling stock.Signal engineer: construction and maintenance of all signals.Day: Requests for expenditures and additional help, and matters of discipline ofemployees. (Half of time on line, the rest in office.)Coal—very crucial. (Burn 600 cars of coal a day.)[Railroad] ties good for 20 years.Rails good for 10-12 years.Rails are moved from high speed track to yard track.Steel bridges—keep them painted to avoid corrosion—members replaced whencorroded or obsolete (in regard to weight of locomotives and trains). Abutmentsmust be watched.Lay rails: 6-8 months.Main line—automatic signals.Side lines—manual signals.If they went back to manual system, could operate only 10% of present traffic.Radio communication between engineering and yard masters, between engineers andsignal men, between front and rear of train. American Association of Railroadscan give arbitrary orders for cars. Five miles of side-track to reach a mine:$300,000. (San Sebastian Line should be about $50,000,000.)204 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_204_r1.jpg][The following notes are from an interview with K. A. Borntrager, manager offreight traffic for the New York Central Railroad.]A union proposal to put an engineer and fireman in each unit of a Diesel.130,000 employees working for New York Central Railroad, about 1—3% areappointive positions. This small group are the brains.About 5,000 men are under Mr. Borntrager; only about 100-150 are appointive.Car Service Department: 300 people, only six to eight appointive positions. Ifthese men were gone, there would be chaos in two or three weeks.Somebody has to coordinate all the machine records—unless somebody can do it, amachine economy cannot function.For construction:Cannot get drilling steel, explosives. Steel came—they put in wooden stringersfor missing pieces. They have rocks to blast—heavy equipment wears out veryfast, many replacements are needed—they have no drills—equipment wore out—theyhave to resort to chipping, hand-work. The brains saved money, now it will costmuch more. Have rails, but have no specialists to build frogs and switches.(Unions are always trying to encroach on appointive positions—constant, silentbattle. [Management] has the right to appoint the station agents (freight andpassenger); unions claim that positions are not big enough, an ordinary man fromthe ranks could do it on seniority basis. Mr. Borntrager would run a railroadbetter if he could appoint twice as many people. Would like to take young manand raise him from position to position (from the ranks), but he cannot do it.)Signals are very intricate mechanisms; couldn’t get copper—so they use steelwire; signals fail. Spend a horrible amount of money—and get a makeshift thingwhen you get through.November 25, 1947NOTES ON VISIT TO INLAND STEEL [IN CHICAGO, IL]Railroad rails are shipped in gondolas. They are picked up by an overhead crane(magnetic), six to ten at a time, and deposited on cars inside a building. Wallsof building can be open.Process of rail making (approximately): Iron from blast furnace (“caste”)—steelfrom open hearth furnace ( “heat”)—steel is poured into ingot molds—ingots go toblooming mill and are rolled into billets (for rails and structural shapes) orslabs (for sheet, plate, etc.). Final shape of rails is done by three sets ofrolls (mills). (The shape is the rolls themselves.)Steel heat: the metal is white, not red or orange. It has no suggestion offlame, only of a blinding white liquid. There is a violent red glow in therising smoke—a shower of white sparks—and bits of metal that fall on the floorand start flaming. When the ladle is full, you see nothing but black and white,a blinding white liquid boiling and running over, spilling with a kind ofwasteful, arrogant prodigality. The white rivulets on the side of the ladle turnto a glowing brown, then to black metal, like icicles, and start crumbling off.The slag in the slag-ladle on the side starts crusting over in thick, uneven,brown ridges, like the earth’s crust. Small flames appear in the cracks. As thecrust thickens, two or three craters appear, with white liquid metal boilingslowly.A steel mill rolls steel; a foundry casts it (in sand molds).Coke ovens. The coke is pushed out like slices of toast. It crumbles likered-hot walls, in layers and in sudden cracks.205 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_205_r1.jpg]From Mr. Fred Gillies (general manager): The attempted embargo on freight carsfor deliveries to steel plants—by the government. Excuse—they do not empty carsfast enough. Reason—bureaucrats want freight cars to ship coal to Europe.(Stopping the country’s production for the sake of looting.)A plant was built by the government during the war, at a cost of 25 milliondollars. Twice the capacity that was ever needed or used (six open hearthfurnaces—only three were used). Company that wanted to buy another such plantwas refused permission by government (anti-trust law), so they did not bid onthis one. No one has bid on plant. It is now used by the government as awarehouse for war surplus—clothes, candy, etc. (!)Diesel freight engine with four motor units weighs 464 tons.Tractive force when starting—220,000 pounds.Average load of boxcars—27 tons. (Weight of boxcar—20 tons.)One-hundred-car trains would weigh about 5,000 tons.Bridge: 1,650 feet—38,000 tons of steel.December 19, 1947Have instance of rotten, inherited capitalist who wants to be nationalized—withpayment, of course. He doesn’t want the responsibility of running his business,he wants to make a profit on the government paying him off at more than thebusiness is worth, and he uses political pull to get that.206 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_206_r1.jpg]The kind of knowledge, judgment and intellectual initiative which is needed forproduction (the article on oil in the Texaco magazine)—and the bureaucrats’method of evasion, double-talk, avoidance of the responsibility of the clear-cutand the specific. Show how and why production cannot be achieved by such method. January 5, 1948NOTES FOR LABOR RULESUnions forbid their members to run more than a certain number of miles permonth. Why? To keep jobs for more men than is necessary? To whose advantage isthat, except the union bosses who get extra dues? At whose expense is this done?At the expense of the abler men of the union, who have no right to advance, noright to work as long and make as much as they otherwise would have.If we suppose that all the members are equally able—still, some are extraneousand should go into other work. This system only has the effect of collective,organized mediocrity—it provides that no man in the profession is going to workharder than the others, so that all will be kept at a certain level of effortand income—I suppose on the assumption that it makes them less subject to thedangers of change of job with the growth of progress and the need of fewer menin their profession. This is organized stoppage of progress—as is any case whereeffort and ability are artificially stopped or limited. Also—this keeps thebetter, abler, more ambitious men out of the profession.Does this really protect them in their jobs, even the mediocre men? Or does itcreate artificial dangers of protracted unemployment? And, of course, it holdstheir living standard down, by stopping general progress. Actually, industrialprogress which cuts jobs in one old line, creates more of them in several newlines. The readjustment or transition should not be difficult or involve periodsof unemployment—in a free economy (because it is gradual). [Union policies are]instances of the savage or animal “range of the moment” psychology in anindustrial civilization that functions on the long range principle of theintellect.Unions are organized against the better members of their own profession.(For pay rates of railroad labor, see This Fascinating Railroad Business [byRobert S. Henry], pp. 405—407.)FOR LABOR TROUBLES (CHAPTER XI)Pat Logan and other good engineers do not get any advantage out of the John GaltLine—the higher speed only reduces their working time and they have to loaf therest of the month, while unemployed engineers from the closing railroads flockto get part of this work, part of the new, fast runs.The unions immediately raise the costs of the operation of the John Galt Line,when the economy of operation is so desperately needed.With the shortage of engines and cars—they demand to limit the length of trains,thus requiring more engines and cars, without making full use of the onesavailable.Management and inventors do everything in their power to exercise their geniusto raise the productivity of employees. The employees do everything in theirpower to hamper and prevent this—yet demand raised pay.Union’s demand for engineer and conductor for the “guest” line in case ofemergency when train is routed over tracks of another line.Demand for extra men on each Diesel unit.Extra day’s pay for breaking a train in half and taking the two sections over ahill individually—in mountainous country.Union’s excuse for limiting train length—the caboose jerks ! ! In the case ofpassenger train—the “poor conductor” has too much work! !(See the “Railway Progress” article for quotes of union leaders’ attitude toward“those locomotive giants” and for examples of paying employees twice for worknot done.)The added expense cuts the slim profits of the stockholders who need their ownmoney desperately—show this concretely, as one of the results of what happenswhen the John Galt Line does not pay. (This leads to the ruin of the Coloradostockholders—the first pressure is on Ellis Wyatt.) (Ted Nielsen—no Diesels.)207 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_207_r1.jpg]The “limitation of ability”: Rearden is forbidden to produce more than OrrenBoyle is able to produce. The reason: “Rearden is destroying Boyle’s market andchance at a livelihood.” (Same principle—Pat Logan and the bums who cannot run abig train, but Logan’s opportunity to run more trains is stopped.)At the same time—the “Fair Share Law”: Rearden has to supply everybody, while heis not allowed to produce. Here—the rise of Mouch, who shrugs when thecontradiction is pointed out to him: “Everything is a contradiction—we act onthe expediency of the moment.” Mouch wants Rearden to fail, so that all businesscan be nationalized. January 17, 1948The judge on strike in the valley: “I was supposed to be the guardian ofjustice. But the laws they asked me to enforce made of me the executor of thevilest injustice ever perpetrated on earth.”208 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_208_r1.jpg]The legend of Prometheus who took the fire back, until men called off theirvultures. (It is probably Francisco who tells [Dagny] this.)January 30, 1948FOR CHAPTER IX: THE JOHN GALT LINEThe reaction of the public as it watches the progress of the John Galt Line:those who sympathize and admire; those who are honestly neutral and watch with agrowing sense of sympathy, not knowing its real reason and not knowing anythingabout the business or technical part of it; those who hate it and want it tofail, in interested malice, like Orren Boyle, or in the pointless malice of themen of destruction, like James Taggart, Bertram Scudder, Philip Rearden; but themost vicious ones (?), the truly evil, are those who watch with cautiousinterest, the safe-players and middle-of the-roaders, who want somebody else totake the risks, then get ready to grab the benefits.James Taggart’s attitude must be shown clearly: when things go well, he is nothappy about it, he is insidiously sarcastic; when things go badly, he is scared,but there is a strange undertone of gloating pleasure in him at the same time.This last, without his conscious admission to himself, is his gratification ofhis real desire—the wish for destruction.Philip Rearden’s attitude must be shown: he is not involved like Taggart, buthis essential attitude is the same. In his case, it is the plain joy of seeingRearden fail—then he is not the only failure, his great brother can fail, too,the great brother isn’t as great as he thinks, etc. February 8, 1948NOTE FOR GALT’S SPEECHThe whole issue in the world is between the men who want to work undercompulsion and the men who don’t. Well, those of us who don’t work as slavesleave the rest of you free to do it; go right ahead, organize any kind ofslavery for yourselves among yourselves. But don’t try to impose it on us anddon’t expect us to accept it. We don’t need you. We don’t seek to force you—werest on the principle of voluntary relations among men. But you—by your verypremise—admit that you need us, since you find it necessary to use force againstus. Well, it can’t be done.And as for those who wish to rule, who think they don’t want to work undercompulsion, but want to exercise compulsion upon others to make them work—thesame applies to them. If they think work can be done under compulsion, they knownothing about the nature of work. If they find it necessary to use compulsion onothers, it means that they need something from those others. Well—we refuse itto them. They think they want to force their inferiors. What about us—the men ofability, their equals or superiors? Do they think they can force us? And as tothose they think are inferiors, what is the standard when force is involved? Ifthey believe that they cannot deal with a man’s intelligence, because he hasn’tany, force will not give it to him. If, by their own definition, they are themen of intelligence, what do they need from the stupid ones and what do theyfear?CHAPTER IX: THE JOHN GALT LINE THE RIDEThe sense of movement—and the achievement it represents. Dagny’s feeling—thesense of achievement and triumph.The overall mood—the real kind of joy. (“It is so easy—and so right!”)The philosophical meaning—life is motion, the essence of man’s life is theachievement of a purpose he has chosen, and any purpose of man can be achievedonly through his reason.Dagny thinks of Nat Taggart and the initials on the first train ever to crossthe continent. This is the first new Taggart Line or venture in manygenerations.The people gathered to watch the train (on hills, on city station platforms) —asin the old days.The guard of honor along the way.Dagny and Rearden: The physical sensation is the same as that of the ride: theride is physical, but its only meaning is spiritual, the physical sensation ofpleasure in the flying speed through space is given only by the spiritualknowledge of what made it possible, of one’s achievement. The feeling of: “I amflying here—and I made it.”Dagny feels tense—and easy in tension, like the work of Pat Logan. She feelssuspended over life as the engine is over the rails.Dagny and Rearden in the motor units. Dagny thinks of the intelligence thesemotors represent—again, the physical as the shape of the spiritual. The feelingof: “Don’t let it go!” She wonders why she feels that this is threatened.The flight across the bridge.The arrival at Wyatt station.1948 [The following notes were made for the scene in which James Taggart and CherrylBrooks meet for the first time. The scene immediately follows the success of theJohn Galt Line, and conveys Taggart’s attitude toward this success.]FOR: JAMES TAGGART AND CHERRYL BROOKSShow that Taggart’s attitude is a total dead-end, the hatred of that which hehimself needs for survival, the hatred of his own gain or advantage—the realparadox. This has to be the advance notice of his final scene, of the fullrevelation that the parasite functions on the principle of death.Cherryl’s attitude in this scene is trust and naive admiration; she feelsencouraged, uplifted that a man like Taggart finds her of interest or value; shethinks he sees something good in her. Taggart’s attitude toward her iscontempt—contempt for a person so low as to admire him; yet he wants theadmiration—and he knows that it can come only from someone who is low; he wouldfear any better sort of person. That is why he hates Cherryl’s later attempt torise.The paradox is that he wants her admiration to be sincere—that is what attractshim to Cherryl—he would not want the flattery and pretense of a designinggold-digger, and he would recognize that as a lie. He wants the good (sincerity)from and for an evil (from stupidity, for his rottenness)—and there is the“moral blackmail” or exploitation of the good against itself: he wants theadvantage of a real virtue (sincerity) for the satisfaction of his rottenness,he wants good in the service of evil, he wants to use and hurt Cherryl by meansof nothing but her own virtue, not by means of any of her bad qualities (hurther—because it is deceit and fraud that he is putting over on her). He wants thesatisfaction of a real admiration for virtues which he does not possess—he wantsa spiritual reward, unearned—he wants the spiritual, moral “something fornothing”—and the “something” in this case has to be real, while nothing abouthim is.That is why their relationship leads to tragedy. Good cannot come from evil;Cherryl’s [admiration comes] not from stupidity, but from ignorance, soTaggart’s scheme could not work; she had to begin to see the truth. Her horroris the discovery that he has a desire to keep her low, to have her rotten, notto let her improve or rise—that he loved her, not for her value, but for herrottenness, that that is what he saw and sought in her. She sees the horror of“love as an answer to evil,” instead of “love as an answer to value”—which isthe whole essence of man’s need of love. In their marriage, what pleased him washer inferiority, which made him superior and magnanimous by comparison. He losthis interest in her when she lost her inferiority. She realizes that he wantedhis “love” for her to be alms—he did not want her to deserve it, to earn it.(There’s another perverted “balance” —real “disinterested,” “rewardless”altruism—he wanted something unearned from her, and he wanted her to getsomething unearned from him. The reality of something earned, of a real virtueor a real value and “spiritual payment or exchange,” was intolerable to him, itsmashed his whole fraudulent structure of emotions and relationships. And hereis an example of Taggart’s “death principle”—he cannot tolerate any value; butthe basis of life is search for and achievement of values.)In contrast to the relationship of Dagny and Rearden, James Taggart’s [feelingfor] Cherryl is not love as an answer to and reward for value, but the ghastlyperversion which is love as alms—love as a “looking down”—love, not for value,but for its absence—the essential pattern of any unearned love, such as “love ofhumanity,” love as pity, as mercy, as anything but justice. (Love as justice isessentially admiration—and nothing else.)209 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_209_r1.jpg]In their subsequent meetings, James Taggart takes pleasure in stressing hisunhappiness, in whining—because he knows that Cherryl cares and feels concern.She is the first person who has ever really cared about what he feels, whodoesn’t want to see him suffer—so he enjoys making her suffer when he whines andcomplains. His motive here is an ugly, twisted mixture of sadism and, at thesame time, appeal for her pity. His own feeling for her is based, in a sense, onpity—since he looks down upon her; yet, at the same time, he wants her to feelpity for him, for his suffering—which means, in effect, to look down upon him. July 5, 1948Have an example (later) of how Taggart uses his “Washington” power—what itconsists of. Some ghastly little bureaucrat has the crucial power to decide sometremendous issue (the power is his accidentally, not intentionally, through thesheer complex stupidity of the laws and the set-up) —and he decides it inTaggart’s favor for some such consideration as a thousand dollars and a dinnerat a nightclub with “important people.” The results of his decision involvebillions [of dollars] of other people’s wealth, are disastrous to Rearden and tothe economy of the whole country. (This may be used with regard to themoratorium on brains.) October 18, 1948[The following deals with Rearden’s anniversary party.]MAIN POINT OF PARTY SCENEThe guilt of the creators is that they don’t claim moral value, moralsuperiority, and moral sanction.One of the causes of it—generosity: the reluctance to rub it in, to remind theweaker ones of their weakness; the belief that the weaker ones know it anywayand are grateful; the benevolence of over-abundance, the pleasure of helpingothers to enjoy life; the belief that the weaker ones do enjoy life and are onthe moral standard of loving life, ability and greatness; the living power ofstrength, which respects living human beings and leaps in to eliminate sufferinganywhere, almost automatically.The result—the creators are the ones who suffer, who permit the parasites tobecome their torturers, who make it possible for the parasites to destroyeverything sacred to the creators, to hamper the creators’ work and function, toblock the creators’ way, to destroy all the things the creators live for, tospread and commit evil, and finally to destroy the creators themselves. This isthe “penalizing of virtue” and the “torture of the best by means of the bestwithin them.” The parasites have no weapon—except the creator’s own moral virtueturned against him. May God damn every man who uses another man’s virtue to hisdetriment, as a means of harming the victim.The proper course—not to support or tolerate any man who is not on the creators’moral standard. To define that standard and then follow it ruthlessly, withtotal consistency, in every aspect of one’s life. To make no allowances andpermit oneself no pity. To give nothing unearned to anyone, in any form—notphysical and most particularly not spiritual. Neither financial alms norundeserved affection. Self-interest must be present in one’s every action.(If Rearden has no selfish interest in Lillian, he must leave her; never mindwhat she feels or why. If Rearden does not approve of Philip’s way of living, hemust not support him. Even if Philip were struggling to work, Rearden must notgive him loans or help, unless it is on a real business basis, that is, unlessRearden can actually get a profit from the loan. Then it would help them both.Not otherwise. Not if Rearden does it only for Philip’s sake. This is the crimeof selflessness. And here is the outline of the “trader principle.”)Since the basis of the creators’ morality is the principle of living, theycommit the greatest moral sin possible to them when they become “their ownexecutioners,” i.e., when they furnish the means for their destroyers to destroythem.The creators must understand the basic difference between themselves and theparasites: the creators are on the life principle, the parasites are on theprinciple of death. The creators’ final, overall purpose is the continuation ofhuman life (one’s own, and, as secondary consequence, all human life, sincethere is no conflict or contradiction here); the parasite’s final, overallpurpose is destruction and death (not a “pitiful, inept attempt to live,” whichwould deserve the stronger man’s help—but actually the intention to destroyoneself and others, to destroy everything that constitutes life, every form ofpleasure and happiness first of all, and, as close second, every form of virtue,value, competence, greatness).210 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_210_r1.jpg]When the bastards preach that “virtue suffers in this world,” they do mean it,though not in the way it sounds. In their world, virtue does suffer and is meantto suffer—the real virtue, the virtue of competence; while their phony altruistvirtue, of course, fails and suffers in relation to physical success—and thisgives them ground for damning this earth, for considering it evil. So the resultis that the truly virtuous, competent man is made to feel guilty, to feel thathis success is evil, to suffer spiritually and morally—while the altruist makesa glory of his own failure and appropriates moral satisfaction (which he can’tenjoy, just the same).211 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_211_r1.jpg][The following dialogue between a businessman and Francisco was cut from anearly draft of the party scene. ]“I mean, is it necessary to hurt anybody’s feelings? There’s some truth towhatever it is you said. On the other hand, there’s some truth to what JimTaggart says. Jim’s got a pretty decent record of public spirit and service.What I say is, do we have to go to extremes?”“To extremes of what?”“Of anything.”“No, we don’t have to. They’ll come to us.”“Who?”“The extremes.”He walked off, leaving the businessman staring after him. October 30, 1948TO THINK OVER:Ragnar Danneskjöld—doesn’t he impede plot?

(Specific illustration.)January 13, 1949From Chapter XI: Rearden cannot deal successfully with the parasites—he isdisarmed by his guilt. He thinks: “They’re evil—but so am I. Who am I to castthe first stone? ... Don’t think of it. Just work. Work harder. Don’t lookaround you.” (If he were certain of their total, inexcusable evil—and of his ownrighteousness—he would have smashed them, or died in the attempt; and he wouldhave won.) February 21, 1949DAGNY-REARDEN VACATIONThey stop at small hotels or sleep in the woods. They talk little. But theydrive in silence and can talk to each other in the middle of a train ofthought—“gloating” about the John Galt Line, or plans for the future. They areenjoying, “assimilating” their achievement—and “getting charged” for newjourneys (“because joy is one’s fuel”). Rearden’s self-centered enjoyment: theway he carries her across a stream, the way he breaks a branch out of theirpath, the way he makes a fire. The emphasis is not on the views they see, but ontheir seeing it. The point is their active estimate of value; if a tourist seessomething without a judgment of value and an emotional reaction of hisown—what’s the point of gazing at things? People are willing to be mirrors orblotters; but not Rearden—he is a ray of light, bringing things into sight andmeaning. His manner of comment is always what can be done—or what one can learnfrom what has been done—always the active, purposeful reaction.They sleep together in a ravine, under the remnant of a trestle. She thinks thatthis is an underground honeymoon, and wonders why it has to be “underground.”No, it is not an accident of his being a married man, of his having first chosenthe wrong woman—she senses dimly some connection between their secret wanderingand the desolation of the country around them.The slovenly auto court landlady—who sneers at them because she knows that theyenjoy sex (that they are held together by nothing but pleasure) and because theyhave a good, expensive car. The denunciation of sex, of pleasure, ofself-indulgence—and of the rich and the industrialists at the same time. Bothhave a common root.Dagny realizes (in indifferent wonder) that she and Rearden are expected to feelguilty. People look at them as at enemies.March 10, 1949HISTORY OF THE “TWENTIETH CENTURY MOTOR CORPORATION ”The purpose of every step of this history is to show the futility of menpossessing material means, if they do not have the mind to know how to use them.(This is the answer to the whining attitude of: “If I only had the money, or thefactory, or the movie studio, etc.” or “It isn’t fair that one guy inherits afactory—nobody gave me a factory ... etc.”)The parasites (the second-handers incapable of independent judgment, of newrational connections) own an inexhaustible means of wealth in the MotorCompany—Galt’s motor—but they do not know what to do with it, and so it doesn’tdo them any good. With the means—property and equipment—of the best motorcompany in existence, the parasites can achieve nothing but ruin. This answersthe fools who think that they’d do wonders if only somebody would hand them thetools of achievement. It is not the tools that achieve. And the man with themind capable of using the tools will earn his own tools.While showing the above, in the history of the motor company, show also the kindof motives, morals, ideas, and human characters who make the“something-for-nothing, give-me-a-chance” attitude (and actions) possible.Also: show the savage, “range-of-the-moment” irresponsiblity of those who thinkthat making money is a matter of speculation, of putting something over onsomebody, of exchange without production—the parasites who think that wealth isa matter of grabbing a material possession and palming it off on somebody fast,not realizing that the profit they thus make (on the re-sale of the factory, forinstance) is made possible only by someone being a producer. When there are noproducers, the material wealth is worthless. The “short-range” savage may think:what the hell, he got away with it—but did he? And can we have a society gearedto giving a chance to these parasites? Will such a society remain productivelong? (In a free economy, the Reardens sweep these types out, just as productivecitizens eliminate criminals who are then only “marginal”; a controlled economyeliminates the Reardens and breeds the “short-range” savages or speculators ofthe moment.)(A proper trader is one who performs a real service of distribution of goods, aservice needed by the producers of the goods. Such a trader takes intelligentrisks [based on] his knowledge and long-range judgment. A speculator functionson the confusion or trouble of the moment, without plan. No, they cannot bedifferentiated by any law. The objective reality of their performance, in a freeeconomy, builds up the first and destroys the second. The trader creates his ownfunction where his services are needed, where no one else is doing thisparticular job. A speculator functions when proper exchange and proper tradersare restricted by force. As example: a blockade-runner is a trader; ablack-marketeer who pays off the bureaucrats, who is their representative orpartner, is a speculator.) March 25, 1949NOTES REGARDING THE WELFARE STATE(For the scene with Dagny and the old worker from the Twentieth Century MotorCorporation, and for the general theme.)Under capitalism, the motive and basic principle throughout the whole system isthe positive good, and human ability. A worker works so that he himself willmake a profit, the boss will make a profit, and the customers who have earnedthe price of the product will buy it. The motive throughout is reward(satisfaction), an earned reward, and the standard of value is ability.Under a collectivist system, the basic principle is suffering and incompetence.A worker works to contribute something to the collective—not for his own profit,reward, or satisfaction. His boss is not supposed to make a profit. The customeris not supposed to be the man who has earned the price of the product, but theincompetent or disabled who needs it. The purpose of the whole society is towork for and be inspired by the incompetent and the disabled. If the goodsproduced are supposed to be a value—then it is suffering and incompetence (the“death qualities”) which are rewarded, not success and ability, not the “lifequalities.” It’s not only that the “life qualities” are penalized; it’s that the“death qualities” are made the inspiration, goal, and motivation of the wholesociety.Also, every man in such a society is a beggar, whether he earns or doesn’t earnhis “share.” A worker simply gives his effort—as alms to society. Whatever hegets in return is alms given to him by society (by other workers), since he hasno claim or right to a reward; he does not sell his product, he gives it. It isnot even supposed to be his to give; he has no property rights to his product orto himself, and therefore the payment he receives is not his in the proper senseof a salary earned, it is a gift, a charity from society. (His production giveshim no right, but his need does. He may demand that others take care of him, buthe may not take care of himself. Failure, misery, incompetence are to hisadvantage and give him a claim; effort and ability give him nothing.)Re: “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. ” In anormal human being, need and ability are exactly balanced. A normal man has thecapacity to produce everything he needs—if he does not copy or borrow hisdesires from others, but stays within the bounds of his own mind, i.e., if he isnot a second-hander who defines his needs or desires by envying (or wishing toimpress) the men of greater ability who can produce more than he can—and if helives in a free, capitalistic economy. (Besides, in a free, capitalistic economythe better minds help him to produce more than his own ability could produce ifhe were left entirely to his own devices.)The only instance when a man’s needs exceed his ability to satisfy them is thestate of illness—the sick, disabled, or insane; i.e., the abnormal.Can society be geared to and ruled by the standards of the abnormal? Shouldnormal men exist for the sake of the abnormal? Should the abnormal be the goal,inspiration and first concern of the normal? Can healthy men live on the regimeof a hospital?(Children, of course, cannot satisfy their needs either. But that is whatconstitutes being a child, what distinguishes a child from an adult. Childhoodis growth into, preparation for, adulthood—for the state of independence, i.e.,a state in which one can satisfy one’s needs. Should society be geared to andruled by the standards of the incomplete, the unformed, thenot-yet-fully-human?)A system which penalizes honesty and rewards dishonesty is vicious. This is whathappens in the “needs” society. Assuming that the goods produced are a value(and they are, since everybody’s goal is to produce them), and assuming that allthe citizens have accepted the “needs” principle as their moral code—then anhonest man, trying to be an altruist-collectivist, will have to minimize hisneeds, demand as little as possible from society and thus be penalized, i.e.,get less value; whereas a dishonest man, preaching but not practicing thegeneral moral creed, will exaggerate his needs in every way he can, demand asmuch as possible from society and thus be rewarded, getting greater value themore he was able to cheat (since every “selfish” demand is cheating, i.e., isbreaking the altruist principle). The better you observe this moral code, themore you suffer; the greater your break of the code, the more you are rewarded.Now, if the person himself is not allowed to present his demands and define hisown needs—who does it? The vote of the collective? By what standard does thecollective then decide and define it? What is a “need”—beyond a cave, a bearskinand a bone to chew? And can even these be determined by others? What kind ofbone, for instance?A man with no right to demand any payment and no right to define his own needsis in a lower position than a slave or a charity ward in a poor-house, andcertainly lower than an animal.In a capitalist system, a man is not asked to sacrifice himself or penalizehimself. It is honesty that brings rewards—the honest exercise of one’s bestability, the honest production of valuable goods. Production has to behonest—when there are no controls or force involved to help one man to defraudothers, no way to gain anything except through demonstrated ability, voluntarilyaccepted by others as a value. The man fully living up to the principle ofpersonal ambition, personal responsibility, and independence is the man whowins, who gets the most value. There is no foothold or loophole for thedishonest. The man who cheats, who doesn’t produce or tries to be a parasite inany manner, is defeated by the system itself.212 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_212_r1.jpg]Note for Dagny and the old worker (who tells her about the beginning of thestrike): He tells her about the terrible state of working in the “needs”system—when you hate your own effort, when you lose your self-respect by theconstant pressure of the incentive to do less and less, the incentive not to doyour best. You begin to hate all your brothers [because you] worry which one ofthem is going to develop new needs that will become your responsibility, yourburden. You begin to hate them for every pleasure they may enjoy, you begin tomeddle into their private lives, because if they break a leg it’s you who’llsuffer, who’ll have to work and pay for it; you begin to meddle into their sexlives, because if they produce more babies, it’s you who’ll have to carry theburden. You can plan nothing, count on nothing, you have no future, since youdon’t know when or where someone’s need will claim your whole effort, regardlessof what plans or ambition you may have had for your own future.And since you do not approve of their desires or needs, you lose the incentiveto work; you cannot work if the concrete result or aim of your effort isrepugnant to you. And you have the nasty doubt of whether those brothers ofyours will take care of you, in case you need something; you begin to suspectthem and to hate them for this, too. Dependence breeds hatred—and you’re doublydependent on them: in your aim and in your needs, in both your production andyour consumption.(If this cannot be told by the same worker, have Dagny meet some otherex-worker, who tells her this, earlier.) (I think this last, another worker,will be better—somewhere along her quest for the motor, but not in Chapter XI.)More for above point: How can you judge the needs of your brothers and approveor disapprove? By what standard? You would have to take the attitude that youapprove without standards, merely because this is what they want. But by yourcommon moral code, they have no moral right to want or ask anything, they cannotdefine their needs either. Who does it, then? The elite super mind, of course.The dictator of the collective who is “the voice of the people,” who “existsonly to serve and knows what is good for them.” This illustrates the real motiveand appeal of collectivism. This is the secret ambition of all the collectivistprofessors.213 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_213_r1.jpg]Altruism seeks to patch the wounds of the sick by cutting off pieces of thebodies of the healthy. April 26, 1949EMOTIONAL MAIN LINE:Rearden hears Franciso’s speech on “money is the root of all good.” The nextstep of their friendship—but then Francisco tells of another [impending] crashof d‘Anconia Copper.On the evening of Ken Danagger quitting: Rearden and Francisco-the furnace.Rearden comes to Francisco—the mutual loneliness. Rearden tells him aboutordering his copper—Francisco’s moment of tragedy, when he leaps to the phone,but he doesn’t call.Rearden learns of sinking ship, loss of copper.Dagny and Francisco in the country, when she has quit.Blackmail of Rearden—[he gives in] for Dagny’s sake.Dagny-Francisco-Rearden. Francisco comes to Dagny’s apartment, to stopher—Rearden enters with key—Francisco learns the truth—Rearden slaps his face.After Francisco leaves, Dagny tells Rearden the truth. Their love scene—he doesnot say it, but we know that he knows he loves her.QUESTIONSIntegrate ending—after tunnel catastrophe. After whom does Dagny fly? (Wouldlike something better than car manufacturer, more important to plot, maincharacter rather than bit, if possible.)Last Dagny-Rearden scene of this part?How does Lillian discover truth?The death of Colorado-specific events to cause it, and to bring about closing ofthe John Galt Line.Tunnel catastrophe—integrate the parasites’ actions to main line of parasites’activity.Ken Danagger quits—specific hints leading up to it.Ragnar Danneskjöld-?April 27, 1949The main line of this whole part should be centered on Dagny-Rearden-Francisco.The events of economic ruin should be subordinated to their personal conflict,should be merely indicated, not presented in detail. From now on, the steps ofdestruction are accelerated, and also the signs of the strike, the steps of theclarification of the strikers’ purpose, motive, and philosophy. May 7, 1949Stress the reason of everybody’s fudging and cowardice: people know that theynow have to exist by favor, not by independent work and merit. Therefore, theymust not offend anyone or criticize anything, they must not make enemies, theymust try to make friends of everybody, they can’t tell on whose favor they mayhave to depend or when, they can’t tell at whose mercy they may be in thefuture. They do know one thing: that they are now in a world of arbitrary powerand undefined values, that reason, justice, merit are gone—and therefore it isdangerous to be moral, it is useless to be honest, it is more important to have“friends” than to have virtue; this is a world where morality is beingpenalized.May 10, 1949FOR GALT’S SPEECH:“So you want to know who is John Galt? I am the first man of ability who refusedto feel guilty about it. I am the first man who would not do penance for myvirtues nor allow them to be used as the tools of my own destruction. I am thefirst man who would not suffer martyrdom at the hands of those who were keptalive by my energy, yet who wished me to bear punishment for the privilege ofsaving their lives. I am the first man who did not accept—neither in weaknessnor in generosity—the miserable little enticement of affection offered by liarsand beggars in exchange for my lifeblood. I am the first man who told them thatI did not need them—and until they learned to deal with me as traders, givingvalue for value, they would have to exist without me, as I would exist withoutthem; then I would let them learn whose is the need and whose the power—and ifmankind’s survival is the standard, whose terms would set the way to survive.” May 14, 1949FOR FRANCISCO’S SPEECH ON MONEYAnother proof of the noble nature of money is that people are able to keep itonly so long as they keep their virtues—and no longer. When men become corrupt,when they compromise, when they lose their self-respect and their courage—swarmsof looters rise at once to seize their wealth, and the men are unable to defendit. When their money is unearned, when they do not have the proud, virtuousknowledge of their right to it—they are unable to hold it.A man without self-respect cannot defend himself. A man without respect for hiswealth cannot defend his wealth. But respect is an emotion which cannot be givenor received as alms, which cannot be unearned and causeless. Respect is anemotion possible only to the trader—an emotion as ruthlessly just as the laws ofgaining a profit. To respect his wealth, a man must know that he has earned it.To respect himself, a man must know that he has the capacity to earn and that hehas translated this capacity into reality by producing a [value]. This is wherethe root of human virtues is tied to the root of human wealth.May 16, 1949FOR DAGNY-LILLIANLillian makes a crack about Dagny being successful in business because shedoesn’t care for “power over men,” because she is sexless, men are not attractedto her. Then Lillian wants the bracelet back—Dagny refuses.Lillian says: “Do you know what your wearing that bracelet should mean?”Dagny answers that it should mean that she is sleeping with Rearden—sex asadmiration, as an answer to one’s highest values.“Then any woman should want to sleep with my husband?”“Any woman who values herself highly enough.”“Then what do you feel for me as his wife?”“I am answering your exact words, Mrs. Rearden: the most profound respect. Youare, of course, the only one to judge whether that respect is rightly yours.”[This last sentence was crossed out.] May 19, 1949NOTE ON MORALITYMan exists for his own happiness, and the definition of happiness proper to ahuman being is: a man’s happiness must be based on his moral values. It must bethe highest expression of his moral values possible to him.This is the difference between my morality and hedonism. The standard is not:“that is good which gives me pleasure, just because it gives me pleasure” (whichis the standard of the dipsomaniac or the sex-chaser)—but “that is good which isthe expression of my moral values, and that gives me pleasure.” Since the propermoral code is based on man’s nature and his survival, and since joy is theexpression of his survival, this form of happiness can have no contradiction init, it is both “short range” and “long range” (as all of man’s life has to be),and it leads to the furtherance of his life, not to his destruction.The form of happiness which involves “a price” to be paid for it afterwards (“aprice,” not in the sense of the means and effort to achieve it, but in the senseof a consequence which is evil to him by his own standards, such as the hangoverthe morning after a drunken orgy) is an improper form of happiness by that veryfact, a sign that the man who finds enjoyment in it holds a destructive premisethat must be corrected.A man must, above all, be proud of his happiness, of the things in which hefinds enjoyment and of the nature of his enjoyment. This is the differencebetween James Taggart and the strikers. The strikers find their joy inself-exaltation, in achievement. James Taggart finds his joy in evil—in cruelty,fraud, degradation of others to his own level. (For example, he takes pleasurein the fact that people are disgraced by paying homage to him, and he enjoysbringing them to this degradation.) His happiness is based on that which, by hisown standards, is evil; his happiness requires evil. Man’s proper happiness mustnot depend upon or be derived from anything which is evil, low, contemptible,undesirable by his own standards.The evil man is not the one who mistakenly believes that bad things are good andacts accordingly; this is only an error of knowledge, not a sin, not a moralflaw. The evil man is the one who loves evil for being evil. (The poor fool whoindulges in sex while semi-believing that it is evil according to his churchmorality, is not wholly bad because he does not really believe that sex is evil.But this does destroy his self-respect and creates all kinds of miserableconflicts for him. The evil man is the one who, knowing that sex is good, takespleasure in forbidding it and thus causing men to suffer.)Man does exist for happiness; he has the right to seek that which makes himhappy. But he is a being of free will, therefore a being who cannot existwithout a moral standard (a standard of values). If he attempts to drop his ownessence—reason—and to seek happiness in the irrational and the contradictory, ifhe evades his responsibility for his own emotions, if he lets his emotions rulehim without thought as to where these emotions came from, permitting himself tobe determined by his own feelings, which means by his own stale thinking, by hisarrested reason—that is where he destroys himself and is unable to achieve anysort of happiness.This is the key to the pattern of how men “suspend” their reason.Another aspect: a man’s happiness must not include any evil as its essentialelement. This is the point which disqualifies the alleged happiness of analtruist. His happiness depends, by definition, on somebody else’s suffering ;he considers this suffering an evil, since he finds it so important to relieveand eliminate it, since he makes that the paramount aim of his life. Therefore,his happiness is based on an evil, and requires that evil to exist. In a worldof happy men, he could not be happy (which, of course, is one of the reasons whycollectivists achieve horrors).If it is said that suffering exists in the world anyway, permanently andessentially, therefore it’s noble to combat it—then that is the malevolentuniverse. Man does not exist for suffering. Suffering is an accidental,“marginal” part of his existence, which he must fight in order to be free toexist in happiness; [a part] which he must overcome as quickly as possible—andnot spend his life seeking, thus making it the aim of his life. The sufferingwhich threatens men from physical nature is negligible compared to the sufferinghe brings upon himself and others. If man functioned properly in the field opento him and determined by him—the field of his choice, his free will, histhinking and actions—he would eliminate most, and perhaps even all, of thesuffering caused by the accidents of his physical nature.The essence of suffering is destruction. By acting on the premises ofself-destruction, man brings about suffering, his own and that of others. And heacts on a premise of self-destruction when he places others above self. He actsagainst his own nature and theirs. The suffering of others cannot be made one’sconcern. It is not within our power of action. It is not within the function ofour nature.Help to others can, at best, be only an incidental activity and then only on a“trader‘s” basis—such as help to a loved one, where one has a specific, selfish,personal reason for wishing to help. Just as one cannot conduct one’s own lifeon the basis of trying to avoid pain and holding that to be a final goal, justas one must live for one’s happiness and fight one’s suffering as an incidentalon the way, so one cannot live for the relief of the suffering of others, as agoal—only this last is infinitely more improper.And neither can one live for the happiness of others—because that involves one’sown suffering as an essential, since one’s happiness is not automatic, but hasto be achieved by one’s own effort, and that effort is the chief duty of one’slife (essentially, the sole duty). One’s own happiness is within one’s ownpower, and one’s whole nature is tied to the necessity of achieving it; thehappiness of others is not. This is the point involving and illustrating man’sessential independence.214 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_214_r1.jpg]Note in regard to Christian morality: The Christian moralists would accept thefirst paragraph of my statement here—but then, of course, the difference lies inthe definition of the moral code involved. And that is where they would notaccept the second part of my statement—the fact that one’s happiness must notinclude evil as its essential part. The Christian morality includes the mostvicious evil as the most essential part of the happiness it advocates:self-sacrifice. This leads to all the vicious paradoxes of “be happy becauseyou’re not happy,” “find happiness in suffering,” etc.There is no conflict and no sacrifice necessary when a man functions on hisproper moral standards. Giving up a party in order to write a novel is not asacrifice, but plain common sense, an acknowledgment of the impossibility of“having your cake and eating it, too” or of doing two things at the same time. Arational man does not desire the impossible—and, therefore, feels no pain in nothaving it, and commits no sacrifice. The sense of sacrifice is possible only tothe emotion-ruled man, who wants or feels without thinking. The happiness ofman’s proper morality does not require his own suffering.The essential test of any moral code or teaching is the presence or absence ofthe paradox. A paradox cannot exist. It is only the result and sign of man’serrors in thinking. If one accepts a paradox as an essential part of one’s moralcode—right there is the sign that one has accepted a code untrue to reality,that one is in the realm of the irrational, and, therefore, one has accepteddestruction as a principle, and as a goal of one’s conduct. (Besides, a codebased on a paradox cannot be practiced; so this leads to the “lip-servicemorality” of preaching what one cannot practice.) Destruction is the result of adeparture from reality. Man’s destruction is a result of his suspending hismeans of survival and his tie with reality—his reason. By accepting any sort ofparadox, he destroys reality in his own eyes, he destroys his control overreality, his means of knowledge, he destroys his mind—and his destruction can bethe only result.A point requiring a great deal of detailed consideration is that the paradox isthe chief symptom and the chief weapon of all the destroyers of man. May 29, 1949FOR “MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL GOOD ”“So you think that money is the root of all evil? Have you ever looked at theroot of money?”The root of money—production. The root of production—the mind.Money is the material form of a spiritual achievement.To make money requires the highest spiritual values. (America is the firstnation that ever spoke of “making” money.)Money is the tool of a society of free men—men as equals—money as the guaranteethat the product of your effort will be exchanged for the product of the effortof others, that you are dealing with producers—not with parasites or looters.Money is the symbol of your dealing with men whom you can trust.Money is the tool of freedom—it gives you choice of everything being produced.Money is the tool of your values—the means to exercise your values.Money will buy happiness—if you understand both money and happiness. Money isyour tool of achievement and enjoyment. It will give you the enjoyment that youcreate; but it will not buy you the second-hand kind of enjoyment, the source ofwhich is in others. Money is your passkey to the services of other men—yourmeans of dealing with them, not through force, fear, or suffering, but throughthe good—through offering them a value, a means to the achievement of theirdesires, in exchange for what you want from them.But money will not become a tool of evil. Money destroys those who attempt to[make it such a tool].Money destroys those who defy its root. Money will not buy intelligence for thefool. It will not buy the admiration and respect of men who understand theseterms—for the man who doesn’t deserve them. It stands as the best guard of man’svirtues—the virtues needed for “making” money. Money always remains aneffect—and refuses to become a cause. It will not give the parasite what hewants most—its own source—the unearned, undeserved virtues of the man who makesmoney.Money is the hardest test of a man—took at the heirs who are wrecked by it. Noman may be smaller than his money. Money is the barometer of a man’scharacter—if he claims to despise it, he’s making it dishonestly; if he is proudof it, he’s earned it and deserves it. [This paragraph was added later.]In the hands of the producer, money is the means of security. In the hands ofthe looter, money is the agent of his destruction (as in the case of thecriminal). Whenever a society establishes criminals-by-right, whenever thelooter is permitted to rob legally—his money is the attraction for otherlooters, who will get it from him as he got it, achieving nothing but generaldestruction and slaughter.Money is the barometer of a society’s virtue.Whenever money is in the wrong hands, in the hands of those who have not earnedit, in the hands of grafters and looters (whenever one can get richer bydishonesty than by honesty)—it is the sure sign that that society is evil, thatit is corrupt and in the process of destruction.[Note added later: Paper money—a check on an account which the bureaucrat doesnot own.Money is the symbol of virtue. It cannot be made by nor will it stay in uncleanhands. The highest virtues are required to make money—or to keep it. Men withoutcourage, without pride, without the highest moral sense of and for their money(the men who apologize for their money)—are not able to keep it. They are thenatural prey of looters.Now, in the first real country of money in history—the country of production andachievement—men have come to regard money as the savages did. Throughouthistory, money was made by the producers and seized by the looters. Men havecontinued, in every different form, to exploit and despise the producers andexalt the looters. Now the one country of money is proclaiming the looter’sstandards; its men of honor are the looter, the moocher and the beggar. Unlessand until it accepts money as its highest, noblest standard—it is doomed to thedestruction it is asking for and deserves.Tears, whips and guns—or dollars. Take your choice, there is no other.(When money ceases to be the tool—then men become the tools of the looters.)(“You damn money and you all want it. So you damn yourselves.”)(“When you denounce money, it’s always the heir-parasite or the crook that youdenounce. What about the man who made the money? You denounce the parasite ofthe unearned—and, as cure, you wish everybody to become parasites of theunearned.”)OUTLINE OF MONEY SPEECHThe nature of money:The root of money—production, mind, virtue.The money in your wallet as a symbol of trust—not of moochers and looters.Definition of money—guardian of rights, independence, freedom, benevolence,brotherhood, integrity; the tool of your values.Money as a scourge of the “reversers of cause and effect.” The things whichmoney won’t do: buy happiness, intelligence, etc.The heirs of great fortunes.What happens when you acquire money by contemptible means—this is the root ofthe hatred of money. (The lovers of money are willing to work for it. Run fromthe haters.)Sociology:The apologizing rich won’t stay rich for long.The looters-by-law: the rule of brutality. (The society of death.)Money as a barometer of a society’s virtue.The destruction of gold—paper money.The consequences—the demoralization of men.Answers to all the smears against money: made by the strong at the expense ofthe weak—your neighbors don’t pay you a just reward—charity, instead ofcompetence.The denunciations of the parasite and the criminal, the silence about theproducer—what you are really after.The industrialist and the scientist—the real benefactor.History:The history of glorifying looters and despising producers (and the source of thequote about the evil of money).America—the country of money. The self-made man. “To make money.”The rise of the looters’ standards here. The warning.August 28, 1949NOTE REGARDING ART VS. ENTERTAINMENTThe idea that “art” and “entertainment” are opposites—that art is serious anddull, while entertainment is empty and stupid, but enjoyable—is the result ofthe non-human, altruistic morality. That which is good must be unpleasant. Thatwhich is enjoyable is sinful. Pleasure is an indulgence of a low order, to beapologized for. The serious is the performance of a duty, unpleasant and,therefore, uplifting. If a work of art examines life seriously, it mustnecessarily be unpleasant and unexciting, because such is the nature of life forman. An entertaining, enjoyable play cannot possibly be true to the deeperessence of life, it must be superficial, since life is not to be enjoyed. (Whycan’t a man like Graham Greene, for instance, write an “art” story which is alsoentertaining? Because his philosophical premises are false to life and could notbe expressed in action, in plot, which means: in reality.)Such is the credo of all the modern intellectuals who divide literature into“art” and “entertainment.” This school of thought will have two kinds ofrepresentatives in practice, both equally disgusting: the intellectual who willbe bored by the best kind of plot story because “if it has suspense, it can’t beserious”; and the intellectual who will reject any element of seriousness in astory as “high-brow,” declaring ostentatiously: “Me—I don’t believe in‘messages,’ I’m for entertainment” and hold that the burlesque theater is thehighest form of art. These [two types] are, basically, the “saint” (of altruism)and the cynic who takes pride in wishing “to go to hell,” to be daringly evil.Why does this school of thought always fail at the box office? Why doesn’t thepublic agree with these intellectuals? Because the public has not been corruptedby any serious acceptance of the essence of the altruist morality; the publicthinks of altruism as some sort of innocent form of good will and charity toone’s fellow men. The public does not believe that enjoyment is evil. The publichas never accepted the depravity of “if I enjoy this, it’s no good” and “if Ienjoy anything, I’m no good.”Incidentally, the intellectual does not enjoy anything; the dutiful form ofboredom he [feels for] his chosen “art” works is certainly not enjoyment, but akind of masochistic satisfaction in liking it because he’s supposed to like it,a form of quest for self-esteem on the pattern of: “There, I’m virtuous if Iapprove of this dull mess I’m supposed to like; I can’t really like it, but mytrying to is my step toward virtue.” (Contrast the public enthusiasm for a hitplay in the old days with the “sophisticated,” “we-don‘t-go-to-extremes”attitude of “smart” New Yorkers today.)Test: do you enjoy a book or play for its own sake?—or do you “enjoy” it as ameans to an end, the end being that self-conscious sense of acquiring somevirtue from it? Joy is an end in itself. My pattern of enjoyment is: I’m good,and if this thing has given me enjoyment, then it is good. Their pattern is: I’mno good and if this thing has made me better, then it is good.My pattern holds joy as its own end, man’s end. Their pattern holds joy and manas a means to an end—the end being God or the supernatural, since they hold thatman exists “for God” (or for others, or for the universe, or for anything buthimself). Any man’s enjoyment is based on his standard of values. I can enjoy anentertaining story because my standard of values holds man as a noble being andjoy as his proper aim in life. They cannot enjoy an entertaining story becausetheir standard of values holds man as depraved and joy as evil; therefore, theyget to the paradox of enjoying only the unenjoyable. There’s another example ofthe use of the paradox. Man cannot escape from joy, as the altruists and mysticswant him to; he can only pervert it into horror and sadomasochism.This is an illustration of the morality of altruism in practice. So they preachthat joy is evil? Well, they do achieve this much: their disciples lose thecapacity of enjoyment altogether. And since joy is the means, the advancer andprotector of life, the joyless creatures are ready for destruction; they have,in fact, destroyed themselves and their capacity for life. There’s altruism andits ultimate goal—destruction. October 4, 1949FOR REARDEN AND DAGNYHe told her that: he feels contempt for her; she is a bitch, as vile an animalas he is; he wants no pretense about love, devotion, or respect, no shred ofhonor to hide behind; he will have her at the price of his self-respect.Show him learning the opposite: that his admiration and respect for her are thesource of his sexual desire; that his desire is for the possession of thehighest woman he knows and is the expression of his greatest self-respect; thathe loves her, i.e., she is the most important and precious person to him, as aperson, not only as “a lay”; that instead of abasement, their affair gives him afeeling of elevation, it raises his self-respect, not destroys it; that he feelslove, respect, devotion, admiration for her, all the real moral emotions, theones expressing recognition of value.His other sensual capacities: love of good clothes, good cars, good furniture(as in his office), good jewelry for Dagny, other “self-indulgent” luxuries forboth of them, the jade vase in his office.Jealousy of the other man in her life.(So far, I have shown: that he makes her wear the bracelet of Rearden Metal;that he wants to leave his “official” life and go away with her and is happywith her; their understanding and respect for each other; that he turns againstLillian when she indirectly calls Dagny a gutter bitch; that he turns againstMayor Bascom when he insults Dagny; that he takes pleasure in Dagny’s greatness,that that arouses his sexual desire; that he takes pleasure in the thought ofDagny and another man, which is an unconscious acknowledgment that sex, as such,is great and beautiful, not evil and degrading.)215 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_215_r1.jpg]The incident of the ruby pendant: he learns that enjoyment of material luxury isan expression of spiritual values—the pendant would be meaningless to him onanother woman (it would be meaningless on the most beautiful naked woman, if shewere only a beautiful body); it would be meaningless if he had not earned it, ifit had been given to him or if he had inherited it. It is not only that he wantsher to have the pendant—he wants her to have it as a gift from him. Would itmean the same to him if she just happened to have the pendant? No. Would heenjoy giving it to some woman who craved it desperately, but who meant nothingto him? Hell, no.216 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_216_r1.jpg]He looks at her as a painting, but he wants the “painting,” and all it implies,in real life: the hopeless yearning versus the man of reality and action.Tie their scene to his groping for the moral issue—to the nature of mistakenmorality, of wrong moral values. And tie his feeling for her to his feeling forhis work.217 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_217_r1.jpg]He tells Dagny he would like her to be his kept woman; she laughs, saying thatshe’d like it for a month or two, but asks: would he like her, just as she is,if she were nothing but a kept woman? “You couldn’t be!” “No, I couldn’t. But ifI were, would you like it?” “I’d be bored to death.” He stops short,understanding the implications.218 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_218_r1.jpg]Rearden’s problem about sex is: he was bitterly disillusioned in his earlyexperiences, and he resented the fact that he felt a violent physical desirethat seemed to be independent of and in contradiction to his rational will andspiritual code of values. He concluded that sex is purely physical, and as suchhe hated it—it was a surrender of his will, a degrading necessity that held suchan immense power over him, created such a violent desire, yet had no spiritualmeaning.He learns that the capacity of sex is physical, a mechanism for the use andexpression of his spirit, the means of expressing in physical form one’sgreatest celebration of life, of joy, of one’s highest self-exaltation and one’shighest moral values in regard to man—that is, in regard to himself and thewoman of his choice. He learns that sex is the means and form of translatingspiritual admiration for a human being into physical action—just as productiveactivity is the translation of spiritual values into physical form, just as alllife is a process of conceiving a spiritual purpose, based on one’s spiritualcode of values, then giving it a material form—which is the proper, moral, andcomplete cycle for man’s existence, for the relation of man’s spirit to physicalmatter. The spirit sets the purpose and uses matter as its tool, as material;the spirit gives form to matter. Just as pure “spirituality,” divorced fromphysical action, is evil hypocrisy—so is the materialism which attempts to havematter give man purpose, value, and satisfaction. Just as “Platonic love” isevil hypocrisy—so is purely physical sex, which is an evil destruction of one’svalues.He thinks that his guilt is that while admiring Dagny as the highest woman, hewants to degrade her by making her a tool for the satisfaction of his physicalneed. He thinks it’s evil that his response to the highest is sexual desire. Helearns that that is precisely the high, moral quality of his desire for her. Hisdesire is a response to his highest values. He learns that evil consists of theattitude of other men who are attracted, not by the highest, but by the lowestthey know—by a mere body, with no regard for a woman’s character, or by a womanthey consciously despise, this giving them a sense of their own elevation bycontrast; the rotten self-fraud of men with an inferiority complex, men who tryto acquire self-esteem by triumph over a woman they have estimated as worthless.219 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_219_r1.jpg]The wrap of blue fox, and the roadside restaurant in winter.The conversation about the “kept woman”: the realization that they are much morecapable of enjoying this than the drunken “playboy” at the next table. Dagnyremembers the “reversal” at her first ball. He remembers her words at his party.The flowers.The cup carved of chalcedony.The crystal glasses—and the way he holds the glass when she serves him thedrink.220 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_220_r1.jpg]In contrast to his love of luxury: the way he enjoys nature, a sensualenjoyment, his body stretched on the ground in slacks and short-sleeved shirt.It is, of course, not a contrast, but the same thing—spiritual enjoyment ofmaterial nature.Rearden as the man who is the master of physical nature, whose spirit is themaster of matter—in factory, countryside, or luxury.221 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_221_r1.jpg]The evening when, on his way to her apartment, he feels loathing for the wholeworld, the shrinking feeling that he doesn’t want to touch anything : he has nosexual desire, no trace of it; then the sight of her against the city bringsback his feeling of the world, the world in which he wants to act and work, andwith that his sexual desire returns. It is an act of celebration—and he feelsconsciously that it is a great achievement of hers, a value, not a degradingsin, when he feels her experiencing pleasure and knows that she is capable ofit, that she is celebrating life as he is.222 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_222_r1.jpg]The incident when he has an affair with her in her office—the deliberatecontrast and “impropriety” of it.His “sadistic” touches of this kind.The way he runs his fingertips down the skin of her arm—here an example of thefact that he never indulges in the physical as such, i.e., merely as contact—thepurely physical in this sense is meaningless to both of them—it is not thecontact that arouses pleasure in them, it is the contact when it is anexpression of their spiritual attitude toward each other at that particularmoment. (Such as: their first affair as result of the train ride and the triumphwhich it represents; the way he takes her the next morning; their first scene inher apartment, the broken shoulder-strap.) October 6, 1949PHILOSOPHY OF SEX AND MORALITYNote: The reason why people consider sexual desire insulting to a woman is, inthe deepest sense, the fact that to most people sex is an evil, low, degradingaspect of man’s life. Since most people, in their philosophical premises, havedamned themselves and life on earth, their sex desires and actions are anexpression of evil (this is clearest in the case of desire for a womanconsciously estimated as one’s inferior). On such a premise, sexual desire isinsulting to the woman who is the object of it. Conventionally, the man issupposed to redeem this insult by the so-called higher, spiritual implicationsof marriage; but, if marriage is not involved, sexual desire is supposed to beinsulting.The twisted element of truth here is that sex has to have a high spiritual baseand source, and that without this it is an evil perversion. But the actualrelation of sex and spirit is not the way they believe: they believe that sex isevil as such, and that the spiritual aspects of marriage serve to redeem orexcuse it, or make it a pardonable weakness which has no tie with and is opposedto the spiritual elements of the relationship. They do not suspect theessential, unbreakable tie between sex and spirit—which is the tie between bodyand soul.On the right philosophical premise about sex, on my premise, it is a greatcompliment to a woman if a man wants her. It is an expression of his highestvalues, not of his contempt. In this sense, a husband would feel honored ifanother man wanted his wife; he would not let the other man have her—hisexclusive possession is the material form of her love for him—but he would feelthat the other man’s desire was a natural and proper expression of the man’sadmiration for his wife, for the values which she represents and which he saw inher.It is on the above ground that Galt feels no jealousy and no resentment ofFrancisco and Rearden in Dagny’s past. His reaction when he hears about Dagny’saffair with Rearden is simple, non-malicious envy—merely the shock of learningthat another man has what he himself so desperately wants. It is also the shockof the possibility, which he has kept in mind all these years, that Dagny maylove another man and he, Galt, may never have her, not even after she joins thestrike. But it is not the conventional fury against the thought that another mandegrades Dagny by possessing her.223 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_223_r1.jpg]Note how dreadful the general attitude on sex is: since all [the accepted]philosophies damn man, his life, and the earth—men’s attitude on sex is adegrading, ugly, corrupting evil, in all the many variations. And this isanother proof that sex is the expression of one’s entire philosophy and attitudetoward life. Since most people’s philosophy is a hodgepodge of contradictorybits, so is their attitude on sex. But man cannot exist without a basicphilosophy, from which all his actions, emotions and desires will come.The cheap little schools of “free love” attempt to glorify sex on a silly sortof materialistic basis—simply glorifying physical joy, considering themselves“vital as animals.” They are unable to discover a moral, spiritual premise tojustify sex—so they try to enjoy it without any morality, and, of course, itdoesn’t work, it doesn’t bring them any sort of spiritual happiness, and noteven much satisfaction.This is the same mistake as that of the materialists who—in protest againstmystical morality—declare that existence on earth has nothing to do with andrequires no morality. This attitude merely drives people back to church, tomystical morality—and people drag themselves back to it regretfully,reluctantly, knowing that it is unsatisfactory, that it cannot work—but knowingalso that they cannot exist without some form of morality, some code of values.This is another example of the vicious cutting of man in two—and setting hisspirit against his body.My most important job is the formulation of a rational morality of and for man,of and for his life, of and for this earth.(No wonder the advocates of religion are so insistent that “there can be nomorality without religion.” They seem to know their danger point. There’s mymain job.)The basic issue, of course, is the standard of values. Good and evil—why? Bywhat standard? Their standard is an arbitrary, “revealed,” unprov able“categorical imperative”—as they jolly well have to admit—and it rests on theirconception of God, and is then translated into indefensible nonsense in regardto conduct on this earth. (For instance, why should charity please God as thehighest virtue? Why should He be that unjust?) The standard supposedly is inanother dimension, opposite and contradictory in nature to ours—yet we aresupposed to live by it on earth, in this dimension. A rational morality startswith a standard of values (of good and evil) based on man, his life, and theearth; it starts with the fact that values are possible and necessary only to abeing of free will who has to function through choice and purpose.224 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_224_r1.jpg]If any school of morality considers morality a social, not an individual,matter—i.e., a code for the relation of man to man, and not for man’s ownconduct in regard to himself—then, of course, it will necessarily be acollectivist [theory] and it will not work. This is true of any religiousmorality or of any attempt at a “social” morality, like communism.Both above schools of “morality” have this in common: that they begin by placingthe standard of their code of values outside of man: God is the standard in onecase, “society” in the other. But since man is the entity, the unit underdiscussion for whom the code of morality is being proposed, the proper standardof values has to begin with him.Most blatantly obvious, in theory and in observable practice, is the fact thatman’s moral code has to apply primarily to his own private conduct in relationto himself and his life—and that only on the basis of the right code towardhimself will he or can he observe any sort of moral code toward others.Conventionally, it is thought that a man on a desert island needs no moral code.That is where he would need it the most. The proper code, of course, is:rational control of himself and his actions, a rational view of reality(identifying facts for what they are, to the best of his knowledge and capacity,being true to truth), the rational choice of his purpose and the action toachieve it.Conventionally, both the religious and the social schools of morality make itappear that moral behavior is an obligation which man owes to others, but not tohimself—that he has no selfish interest in morality—in fact, that his selfishinterests are actually opposed to his moral code, but he must observe it as asacrifice for and to others. Thus he is a sacrificial animal to God or tosociety—sacrifice, suffering, renunciation of happiness on earth are made [theessence] of his moral code. He must live for God, or society, or humanity, orthe poor, or whatever; he is always taken as a means to some end—but he is nevertaken as an end in himself.But we can see all around us that the men who are immoral toward others arefirst of all and more profoundly immoral toward themselves. The criminal orfraud or con-man is the irresponsible man who exists without a purpose, wasteshis life and hurts himself more than he harms others. The liar is not “honestwith himself, but dishonest with others”—he does not fake reality for others,while having a clear, honest grasp of it for himself; he is the one who fakesreality for himself, in his own mind, much more dreadfully and disastrously thanhe can ever fake it for others; he is the man who has renounced the rationalidentification of facts, the “being true to truth”—he is the neurotic full ofcomplexes and in dread of ever facing reality.Incidentally, if morality were merely a social matter, a code for the relationof man to man, then a plausible case could be made for taking “society” (or thecollective) as the basis of moral values, for letting “society” choose the termsof the code, for the precept that “the good is whatever is good for society,” orfor the idea that society itself needs no moral code—that the majority may doanything it pleases, since it physically can do it—that whatever the majoritydecrees, that is moral.A good example here as to why a society or a man needs a moral code is thedifference between what a man can do or may do. A man can cut his own throat—buthe may not do it, if his purpose is to live. Society can become collectivist anddestroy itself—but it may not do it, if its purpose is to exist, or prosper, orachieve happiness for any of its members. (Here again—the relation of moralityand purpose is clear.)Incidentally, it is debatable whether a majority can do anything it pleases,even in the crudest physical terms. Those who think it, think simply of a wildmob overrunning an individual or a small, opposing minority—simply in terms ofphysical numbers and physical force. But even this is not true: one man with amachine gun can defeat a mob. This is an example of “force” versus “mind andforce.” Man cannot do anything by sheer physical force—his muscles have to beguided by his mind, his mind has to set the purpose of his actions—and rightthere is the illustration of why a majority is actually helpless as such, if itsphysical numbers are the only criterion of its strength. If it’s asked: but whatabout a numerical majority with a vicious leader or with a vicious idea?—thenthe answer is: on those terms, the question of the mind is involved, and thenthe man with the right idea will win, regardless of numbers; he will win, evenif his following is much smaller than that of the evil leader—and he will alsowin even in the minds of the enemy’s following, to the extent of theirintelligence.NOTE FOR FRANCISCO AND REARDENIt is Francisco who tells Rearden what people’s attitude on sex is: the questfor self-esteem, when sex should be an expression of self-esteem.This is the scene when, after their unfinished conversation at the mills,Rearden comes to Francisco’s suite at the Wayne-Falkland. Rearden asks how a manof Francisco’s intelligence can find any sort of satisfaction in the life of aplayboy, in running after countless cheap women who have nothing but beauty.Francisco tells him that he has never touched any of those women—why the womenkeep up the pretense—and that he has loved only one woman in his life and stillloves her. October 26, 1949“BEING TRUE-TO-TRUTH ”Logic is the art of non-contradictory identification.The essence of consciousness is identification. Our senses give us informationabout physical reality. Our mind grasps it, organizes it, identifies it,establishes conceptions—ideas. Our ideas about reality establish our emotions,desires, purposes, motives. The “spiritual” duty of our mind is to identify ourideas and all their consequences, all the functions and aspects of ourconsciousness as strictly as we identify the facts of physical reality. Here,too, our first and foremost (and probably only) duty is: non-contradictoryidentification. This establishes our moral character as a person—this isprobably the whole essence of morality. (“A broken person is one who dares notadmit to himself the nature of what he is doing.”)Since existence cannot be contradictory, this rule of consciousness is the ruleof morality—the life-serving principle. A contradiction, being impossible, hasto lead to destruction—therefore, a philosophy containing paradoxes(particularly the intentional, conscious acceptance of paradoxes) has to havedestruction as its ultimate result. (This is an important clue for thedistinction between the “life” and “death” philosophies.)225 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_225_r1.jpg]To think over in this connection: the example of the certainty of asleep-walker. Define the exact relation of how to set your abstractions in sucha way that the concrete action follows automatically and correctly. This is bothfor general thinking and particularly for the process of writing. November 5, 1949FOR SPEECH ON MONEYThere are only two possible societies: where men work for reward or where menwork from fear—the incentive of joy or the incentive of suffering. These arebasic, because man has, essentially, only the two sensations: pleasure and pain.Now, which of these two societies do you want?If man is to work, not for his own pleasure, but for the pleasure of others,then others have to take care of him, of providing his pleasure. Then man inrelation to his brothers is simultaneously a sucker and a beggar. Is that whatyou consider good? Is that the rule of a moral society? That—as against asociety where the relationship of men is that of self-respecting,self-supporting, responsible equals.Money is the tool of intelligence and of freedom. It requires judgment, in orderto be produced and to be spent. When a man pays you in money, he leaves to youthe choice of how to spend it. You are the judge of what you want to get inexchange for your effort. What would you prefer—that your employer decide whatyou should have and what he will give you?The men who hate their work “because they have to work for money” are immoral.The fault is theirs—they are the kind who hate work or the kind who want othersto support them in a work for which those others get nothing. December 13, 1949MAIN POINTS OF GALT’S CAUSEMan exists for his own happiness; he is an end in himself and does not exist forthe sake of others.If any man is asked to sacrifice himself for others, it means that he hassomething of value, some virtue, which they lack. Therefore, it means that theworthless is given a claim of priority over the valuable, the unvirtuous overthe virtuous, the miserable over the happy. It means—whatever the standard ofvalues, since it is only a value that can be sacrinced—that the good must besacrificed to the evil.Men of virtue, do you value your virtues as little as that? Are you willing tomake them serve, feed and preserve those who are evil? Are you willing tosupport your own enemies? You are your own destroyers.If the inferiors base their entire claim on the fact that they need thesuperior—then how can they enforce their claim and their exploitation, unlessit’s the superior who permits it, accepts it, and works for his own destruction?It is the superior who makes possible his own torture, enslavement,exploitation, and ruin.If they need you, while you do not need them—it is you who must dictate theterms. (There is no question of sacrifice between equals, or between any two menwho have something to offer to each other; there is only a trade—a just,honorable exchange. Whenever sacrifice is [demanded], it means that one partywants something from the other but has nothing to offer in return.)The great, primary error of the superior men has been the fact that they haveaccepted the morality of their own exploiters.What morality is and why it is the cardinal need of man’s existence: man is abeing of free will, he has to survive by conscious choice and effort, he has tochoose his purpose and the means to achieve it. The choice of the means dependson the purpose, and the choice of the purpose depends on his code of values. Abeing of free will cannot choose, act, or exist without a standard of values.His standard must be himself-man’s nature. His basic, primary, essential purposemust be to live. He can live only in the manner proper to his nature—proper toman. He must understand his nature, define it—and that will give him hisstandard of values.Man’s essence and sole means of survival is his mind—his capacity to think—hisrational [faculty]. Any departure from it or denial of it is a destruction ofhis consciousness. A morality or standard of values not based on his reason isimpossible for him to practice and can lead only to his destruction. He cannotlive against and in contradiction to his consciousness. He cannot be good, ifthe “good” is that which is contrary to his nature, that which is impossible tohim. Nor can he exist if he accepts himself as essentially evil: then his life,too, is evil—and he can have no desire to struggle for the continuation of theevil existence of an evil being. It is thus that he is set against himself.The cardinal crime in morality has been the placing of the standard of valuesoutside and beyond man. This was done by chopping man into two contradictoryparts, set to war against each other: body and soul. Then the standard of valueswas placed in the alleged realm of this alleged soul, as an enemy of the realmof his body. This left man’s existence on earth without any morality; man had nocode of values for this earth; in fact, to exist at all, he had to be immoral.Man’s consciousness is not material—but neither is it an element opposed tomatter. It is the element by which man controls matter—but the two are part ofone entity and one universe—man cannot change matter, he can control it only byunderstanding it and shaping it to his purpose. (The distinction between“entity” and “action”—between noun and verb. The essence of being.)Man’s soul or spirit is his consciousness—here, now, on earth. The rulingelement, the control, the free-will element of his consciousness is his reason.The rest—his emotions, his memory, his desires, his instincts—all are determinedby his thinking, by the kind of conclusions he has made and the kind of premiseshe has accepted.The man of spirit is the man of the mind. He is the man who is not the slave,but the ruler of matter. He is the man who makes it possible for mankind tosurvive. He is the creative man.The morality of the mind—to be true to truth. The great courage, integrity andresponsibility that it requires. The only cardinal sin is the denial orsuspension of one’s reason—the refusal to face reality, identify it and makerational connections. No man can go against his own mind—and that is why hecannot submit to force. The greatest field where this morality is needed andexpressed is the field of material production.All material production is an achievement of the spirit—of the mind. Every humancreation has to start in the mind and be given form in matter—whether it’s awork of art or a commercial gadget. Every spiritual value of man has to beexpressed in material form or action. What is a virtue, if man does not practiceit or act upon it? The great courage and virtue of the producers.The hatred for the producers is the hatred for man, for life and for this earth.Those who despise material producers are motivated by the desire for man’sdestruction. They are the men of death.The desire for the unearned in matter is only a consequence and an expression ofa deeper, more vicious aim: the desire for the unearned in spirit. Those whowant to seize the material wealth produced by others actually want the virtuesof the producers, and they want to obtain them unearned and undeserved: unearnedrespect, unearned love, unearned admiration. They hope to obtain it by reversingman’s standard of values, by regarding all the virtues of life and of this earthas sins, and their opposites—the qualities based on and leading to death—asvirtues.The victims—the producers, the men of this earth—have accepted this monstrouslyevil reversal for too long. It has always been supported by force—the bruteforce of the organized destroyers—but the producers have submitted and obeyed,because they were disarmed morally; they had accepted the destroyers’ moralityand never found their own.The power of the “moral sanction.” It is not enough to be neutral about one’sproductive talent; one must hold it as one’s highest, proudest virtue.The free enterprise system—the system based on the morality of the producers—isnow being destroyed because the producers have never [identified] their propermorality.America versus India: which country [represents] the triumph of spirit overmatter?The present struggle is a conspiracy against the mind, a conspiracy againstability.The men of production must set themselves free of the guilt which has beenattached to them for centuries. Do not accept the destroyers’ morality. Do notsubmit to force. You do not need your exploiters. They need you. Let them try toget along without you. Do not give them that which they cannot force out of you,which they cannot obtain without your consent: your living power—the power ofyour love for life—your mind. Put an end to the use of your virtues for your owntorture—and of your love of life as a tool of destruction and death. We are onstrike against the morality of death. We are fighting for the morality of man,of life and of this earth. December 19, 1949[AR seems to have prepared the following for a conversation with Earl Reynolds,an employee of Kaiser Steel. She notes down some of his answers. ]QUESTIONS REGARDING FURNACE ACCIDENT1. The exact nature, cause, appearance and progression of accident? “Chargehangs up” in a blast furnace (can be from wrong ore).2. The exact action needed to prevent disaster and the danger to the rescuers?3. When alarm rings—who is supposed to answer it? Who should have taken care ofaccident, instead of Rearden?4. Would coke ovens be operated late in the evening—about 8 p.m.? Yes. Do youcall it a “door”? Yes.5. Is it “structural shapes” that Danagger would get for his coal mines? If so,how much? Or is there a more essential thing which he could get direct fromRearden?6. Is 500 tons of Rearden Metal (equivalent to 1,000 tons of steel) about rightfor the “quota”?7. For Mr. Ward’s harvesters: how many would a modest sized plant put out in ayear? How much steel would he need? 2,000-3,000 harvesters at about 1-2 tons perunit.8. Is it “Purchasing Manager” of steel mills? Is line correct: “We’ll make it upon volume”? Tonnage.January 28, 1950NOTES FOR REARDEN’S TRIALThe overall point: the sanction of the victim.The looters try (e.g., through Bertram Scudder) to use the trial to discreditRearden in the eyes of the public, to destroy his popularity, which is due toRearden Metal. The looters are worried over the fact that the public, in gloomysilence, realizes the value and the productivity of the industrialists—asexemplified in the history of Rearden Metal.The looters have tried to counteract it by a barrage of screaming about “greed,selfishness, the profit motive.” It has not worked. The public attitude is aglum, impassive silence. People say obediently: “Yeah, Rearden was after nothingbut his own proiit”—but there is no condemnation in it, no anger or indignation;they say it without conviction—they have begun to doubt that that’s evil—theyhave no conviction about anything, neither in approval nor disapproval—they feelnothing but a gray, hopeless apathy. This worries the looters. They try—by meansof the trial—to whip up hatred for the industrialists, for the rich, to make menlike Rearden the goats and blame the national emergency on them—“they preventthe national plans from working, they break the regulations and thus stand inthe way of the prosperity that the plans would certainly have given usotherwise.”It does not work. Rearden’s attitude blows it up completely. They want Rearden’sadmission that the “planning” and the controls are good, but that he selfishlyignored them. They want him to apologize for his action. He doesn’t. They wantedan industrialist’s endorsement of the public value of controls. They wanted itto be a debate over the “public good.” If he claimed that his action was for the“public good”—they would have had him, because nobody would believe it. Theywould have had the moral sanction. This is what he doesn’t do.226 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_226_r1.jpg]Dagny says: “Hank, that we should have come to do business like criminals!” Heanswers: “The real evil is our accepting it as being criminal. Ask yourself whyplain highwaymen and robbers have never been a grave problem to mankind, butlegal looters have made the whole of human history into a tragedy and aprocession of horrors.”227 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_227_r1.jpg][AR copied the following quote from Will Cuppy, critic and humorist for the NewYork Herald Tribune:] “If the insects do win and set up a government, how willthey manage, without us to raise crops for them? Do they intend to exterminatemankind or will they let a few of us remain in some minor capacity, such asplanting apple trees for the Codling Moth and cotton for the Boll Weevil?”228 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_228_r1.jpg]For Rearden: He is asked to contribute Rearden Metal for a slum playground. Heasks: “What is more important—to give the slum a playground or to give EllisWyatt his pipeline?” February 16, 1950NOTES FOR GOVERNMENT ENCROACHMENTS ON RAILROADSRegulations are imposed in the name of safety “for passengers and employees.”First, the miserable condition of the equipment—which is due to lack of money,rising costs and wages, no permission to raise rates, low profits—causesaccidents. Then, the accidents are used as an excuse for “safety” controls.The purpose of controls is to eliminate the necessity of judgment (!) and toeliminate the competition, for the parasites, of the men capable of judgment.(The “freezing” of judgment. This is for “the moratorium on brains.”)For the tunnel catastrophe: Government Board reinstates employees (with backpay!) who have been discharged for serious infractions of basic safety rules.(See p. 9 of Union Pacific Pamphlet.) Here—the pull of the labor leader whokeeps “his men,” in exchange for control of union’s votes, etc. April 24, 1950[AR made the following notes for the scene in which the parasites discussDirective 10-289.]ELEMENTS FOR PARASITES’ SCENEStress the fact that the parasites lean on need, weakness, incompetence as thebase and justification for all of their schemes. Show the “death principle” inpractical application. [...]Above all—show the hatred of ability and of the mind. The conspiracy againstability. The attempt to eliminate the necessity of judgment. The “freezing” ofjudgment. The attempt to substitute a mechanical security, an automatic routine,for the risk and responsibility of exercising one’s own judgment. The attempt toseize “the motions” of the able, to copy them, and to forbid the able toadvance, forbid them to make any new “motions” which would destroy the“security” of the aping robots.The directive is known as “Directive No. 289.” It requires Mr. Thompson todeclare a state of total emergency—in the name of “total stability.”In the scene: Mr. Thompson, Wesley Mouch, Eugene Lawson, Mr. Weatherby, JamesTaggart, Orren Boyle, Dr. Ferris, and the labor leader (Fred Kinnan).MAIN POINTS OF “MORATORIUM ON BRAINS ”:1. Everybody is attached to their jobs—cannot quit or be fired. (Freedom fromworry.)2. The industrialists are forbidden to quit—if they do, their property will benationalized. (Freedom from risk.)3. No more inventions and new products for the duration of the emergency.(Freedom from speculation.)4. All patents and copyrights are taken over—to be used equally by everybody“for the public good.” Patents and copyrights are to be signed over to thenation “voluntarily” as a patriotic emergency gift. (Freedom from greed.)5. Everybody is to produce the same amount as in the “basic year”—no more and noless. Over- or under-production is to be fined. (Freedom from exploitation.)6. Everybody has to spend as much as they did in the “basic year.” (Freedom fromprivation.)7. All wages, prices, dividends and interest rates are frozen as in the “basicyear.” (Freedom from future.)Their main cry is to “end instability”—to “achieve security.”This will end “wasteful competition”—“we’ll close all research departments, wewon’t have to worry about new inventions upsetting the market, we won’t have towaste money just to keep up with over-ambitious competitors.”Their attitude is, in effect: things are getting worse and worse, to hell withprogress if we can only remain as we are; we can exist now, but we won’t be ableto if things continue going down, so let’s hold still. They are rolling down theslope of an abyss—and want to [stop] themselves by hanging on to a branch on theway.Wesley Mouch acts like a cornered rat—his sole recourse is to get angry, withthe petulant anger of an offended tyrant, as if the country’s troubles are anaffront to him and people better do something, since he’s angry. He’s becomeused to the fact that people seeking favors are afraid of his anger—and he’sbeginning to feel that his anger is the solution to everything, his anger isomnipotent, all he has to do is get angry. But the basic element in his anger isa rat’s fear. He keeps screaming “I’ve got to have wider powers! ... I’ve got tohave power!” like an injured party, as if the guilt for everything is on thosewho haven’t given him the power. Wesley Mouch is the zero at the meeting pointof opposing forces. (He is resentful of Mr. Thompson—he knows that Thompson hasthe power to kick him out, but won’t because Mouch has balanced the forcesskillfully and Thompson is too dumb and too busy to break through the mesh.)The white obelisk monument in the window. When they decide to pass the“emergency directive,” Taggart rises and pulls the blinds down over the whiteobelisk.This is the scene of “nothing is anything—there are no absolutes—there are noprinciples—we must act pragmatically on the emergency of the moment.” Menwithout mind or morals running amuck on power—since what logic, morality orjustice is possible under the unlimited rule of the “public good”?The overall mood of the scene: fear. Fear of the public, of their own victims.“Can we get away with it?” This is where we see the power of the moralsanction—which these bastards know and dread, without acknowledging it in somany words. The public could have thrown them all off like tics—by moral means,by refusing to accept their actions as just. It is the victims who are makingtheir own destruction possible. July 16, 1950NOTE FOR TUNNEL CATASTROPHEThe disaster is made possible by the illusion of the old morality, on whichpeople rely, even though it is not there any longer, they count on it after theyhave destroyed it. The old morality, which created discipline and confidenceamong the employees of a railroad, was the principle of rationality and ofself-interest based on reason and rights: every man knew that the purpose of therailroad and of everyone connected with it was to run trains well, that this wasin their common interest, that every man could expect a good performance fromevery other man, and that objective truth was the criterion and standard ofjustice.If anyone tried to be a vicious exception and to pass the buck, he would beexposed and penalized, because the principle of objective truth was thestandard, and the objective fate of the railroad enforced this standard upon theowners. Therefore, trusting this principle, everyone still trusts his superiorsand carries out their orders; and the passengers do not even imagine that therailroad employees can have any motive other than to move them safely; they takethis motive and safety for granted—with no thought of what it is based on.But now, the purpose of the railroad is not the objective success of anobjective performance—as it is not the purpose of the whole society and of itspresent economic system. Now, one lives, not by the objective result of one’seffort, but by means of and at the expense of other men. Therefore, every man onthe railroad has only one interest: to gain an advantage over others, to protectthe appearance of his performance in the eyes of authority, to be judged right,not to be right, and this at the expense of others. Therefore, every man has tofear and distrust all the others. Their interests now clash: one man’s loss isanother man’s gain. The fate of the passengers means nothing to the railroadmen, since it is not by the fate of the passengers, not by the performance ofthe train, that they are to be judged (and rewarded).This is how, functioning on the dead hulk of a morality which they havedestroyed, counting upon it when they have made it impossible, men come to thespectacle of a great physical machinery (the railroad)—built for safety [on thebasis of] a moral principle (individualism)—becoming the tool of a dreadfuldestruction, instead. This is what the material shell will do, when its soul hasbeen destroyed. This is all the good that the seizure of material wealth,without the mind, will do for the looters. July 18, 1950[AR continues her notes on the Taggart Tunnel catastrophe.]THE PASSENGERS “WHO WEREN’T GUILTY”:The last one must be the most vicious insult to businessmen, applyingunmistakably to Ellis Wyatt.The man who said: “Why should Rearden be the only one permitted to manufactureRearden Metal?”The man who said that man exists for the good of society and has no other rightor justification for existence.The man who said that majority will is law—“society can do anything it pleases.”The man who said that an individual’s conscience doesn’t matter; an individualhas no right to any conscience, it’s just a luxury for prosperous times, not foremergencies—“In an emergency, society hasn’t time to bother about individualconsciences.”The man who said that there is no individual achievement, that individual effortdoes not count nor matter, that everything is done collectively.The man who said that men are vicious morons unfit for freedom, that theirnatural instincts, if left alone, are to lie and murder—therefore, lies andmurder are the only proper means to rule them and keep them in order.The man who said that rewards and persuasion do not work, but punishments andfear do.The man who saw no difference between the power of money and the power of a gun.The man who believed that it is proper and moral to use compulsion “for a goodpurpose,” who believed that he had the right to use force upon others for thesake of his own idea of a “good purpose,” which did not even have to be an idea,only a “feeling,” not even knowledge, only a “good intention.”The man who said that “poverty is so horrible that I don’t care if we use force,compulsion or murder so long as it’s for the poor.”The man who said that the able must be penalized in favor of the parasite.The man who said: “Me? I’ll find a way to get along under any political system.”The man who said that there is no mind, there is no logic and men do not live byreason.The man who said that there are no principles, no rights, no morality, noabsolutes—and the practical way to live is to act on the expediency of themoment.The man who “could not take sides” because he had to think of his children.The man who was against Directive [10-289], but would not “be quoted” publicly.The man who wanted controls to stifle a competitor.The man who wanted the government to guarantee him a job.The man who wrote sniveling little obscenities about the evil of businessmen.The man who belonged to “The Friends of Progress” because it was fashionable.July 19, 1950FOR THE PASSENGERS:Main philosophic points:Collectivism. (School teacher: “Unlimited majority rule.”)Anti-ability. (Professor of sociology: “There is no individual achievement andthere are no great men.” Humanitarian: “The able must be penalized.”)The malevolent universe. (Newspaper publisher: “Men are vicious and must beruled by force.”)Power lust. (Journalist: “It is all right to use force for a good purpose.”)Anti-reason. (Professor of philosophy: “There is no mind or logic” and “Thereare no principles, rights, morality or absolutes.”) Materialism. (Professor ofeconomics: “The mind doesn’t count, it’s only a matter of seizing themachinery.”)Anti-business.Personal types:The rotter who “can get along under any system.”The man who “has to think of his children.”The man who wanted to control a business competitor.The worker who wanted a guaranteed job.July 31, 1950NOTE ON MORALITYFigure out (define the principle and the standard of moral guilt) who is moreevil: Lillian or Ferris? Ferris or Toohey?Lillian has two elements of truth in her: knowledge of Rearden’s greatness andevaluation of it as great. Then she acts against both.Ferris has only one element of truth: knowledge of Rearden’s greatness. He doesnot evaluate this greatness as valuable or important. He acts against only oneelement of truth in him.Toohey knows many more elements of truth than Lillian or Ferris, and actsagainst all of them.Yet I have the impression that Lillian is more vicious than Toohey, and Ferrisis more vicious than Lillian. Why?There are two aspects involved here: one, the element of truth in a person, inthe sense of correct perception; in this sense, Toohey is the best of the three.The second aspect is the acting against one’s own knowledge of the good, thedoing of evil consciously; in this sense, Toohey is morally the guiltiest of thethree.Obviously, the issue here is between faults of knowledge and moral faults. Byknowledge here I mean knowledge of fundamentals that would affect a person’sessential character, such as Lillian’s reaction to Rearden. I do not mean plainfactual information or errors of information or lack of factual knowledge, suchas is acquired in schools; I mean a fundamental perception. Define this and getat the principle and standard of evaluation involved here. It is important.In connection with it: the capacity for enjoyment is a virtue, the result oftruth, of right premises. Toohey, Lillian, Ferris, Taggart, and Mouch are allincapable of any sort of enjoyment. They have no terms in which they couldactually enjoy anything. Toohey’s power lust gives him no enjoyment—neither doesLillian’s sense of power nor her malice—neither does Taggart’s pleasure in anyfailure of Dagny’s or Rearden’s. Orren Boyle is, perhaps, capable of someenjoyment, in the momentary form of some crude orgy. The others cannot even dothat. Why? It is not merely a matter of intelligence; Orren Boyle is dumber thanthe others, but Mouch is even dumber than Boyle—yet Mouch is totally devoid ofany capacity for or sense of enjoyment. Define the exact principle involvedhere.Note: this line of thought started with the idea that a former friend whoadmires me will act more viciously toward me, if he goes bad, than would aperson indifferent toward me in the first place, one who sees no special valuein me. This is an example of the inability of eliminating a truth once a personhas seen it—and with the growth of an evil trait, this truth can take a terribleform, become corrupted into a greater evil, in action, than if the person hadnever seen it in the first place. This is an example to analyze carefully inrelation to the difference between truth (or virtue) as a trait of character (asthe created personality), and the truth or virtue of an action (as a moral orimmoral action, particularly in relation to the essence of immorality: the doingof conscious evil).The reason why people who start out with many virtues and a few flaws growprogressively worse, with the flaws winning, is the fact that an evil cannotremain stationary: it must either be eliminated entirely or it will grow (like“a few” controls in a free economy). The question I ask myself here is: butwhat, then, happens to the virtues, which I consider indestructible (in thesense that a truth, once perceived, cannot be eliminated and replaced by anerror)? Define this.The difference between an error of knowledge and a moral error is that in thefirst case, a man does not suspend his consciousness (his reason), he isexercising it fully and he merely lacks all the necessary information; in thesecond case, he acts against his reason, he does not want to know and,therefore, he is guilty of the basic, cardinal sin (which, perhaps, is the oneessential sin that embraces and contains all the others): the sin of suspendinghis consciousness, which amounts to suspending life or destroying the essence oflife. In the first case, a man remains open to new knowledge, open to thepossibility of correcting his error. In the second case, the man has closed thedoor to knowledge, therefore closed it to correction, and therefore his error(and his evil) will grow worse and worse. August 27, 1950[The following is from an early draft of the scene in which Francisco findsDagny in her country home, after she has quit.][Francisco:] “If you had left TT then [twelve years ago], what would have becomeof it?”[Dagny:] “Some botched form of existence, if any. Someone else would have beenwilling to bear the torture in order to keep it running.”“Why were you willing to bear that torture?”“Because I loved the railroad, I loved my work—and the torture was the price Ihad to pay for it.”“Dagny, suffering is evil. One must never make terms with suffering. One mustnot accept it as normal. Suffering is the call to action, the call to fight itand destroy it—not to bear it.“Why should love be tied to pain, as its permanent price? Why should the virtueof your ability, your competence, your intelligence, your great, living fire, bepaid for by pain? Isn’t there some terrible evil in that, which you haveaccepted? The one evil, the root and source, which we must fight? The immortalization of pain? The damning of life as a chronic state of suffering?“Dagny, by the nature and essence of existence, no paradox can exist. Pain isdestruction—the sign of the evil, the wrong, the improper, the contradictory.Pain cannot be the natural accompaniment of talent, of creative work, of livingactivity. The essence of man’s life—creative action—cannot be the cause whichhas pain as its effect. If this is what you see around you, throughout man’sexistence—then what sort of code are men acting on? Who caused that? Whose ideaare you acting on and what sort of an idea is it? Do you realize that that ispure, naked evil—the idea of death? Virtue cannot and may not be tied to pain.When it is, then it is evil that we are serving....“Have you ever wondered why the peddlers of the cannibal morality lay such astress on imperfection? They are careful to make men think that the mere desirefor perfection is evil, that it is a sin, the sin of pride. Why? Because thisholds the whole secret of their moral code. It is the code of destruction—whichcannot be practiced fully, or mankind would perish. But in that ghastly agony ofthe just-about, the approximation, through which they have dragged mankind forcenturies, lies the only advantage they hope to achieve. If the man of virtuedoes not expect perfection, he will put up with undeserved pain. If the evil mandoes not expect perfection, he will escape the full punishment which hedeserves, he will get the unearned, he will get—in spirit and in matter, inmoral honor and in physical wealth—the rewards of the man of virtue, while thatman of virtue will bear the evil-doer’s punishment. That is the whole heart ofthe ‘morality of imperfection.’“That is what we’ve borne for centuries. Dagny! That’s the evil we have to end,once and for all. No part of our virtue, no work or product of it, must go intothe service of evil. No part of it must be left unrewarded and unpaid for. Nomoment of our suffering must be spent for the sake of providing unearned joy tothe looters. One hour of undeserved pain which we accept is an hour given to thelooters, the hour when we make evil possible—the only hour that makes itpossible—the act of feeding and supporting evil. That is what we have to refusethem. Nothing unrewarded and undeserved, neither in matter nor in spirit,neither in escaped punishment nor in uncollected reward. The code of thetraders, Dagny. The code of justice.”[AR commented later on the problems she faced in writing some of thephilosophical scenes with Francisco: “It was enormously difficult to decide howmuch could be given away and where—and what should be saved for Galt’s speech. ”The above passages were probably cut because Francisco comes too close toidentifying death as the standard of the parasites’ moral code—a point that ARhad to save for Galt.] January 5, 1951NOTES FOR PART IIAs illustration of “Laws are made to be broken”—the state of the country now issuch that one cannot survive (or get rich, which is the same) except as acriminal: by breaking the looters’ laws, by paying for pull, by paying for theright to exist. The “death principle” is now almost blatantly obvious; you haveto pay for the right to live—existence is now a crime.Make use of Danneskjöld’s gold given to Rearden. If possible, have it become theonly money left to Rearden, his only means of escape.Make issue of the copper shortage (in connection with or leading up to thefinal, total crash of d‘Anconia Copper).Make issue of Danneskjöld’s blockade against the production of Rearden Metal bythe looters.To consider (as a possibility): the importance of California (or the West Coast)to the final disintegration and to Project X (the rule of brute force)—this waswhy Mouch wanted Kip Chalmers to control California. This could also be whyparasites have to hold the main line of TT, rather than the Minnesota Line—thussacrificing production to political power. They would rather have moresemi-starving people to loot than to have more production—they cannot permitproduction. March 20, 1951NOTE FOR GALT’S SPEECH“Live and let live is our moral code. The code of our enemies, the code of evil,is the code of death. It will work out to its logical conclusion and it willdestroy them; but we will not save them, will not give life to their evil, willnot make it work. Thus, toward them, our code is: live and let die. Anyone whodesires be an irrationalist—let him perish by his own ideas, but do not help himto destroy the world and yourself. You cannot hold mercy above morality. To maketerms with that which you consider evil, to be an accomplice of evil, to betrayyour own moral standards, in the name of ‘mercy’—and to hold this as moral—isthe lowest corruption ever devised by men.” March 21, 1951KEY ECONOMIC EVENTS FOR PART II:“Unification” of railroads.“Unification” of steel.Crash of d‘Anconia Copper.“Soybean project”—freight cars—collapse of Minnesota.Closing of Minnesota Line.End of Rearden Steel.Collapse of Taggart Bridge (which is end of TT and of New York).229 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_229_r1.jpg]This is the rule of the brute—the economics of gangsters, the mixture ofproduction and guns, the “expediency of the moment,” the plain, crude attempt toseize whatever’s still available, with no pretense of any plan or thought of thefuture.

Hands her the gun. “Have you forgotten thatyou wanted to shoot me on sight?” (The contradiction in her premises, which shewill have to resolve.)She notices the inscriptions on the wall: “You’ll get over it—Ellis Wyatt.” “Itwill be all right by morning—Ken Danagger.” “It’s worth it—Roger Holt.” She askshim about it, he explains and adds: “This is the room you were never intended tosee....

He tells her she willhave to discover whether those men really want reason or life.He flies her out of the valley. “Don’t look for me. You won’t find me until youreally want me—with no contradictions and for what I really am. And when you’llwant me, I’ll be the easiest man to find.” July 6, 1951FOR MULLIGAN’S DINNER1.

Akston: he quit in protest against intellectuals who teach that there is nointellect; he did not want to make that possible for them; let them try to existwithout the intellect.2. Mulligan: he quit because, when he saw money handed to need, he saw thebright faces and eyes of men like young Rearden being tied and bleeding onaltars at the feet of Lee Hunsacker.3. Judge Narragansett: he quit because he could not accept the opposite of thefunction he had chosen: he could not accept the position of ajudge dispensinginjustice—the vilest injustice conceivable to his judicial mind.4. Richard Halley: he quit because he would not be a martyr to those whom hebenefited. He had been willing to accept anything and give them anything; ifthey had said: “Sorry to be so late—thank you for waiting,” he would have askednothing else. But it was the smug cannibals who claimed that it was his duty toaccept the torture inflicted on him by their stupidity, for their sake—thecannibals who make a virtue of spiritual impotence, just as they make a virtueof material impotence—the cannibals who demanded the unearned in spirit, just asthey demand it in money—that made him quit.5. Dr. Hendricks: “Do you know what it takes to perform a brain operation?”—thekind of skill and devotion required—he quit because he could not let that be atthe mercy, command and disposal of men whose sole qualification and right torule him rest on their cowardly, evasive brutality. In all the discussions ofsocialized medicine, men discussed everything, except the wishes, will, andchoice of the doctors. Men considered nothing but the “welfare” of the patients.Well, let them cure themselves and exist without him.6. Ellis Wyatt: he quit because he knew that it was his blood—his carcass—theyneeded in order to survive.7. Ken Danagger: he quit because he did not need them.8. Quentin Daniels: he quit because he could not deal with unreason. Thescientist who deals with unreason is the guiltiest man of all.9. Galt: he abandoned the motor, because he knew that it would do men no goodwithout a mind able to understand it.The history of the valley: first, just Mulligan’s private retreat, then JudgeNarragansett joined him, then Richard Halley. The others stayed outside, [livingby] their rule: do not work in your true profession, do not exercise yourability, do not give men the use of your mind. Their assignment outside: towatch men of ability, to approach them when they’re ready and to pull them out.They all went on working at their professions, but sharing nothing with men,giving nothing. The yearly vacation—one month to rest and to live in a humanworld, in society as it should be.Then, particularly since the destruction of Colorado, they began to joinMulligan and settle in the valley, because they had to hide. They convertedtheir wealth into gold or machines. The valley is not a state, not anorganization of any kind; it is a voluntary association held together by nothingbut every man’s self-interest. Mulligan owns the valley and leases the land tothe others. Judge Narragansett is the arbiter, in case of disagreements; therehaven’t been many. (This code of principles is the Constitution of the UnitedStates, without the contradictions: the code of inalienable individual rights.)The valley is now almost self-supporting, so that most of them can live therefull-time and earn their living (Dr. Akston, Owen Kellogg, the young porter).Mulligan takes care of dealing with the outside world for the purchase of goodsthat they cannot produce in the valley; he has a special agent for that (RagnarDanneskjöld). Soon they will all have to live in the valley exclusively—becausethe world is falling apart so fast that the outside will be starving; but theywill be able to support themselves here. (The frozen trains, etc., are not partof the strike—they’re the natural response of whatever rational element is leftin people, the same kind of protest, the natural, inevitable break-up.)[The strikers] had started with no time limit in view, but now they think thatthey will see, and soon, the day of their triumph and their return. When? Whenthe road is clear, when the looters have collapsed. Let the looters collapsewithout the mind—let them get out of the way—then Galt will call off the strikeand they will return to the world.They speak of their professions which they are still pursuing, each naming hisparticular work.Galt points to the roads of the valley—“the most expensive roads in the world.”The men who could do only physical labor or road-building are now starving forlack of jobs which they cannot originate—while the men who could have providedjobs, factories, automobiles, radios, if they were free and their time werereleased, have, instead, been building roads. “We can survive without them. Theycan’t survive without us.” June 30, 1951NOTES ON EMOTIONSAll emotions are [responses to] judgments of value.The fundamental division is: pleasure and pain. This applies to physicalsensations and to emotions; the emotional equivalent of pleasure and pain is joyand sorrow.CLASSIFICATION OF EMOTIONSI. Emotions toward oneselfPositive: Self-respect, pride, confidence, assuranceNegative: Self-contempt, shame, guilt, self-doubtII. Emotions toward objective reality (toward events)Positive: Joy, hope (?), interest (?)Negative: Sorrow, fear, disappointment, frustration, boredom (?)III. Emotions toward other peoplePositive: Admiration, respect, affection, loveNegative: Contempt, anger, hatred (Fear—? Fear is felt toward an event or anaction of the person, not toward the person)The single emotion toward an objective to be reached-desire.Compassion—don’t know where to classify. (?)Analyze which are primary, which are combined emotions—and define the kind ofvaluations that are involved in the primary emotions. This could be a basicchart for the specific provisions of a code of ethics.Question to analyze: since all valuations pertain to a realm of choice and areacts of choice, perhaps emotions can be felt only toward actions, not towardstatic entities. This may clarify the exact connection between one’s emotionsand one’s actions. Emotions toward people are toward the entity of a person—butthey come from one’s estimate of that person’s actions. We feel the emotiontoward that quality of a person’s character which was responsible for theaction. The same applies to emotions toward oneself. Emotions toward objectivereality are all estimates of events, past, present or future, which [are] meansof actions. The emotion of desire (to reach an objective) is toward action. (Theone exception seems to be esthetic pleasure—which is admiration for an attributeof a static entity: physical beauty.)

[The last sentence was crossed out.]9. Scene where Dagny decides to go back.January 4, 1952SCENES FOR CHAPTER II (TENTATIVE)Scene where Dagny decides to go back (two days before last, June 28): here thedialogue between Dagny and Galt is about love, but never directly. It is theirdeclaration that they love each other—they both understand, but nothing is saidopenly. In her mind, interspersed with the things she says aloud, are the linesof her speech of dedication: “You whom I have always loved and never found ...”He tells her that the ideal is here, it’s real, it’s possible, but...(Write the two themes in counterpoint, so that his words underscore and answerthe words in her mind—so that the whole is clear and is a declaration of love,but only as a whole, not in what either of them says aloud.) Scene where Francisco discovers Galt-Dagny romance (toward end of month). “Andyou said that I was the one who took the hardest beating! ... I should haveknown it. I should have known it twelve years ago, before you ever saw her. Ihave stated it myself. You were everything that he was seeking, everything hetold us to live for or die, if necessary.”[Added later:] Galt had said to Francisco, in sending him to Dagny: “If you wantyour chance, take it. You’ve earned it.” Francisco says: “Take it. You’ve earnedit—and it wasn’t chance.”Here, too, the counterpoint dialogue. Nothing is said openly—everything is saidthrough their mutual understanding. Francisco’s attitude: I understand, Iapprove, it’s as it ought and had to be. Galt’s attitude: I’d give anything notto hurt you—anything but this, because this, as you know, is beyond sacrifice.Dagny’s attitude: It’s true, but I’ll only hurt him as I’ve hurt you, and myprice for it is that I’m hurting myself right now as much as both of you havesuffered—but it is a price that I have to pay. Yet, through this,simultaneously, she feels “the sense of enormous rightness” and a sense ofjoy—for all three of them, for being alive. (It’s Galt who expresses this last,who gives voice for all three of them to the sense of joy, to their sense ofexistence.) Scene of the “non-sacrifice. ” Elements for it: Francisco tells Dagny about Galtsending him to her in the country. Galt refuses to let Dagny move to Francisco’shouse. Dagny is set free of the fear of sacrifice—she sees what ugliness thiswould have been if they had acted on the moral standards of the outside world.233 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_233_r1.jpg][Note on the writer who was a fishwife in the valley:] Galt tells Dagny that thegirl is in love with him—and mentions the contemptible paradox of the outsideworld’s attitude toward unrequited love: men hold love to be a supreme virtue,yet a woman who loves a man without answer is supposed to be ridiculous, she issupposed to hide her feeling as some sort of disgrace or shame, in order toprotect her “pride,” or else she makes a claim and a burden upon the man out ofher unrequited feeling and pursues him, half as a begger, half as a sheriff. Buthere, love is [held to be] what it actually is by its nature: a recognition ofvalues and the greatest tribute one human being can give another, gratefully tobe accepted, whether one returns it or not. Scene of Rearden’s plane. This comes after some scene where Dagny is violentlyhappy about her relationship with Gait—after some clear indication of his lovefor her and of her happiness with him. The plane serves as the climax or lastincident of the contest among the three men in her mind. It is Galt who wins—thescene must end on some indication of this. Scene of Dr. Akston, his three pupils, and Dagny. (For philosophicaltheme—“emotions as the philosophical summary of a man.”) [This last sentence wascrossed out.] For personal theme—Akston’s reminiscences about Galt, Francisco,and Danneskjöld in college. This will show us what sort of men they were and howthey faced their future. Francisco—the richest heir in the world;Danneskjöld—the European aristocrat, without money, but with the sternesttradition of honor and nobility; Galt—a wholly self-made man, out of nowhere,penniless, family-less, tie-less, son of a factory worker in Ohio, left his homeat the age of twelve and has been on his own ever since. (Akston refers to himas “Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, who was born ready and whole out ofJupiter’s brain.”) Akston mentions their choice of physics and philosophy astheir major subjects—and their reasons: the union of mind and body.(This might be the place to state their attitude on religion—the atheism of allfour of them. “Do you believe in God, Miss Taggart?” “God, no!” “That’s aboutall that one needs to say on the subject. We are here concerned with reason. Itis a big enough job—enough for the life of any man.”)Show Akston’s love for his three pupils, his paternal devotion to them—past andpresent. For present, such touches as: “Don’t sit on the ground, Francisco. It’sgetting chilly. You’ve always been careless about taking chances.” Akston callsDagny “Miss Taggart”—then, after a specific reference to the three men as hissons (and after some hint of the Dagny-Galt relationship), he suddenly addressesher as “Dagny” and she sees him looking at Galt. This is Akston’s acceptance ofDagny as his daughter—as Galt’s wife. Scene of temptation. The night when Galt and Dagny almost surrender to anunendurable desire for each other. She sees the look and the torture of desirein his face. (“Do you wish to hold me here?” “More than anything else in theworld.” “You could hold me.” “I know it.” Then: “It’s your acceptance of thisplace that I wish. What good would it do me to have your physical presencewithout any meaning? That is the sort of fraud on reality which people cheatthemselves by. I’m incapable of it.”) He is first to leave—to go to his bedroom.She lies in bed, tortured, unable to sleep. She wonders whether Galt is torturedin the same manner. She hears no sound, sees no light in his room. Then shehears the sound of a step and the click of a cigarette lighter. (Then—she hearsthe steps outside and hears Francisco speaking to Galt. She learns that Galt hadbeen sitting on the sill of his open window, smoking a cigarette. Francisco ison his way home from Richard Halley’s house. They speak for a few moments, thenFrancisco walks on. She realizes that Francisco has no suspicion of anyattraction between her and Galt—and now Francisco can be certain that they donot sleep with each other.) [This last parenthetical passage was crossed out.]Scene of Galt telling her about his first sight of her. This must come in somecontext such as the one at the power house, so that when she asks: “When did yousee me for the first time?”—the question actually is: how long have you been inlove with me? He tells her that he saw her ten years ago, one night, on theunderground platform of the Taggart Terminal. She was wearing an evening dress,a light, flowing, ice-blue gown, like the tunic of a Greek goddess, with theshort hair and imperious profile of an American girl. She had a fur cape, halfsliding off her body, he saw her naked back, shoulders and profile, it lookedfor an instant as if the cape would slide further and she would stand naked. Shelooked preposterously out of place on a railroad platform—it was not of arailroad that he was thinking, and yet it was, she did belong here, she was thereal spirit and meaning of it, luxury and competence combined, energy and itsreward. She did not seem to be aware of her clothes, she was giving orders tothree men, her voice clear, swift, confident, she was intent on nothing but herwork. He came close enough to hear two sentences: “Who said so?” asked one ofthe men. “I did,” she answered evenly. That was all. That was enough. He knewthat this was Dagny Taggart—and he knew, then, that he was in love with her. Shewonders which one among the streams of passengers that she ignored had beenGalt—she wonders how close she had then come and had missed. “Why didn’t youspeak to me, then or later?” she asks. He says: “Do you remember what you weredoing in the terminal that night?” She remembers vaguely that she had beencalled from a party she was attending, because the new terminal manager hadcaused some mess—the old one had quit a week earlier. He says: “It was I whomade him quit.”Before that night, Galt had heard about Dagny from Francisco, but very little:Francisco had told him that she was one of them, that she was the sole hope andfuture of Taggart Transcontinental, but that TT would be hard to destroy,because she would be their most dangerous enemy, she would be very hard to winfor their strike, she had too much endurance and devotion to her work. Franciscohad spoken briefly, dryly, non-commitally, as if merely reporting on a futurestriker. Galt knew that they had been childhood friends, that was all. AfterGalt had seen her, he began to question Francisco about her whenever he could.He noticed that Francisco was eager to talk about her, in spite of himself. Herealized what Francisco’s past with her had been, that she had been Francisco’smistress, that Francisco had given her up for the strike and was stilldesperately in love with her. But Galt never let him guess the nature and reasonof his own interest in her. It sounded merely as if he were questioningFrancisco about an important future striker. The scene ends on Dagny wonderingwhether Galt intends to sacrifice his own love for the sake of Francisco. Smaller, preliminary scenes: (1) Scene where Dagny asks Galt from where he hadbeen watching her and what job he holds in the world; he refuses to answer bothquestions. (2) Dagny and Francisco in his house. (The two silver goblets—he’snever used them; they’re all he wants to save, everything else will go, in a fewmonths.) His design of a copper smelter, his talk about his first d‘AnconiaCopper mine, here, in the valley; instead of the doubled production he haddreamed about, he might produce only a single pound of copper at the end of hislife, but he will be richer than with all the tons produced by his ancestors,because that pound will be wholly his, with no part of it feeding the looters.(The start of d’Anconia Copper—and of the world—has to be in the U.S.) In thisscene, there is a touch of possibility of her love for Francisco. (3) Scenes ofDagny and the valley: Galt’s lectures; Dagny-Richard Halley; Dagny-Kay Ludlow;Dagny-young mother. (4) Dagny and the plan for the railroad (then—“what for?”)(5) Scene where they discuss Dagny’s departure: Dagny, Galt, Francisco,Mulligan, Akston. Here they beg Galt to remain in the valley, he has no furtherreason to stay outside; but he says that he has not yet decided, he might stayoutside—for “the one thing he wants for himself” (though not in anycollaboration or compromise with the looters—nor with the “scabs,” this is notfor Dagny, but for him).234 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_234_r1.jpg]Think over: whether to indicate the economic future of the world when thestrikers return—and Judge Narragansett’s proposed amendment to the Constitution. January 5, 1952DECISIONS TO MAKE FOR KEY SCENES[The answers to these questions seem to have been added later.]1. Scene of Galt telling Dagny about the past: Where does scene take place? Inhis house. What form of temptation leads to her questions ? He finds her asleep,waiting for him.2. Rearden’s plane: In what context? What precedes and follows her sight of theplane?3. Temptation scene: What leads to it? (Combine with 1.)4. “Non-sacrifice”: In what context? In context of: “If you want your chance,take it.” Where does scene take place?5. Francisco’s discovery: Where does scene take place? In his house. What giveshim his final clue? Galt’s decision to go back to job.TENTATIVE ORDER OF SCENES (CHAPTER II):1. Scene of Galt telling Dagny how he saw her for the first time. (Preceded byher question about how he watched her and what is his job in the outside world.)(He finds her asleep. The story is followed by the temptation scene.)2. Dagny-Francisco, in his house.3. Dagny-the valley (Galt’s lectures, Richard Halley, Kay Ludlow, young mother).4. Dagny—plan of railroad. (“I won’t ask you—you’ll tell me when you’vedecided.”)5. Dr. Akston and his three pupils.6. Rearden’s plane.7. Scene of “no-sacrifice.”8. Discussion of Dagny’s departure. (Talk of danger to Galt, of break-down andTaggart bridge, makes her decide to go back.)9. Francisco discovers Galt-Dagny romance. (They walk home together and stop atFrancisco’s house. Question of Galt going back to his job. The two silvergoblets. “Take it. You’ve earned it.”)10. The flight by plane, and their parting.January 6, 1952NOTE ON PARADOXESThe essential paradox, which is the root of all philosophical errors, is asfollows: to substitute for an abstraction one of the concrete applications ofthat abstraction, and at the same time make that concrete contradict andinvalidate the abstraction. Example: when a man decides that thought is notvalid, that he will not think, but will instead obey the orders of a dictator,it is an act and decision of thought; he substitutes specific “politicalthought” for the general abstraction of “thought,” declares thought to beinvalid and holds this as a justification for the thinking which led him todecide to stop thinking about politics and to obey political orders. June 7, 1952FOR TAGGART AND CHERRYLTaggart’s desire for the unearned spiritually—he does not want Cherryl to rise,he wants his “love” for her to be alms and he wants her admiration for him to besincere, but unearned; her torture under an impossible paradox. Her horror whenshe realizes that his love was in answer to flaws, rather than in answer tovalues (the exact opposite of the Rearden-Dagny romance). Taggart’s hold on herthrough her pity; he stops her doubts by means of his whining and hergenerosity—until she sees the truth. She thinks that suffering is still a signof the good in him, of his struggling for something—until she realizes what thenature of his suffering is: his frustrated desire for destruction. (Her strugglewith “culture”—her boredom with the Eubank kind of art, her bewilderment at therevivals of classics, Taggart’s anger at her questions about it. Here—parallelto the last-stage economic looting.) June 9, 1952TAGGART AND CHERRYLTaggart wishes to celebrate the deal which has given a loan to the People’sState of Chile in exchange for the promise that the d‘Anconia Copper mines willbe nationalized on September 2, then turned over on “operation lease” to an“international group” consisting of Orren Boyle, an equivalent of Cuffy Meigs,and others of that sort. No word has been said publicly about Dagny’s broadcast,but Bertram Scudder has been made the goat: his program is abolished. He has tokeep silent if he doesn’t want to be framed and jailed or [punished as] theauthorities please.Taggart’s sudden realization that nothing gives him pleasure. Taggart andCherryl, their “formal” dinner. Her poise and silence, his attempts to get hersanction.Flashback to highlights of their marriage and of her growing realization.Her bewilderment about their wedding party—and her determination to understand,and to be worthy of him.Her attempts at self-improvement, and his vicious attitude toward it.She begins to suspect his position on the railroad (faith versus truth); shedecides to investigate. The evasiveness of the railroad officials; the commonworkers tell her the truth; Eddie Willers tells her the whole truth.Taggart’s fury about her “ingratitude,” then his play for pity and“understanding”—her tortured fairness and patience. (Her disappointment in“culture”—his incomprehensible anger about it.)Now, at dinner, his attempt at “celebration” fails—he talks about “causeless”love—she will not grant him sanction. (“What I feel is fear.” “Of me?” “No, notexactly. Not of what you can do, but of what you are.”)Cherryl goes to see Dagny. Cherryl’s apology and despair; Dagny cannot fullyreassure her.Lillian comes to see Taggart about stopping the divorce. He can’t help her, butthey both share the enjoyment over Francisco’s coming ruin and over Rearden’scrushing burdens. This is the celebration Taggart wanted. Their affair.Cherryl comes home to find that Taggart is in the bedroom with some woman.Cherryl does not walk in, she hides in her own study and waits, then comes outand confronts Taggart when he is alone. His vicious admissions, his boast thatthe woman was Lillian Rearden, his laughter when Cherryl offers to give him adivorce—her horror at the full realization of the meaning of his love, the love“in answer to flaws.” She almost names the death principle—he slaps her.She runs out of the house, wanders through the streets, the city—as her symbolof greatness, but now she is in total terror that she has no way of knowing thegood from the evil. (The traffic lights.) Her suicide—she leaps into the river. August 26, 1952NOTE FOR GALT’S SPEECH[In regard to] the “death principle” and James Taggart: Taggart wanted Cherrylto be vicious—and moral—at the same time. This means that he wants good peopleto “weaken” occasionally and thus give him both the benefit of their virtue andthe license for his evil. It is their “weaknesses,” their evil, that would makeit possible for him to exploit their virtues. (Example: Rearden’s sex guilt andthe gift certificate.) It is the “middle-of-the-road” morality—the theory that“there’s something bad in the best of us”—that is the most immoral theorypossible, because it is the only theory that makes it possible for evil toexist. Pure evil is impotent, it is destruction and nonexistence; it is only byfeeding on and penalizing virtue that evil can act and have power in the world. October I, 1952[PART III, CHAPTER V:] “THEIR BROTHERS’ KEEPERS ”1. The complete chaos, the blind, random chance, the arbitrary senselessness,the total lack of logic and reason in production—and the steady, inexhaustiblelogic in the progression of destruction. (Men are still achieving theirideas—hold the premises of destruction and you’ll get it.)2. The futile and horrible rushing to save the needy at the expense of theable—the last of the country’s wealth is going to support the incompetent in theemergency of the moment. The incompetent perish and the wealth goes down thedrain with them, while the competent, who could have survived, are immolated theminute before, i.e., their chance of survival is destroyed to let theincompetent last that one minute longer—the range of the moment, which keepsgetting shorter and shorter. The revolting obscenity of acting on the cult ofneed, of taking need as claim and motive. The “brothers’ keepers” see themselvesbeing eaten alive, with the “brothers” making their work impossible and makingmore demands at the same time—the final, naked insolence of the cannibalisticparasite who yells that “you’re morally evil because I starve, look at mymisery, it is your moral failure and sin—do something!—how do I know what?—it’syour problem and responsibility, you’ve got the mind, I haven‘t, you’re mykeeper, I have the right of misery, incompetence and helplessness!” (Giveexamples of this along the whole range—both public and private, both forindustries and for personal, family relations.)3. The grotesque preposterousness of the “world planners”—such as the “soybeanproject,” the power-hungry incompetents, each with a plan of his own to rule theeconomy of the nation, each getting a little bit of his plan into action, at adevastating cost. Here we have soybeans, TV sets, etc. manufactured for thepleasure of the masters and the planners—while the country is starving. Herematerial goods follow the pattern of the men who are still left—the senselessand non-essential goods are manufactured, the essential ones vanish. The motiveshere are an almost inextricable mixture of corruption and humanitarianism—someprojects are undertaken for pure Cuffy Meigs-like looting, others for a EugeneLawson-like vicious hysteria of giving away and saving the needy of theimmediate split-second. (Show that the motive makes no difference.)"},{"pageContent":"14NOTES WHILE WRITING GALT’S SPEECHIn a 1961 interview, AR recalled her thoughts as she approached writing JohnGalt’s speech: “I knew it was going to be the hardest chapter in the book.... /underestimated. / thought, with a feeling of dread, that it would take at leastthree months. Well, it took two years.” AR began her outline on July 29, 1953;she finished the speech on October 13, 1955,Her difficulty was not primarily with philosophical content By 1953, she wasclear on nearly all of the ideas. The only fundamental that she discoveredduring the writing was the relationship of the concept “value” to the concept“life.” The other problems of content were in formulating the ideas with thetotal precision she demanded.It was the literary requirements of the speech—it had to be a dramatic,emotion-charged statement serving as the strikers’ ultimatum to the world—thatgave AR the most difficulty, particularly in regard to the order ofpresentation. She explained in a 1961 interview:I started by making an outline of the issues to be covered. First as a generallisting of material, then in approximate order of presentation. But I couldn’tstick to that outline; it had to be redone many times. I originally began thetheoretical presentation with metaphysics, starting with existence exists, goingfrom metaphysics to epistemology, then planning to go to morality. After writingquite a few pages, I had to stop because I knew it was absolutely wrong. That isthe logical order in non-fiction, but you can’t do it in fiction. The speech hadto start by presenting the morality, which is the real theme of the book, andwhere Galt would have to begin his explanation to the world. So I had to rewritethe whole thing.The brief notes presented here ore apparently all that she kept from her twoyears of work on Galt’s speech; regrettably, the early draft and revisedoutlines that she refers to ore not among her notes. July 29, 1953MAIN SUBJECTS OF GALT’S SPEECHMetaphysics: Existence exists—A is A.Epistemology: Reason—thinking is volitional, not automatic.Morality: The need of morality for a being of free will. The Morality of Life:Life as the standard of value—thinking as the only basic virtue, from which allothers proceed—non-thinking as the only basic vice—the recognition of reality orthe non-recognition. Force. Mysticism. The morality of death: all the forms ofthe attempt to fake reality; destruction as the only result. Basic premises.Emotions and reason.Economics: The unearned. The gift of inventors.Politics: Rights.OUTLINE OF GALT’S SPEECH (PHILOSOPHICAL CONTENT)METAPHYSICSExistence exists. A is A.EPISTEMOLOGYMind and body. The nature of reason—the evidence of the senses, integrated byhis mind according to the rules of logic. Logic is the art of non-contradictoryidentification. The nature of abstractions. Thinking is volitional—it is not anautomatic process. The root of “free will”—you have no choice about what realityis, but you have the choice of knowing what it is or not. The mind is man’s toolof survival. Life is given to you, survival is not. To survive, you must think;you must discover the means and methods of survival proper to man; you have noarbitrary freedom about it—you cannot survive “at random,” you must learn whatis necessary for your survival as man.235 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_235_r1.gif]MORALITYThe need of morality for a being of free will—a being who must survive by meansof choice—a rational being who must think and must choose to think. The processof reason is: Yes or No? Right or Wrong? This is the process of thinking and ofevery action a man takes as a result of his thinking. Truth (perception ofreality) is the standard of value for his thinking. He needs a standard of valueto guide the actions he’ll take as a result of his knowledge, to estimate thechoices he’ll make: his existence as man is his standard of value—as man,because he can exist in no other way, yet he has to maintain his status as manand his existence by his own will and choice.THE MORALITY OF LIFEThinking as the only basic virtue, from which all others proceed; non-thinkingas the only basic vice. The recognition of reality or the non-recognition;existence or non-existence; life or non-life; entity or zero. The responsibilityof saying “It is.” Joy and pain as the barometer of life or death. The functionof pain in one’s body—the pain in one’s spirit. Emotions proceed from reason.Emotions as the summary of a man’s philosophy. Emotions are based on yourestimates, and your estimates on your basic premises, on your moral code.Joy is the purpose of the Life Morality. When man’s life is the standard andreason the judge, no contradictions are possible, no “destructive” joy, no“hangovers”—and no desire “to have your cake and eat it, too,” no desire for theirrational. Life is the value, pursuit of happiness is the goal; man exists forhis own sake and for his own happiness. The same code applies to all men: thereis no clash of interests if no man expects another to live for him, if no manexpects the unearned. There is no sacrifice in human relationships—only thepattern of traders. Men trade value for value, in matter and in spirit.The virtues of the Life Morality: thinking—therefore rationality, the refusal togo against your own consciousness and judgment, the refusal to fake reality;independence—the refusal to submit to the authority of others, to placeanother’s judgment above your own; honesty—which is only another name forrationality, the loyalty to reality, the “being true to truth”; purposefulness(productiveness)—the choice of your life purpose and the achievement of it;happiness—which is possible only as the result of virtue, as the fullintegration of your reason and action; self-esteem—which means pride,self-value—which means the conscious practice of your moral code, the living upto your values, the creation of your own character. (Errors of knowledge versusmoral errors; in the realm of morality, nothing counts but perfection.) (Man’sneed of an ideal.)The vices of the Life Morality: non-thinking-which means the evasion ofknowledge, the placing of anything whatever above your own mind, any form ofmysticism, of faith, or denial of reality; dependence—the placing of othersabove yourself in any manner whatever, either as authority or as love;aimlessness—the non-integrated life; pain—the submission to it or acceptance ofit; humility—the acceptance of one’s moral imperfection, the willingness to beimperfect, which means: the indifference to moral values and to yourself, i.e.,self-abnegation; the initiation of force—as the destruction of the mind, as themethod contrary to man’s form of survival, as the anti-man and anti-life.THE MORALITY OF DEATHSuch moralities place the standard of value outside of man and of reality, e.g.,God, the hereafter, the needs of the soul as opposed to the body. By definition,they are impossible to man; the “good” is the opposite of life. The result issuch evils as the opposition of soul and body, of theory and practice, of themoral and the practical. All of it is a rebellion against reality. You cannotfake reality. The desire for a non-stable reality is the desire fornon-existence (A is A).The morality of sacrifice: the sacrificing of virtue to vice, of the good to theevil, of value to non-value, of a positive to a negative, of achievement toneed, of ability to inability—the lack, the flaw, the absence, the zero as theconsistent standard and the ultimate goal. Life is a sin, under this morality,because everything required by life is a sin. Joy is a sin, pain is a virtue.The death principle throughout it all. The creed of the unearned.The worship of emotions—but emotions are only your “stale thinking.” The demandfor unearned love—they do not expect causeless fear, but they do demandcauseless love.The “strong” and the “weak”—so you expect men to survive while being irrational?The conspiracy against life, ability and the mind. The paradox of the defendersof freedom resting their case on mysticism, while the destroyers of the mindclaim to represent reason—the paradox of all absolutes being mystical ornon-existent; the absolute of reason is denied by all. Which is the triumph ofspirit over matter: India or New York?POLITICSMan’s rights—inherent in the need of his survival as man. No initiation offorce. No sacrifice of man to man. No compulsion. No subordination of one man’smind to that of another. Voluntary transactions. The trader principle. Theproper function of government—retaliation by force against those who initiateforce, and nothing else.ECONOMICSMan’s right to his own property, to the product of his labor, rests on the lawof cause and effect. You cannot have the result, if you destroy the source. Youcannot have the product of a man’s mind, except on his terms. How freeenterprise worked—the benefit given to others by inventors and innovators, theinestimable benefit of an idea. The relationship of the “weak” and the “strong”:the strong (intellectually strong, which is the only strength possible in afree, non-force economy) raise the value of the weak’s time by delegating tothem the tasks already known and thus being free to pursue new discoveries.Proper mutual trade to mutual advantage. The interests of the mind are one, nomatter what the degree of intelligence, provided nobody seeks the unearned.236 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_236_r1.jpg]The address to the men of the mind: do not accept the morality of your owndestroyers. It is you who have made them possible. Set your own terms and code.Put an end to the use of your virtues for your own torture. Learn to understandthe nature of your enemies: they do seek death and universal destruction. Yoursis the code of Life. Fight for it. There is no other. July 30, 1953[The following seems to be a revision of the above outline, beginning withmorality.]OUTLINE OF GALT’S SPEECHYou have achieved your moral ideal. It is your morality that has destroyed theworld.What is morality? Man—reason—need of a code—man’s only choice: to think or notto think—the essence of thinking: A is A—the standard of value: man’s survivalas man, life as the value. It is on a desert island that you would need moralitymost.What is your morality? The morality of death—the anti-man, anti-mind,anti-existence. Mysticism and force—mind and body. Whatever your code, reason isyour common enemy. The conspiracy against the mind. We have withdrawn. (I havemerely done by design what has been done throughout history by default.) Nowlook at your morality and your world.The Morality of Death. The standard of value outside of man; original sin; lifeas guilt, the mind as guilt, every virtue needed to support life as guilt, themoral versus the practical, joy as guilt. Sacrifice: the total immorality of itsmeaning—the zero as the consistent standard of value.The consequences of the contradiction (personal): the botched, half-livingcreatures scared to think—all the consequences of the morality of death—theworship of emotions—“wishes” versus reality. Man’s need of self-esteem: hischronic fear, his knowledge that he is his own destroyer—all his virtues arecalled vices, all his vices are called virtues—the dread that evil is practical(since life is evil).The creed of the unearned: the real purpose of all mystics: the unearned inspirit; the rebellion against a stable reality, against the absolute of reality;the anti-cause-and-effect; the desire to reverse cause and effect. But theescape from reality, in any form whatever, is the desire for non-existence.The consequences of the contradiction (social): the defenders of freedom are nowmystics, and the destroyers of the mind claim to represent reason; the idea thatmorality and absolutes must be mystical; the attitude toward “desires” and man’spsychology which savages had toward physical nature. The constant oppositions:mind and body, the moral and the practical, theory and practice, reason andemotions, security and freedom, yourself and others, selfishness and charity,private interests and public interests, the “having and eating your cake”principle. A “social” or mystical morality is self-defeating by definition, ithas to make man immoral—but try to consider all those concepts with reason asthe standard and you’ll see that there are no contradictions where no element ofmysticism, of the irrational, has been introduced.The constant demands for the impossible: the desire to have men survive whilebeing irrational. “Public welfare”: who is the public?—failure as [conferring]the right to the title of “public.”The destruction of America: the country of reason; what has been done to it?America’s self-sacrifice to the vilest savages—which is the triumph of spiritover matter: India or New York?—why America could not survive on the morality ofaltruism.The Morality of Life: Life as the standard—thinking as the only basic virtue—joyas the purpose—man existing for his own sake and for the pursuit of his ownhappiness—no duty, no temptation—evil as non-practical-the pattern oftraders—justice, not mercy—no sacrifice, no initiation of force, no obedience toforce.Politics: Man’s rights. The proper function of government regarding force.Economics: Property (the profit-motive, the dollar-sign). How free enterpriseworked: the spiritual benefit given by the inventors. The separation of Stateand economics.(I have merely done by design what has been done throughout history by default.What I have done, too, is merely an act of identification. The extent to whichyou have lived and found joy is the extent to which you have acted on mymorality.)The address to the men of the mind: To the best within you. Do not accept themorality of your own destroyers. Set your own terms.Yours is the code of life. Fight for it. There is no other. When Life is oncemore the value—then, we’ll return. The strikers’ oath.September 28, 1953When we say that nobody actually believes in God, it is true, if by “belief” wemean the equivalent of a rational conviction. But the trick, the psychological“gimmick,” of mystics is the fact that they do not “believe” in reality, either.What we mean by a rational conviction has no equivalent in their consciousness.No, they do not “believe” in God in the same way as they “believe” in food,money or their material existence—but their material existence has no fullreality for them, either—and that is some special state of consciousness, thatis the root of the faking, the pretense, the going through an act, the unrealitywhich I sense about most people and which I hate more than anything else, thatis the form of their Death Premise, as if they do not merely wish to destroyexistence, but have never even permitted existence to exist.January 9, 1954THE MORALITY OF DEATHMetaphysics: the worship of the zero; the rebellion against a stable reality,against absolutes, which is the wish for non-existence. Epistemology: the “sixthsense,” the definitions by means of the negative, the modern mystics andrelativists, the “stolen concepts,” the worship of emotions, the mixture ofexistence and consciousness, the anti-cause-and-effect, the creed of theunearned.Morality: mind and body; the placing of the standard of value outside of man;original sin; life, mind and joy as guilt; the opposition of the moral and thepractical; sacrifice: the total immorality of its meaning, the zero as thestandard of value. (It is evil to produce, it is good to mooch.)The purpose of that morality: the sacrifice of the good to the evil, theconspiracy against ability and the mind—what the strikers are on strike against.(You need us? It is the generosity of the good that makes the evil possible.)THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE MORALITY OF DEATHPERSONAL:Man’s need of self-esteem: life or death. Their sense of guilt and fear: theknowledge of their non-thinking. Fear—because they have abandoned their tool ofsurvival. Guilt—because they know that they have done it volitionally. They aretheir own destroyers. (Their search for “themselves”—the self is the mind.)They have given up reason—then complain that the universe is a mystery.The conflict of the practical and the moral.The fear that evil is practical—since life is evil.(“It’s only logic.” The fortune-teller and the fortune-maker.)SOCIAL:The defenders of freedom are mystics, while its enemies claim to representreason.The contradictions between: soul and body, mind and heart, the moral and thepractical, yourself and others, security and freedom, public interest andprivate interest, human rights and property rights.The principle of expropriation throughout society—every man is rewarded inproportion to his flaws, and penalized in proportion to his virtues.The evil of the “middle-of-the-roaders ”: they place their best in the serviceof their worst, and destroy their best in the same way as they destroy the bestmen in society. (The cost of their compromises: the death of their children asresult of their government subsidy.)What the men of the mind had given them—the pyramid of ability.What they must do: stand on the judgment of your mind—you don’t know much?—don’tdiscard that which you know. Reason is an absolute.Errors of knowledge versus moral errors. Perfection. (“Benefit of the doubt.”)Traders—help to others on the basis of values, not flaws, not need.The single axiom: the evil of force. Good men will not work under compulsion.The obscenity of using force “for their own good.”“Some of you will never know who is John Galt.”The moments when they do know who is John Galt.The damnation of Stadler. (The man who places his mind in the service of evil,while he is able to know better, but does not care.) Undated[The following note critiques the Kantian idea that “things in themselves” areunknowable. AR cut this topic from Galt’s speech. Later, she covered it in thetitle essay of For the New Intellectual.]NOTES FOR [GALT‘S] SPEECHMETAPHYSICS: “THINGS IN THEMSELVES ”Walk into any college classroom and you will hear your professors teaching yourchildren that knowledge is impossible to man and that his consciousness has novalidity whatever. A savage does not know the nature of his means of perception;your teachers go him one better: they know and they disqualify man’sconsciousness on the ground that its means are specific and knowable.You can know nothing, they tell you, because you perceive only that which yoursenses can perceive; your sight is made possible by light rays, your hearing ismade possible by sound waves—therefore, your knowledge is not valid, since yourconsciousness works through these means and no others, since it is itself andcan be nothing else, since it cannot step outside itself to verify itsknowledge. Your knowledge is not valid, they tell you, because your perceptionsare not causeless. You cannot know, they tell you, whether the things youperceive are real, because you have no consciousness other than your own and donot know what some other sort of consciousness might see. No matter how much youlearn, they tell you, you will always be limited by the fact that you can learnonly that which you can learn; you will never be able to know that unlimitedzero—the things defined as “not that which you can know” seen by a consciousnessdefined as “not yours.”You listen to them and you blank out the fact that this argument denies thevalidity of any form of consciousness whatever: if you were the omniscient Godof their invention, you would still know only that which your means of knowledgeperceived, whatever such means would be, unless—and this is the core of theirmystic inventions—God were not “limited” by being an entity and his means ofperception were causeless. God’s knowledge would be valid, they tell you,because it would be unaccountable, God would know everything, because he wouldknow it by means of nothing, while you can know nothing, because you know it bymeans of something. You are blind, they tell you, because you have eyes, anddeaf, because you have ears; true sight and true hearing would have neither.You are blind, they tell you, because you can never know “things in themselves”or “things as they are,” which means: “things as they are not perceived by you,”things as they are apart from your consciousness and apart from anyconsciousness. By this concept, reality is that which no one perceives, themoment it is perceived it ceases to be real—existence is outside the bounds ofany consciousness, to know it you must know it without consciousness, the momentyou’re conscious, it ceases to exist, the moment you’re conscious, you areunconscious. Knowledge is impossible to you, they tell you, because the momentyou are A, you’re no longer able to be non-A, the moment you are an entity, youare no longer able to be a zero—and the zero is the only thing that’s certain,omniscient, omnipotent and real.Do you wonder what is left of a young mind after an intellectual training ofthis sort? Do you wonder why your childen leave college as neurotic nonentities,ready for any witch doctor to knock over?Since, in fact, no consciousness can hold on to a zero, there is a specificpurpose in all of this mystical claptrap: the nearest thing to “causelessknowledge” is an irrational wish—and your teachers’ revolt against causalperception is the desire to place above reality and reason those nameless wishesof theirs which they know to be contrary to both.The closest approach, in practice, to the theory of “things in themselves” is asfollows: if you steal your neighbor’s wallet, your action in itself and as it isis a crime; but since you wanted his wallet and held your wish as superior toreason, you blank out the nature of your action and continue to regard yourselfas honest, by telling yourself and others that there’s no such thing asobjective reality and you would not be able to know it if there were.

AR put them in a foldermarked: “Discards from Atlas Shrugged (which I like). ”]You have heard it said that this is a time of moral crisis. You have mouthed thewords yourself. You have wailed against evil and at each of its triumphs youhave cried for more victims as your token of virtue. Listen, you, the symbol ofwhose morality is a sacrificial oven, you who feel bored by what you profess tobe good, and tempted by what you profess to be evil, you who claim that virtueis its own reward and spend your life running from such rewarding, you whoresent and despise those you hold to be saints, and envy those you hold to besinners, you who proclaim that one must die for virtue, but dread having to livefor it—listen—I am the first man who has ever loved virtue with the whole of mymind and being, the man who never sought another love, knowing that no otherlove is possible, and thus the man who rose to put an end to your obscenity ofsacrificing good to evil.237 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_237_r1.jpg]Only the man who is morally fit to live on a desert island is morally fit tolive in society—the man who knows that man’s life depends on production andproduction depends on man’s mind, that he must live by his own effort and thinkthrough his own brain, that if he chooses to live by means of force or fraud, bymooching, extorting or plundering the products of the minds of others, he ischoosing to abandon his human status—to exist as something other than a man, yetto let his life depend on those who choose the existence of rational beings; heis trying to switch to them the death which would have been his on that island,he is living by the mind of his victims, by the virtue of those whom hedestroys—he is choosing death as his standard of value, and he will reach itthrough an agony as sure as, but more ugly than, starvation on a desert island.Yet your code of morality was designed to foster this breed of the subhuman, todestroy the men who think and to turn the earth into that desert island. Youhave succeeded.238 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_238_r1.jpg]If you preach that man must hold the pursuit of his own happiness as evil andmust seek self-sacrifice as his moral goal, you are asking that he twist himselfinto a monstrosity that takes pleasure in his own pain and finds pain in his ownpleasure, that enjoys his suffering and despises his joy, that strives for hisown frustration, that holds desires only to renounce them, fights battles onlyto lose, seeks wounds as victories and sores as medals, [like] a machine set inreverse, with its gauges switched from life to death, with death as its goal andits standard of value—a monstrosity that fights against itself and crashes in afinal, bloody heap, leaving a trail of destruction behind it.That as a moral ideal? That as a code of love for man?239 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_239_r1.jpg]The mystics, who preach self-sacrifice, who preach that the highest virtue mancan practice is to hold his own life as of no value, who claim that they despisethe body and worship the spirit—do not grant to man’s spirit the importance theygrant to his body. They know that if a human body were to reject the function ofmaintaining its existence, it would cease to live and would turn into a mass ofcorruption, carrying the poison of death to those who did not avoid its contact.Yet they do not expect a life-rejecting human spirit to become an agent ofinfection—and they let it loose upon the world as the death-carrier which it hasbeen through all the ages. Do you preach that the purpose of morality is to curbman’s instinct of self-preservation? It is for the purpose of self-preservationthat man needs a code of morality.240 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_240_r1.jpg]Do you think they are taking you back to the dark ages? They are taking you backto darker ages than any your history has known. Their goal is the era of thepre-human. Consider what feat of intelligence was performed by the namelessgenius who was first to identify the fact that man possesses a mind. Considerwhat tremendous mental power was spent on the invention of language, what spanof centuries had to be traveled from the first inarticulate sounds that namedimmediate objects to the words that conveyed abstractions. The greatestachievement in communication was not the wireless telegraphy nor transatlanticradio, but the feat of the genius who grasped and taught to others the conceptof identifying reality in words of objective meaning. These are the achievementswhich your teachers now seek to negate and to destroy, by refusing to identifythem and pretending that neither mind nor words have ever been discovered. Theirgoal is to take you back, not to the age of pre-science, but the age ofpre-language.241 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_241_r1.jpg]A man of self-confidence knows the nature of knowledge; he knows that existenceexists, that reality cannot be faked, that a mind cannot be forced. He knowsthat nothing can be accomplished by ruling a herd one has reduced to the levelof morons and liars. He is unable to fool himself about the loathsome spectacleof men who have to act under compulsion; he is unable to regard the role of aruler as anything but personal infamy. It takes a mystic to reach so low a stageof self-deception as to derive any value or pleasure from the extorted motionsfaked by others—extorted by and faked under the threat of a gun.242 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_242_r1.jpg]You accept the morality of selflessness—but observe that you are unable to liveexcept by taking yourself as the standard of value—a depraved, irrational,contradictory self, blindly seeking its own pleasure, struggling by corruptedmeans to comply with the law of existence. You profess to damn matter, but youlie and cheat to get rich; you profess to value chastity, but seek pleasure fromwhores; you profess to hold an altruist as your moral ideal, yet make no move toreach his rank, though it is in your power—but the man of ambition, of selfishachievement, is the man you envy, and you scramble to obtain his rank withoutearning it, though you profess to consider him immoral.243 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_243_r1.jpg]You believe that your heart is superior to reason, that man must live by hisfeelings, not his mind—as if hatred, fear and envy were not feelings, as if aman of unbridled emotions would become a paragon of virtue—as if the dope fiendwho robs a store, the woman who murders in a fit of jealous rage, the sadist whoindulges his craving for torture were exponents of coldly impersonal logic,while the surgeon who performs a brain operation were a man directed by hisfeelings.You believe that security is superior to freedom—as if a livelihood earned byyour effort voluntarily traded for the effort of others, with your body andproperty protected from seizure, were a state of precarious uncertainty—but thestate of being bound, gagged and fed by the mercy of an arbitrary ruler, whopossesses the power to cut off your food, to rob, to torture, to murder you atwhim, were a state of peaceful security.244 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_244_r1.jpg]A mystical morality makes it impossible for you to pass moral judgment. Youcannot judge by an incomprehensible standard, be it God or society or anythingoutside reason. When you are told: “Do not try to understand what is good,believe it,” you become unable to estimate any value, action, person or event,or to make any firm choice.If you cannot judge, you will not think. The aim of every action, mental orphysical, is to achieve a value, to further your life. Why think, if you cannotreach any conclusion, if you cannot appraise the value of any choice? Everythought implies a value judgment. If you cannot value, you cannot think. You mayknow that giving poison to a man will kill him, but why consider it, if youcannot know whether it is right or wrong to kill him?If you cannot think, you will act on the spur of the emotions of the moment. Thecreed of expediency is the worship of emotions. Emotions, in fact, are thesummary of your philosophical premises—and destruction will follow from thecontradictions in your premises if you act blindly on your emotions. Allemotions are appraisals, inexorably based on the rule of “What’s in it for me?”but you have no way of judging what should be in it for you, what is yourself-interest—and your destruction follows from such blind choices.Your morality disarms you and protects itself from your mind by making a virtueof imperfection: humility is a virtue, pride is a sin. It gives you a blankcheck on evil and forces you to give a blank check to others. If you cannot beproud of yourself, you cannot condemn any depravity. The man who is unable topraise himself is unable to blame anything on anyone.245 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_245_r1.jpg]You create your character or destroy it by the same means which create ordestroy all your values: by the act of thinking or non-thinking. Your self isyour mind, and its constant choice is the act of self-affirmation orself-denial, of perceiving or refusing to perceive, the act of being ornon-being by which your mind, like a pilot-light within you, goes on or off.This act is your primary choice, it is your will, the only will you have, youronly choice, from which all other choices proceed.246 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_246_r1.jpg]Just as you possess a pair of legs, but must learn to use them, and the abilityto walk becomes automatic, but the decision to walk does not, and you will notwalk without a decision to cross the room, the street or the world—so youpossess a brain, but must learn to use it, and the ability to think becomesautomatic, but the decision to think does not.247 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_247_r1.jpg]It is not values that you have to renounce, but only your fakes and pretenses:the prestige which you don’t possess, the respect which no one grants you, thelove which you do not feel, the faith which you don’t believe. Get out of yoursnarl of deceit which has deceived no one but yourself. Get out of the dankprison of your emotions into the hard, clean sunlight of the mind. And if, inexchange for your scrap heap of borrowed slogans and undigested commandments,you are able to reach by the work of your mind no more than the first-handconviction that water is wet and fire is hot, you will still be incomparablyricher than you were and you will know the meaning of self-esteem.248 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_248_r1.jpg]Only a man of integrity can possess the virtue of honesty, since only the fakingof one’s consciousness can permit the faking of existence.249 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_249_r1.jpg]You believe you got away with your evasions? Look again and check the additionthat sums up your soul and your life. You had cheated in business, but you seeno connection between that and the fact that your wife has deserted you? You hadpaid off a bureaucrat to destroy your competitor, but you see no connectionbetween that and the fact that your market has vanished and your business hascrashed? You extorted high wages by means of directives, but you see noconnection between that and the fact that you’re now condemned to joblessstarvation? You had preached ideas you hated, in exchange for the favor of menyou despised, but you see no connection between that and the fact that you’venow become an alcoholic? You had prospered on government subsidies, but you seeno connection between that and the fact that your son has been killed in a warto bring prosperity to the natives of some jungle People’s State? You had setevery part of you to betray every other, you believed that your career bears norelation to your sex life, that your politics bear no relation to the choice ofyour friends, that your values bear no relation to your pleasures, and yourheart bears no relation to your brain—you had chopped yourself into pieces whichyou struggled never to connect—but you see no reason why your life is in ruinsand why you’ve lost the desire to live?250 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_250_r1.jpg]Like the criminal who plays it short range, who believes that he gets away withthe unearned and does not see why his loot disappears into the pockets of anyblackmailer and any criminal more ruthless than himself—so you believed that youcould exist as half-producer, half-thief, and did not see what parasites youpaid in exchange for your little snatch of the unearned. Every time you cheatedthe honest, it is the dishonest you had to pay off. Every time you resorted toforce—passing a law—to destroy your superiors, it is to your inferiors that youhanded the weapon by which they destroyed you in your turn. Whether you were abusinessman or a worker, your blank-out consisted of believing that you werefighting and looting each other—and what you did not dare to identify was thatyou were looting the better men of your own profession, that any kind ofcollectivist action is intended to milk the better members of the collective—andas you destroyed your abler competitor or your abler fellow-worker, tenincompetents were ready to pounce upon you and to drain you dry in turn. Soyou’re reaping a profit you did not deserve and wonder why bureaucrats aredevouring your profit. So you’ve gained security where the boss cannot fire youand no other newcomer can compete for your job—and you wonder why your wages arebuying less and less, and why you live in terror of your union leaders, whosewhim can condemn you to starve.251 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_251_r1.jpg]You believed that compromise was practical, that you could not succeed on merit,that some shortcuts were needed to help you to rise, that your sins wereassisting your virtues. But there is no compromise between good and evil,between reason and force, between production and looting. Your vices havedevoured your virtues, your intelligence was spent on protecting your evasions,your ability on paying for your frauds, your energy on enriching the parasiteswho bled you—while you were gaining a penny of graft in exchange for a dollar ofyour own honest profit.When you established the right of the unearned and accepted need, the zero, as aclaim, you did not see—you blindest of fools, the businessman or laborer of thecompromise economy—that any man on any level who continued working, was losingin proportion to his effort and his work, and that those who gained, weregaining in proportion to their having accomplished nothing. You had connived todestroy your superior and had hoped to step into his shoes, but you did not stepinto his fortune, you stepped into his place under the social squeezer which youhad set in motion—and when you are squeezed dry in your turn, you will find thatthe ultimate winner is the looter who made no compromise with working, but stuckto the absolute of robbery and murder, the “practical” hero of the short-cut,who will perish on the carcass of the last compromiser.252 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_252_r1.jpg]MIND AND BODYMan is an entity of mind and body, an indivisible union of two elements: ofconsciousness and matter. Matter is that which one perceives, consciousness isthat which perceives it; your fundamental act of perception is an indivisiblewhole consisting of both; to deny, to [separate] or to equate them is tocontradict the nature of your perception, to contradict the axiom of existence,to contradict your basic definitions and to invalidate whatever concepts youmight attempt to hold thereafter.Your consciousness is that which you know—and are alone to know-by directperception. It is that indivisible unit where knowledge and being are one, it isyour “I,” it is the self which distinguishes you from all else in the universe.No consciousness can perceive another consciousness, only the results of itsactions in material form, since only matter is an object of perception, andconsciousness is the subject, perceivable by its nature only to itself. Toperceive the consciousness, the “I,” of another would mean to become that other“I”—a contradiction in terms; to speak of souls perceiving one another is adenial of your “I,” of perception, of consciousness, of matter. The “I” is theirreducible unit of life.Just as life is the integrating element which organizes matter into a livingcell, the element which distinguishes an organism from the unstructured mass ofinorganic matter—so consciousness, an attribute of life, directs the actions ofthe organism to use, to shape, to realign matter for the purpose of maintainingits existence.That which you call your soul or spirit is your consciousness, the life-keeperof your body. Your body is a machine, your consciousness—your mind—is itsdriver; and that which you call your emotions is the union of the two, theproduct of the integrating mechanism by which your mind controls your body.253 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_253_r1.jpg]Man has wrested existence from the mystic demons, but not consciousness—materialreality, but not his mind. Men still look at consciousness as savages looked atmaterial nature. Men have progressed in material production, but have notprogressed in spirit—because the first was the province of reason, but thesecond is still the province of faith and emotions. There has been no moralprogress, because the tool of all progress-the mind—was banished from morality."},{"pageContent":"PART 5FINAL YEARS"},{"pageContent":"15NOTES: 1955—1977This chapter presents a miscellany of notes written from 1955 to 1977. AR’snotes for two books, also made during this period, are saved for the lastchapter.The following material begins with notes on psychology written in the same yearthat AR completed Galt’s speech. These notes are unrelated to the speech; ARkept them in a separate folder. They contain the build-up to and her firstdiscussion of “psycho-epistemology,” a concept she originated; she later definedit as “the study of man’s cognitive processes from the aspect of the interactionbetween the conscious and the automatic functions of the subconscious” (see TheRomantic Manifesto). She begins by referring to a man’s conscious premises andsubconscious processes as the “super-structure” and the “sub-basement” of themind, without giving explicit definitions of these terms. Later, she writes:“Super-structure is the realm of philosophy, of premises, ideas, convictions,etc.—that is, the content of a person’s mind; sub-basement is the realm ofpsychology—the method by which a mind acquires and handles its content.”Almost a third of AR’s notes on psychology are presented here—those in which ARis writing as a philosopher about the foundations of psychology. The rest of thematerial, which I have omitted, pertains to topics outside the realm ofphilosophy, such as particular neuroses. Her motive in writing the latter noteswas to understand the people she knew, many of whom baffled her. However, shewas not interested in psychology as a subject, and never made a systematic studyof it. So the omitted notes are of less interest.The rest of the material in this chapter is from the post-Atlas Shrugged period,when AR was writing prolifically on philosophy. Considering the complexity ofthe issues she dealt with in this period, it may be surprising that she made sofew notes. But she found non-fiction writing much easier than fiction.Typically, she wrote from brief outlines, which are omitted here because theymerely list the main ideas in the published articles.May 13, 1955[In her 1955 notes on psychology, AR used the term “rationalist” to refer to “anexponent of reason. ” Since this term is associated with therationalist-empiricist dichotomy in philosophy, which she rejected, I haveeliminated it in favor of “rational man. ”]PSYCHOLOGICAL “EPISTEMOLOGY”The three metaphysical fundamentals with which a human consciousness has to dealare: existence, consciousness—and the consciousness of other people.The crucial decision that a man makes is: in which category does he place theconsciousness of others—in external existence or in his own consciousness? Thefirst is the proper process of a rational man. The second means that theconsciousness of others becomes a factor in the mind’s process of judgment; itbecomes, not an external fact, but an x factor by means of which facts are to bejudged; not that which the mind perceives, but that by means of which it doesthe perceiving. This is the root of the “epistemological” corruption of a humanconsciousness.Example: A rational man thinks: “Two plus two equals four.” A second-handerthinks: “Two plus two plus x equals four—maybe, the x permitting.” The x standsfor the unknown and unknowable decision of the consciousness of others.Question to investigate: These three fundamentals are probably the threepremises which determine a man’s psychological “epistemology.” Is there aspecial method of thinking that a man will employ according to the premises hehas formed about these three fundamentals? And, as sub-category: in relation tohis own consciousness, is there a crucial premise formed by a man about histhinking and his emotions? Is this premise another determining factor in thethinking method that a man will employ? [...]Next assignment: Define more fully and specifically what we know so far aboutmethods of thinking.What is the exact role of the conscious mind (of the “spark”) as driver and asspectator of the material provided by the subconscious?What is the exact nature of the subconscious as the repository of storedknowledge—and as the automatic creator of emotions?What is the exact role of emotions in a process of thinking? (Are theyselectors, integrators, blockers—or all of these, according to one’s premises?)What is the exact nature of the process of integration?What is the nature of the state which a man takes as certainty? How does he knowthat he knows? (Or is certainty possible only to a rational man? If so, whattakes its place in a corrupted consciousness?)Is the question of “certainty” related to the question of “values”? My lead hereis the fact that when I attempt to calculate a chess game my mind gives up on avery violent feeling of “What’s the use?” [...] (Later question: Does [a man]become immoral (non-valuing) because he has formed the premise of a fluidreality—or does he form the premise of a fluid reality because he has rejectedhis value-setting power? I suspect that it is the first. I also suspect thatone’s concepts of reality and of values are inseparable corollaries. This, Ithink, is the point at which the independent mind and the sovereign value-setterare united.)In relation to emotions: The two fundamentals are pleasure and pain. Inpsychological motives they become: love or fear (love for values, ambition forpleasure, i.e., happiness—or—fear of pain, escape from pain). (This leads to:activity or passivity, achievement of the positive or escape from the negative.)An important moral lead is the question: Is a man motivated by fear in any partof his psychology? He is immoral to the extent of his fear motivations—immoralin the primary sense of morality: fear leads to the refusal to think, toperceive reality. (Fear as an “epistemological” factor.) May 25, 1955The first two metaphysical fundamentals which a human consciousness has to graspand deal with are: existence and consciousness. Within each of these two, thereare two fundamentals which a man grasps with his earliest concepts: existence isdivided into facts (reality) and people (other people’s views ofreality)—consciousness is divided into mind and emotions (thinking and feeling).If a man is unable to integrate these four concepts (reality, people, thinking,feeling) in a proper, rational manner, if he finds himself torn by conflictsamong these four—then what he sacrifices and what he chooses to preservedetermines his basic character, his metaphysics and his epistemology. [...]The proper pattern of a rational man in regard to the four fundamentals is asfollows: Mind above emotions (but not in the sense of emotional suppression,only in the sense of knowing that the mind is the source of emotions)—andreality [above people] (a single, indivisible reality to be perceived and judgedby one’s own mind). The specific distinction of a rational man is the fact thatthe consciousness of others as an epistemological factor does not exist for him,that he holds no such concept, that a conflict such as his view of realityversus the view of others has never occurred to him epistemologically and hasnever been an issue within his own processes of thought. A rational man regardsothers and their views as [external] facts of existence, to be judged by hismind—and not as an inner fact, to be part of his judgment. A man of unbreachedconsciousness is one who has never allowed the opinions of others to become anepistemological issue, that is, to shake his confidence in the validity of hisown perceptions and of his own rational judgment. May 27, 1955Assignment: The next and most urgent step in this inquiry should be a full,exact and objective definition of:1. What these four fundamentals are, what realm they cover, in what form theyexist within a consciousness, by what objective signs one can detect them.2. The exact influence of the sub-basement on the super-structure.3. The manner in which sub-basement premises are formed (since they are notformed as a conscious, philosophical conviction).May 28, 1955THE FOUR FUNDAMENTALS AND THE ISSUE OF VALUESThe crucial error of the man who chooses “emotions above mind” in thesub-basement consists of acquiring an “epistemology” that makes emotions part ofhis thinking process in the specific role of a judge of values and, later,almost the judge of truth and facts (or the meaning of facts) and, therefore,the judge of certainty in any given thought process. While to a rational man theanswer to a problem is a factual identification or explanation of reality—to asub-basement emotionalist the answer to a problem is the achievement of a happyor positive emotion.The formula for this crucial difference is as follows:An emotionalist’s identification of values is: “The good is that which will makeme happy. ”A rational man’s identification of values is: “I will be made happy by thatwhich is good. ”Thereafter, the rational man will be incapable of emotional response withoutknowing the nature of that to which he is responding. In complex situations, hemight need time to identify all the elements of his particular emotionalresponse (since an emotional sum is calculated by the subconscious much fasterthan a conscious process of thought could do it), but the identification willalways be available to him, open to his conscious mind, and his emotions willalways correspond to his conscious standard of values. He might be mistaken inany given situation about his conscious identification of the facts involved—buthe will never be off his standard of values, there will never be a contradictionbetween his emotional response and his conscious, rational, stated standard ofvalues. He will never be in love with a person whom he consciously despises, norbe resentful of a person whom he consciously admires.The emotionalist will be open to all the above kind of conflicts. Only thestrength of his rational super-structure will guarantee whether he responds tothe right values or not, according to his conscious standard or not. He willexperience an emotion ahead of his full rational knowledge of that to which heis responding. He will do so by means of a “package deal”: since emotions aresums, he will respond to his first, vague, generalized perception of an objector to some particular “highlight” of an object. He will respond to the total ofan object, person or event—without breaking it up into its parts or attributes.In his “emotional epistemology,” he will be in a position similar to that of achild who perceives entities, but has not yet learned to identify them by meansof their attributes.When his emotional response clashes with his later, rational identification of agiven object, the emotionalist is left in an insoluble conflict: (1) He does notknow how to untangle the emotional from the rational in his own mentalprocesses; (2) He feels a tremendous reluctance against analyzing his emotionsor their object, against breaking up the “package deal”; such an analysis iscontrary to his basic metaphysics and his basic concept of himself; he feels asif he were doing violence to himself and his universe; (3) Even if he succeeds,by a painful, forced process of “old-fashioned will power,” in analyzing theobject of his emotions, the conclusion made by his mind lacks full conviction tohim, lacks the fire and certainty of conviction—because the emotion, not thefacts, is his final judge of the value of reality, which does mean: his finaljudge of reality.The emotionalist is the man who says that “the cold hand of reason destroysemotions.” To a rational man, such a statement is incomprehensible.Sub-basement premises remain in an adult consciousness in the form of“psychological epistemology ”—in the method of thinking (“front seat” or “backseat,” directed or contemplative), in the place which emotions occupy in aprocess of thought (reason as the active director, emotions as the passiveresult—or—emotions as the active judge, reason as the passive result) and in thenature of the emotional response (specifically particularized—or—vague andgeneralized).Sub-basement premises are the methods of functioning of a consciousness —theyare specifically the field of psychology (as distinguished from philosophy)—theyare the workings of a soul’s mechanism, not the content of its ideas.Sub-basement premises are not premises in the sense in which we use the conceptphilosophically. A rational adult with an emotionalist premise in hissub-basement does not hold somewhere deep in his subconscious the convictionthat “emotions are superior to reason.” What he holds is an epistemologicalmethod which, if translated into a philosophical premise, would amount to“emotions are superior to reason.” He did not choose it in terms of a consciousconviction; he chose it in terms of an-inner method of reacting which, by thetime he is old enough to identify it, has become automatic, appears to be anirreducible primary and is extremely difficult for his own consciousness toidentify.The same is true of the other crucial sub-basement fundamental: reality versuspeople. There may be other fundamentals pertaining to the sub-basement, whichwill need to be identified. At present, I am tracing only the influence of thetwo metaphysical fundamentals with which I started these notes: existence andconsciousness. It remains to be seen (to be examined separately) whether thesetwo cover the whole sub-basement or not. What I am certain of at present is:1. I have found the key to the pattern of how metaphysical fundamentals aretranslated into psychological fundamentals.2. What we called “sub-basement premises” are methods of functioning or what wecalled “psychological epistemology.”3. What we called “super-structure” is the realm of philosophy, of premises,ideas, convictions, etc.—that is, the content of a person’s mind; “sub-basement”is the realm of psychology—the method by which a mind acquires and handles itscontent. But since the method was determined by implied (if not conscious)philosophical ideas formed by a person’s mind—it is philosophical ideas that cancorrect the method, provided the psychologist is able to identify them for thepatient.4. The role of psychology is “the science of epistemological retraining.” Apatient needs, not just a correct philosophy, but a new method of thinking andfeeling. A psychologist must first communicate the essentials of a correctphilosophy, then start the patient on a course of “epistemologicalretraining”—as soon as the psychologist has grasped the specific nature of thepatient’s errors (from the patient’s conscious and subconscious premises). Thiseliminates the need of constant analyzing of particular, concrete troubles,confusions and relapses. (This answers my own particular bewilderment at thefact that our best and most intelligent converts were not always able to derivefrom our philosophical abstractions the concrete applications which, to me,seemed self-evident.)(Note to Nathan [Nathaniel Branden, psychologist and associate of AR’s until1968]: I know that the above is very vague and generalized, but my stomach (andbrain) is screaming that this is the right track. The “epistemological” methodsthat we have discovered so far (such as “back-seat driving,” etc.) are not thewhole story—but I am sure that the role of psychology is to discover, identifyand then be able to cure all the essential “epistemological” errors possible toa human consciousness. We will know that we have discovered them all when we areable to explain every basic aberration of a human consciousness. In the past, wehave been identifying and detecting specific, individual bad premises in apatient’s mind, some of them fundamental, others fairly superficial, with nogeneral plan of procedure, no systematic view of a cure. What I am glimpsing nowis at least the first key to establishing the mileposts of a systematic road toanalysis and cure; the mileposts themselves are still to be identified; this isonly the first of them.) 1955[In the following note, AR is discussing those who refuse to judge right andwrong because of their fear of opposing others.]Isn’t this the “Rose Wohl issue”? [An unknown reference.] She said she did notwant to think that others were so wrong. I thought she meant that she would findit horrifying to live among evil creatures and, therefore, prefers not to knowthat they are evil; I took her motive to be: (a) a kind of good will, whichmakes her resist the necessity of hating and loathing others, a mistaken form ofdesire for a benevolent universe, which she thinks she can achieve by evasion;(b) a practical sort of cowardice, which makes her resist the idea that shemight be living among monsters and in constant danger, and makes her prefer notto know it, on some grounds such as “what you don’t know won’t hurt you”—againon the principle of plain (“wholesome”?!) evasion, such as the evasion of a manwho refuses to see a doctor in order not to find out whether he has a deadlydisease.What I see now is that she meant she does not dare think that others are wrong,she does not dare oppose them even in her own mind; they would punish her forholding such an opinion; it is dangerous not only to act against them, but evento think against them. (!!!) This amounts to a voluntary brain-washing as abasic policy of life. (Good God!)This issue is the reason why of any depravity, the one I’ve always loathed mostis the slogan “If you can’t beat them, join them.” But again, I thought of it insemi-rational terms, i.e., I thought it meant the advice to fake the terms ofothers in action and beat them at their own game. But here I think I had a“stomach-sense” of the truth, because this slogan made me much more indignantand horrified than any rational interpretation warranted; I sensed somethingmuch more evil in it. Now I see that it means the surrender of one’sconsciousness, in the sense of: “If you can’t beat them, don’t think”—it ismeant to apply, not to action, but to thought, not to the realm of existence,but to the realm of consciousness, not in the sense of accepting values you donot really believe for the sake of some “practical” advantage, but in a senseunspeakably worse: in the sense of discarding your capacity to agree andreplacing it by uncritical obedience—thus making obedience take metaphysical andepistemological primacy over acceptance or rejection, truth or falsehood, whichmeans: over one’s judgment. UndatedMEMORY-STORING EPISTEMOLOGYThe “emotional” epistemology of the “perceptual” level [mentality] works asfollows: instead of storing conceptual conclusions and evaluations in hissubconscious, a man stores concrete memories plus an emotional estimate.Example: instead of conceptual conclusions in the form of political principles,he stores specific memories of concrete events of his own experience, with thememory that these things or events were “bad” (“painful”). Thereafter, when hehas to consider any new political event, his epistemology works as follows:first, a strong negative emotion—then, the emotion, acting as selector, revivesor brings out of his subconscious a lightning-like montage of memories of otherpolitical events, all of them painful—then his conclusion is that the new eventis and/or will be painful, hopeless, and generally negative.Any specific judgment that he utters, in such cases, is completely accidental orirrelevant: it is dictated, not by a rational conclusion, but by random orchance association and is, in fact, intended by him only as an approximation(though not consciously). Any conceptual conclusions, principles, or sentenceshe may have accumulated through the years on that particular subject are storedas loose concretes along with his memories of events, almost as accidental,undifferentiated rubble or barnacles clinging to the events. In effect, theideas are also stored as concrete facts, as memories of something he has heard,read, or thought, not as ideas or concepts. Therefore, he does not exercise anyselectivity or discrimination when he utters a comment.His comment is approximate, because it is intended to stand for the totalmontage, the “gestalt,” that his emotion brings out of his subconscious. Theonly thing he really intends to communicate, his actual judgment, is: “This ispainful.” Translated into words, his judgment would be: “This is painful,because of all the similar events I remember as painful.” Thus his memoriesserve as the proof or the validation of his judgment, performing, in hisconsciousness, the function performed by logical, conceptual evidence in arational consciousness. This is the process by which emotion takes precedenceover logic; in fact, it does not take precedence—it substitutes for logic.(Logic is a conceptual tool—it cannot operate by means of percepts, it cannotdeal with unanalyzed, undifferentiated, “irreducible” concretes.)This method, of course, is as near to a perceptual level of epistemology as aconceptual, human consciousness can come. It consists of treating memories aspercepts, as “package-deal” irreducible primaries, and of forming valuejudgments by a primitive, animal-like standard of “pleasurable” or “painful,”these two standing for “good” or “bad,” without any further analysis orunderstanding, without any knowledge of why something is good or bad, whysomething was pleasurable or painful. This is exactly what an animal’s“pleasure-pain mechanism” would do. In the case of an animal, this mechanismworks as an immediate response to immediate concretes and is assisted by memory.An animal’s memory is purely associational, and thus an animal can be trained bya repetition of pleasurable or painful experiences, of rewards or punishments(the repetition makes the animal memorize or associate).In the case of a man, this method becomes the issue of “stale thinking.” When aman claims that he cannot separate his emotion from his perception of the eventto which he is responding, that he feels as if the two come simultaneously(which means that he evaluates something before he has grasped what it is, yethe is epistemologically unable to take time to perceive the event fully), hisconsciousness, in fact, is reacting to past events, to memories called out ofhis subconscious by his first glimpse of some accidental resemblance orassociation between the present perception and the events of his past. (It is inthis sense that he does not actually perceive the present event and cannotidentify it or think about it; and it is somewhat inaccurate to call hismemories “stale thinking”—they are not his old conclusions or consciousvalue-estimates, they are merely unanalyzed “gestalts” of concrete events andautomatic emotional reactions.)A man whose epistemology functions in this manner, by accidental associations of“pleasure” or “pain,” has no way of knowing whether his judgment (his emotionalresponse) is or is not relevant to the present event or the facts confrontinghim or the immediate reality with which he is dealing, but which he has notactually perceived. He has no way of knowing whether his judgment (hissubstitute for judgment) is right or wrong, true or false, nor why.The terrible consequence of this method for a human consciousness is the factthat it does make a full perception of reality impossible, that it does make aman epistemologically unable to take time to perceive. Since man needs a systemof symbols to deal with the enormous complexity of his experiences, since he hasto condense and simplify every new event by means of its essentials, since hecannot treat every new event as if it were an undifferentiated, unprecedentedfirst in a baby’s blank consciousness, but must integrate (or at least relate)it to the context of his past knowledge, this method substitutes an emotion forthe perception and selection of an essential.Thus, a rational man, considering a specific political event, will call on hisconceptual knowledge to identify the event by means of its essence. He willobserve, for instance, that a given law establishes government controls and hewill estimate it as evil, by means of his previously reached conviction thatgovernment controls are evil. He will not need to examine every concrete detailof the law or ponder over all its future consequences; his conceptual grasp ofthe essential element involved will contain and cover all those concretes.But a man with an “emotional-perceptual” epistemology is helpless and lostbefore the complexity of the same law. His only method of condensing the meaningof that law is his emotion, backed by the context of his memories, which areloosely stored by resemblance, similarity, or chance association. He has no wayof determining what is essential in that law, and thus his emotion becomes theessential—and, without examining or analyzing that law (which he cannot begin todo and would not know how), he concludes that the law is “bad” or “good”according to whatever aspect of it has the strongest emotional meaning for him,the strongest emotional associations or connotations. This is the reason whysuch men jump to conclusions rashly, on the mere hint of some isolated aspect ofan issue, and miss the most important, essential, or relevant points, regardlessof their intelligence and perceptiveness. This is why such men are alwayscontext-dropping; this is why they see the whole issue only when some advocateof reason points it out, and then they wonder: “Why didn’t I think of thisbefore? Why didn’t I see it by myself?” This is how that epistemology canparalyze and negate the best mind.Notes for cure: The difficulty in correcting this epistemology is the fact thata man’s emotion has become his only selector. Without it, he would feel totallylost in a maze of incomprehensible complexities (which no mind could hold), hewouldn’t know where to begin, he would literally feel something resembling thedisintegration of his consciousness. (His emotional “yes” or “no” is the onlyintegrator of his consciousness, that is: of his memories.) Therefore, onecannot simply forbid him to use his emotion as selector, one cannot remove itwithout providing him with a substitute. So the first step to take is asfollows: while building up his conceptual files by a constant process ofverbalizing and defining, teach him to analyze his emotional selector when hecatches it in action. Thus, if he feels that politics is “bad,” make him askhimself: “Why do I feel this?” and name as many reasons as he can find. Thereasons do not have to be exhaustive immediately; the purpose is to train him tothe process of identifying the causes of his emotions—and, gradually, he willlearn to discover deeper and deeper reasons, to remove more “onion skins,” andultimately to reduce his emotional premises down to their philosophical, primarybase. (Do not rush this process—let him do it—don’t let him memorize formulasand dogmas which he does not fully understand.)[AR’s notes on psychology end here.] 1959[Several years later, AR noted some ideas for short stories.]A “horror story” about mechanics in charge of an H-bomb.

(Such as the relationship of mentalaction to existential action.)256 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_256_r1.jpg]The reification of “forces” of nature is the rebellion against (or ignorance of)the law of identity: it separates entities from actions, implying that actionsare not caused by the nature of the entities that act, but are caused by someoutside power. For example: “Death takes a holiday” implies that death is notinherent in the nature of living entities. Or: “Spring brings flowers”—implyingthat the growth of flowers is not inherent in nature. This is an example of theinability to grasp that existence exists.The process of reifying abstractions is proper only in the moral realm, i.e.,only in regard to human character. Here, it is not a metaphor, a fantasy, orcontradiction of reality—it is possible in fact, it is a model.257 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_257_r1.jpg]The “determinism” to look for in human psychology is logic.

This is the relationship of consciousness toexistence: the content of consciousness is variable; the facts of existence areconstant. Only on this basis can consciousness determine the nature of any givenfact or problem that it is investigating.

To understand the extent ofthe collapse, one must remember that the task of integrating abstractions intowider abstractions, of integrating knowledge into theories and principles, ofintegrating theories and principles to their practical applications, ofmaintaining a constant unifying process between broad concepts and theirconcrete, perceptual roots, thus achieving and preserving a non-contradictorysum and frame of reference—is not an automatic task nor an easy one; it requiresthe highest, most demanding level of conceptual psycho-epistemology. It is thespecific task of philosophy, which cannot be performed by any other profession.Philosophers, by the proper requirement of their task, are the guardians ofman’s knowledge and of his capacity to know.260 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_260_r1.jpg]Every society of men—from the most primitive tribe of savages to present-dayAmerica—has a certain cultural atmosphere which is determined by the kind ofideas that underlie the actions, the mode of living, within that society.Whether the majority actually believes these ideas or merely accepts them bydefault, no society and no men can exist without certain basic ideas to directtheir actions, so long as they do have to act, that is: to deal with reality,with physical nature and with one another. Most men accept their ideas, notbecause they have judged them to be true, but merely because they believe thatthese ideas seem to be accepted by others. The unstated premise behind suchacceptance is the desire to escape the responsibility of independent judgmentand to “play it safe” by means of the evader’s basic formula of: “Who am I toknow? Others know best.”It never occurs to such evaders that most of those others accept their ideas inprecisely the same manner, with no more thought, judgment or knowledge thantheir own. When men attempt to evade the responsibility of thinking, they becomethe victims of an enormous self-made hoax, each man believing that his neighborknows that the ideas they share are true, even if he himself does not know it,and the neighbor believing that his neighbor knows it, even if he doesn‘t, andso forth. Where, then, do these ideas come from? Who sets the terms and thedirection of a culture? The answer is: any man who cares to.For good or evil, whether such a man is a profound thinker or an ambitiousdemagogue, an idealistic hero or a corrupt, man-hating destroyer—those whochoose to deal with ideas determine the course of human history. Those whoformulate men’s thinking determine their fate. The makers of trends, thecreators of cultures, the actual leaders of mankind are the philosophers.If you study history, you will be shocked to discover how few—how very few—ofthese philosophers were profound thinkers or idealistic heroes. But this shouldnot be astonishing: when men attempt to escape the responsibility of thinking,it is not the thinker or the hero that they will attract to the role of theirintellectual leader.The old slogan of con men “You can’t cheat an honest man” is nowhere asapplicable as in the field of the intellect. An honest mind may make errors, butwill not be taken in. The trickiest sophistries of the con men of philosophy areimpotent against a mind honestly concerned with the pursuit of knowledge. Such amind will accept nothing until his own independent, rational judgment hasweighed it and found it to be true. But the pretentious, half-conscious zombie,who wants to be intellectual without effort and who mouths fashionable formulas,with no idea of their meaning, source, or implications, feeling safe in thebelief that some omniscient, infallible authority somewhere has proved them tobe true and saved him the bother—is sure to be the victim of those whose purposeis to destroy the mind he has abandoned. An intellectual leader such asAristotle does not seek blind believers and formula-reciters; a leader such asImmanuel Kant does.261 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_261_r1.jpg]There is one paragraph of Hume‘s, a single short paragraph, which has beenworking like a paralysis-ray on the brains of ethical theorists up to thepresent time, and which I should like to quote:In every system of morality which I have hitherto met with I have alwaysremarked that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way ofreasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerninghuman affairs; when of a sudden I am surprised to find, that instead of theusual copulations of propositions, is and is not, I meet with no propositionthat is not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change isimperceptible; but it is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ought orought not expresses some new relation or affirmation, it is necessary that itshould be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason should begiven for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be adeduction from others that are entirely different from it. [Quoted from ATreatise of Human Nature.]This, in terms of modem philosophy, is the issue of the “is” versus the “ought.”It purports to mean that ethical propositions cannot be derived from factualpropositions—or that knowledge of that which is cannot logically give man anyknowledge of what he ought to do. And wider: it means that knowledge of realityis irrelevant to the actions of a living entity and that any relation betweenthe two is “inconceivable.” May 21, 1961[AR made the following notes while attending a conference on “Methods inPhilosophy and the Sciences ” at The New School in New York City.][Speaker: Noam Chomsky, “Some Observations on Linguistic Structure. ”]Noam Chomsky (an expert social-metaphysical-elite witch doctor):“Studies” should not be multiplied beyond necessity.Simple trees [i.e., diagrams used in modern symbolic logic]: is the manner ofpresentation always in mid-stream, assuming previous knowledge?Pure Rube Goldberg.

UndatedNOTE FOR “SELF-ESTEEM” “ (AND MORALITY)The “able to live” and the “worthy to live” issue can be called “Darwinism” asapplied to man: only the man who has made himself able to live is worthy tolive—which means: the man fit to survive, can survive—which means: theintellectual (and moral) “survival of the fittest.” But observe the meaning ofthis, as against the “Spencerian” kind of Darwinism: (a) other species surviveby “destruction” of lesser species (incidentally, not by the destruction oftheir own species, there is no such thing as “dog-eat-dog”)—man survives byproduction (not by fighting over the given in nature); (b) the human “survivalof the fittest” benefits every human being (the “pyramid of ability”), exceptthe parasites.All altruist societies create the metaphysical contradiction of: the man fit tosurvive finds himself unable to survive—because of conditions geared to thenon-thinking parasite and because of the principle of penalizing virtue forbeing virtue. (This is the [key] for explaining the altruist’s package-dealabout “compassion” and concern for the “unfit”—the unable or theunwilling?—their real concern is: “Let me survive out of focus at yourexpense.”) Undated[AR made the following notes while planning an article on “The Unsacrificed Self”]ISSUESThe sacrifice of material goods is only the last, and superficial, result ofaltruism. The basic demand of altruism is the sacrifice of one’s mind.To sacrifice material goods means to sacrifice one’s values—which means, tosacrifice one’s judgment—which means, to sacrifice one’s mind. (Give clearexamples.)(Power-lust is the attribute of the irrationalist. A rational man wants to knowthe truth, to perceive reality, and has no vested interest in the subversion orsubmission of another man’s mind.)The basic motive of altruism: parasitic survival or the destruction of the mind?Both—since it is the same issue. Existentially, it is not so much parasiticsurvival (and, sometimes, not at all) as the “sense of life,”“pseudo-self-esteem” kind of search for metaphysical-epistemological vindicationor “pseudo-efficacy”—for the reassurance that if one can destroy man’s reason,one can get away with surviving by one’s corrupt, irrationalpsycho-epistemology. It is the constant urge to get away with irrationality—inorder to escape the anxiety of knowing that one is unfit to exist. In thissense—the “non-venal” lust for power (“obedience for the sake of obedience”).The dominance of anti-mind in world religions: Lucifer, Adam, Prometheus,Phaethon, Icarus, the Tower of Babel. Pride as a sin is always the pride of themind, that is, reason. (Which means: the absolutism of one’s own rationaljudgment, the reliance on one’s own “unaided” intellect.) Superficially, peoplethink that pride is some sort of moral conceit, the boast “I am good,” usuallyunearned. But it does not pertain to morality—it pertains to epistemology, asintended by the altruists. For mystic altruists—it is “the pride of the mind”;for collectivist-altruists-it is “the pride (or the evil) of independence.”(Observe how the second brings out the intention of the first, by bringing theissue down to earth. This is an instance of the mystics of muscle being theproduct and heirs of the mystics of spirit.)The need of all power-lusters for a “higher authority” to sanction theirdoctrines, either God or Society—the ultimate reason is that no man could getaway with demanding the sacrifice of your mind to his; he has to be thespokesman of a “higher power.”“Under altruism, no moral calculations are possible. ” Allaltruistic-collectivist systems are guilty of the “fallacy of the stolenconcept” in regard to individualism: they intend to preserve the values ofindividualism while destroying their base.(America’s subordination to the “underdeveloped nations” in the U.N. is thenational counterpart of what altruism demands of the individual: the sacrificeof the power of judgment.)Non-objectivity-as revolt against the independent mind. The “tyranny ofreality.”People do not want total irrationality or dependence. What they want is muchworse: an independent mind who, in case of conflict, accepts their judgmentabove his own. (This is impossible, therefore the result is neurotics withswitching metaphysics; also—the men who reserve their independence for theirprofessions, but surrender their mind in everything else. Examples: Einstein,Frank Lloyd Wright.)The ultimate political-social result and expression of the sacrifice of themind: unlimited majority rule, “democracy,” numbers (or the collective) as thestandard of morality and truth. (Current examples: Kennedy, the Saskatchewandoctors.)The “frozen absolute” attitude toward altruism-collectivism: “What will you doabout the poor?”Altruism is destructive of the mind of the giver and also of the receiver.(“It’s for your own good”—white lies, etc. Example: the universal tragedy of“self-sacrificial” parents.)

It is earlier than you think. The status quo of today is amixed economy with a fascist, rather than socialist, trend—and [Lyndon] Johnsonis the conservative in the exact sense of that word. Today, the advocates oflaissez-faire capitalism, which Sen. [Barry] Goldwater is not, are and have tobe radical innovators.“ February 20, 1966POSSIBLE THEMES FOR ARTICLES“The Short-Range View of Reason”: The people who claim that “man cannot live byreason alone” are concrete-bound, range-of-the-moment non-thinkers who have noidea of principles, wide integrations, fundamental issues, philosophy—and,therefore, who use their mind only moment by moment, on immediate, concreteproblems. They have no inkling of a phenomenon such as a sense of life and noidea of the way in which mind determines emotions. These are the people who saythat reason can deal only with the means to achieve values, but not with theends—that the choice of values is subjective, mystical or arbitrary—thatmorality is not the province of reason, and there can be no rational morality.(If a man like [Ludwig von Mises] advocates this last, it is a sign of someenormous repression (or second-handedness) in the realm of values—since he iscertainly not concrete-bound in his professional psycho-epistemology; ifanything, he is “rationalistic” (Kantian) and inclined to floating abstractions.This is an interesting psychological lead.)268 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_268_r1.jpg]“Sense of Life and the Primacy of Consciousness ”: Man needs a state ofpsychological integration—of inner unity and, therefore, full certainty.Uncertainty is a dangerous state for man existentially, and unsupportablepsychologically. The truly unbearable uncertainty is uncertainty about thevalidity of one’s own consciousness. And since man never learned how to livewith a volitional consciousness, how to possess certainty and knowledge withoutinfallibility and omniscience—his most urgent need is the validation of his ownconsciousness. Therefore, in the absence of a rational epistemology (which isthe only solution to this problem) man takes his consciousness as an absolute(uncritically) and fakes reality to fit it—in order not to face the horror of animpotent consciousness; hence, Platonism and other such philosophies. (This isthe distorted element of truth in such systems—or the psycho-epistemologicalneed which makes them possible. A great deal of conscious evil and faking forevil motives is involved in the authors of such philosophies, as, for instance,in Hume or Kant.)

The “games” ofdouble-meaning dialogue, focused on “beating” somebody—the focus on “impressing”somebody or “proving” something about oneself, rather than on facts and reality.In regard to art: the focusing, not on whether one enjoys a given work of art,but on: “What will it prove about me if I enjoy it or not?” (The paradox:enormous and irrational concern with one’s moral status—by a person who hasgiven up values and moral sovereignty.) The irrationality of altruism on thisissue: the advice to “come out of yourself” and “concern yourself with the‘wider’ world,” which is equated with “concern with others”—as if the objectivemeant the collective, as if “others” had a stake in reality, but one did not, asif the withdrawal from reality into one’s own feelings were actually to one’sown interest.(This is actually the issue of “self-doubt-centeredness.”) [AR regarded the term“self-centered” as a pejorative, meaning, roughly, “neurotically concerned withone’s own worth, ” i.e., “centered on self-doubt. ” In her view, the virtue ofselfishness requires that one be “reality-centered. ”]269 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_269_r1.jpg]The issue of men’s unidentified best: The reversal of the idea that men pretendto be good in public, but are monsters in private (like Peyton Place). The exactopposite is true: men (I suspect, predominantly) repress and hide their best(their values, their honest or profound thoughts, their serious concerns), andput on an act of cautious, empty superficiality (and, often, moral treason) inpublic. The “lynching” spirit: the worst in men is encouraged by a mob feeling(and I doubt whether the best ever is—such instances as “public” courage are notcourage).(The springboard for this article: The fact that men use the right epistemologyin the physical sciences, to the extent that they do succeed, but have neveridentified it.) 1966-1967[The following passages were cut from Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology.The first is from the conclusion to Chapter 5, “Definitions. ”]It is as if man were still screaming in terror before the mystery of his ownconsciousness, unable to grasp the fact that human cognition is not to beachieved automatically, neither by passive absorption nor by active distortionof perceptual data, and that knowledge can be acquired only by a specific methodwhose terms are set irrevocably by the nature of man’s consciousness and ofreality, and are not open to man’s choice, only to his discovery and practice—arigorous method, to be practiced volitionally, whose reward is objectiveknowledge.270 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_270_r1.jpg][From Chapter 6, “Axiomatic Concepts ”:]The disintegration of a human consciousness means the attempted descent to ananimal’s perceptual level of awareness, but with this difference: an animal,being unable to question reality, is unable to fake it and acts, moment bymoment, in accordance with such facts as his limited awareness entitles him toperceive. Man, possessing the power to expand his consciousness, does notpossess the power to shrink it; he cannot escape the integrating power of hisbrain and restrict himself to snatches of moment-by-moment awareness. If herejects the task of conscious integration, his sub conscious does the job forhim, and the result is not cognitive integration, but a blind, nightmare mixtureof the part-grasped, part-evaded, part-felt, part-wished and whole terror, thestate of a creature unfit to perceive reality on any level of awareness, andunable to survive—samples of which may be observed in any psychiatrist’s officeor in the ranks of any irrationalist movement.271 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_271_r1.jpg][From Chapter 7, “The Cognitive Role of Concepts”:]The growth of language follows the growth of knowledge, guided by the principleof unit-economy. Every new branch of science creates a vocabulary of its own(which should be, but today is not, translatable without contradiction into thegeneral language). The advent of every new industry creates new words, i.e., newconcepts. (If Plato’s theory of universals needed any modern refutations, testit by asking yourself whether the archetypes of “monkey wrench,” “spark plug”and “television” had to wait two and a half thousand years in another dimensionto be finally recalled by man.)[After crossing out the above, AR wrote:]The growth of language follows the growth of knowledge and the expansion ofhuman activities. It is a vast, anonymous process, with many variations (in theoptional area), many changes, false starts and short-lived attempts. Yet certainbasic principles can be observed, demonstrating, not the arbitrary character,but the objectivity of that process.In secular practice (i.e., omitting the concepts of mysticism, which have noreferents), a word survives and gains general usage only when and if itdesignates an actual category of existents that need conceptual designation—withthe principle of unit-economy determining that need. Slang is a major source ofnew words in the general language. Many slang terms are coined every year, byone group or another; some of them become fashionable, enjoy a brief, artificialpopularity of random mouthing (intended to designate the fact that one is inwith the right group, rather than any category of existents) and vanish, likethe stale debris of some noisy party. But a few slang expressions survive andbecome part of formal language—the apt, incisive ones that designate some aspectof reality for which no formal term had previously existed (such as the verb “tokid” or the nouns “bum” or “stuffed shirt”).272 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_272_r1.jpg][From Chapter 8, “Consciousness and Identity”:]Such knowledge as mankind has acquired and such progress as it has made wereachieved in spite of and in a constant struggle against its dominant theories ofepistemology. Cognitive objectivity has existed in the world as a kind ofunofficial, unrecognized underground, in isolated instances and sporadicsnatches, fed by such partial leads as could be found in Aristotle’s far fromperfect system. Objectivity has never had a full statement, a consistent theoryor a firm epistemological foundation; and, even though it represented theimplicit method practiced in every scientific achievement, particularly in thespectacular progress of the physical sciences, it was not identified noracknowledged by its practitioners, which is an eloquent illustration of theultimate futility of practice without theory, of man’s helplessness when helacks an explicit statement of his merely implicit knowledge. Those who soughtcognitive objectivity were helplessly vulnerable to the theoretical onslaughtsof both mystics and skeptics—they had no answer to the flood of equivocations,merely sensing that something was very wrong in those arguments, but unable todiscover why—and they lost the battle again and again, as they have lost ittoday, when we witness the spectacle of nuclear missiles on one hand and, on theother, a unanimous chorus proclaiming that knowledge is impossible to man (and,presumably, that a process of cognition based on conceptual “familyresemblances” [a reference to Wittgenstein] will determine when those missilesare to be used).May, 1968[The following was cut from AR’s introduction to the twenty-fifth-anniversaryedition of The Fountainhead.]I have been asked whether I have learned anything from the history of TheFountainhead and its readers. I have—and it was not an attractive discovery. Ilearned, at least in part, what makes those stillborn men extinguish theunrepeatable fact of being alive.Without apology to Dostoevsky, this part of my discussion may be entitled “Notesfrom the Underground.”It took me some time to identify and confirm the nature of that particularunderground. I shall list the key points of the evidence, as I observed it.Of the twelve publishers who rejected The Fountainhead, the most shockingrejection, to me, was by a house whose editor told me that their editorial boardhad evaluated my novel as: “a work of almost genius ‘genius’ in the power of itsexpression—’almost’ in the sense of its enormous bitterness,” but that theyrejected it because they were certain it would not sell. (Incidentally, whatthey took for “bitterness” was the unforgiving tone of moral indignation.) Thephenomenon of men acting on wrong standards of value did not puzzle me; but thephenomenon of men rejecting that which they regarded as a value by their ownstandards and judgment was, to me, psychologically inconceivable. I felt that Iwas sensing some profound evil which I would have to learn to identify someday.After the publication of The Fountainhead, I met a woman, by chance, in a beautyparlor. She heard my name and she approached me to tell me how much she admiredmy novel. She was not gushing; she spoke quietly, intently and, to the best ofmy judgment, sincerely. It was the sincerity that made me take notice when shecomplimented me on my courage and added, with the faintest note of despair inher voice, referring to the spirit of my book: “Many of us feel that way, but wedon’t have the courage to say it. We’re afraid.” “Afraid of what?” I asked. Shecould not answer; she merely sighed and spread her hands out in a gesture ofhopelessness, as if she were thinking of something intangible, too vast toidentify. I tried to question her, but got no further clue. I truly did not knowwhat she was talking about. I never saw her again. But the incident remained inmy mind because I felt it was a clue to something either evil or very, verywrong, which I had to understand.A brilliant young man [Leonard Peikoff] whom I met when he was seventeen (andwho since has become one of my best friends), asked me, on our first meeting:“Is Howard Roark moral or is he practical? He seems to be both—yet I have alwaysbeen told that it’s one or the other.” This choice was deeply disturbing to him,because he took moral issues seriously and because the same people urged him—atdifferent times—to choose alternate sides of this dichotomy. It did not take melong to convince him that this was a false dichotomy, caused by theirrationality and impracticality of the mystic-altruist ethics, and that thiswas one example of why man needs a rational code of ethics. But I wondered—as Ihad wondered often, before and since—about the psychological state of those whomaintain that dichotomy. What are moral values divorced from practice? And whatis it that one chooses to practice, if it is divorced from moral values? [Thisparagraph was crossed out.]In the early days of The Fountainhead’s history, when its success was stilluncertain, I noticed the peculiar attitude of an editor of my acquaintance: hisconviction that my novel was a great value and his emotional commitment to itwere unquestionable, he had demonstrated it, in action, on many occasions—andyet, whenever I consulted him on any action to be taken on its behalf, hisanswers were vague, almost forced and singularly half-hearted. Then, one day, Iasked him: “Tell me, you believe that The Fountainhead is great and, preciselyfor that reason, you believe that it is doomed, don’t you?” He answered in alow, unhappy voice: “Yes.”The instances of men who paid me extravagant, unsolicited compliments at privategatherings, but never stated it in print or on public occasions, are toonumerous to count. I do not mean the usual sort of gushers. Those men wereprominent literary or professional figures who had no reason to flatter me; inmany cases, they did not even say it to me, but to others, without knowing thatI would ever hear about it. If such were their views, they had no reason to beafraid of expressing them publicly. Yet they kept silent.The final clue was provided by a very perceptive friend of mine. He said he hadobserved a strange quality in many people’s enthusiasm for The Fountainhead: itwas a furtive, secretive, subjective quality, almost like the reluctantconfession of a guilty love. “They talk as an unhappily married man would talkabout his secret mistress,” he said. “Their marriage is to the Establishment, toconventional values and the ‘accepted’ intellectual positions. But TheFountainhead is their passion.”What I felt was something like a cold shudder.What I grasped was that this was deeper and worse than simple cowardice orconformity. For whatever complexity of reasons—whether out of fear, orbewilderment, or discouragement, or repression, or years of conditioning byaltruism’s vicious dichotomy between the moral and the practical, with theconsequent feeling that the good is impractical, and the practical has no placefor values—those men were consigning their values, the things they loved oradmired or enjoyed, to the airless dungeon of subjectivism, as private fantasiesor fragile, private treasures unfit for the sunlight of reality. circa 1977[The following daily schedule was undated.

She did not get for inplanning either book; the notes here represent in total a few days of work oneach, spread over a period of years—what AR referred to as “work in smallglances.” June 8, 1958OBJECTIVISMA PHILOSOPHY FOR LIVING ON EARTHPREFACEI apologize for the subtitle of this book: it is the intellectual corruption ofour age that made it necessary. If men were taught how to speak, it would beobvious that the word “living” refers to man; that man lives on earth; that“philosophy,” being the science of the nature of existence, is concerned withdiscovering the knowledge man requires for living; and, therefore, that the onlywords necessary are: “A philosophy.”But since “philosophy” is the one concept which, today, has been all butdestroyed, there are reasons why modern men cannot achieve a state of conceptualprecision prior to acquiring the knowledge here to be presented. The purpose ofthis book is to make its subtitle redundant.June 19, 1958“Cosmology” has to be thrown out ofphilosophy. When this is done, the conflictbetween “rationalism” and “empiricism” will be wiped out--or, rather, the errorthat permitted the nonsense of such a conflict will be wiped out.What, apparently, has never been challenged and what I took as a self-evidentchallenge (which it isn’t) is Thales’ approach to philosophy, namely: the ideathat philosophy has to discover the nature of the universe in cosmo-logicalterms. If Thales thought that everything is water, and the other pre-Socraticsfought over whether it’s water and earth and fire, etc., then the empiricistswere right in declaring that they would go by the evidence of observation, notby “rational” deduction—only then, of course, the whole issue and all its termsare [thoroughly confused]. The crux of the error here is in the word “nature.” Itook Thales’ attempt to mean only the first attempt at, or groping toward, aunified view of knowledge and reality, i.e., an epistemological, not ametaphysical, attempt to establish the fact that things have natures.Now I think that he meant, and all subsequent philosophers took it to mean, ametaphysical attempt to establish the literal nature of reality and to prove byphilosophical means that everything is literally and physically made of water orthat water is a kind of universal “stuff.” If so, then philosophy is worse thana useless science, because it usurps the domain of physics and proposes to solvethe problems of physics by some non-scientific, and therefore mystical, means.On this kind of view of philosophy, it is logical that philosophy has dangled onthe strings of physics ever since the Renaissance and that every new discoveryof physics has blasted philosophy sky-high, such as, for instance, the discoveryof the nature of color giving a traumatic shock to philosophers, from which theyhave not yet recovered. [AR is referring to the discovery that our perception ofcolor depends on the nature of the light and the human visual system as well ason nature of the object, which led many philosophers to conclude that perceptionis subjective.]In fact, this kind of view merely means: rationalizing from an arrested state ofknowledge. Thus, if in Thales’ time the whole extent of physical knowledgeconsisted of distinguishing water from air and fire, he took this knowledge tobe a final omniscience and decided on its basis that water was the primarymetaphysical element. On this premise, every new step in physics has to mean anew metaphysics. The subsequent nonsense was not that empiricists rejectedThales’ approach, but that they took him (and Plato) to be “rationalists,” i.e.,men who derived knowledge by deduction from some sort of “innate ideas,” andtherefore the empiricists declared themselves to be anti-rationalists. They didnot realize that the Thales-Plato school was merely a case of “arrestedempiricists,” that is, men who “rationalized” on the ground of taking partialknowledge as omniscience.Aristotle established the right metaphysics by establishing the law ofidentity—which was all that was necessary (plus the identification of the factthat only concretes exist). But he destroyed his metaphysics by his cosmology—bythe whole nonsense of the “moving spheres,” “the immovable mover,” teleology,etc.The real crux of this issue is that philosophy is primarily epistemology—thescience of the means, the rules, and the methods of human knowledge.Epistemology is the base of all other sciences and one necessary for man becauseman is a being of volitional consciousness—a being who has to discover, not onlythe content of his knowledge, but also the means by which he is to acquireknowledge. Observe that all philosophers (except Aristotle) have been projectingtheir epistemologies into their metaphysics (or that their metaphysics weremerely epistemological and psychological confessions). All the fantasticirrationalities of philosophical metaphysics have been the result ofepistemological errors, fallacies or corruptions. “Existence exists” (oridentity plus causality) is all there is to metaphysics. All the rest isepistemology.Paraphrasing myself: Philosophy tell us only that things have natures, but whatthese natures are is the job of specific sciences. The rest of philosophy’s taskis to tell us the rules by which to discover the specific natures. June 20, 1958The philosophy which I now will have to present is, in essence, the “rules ofthinking” which children should be taught in the proper society (which the WetNurse needed). It is fundamental epistemology—plus psychological “epistemology.”All the evils of philosophy have always been achieved via epistemology—by meansof the “How do you know that you know?” Consider the fact that the first andgreatest destroyer, Plato, did it by means of the issue of “universals vs.particulars.” Mankind as a whole seems to be caught in the trap of the nature ofits own epistemology: men cannot think until they have acquired the power ofabstractions and language, but having done so, they do not know how they gotthere and are vulnerable to any attack on their means of knowledge. Like thediscovery of “A is A,” their epistemology is implicit in their thinking, butunidentified. This will be the main part of my job: my theory of universals—thehierarchical nature of concepts—the “stolen concept” fallacy—the“context-dropping” and the “blank-out” (the refusal to identify)—the “Rand’srazor” (“state your irreducible primaries”)—the rules of induction (anddefinitions)—the “integration into the total sum of your knowledge”—the proofthat “that which is empirically impossible is also logically impossible (orfalse)”—etc.This will be the issue of “teaching the world my particular kind ofepistemology” (which I took to be self-evident and known). This is also why Ialways thought of philosophy as a static, “finite” base, like logic, i.e., as aclosed discipline which has to be learned in order then to proceed to live, with“life” beginning above this base. This, probably, is the root of what Leonard[Peikoff] had in mind when he called the present state of the world “the age ofpre-reason.” It will help me to think of my job as “Philosophy for Hank Rearden.”NOTES FOR “OBJECTIVISM ”[Most of the remaining notes for the book deal with AR’s theory of concepts,which she later published in Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology.]A unit is a concrete entity considered apart from the other entities which aresubsumed under the same abstraction.Thus, an inch is a concrete entity of the abstraction “length ” and is a unit ofmeasurement for any other length which is conceptualized by means of itsrelationships to the chosen unit; thus a yard is so many inches, a mile is somany yards, etc.Number is the abstraction of the process of abstraction. It stands for therelationship of an entity to other entities, all of which have to be absoluteand immutable in their defining characteristic, in that which permits them to beregarded as units subsumed under a single concept. Number is the concept thatidentifies the transition from “entity to ”unit, “ the mental transformation ofa concrete, perceptual entity into the material to be integrated by a concept.Mathematics is the pattern (the blue print) of the conceptual level of man’sconsciousness—the abstract pattern of the process of concept-formation, in thesense that it isolates and identifies the process which man’s mind has toperform in regard to every abstraction, every concept it reaches, regardless ofthe concretes involved—that is: the abstraction of ”number“ stands for anyconcrete entities regarded as ”units“ to be integrated into a concept which thenbecomes a new, single unit. (The concept ”ten“ is a single unit denoting acertain number of ”ones“; the abstraction ”man“ is a single unit denoting ”nnumber“ of concrete men, that is: denoting a mathematical series to be extendedinto infinity, to subsume any number of men.)(Next step: The relationship of every concept to the “open-ended” mathematicalseries.)“Measurement” is the establishment of a relationship—the relationship between aconcrete unit, which serves as the standard of measure, and other concretesbelonging to the same abstraction (length, weight, etc.). A “concept” is alsothe establishment of a relationship—the relationship between a concrete unit andother concretes belonging to the same abstraction; the standard of measure hereis the defining characteristic.FALLACIES:“Stolen Concept” (connected with “irreducible primaries”).“Context-dropping.”“Reification of the Zero.”“Stepping into Limbo.”“Non-differentiation between Existence and Consciousness.”(A “unit” is the concept of identity. If you take “a group” as a start andproceed to define a “unit” by breaking up the group—you have committed thefallacy of the “stolen concept”: you have already accepted the group as a unit.)Regarding “context-dropping ”: a variant or corollary fallacy is the idea thatconsidering a thing in context is a “relativistic ” premise, thus: if values areselected by man, they are “relative” to man. This is an example of the “whosewhim” fallacy: either values are intrinsic (arbitrarily set by the whim of Godor nature)—or they are subjective (“relative” to or set by the whim of man); theconcept of objectivism (of an immutable nature of things) is missing. Thereasoning behind it goes like this: if a thing has to be considered in acontext, then it is not an absolute, then anything goes. The error is: thesubstitution of infinity for a given, known context. Example: [a philosophyprofessor] claiming that the airplane invalidates the absolutism of the law ofgravitation. April 9, 1959NOTES FOR EPISTEMOLOGY (RE: MATHEMATICS OF CONSCIOUSNESS)The basic and most universal concepts in the functioning of a humanconsciousness are: existence—identity—entity—unit.The first two pertain to metaphysics, the second two to epistemology.To grasp existence is to grasp that existence is identity—that a thing is whatit is.To grasp that is to grasp the concept of entity—a thing.To continue the process of consciousness is to transform the concept of entityinto the concept of a unit, thus: a “unit” is an entity which is independent ofany other entity of its own kind—or, a unit is any part of an entity consideredindependently of the rest of its own kind, such as an inch of string consideredas an independent length of string while it is part of a ten-inch string. Thisis the start of the process of measurement.All measurement is integration, by means of a basic unit, that is: the bringingof a vast or complex whole into conceptual form by relating it mathematically toa basic unit. Example: a mile is so many feet.All abstractions (all concepts) are the identifications of a basic unit ofmeasurement, with the specific measurements of the particular concretes omitted.For example, length is the abstraction of spatial extension, which omits thespecific spatial extension of any given entity, but defines the kind of unit bymeans of which this entity is to be measured in regard to its attribute ofspatial extension.The unit of measurement for all concepts pertaining to consciousness is theircontent. Since consciousness is a “representation” or “reflection” (a more exactterm is here needed) of existence, the concepts pertaining to consciousness areultimately reducible to the existents which they “reflect” or “represent.”Examples: a “thought” is differentiated from another thought by means of itssubject (of what the thought is about); an “emotion” is differentiated fromanother emotion by means of the value judgment it represents, and a valuejudgment is a thought (a thought dealing with the realm of action in existence).In establishing a unit of measurement one has to observe two rules: the unit hasto be a tool of both division and integration, it must give one the conceptualpossibility of breaking an entity into such units and of integrating it backagain, as well as integrating it with other entities of the same kind intogroups or sums. Example: if an “inch” is taken as the unit to measure length,one must be able to break up a longer string into inches, then add them up toget a concept of the string in terms of an integrated sum of inches. (Thisrequires a great deal more careful thinking and more precise definitions. Butthis is a lead to the process of forming concepts or abstractions.) [...]275 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_275_r1.jpg]My hypothesis is that all consciousness is a mathematical process (or, rather,the function of any consciousness is a mathematical process). To prove this Iwould have to identify the basic principles common to perception andmathematics. (By perception I mean here the total process of human awareness,from sensations to perceptions to conceptions.) I would have to identify thewider abstractions underlying the processes of concept-formation and ofmathematics. And I would have to integrate them with neurology on the one hand(with the physiological part of the integration of sensations intoperceptions)—and with metaphysics on the other.If my hypothesis is true, then algebra might give me the clue to the objectiverules of induction—to a kind of “Organon of Induction.” [Aristotle’s works onlogic are called the “Organon, ” Greekfor “instrument. ”] June 18, 1959(Hurried notes, which require hours and hours of further thinking.)Arithmetical numbers are taken as entities in any arithmetical calculation,which means: an arithmetical calculation is an action by which the relationshipof certain entities leads to the discovery of a final entity, which is the goaland the stop of the action. A series of arithmetical equations involving actionis incomplete until it has reached the stopping point of a specific arithmeticalentity, e.g., a number.But the numbers themselves are composites. The only primary entity here is theunit—the concept of one (1). Every other number is an abstraction which replacesa certain repetition of ones by a single concept meant to stand for thatrepetition (111 1 means 4).This is the epistemological method of the first level of abstractions—that is,the abstractions (or conceptions) derived directly from perceptions andconstituting “ostensive definitions,” e.g., the abstractions of immediatelyperceived objects, such as: chair, table, man, red, green, color, living being,etc. (Note the mixture of levels, such as “red” and “color.”) [AR seems to becorrecting herself here—“color” and “living being” are not“first-level” abstractions.] (Perceptions here mean that which a humanconsciousness automatically integrates out of sensations.) The next (andvolitional) level are the abstractions from abstractions—which is theepistemological method of algebra (the discovery of unknown quantities by meansof their relationship to the known quantities).December 15, 1960NOTES,FOR “OBJECTIVISM”Re: fallacies. The two most important fallacies which I must define thoroughlyare, in effect, extensions of two of the fallacies defined by Aristotle:“context-dropping” is really the wider (and more modem) name for Aristotle’s“ignoratio elenchi”; and “the stolen concept” is the other side, the reverse, of“petitio principii.” If this last is “begging the question” or “assuming thatwhich you are attempting to prove,” then “the stolen concept” is “begging theanswer” or “assuming that which you are attempting to disprove.” (Many instancesof “the stolen concept” are, in fact, instances of “petitio principii,” such as[Bertrand] Russell’s attempt to derive the concept “unit” from [the concept]“group,” which, throughout the whole reasoning, presupposes knowledge of theconcept “unit.” But such instances are merely fraudulent attempts to provesomething; the most important part of “the stolen concept” is its application tothe fraudulent attempts to disprove something, particularly to disprove basicaxioms. This is the worst of the fallacies in modern philosophy.)[The notes for Objectivism: A Philosophy for Living on Earth end here.]276 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_276_r1.jpg][During an interview in 1961, AR remarked:I don’t know whether I will ever write fiction again. The difficulty is thatAtlas Shrugged was the climax and completion of the goal I had set for myself atthe age of nine. It expressed everything that I wanted of fiction writing. Aboveeverything else, it presented my ideal man fully. I can never surpass Galt. Morethan that, I now have four variants: Roark, Galt, Rearden, and Francisco. Thereis no point in multiplying them. What worries me about my future in fiction isthat the motor of my interest—the presentation of the ideal man and the idealway of life—is gone. It’s completed, fulfilled....If and when I see an aspect of my sense of life that I have not covered, then Iwill write another novel. One can’t exhaust the sense of life; it is not likephilosophical problems.At the time, AR had already made a few notes for To Lorne Dieterling. In AtlasShrugged, the focus was on the whole of society, and the philosophic issues weredealt with explicitly. In To Lorne Dieterling, the focus is on the heroine,Hella, and her sense of life.]277 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_277_r1.gif]278 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_278_r1.jpg]November 30, 1957First notes for: To Lorne Dieterling.Basic theme: The story of a woman who is totally motivated by love forvalues—and how one maintains such a state when alone in an enemy world. Next step of theme: The whole issue of values and of happiness. The role ofvalues in human psychology, in the relationships among men and in the events oftheir lives. What it means to “live for one’s own sake”—shown not on asocial-political scale, but in men’s personal lives.As a consequence, show the manner in which men betray their values, and show theresults. Select, for the characters of the story, the key versions of men’sattitudes toward values.The hidden, basic issue here will be: effort or non-effort, or happiness versusnon-effort. The issue “to think or not to think” takes actual form,existentially and psychologically, as the issue: “To value or to conform. ” Itis not the independent thinker as such that people actually resent, but theindependent value—which means: the person who feels intensely about his values.(This point will require long, detailed analysis here.) The set-up of characters, at present:Hella: the fully rational valuer.Lome Dieterling: the repressor (a rational man who goes off the rails on thequestion of action—who, starting with the absolute that he will not let peoplestop him, finds himself placing action above ideas).The “practical man.”The “glamorizer.”The “idealist.”Gloria Thornton: the “energy without effort” type.The above are pro-life people. Hella and Lorne are rational; the rest are thebetter types of social-metaphysicians.On the “below-zero” side are the pro-death people—the actual haters of life andvalues.The “Uncle Ed” type: the power-luster, who wants power for the sake of power;actually, he is after nothing at all.The sneerer: the professional cynic, whose sole motive is to sneer ateverything; specifically, at any kind of values (the New Yorker magazine type).The humanitarian: the type whose motive is to penalize values for being values,to make men feel guilty about their intelligence, or ability, or beauty, orsuccess, or wealth.The story must show: that the death-premisers are actually after nothing, thatthey achieve nothing but a senseless, meaningless vacuum, that their horror istheir mediocrity; and that they are the value-setters of a society ofsocial-metaphysicians. (The rational men do not “take care” of other men; thethinkers require thinking men. It is only the most profoundly dependentsocial-metaphysicians, the power-lusters, who will undertake to “think forothers.” As a consequence, the value-betrayers in the story—the men who gave upvalues for the sake of “safety,” on the ground that “others know best”—find, inthe end, that their treason and all of their torture were for no better purposethan to have the world obey “Uncle Ed‘s” opinion on cigarettes. Or, as anotherexample: the girl who renounces the man she loves, because of her mother’sobjections—finds that her mother’s ultimate purpose was to stay in bed an hourlater than usual “on whim.”) The story must also show: that the value-betrayers end up by achieving the exactopposite of the goals they sought to achieve by social-metaphysical means.Here there are two separate aspects to consider: Whether these men have somesemi-rationally selected goal and believe (emotionally) that social-metaphysicsis the means—or whether in their very selection of goals, they chose thesocially prescribed, chose it uncritically, as a self-evident, irreducibleprimary. (I believe it is more this second. As an example: the “practical man”who chooses wealth and material success without any thought of “why?” or “whatfor?,” simply on some such feeling as “it’s good to be successful, everybodywants to be successful, how can that be doubted?”—which amounts to the feeling:“one is supposed to be successful.” Another example: the woman who has childrenwithout ever questioning whether she wants to have them—simply on the feelingthat “one is supposed to have children.”)The “practical man” goes bankrupt.The “glamorizer” is viciously betrayed by his “best friend” (or wife) andsuffers a terrible tragedy.The “idealist” becomes the particular “cat’s paw” of the villains in theirattempted destruction of ideals.Gloria Thomton—whose “ego-value” was her competence in the achievement of anyvalues prescribed by society, who obeyed, adjusted and conformed in theexpectation that “others” (or “reality”) would reward her with happiness—findsherself empty, exhausted, enjoying nothing and reaching a state of chronicpanic. Examples of value-betraying (these are random examples of the things I hatemost):The man who, in middle-life, finds the woman he could be truly in love with, andpasses her up because “it would upset his whole life.”In the same category as above: the man who avoids any serious emotionalcommitment, who runs from anything that he could feel strongly about—for reasonssuch as: “I would be afraid to lose it” or: “It would hurt me too much to loseit,” etc.—the man who deliberately chooses the second-rate and second-best, theman who seeks dullness and mediocrity.The man who says: “I don’t want to be happy, I just want to becontented—happiness is too demanding, exaltation is too difficult to bear.”The man who says: “Don’t take anything too seriously,” and, later and moreaccurately: “I don’t take myself seriously.”The man who says: “There is no black and white. All men are gray.” (With theresult that he then proceeds to a mawkish, hysterical defense of any depravityas “not wholly black”—and to a malicious resentment against any man who iswholly white, and more: against any claim that any man can be wholly white.)The man who excuses (and sanctions and accepts) another man’s evil action byclaiming that the actor’s motives or intentions were good.The man who believes that ideals are “too good for this earth.” His variantsare: “If it’s good, it’s doomed,” or: “If it’s successful, it can’t be good,”or: “If I want it, it’s impossible.”Any believer in any sort of compromise.Any man who believes that mankind is essentially, metaphysically evil—andproceeds to make terms with the evil. (Any “appeaser.”) Key points of the original “unrequited love ” story:Hella’s dedication to the “curse” of always seeing things “as they ought to be.”(“The Archer” prologue.)The Hella-Lorne romance—and breach.Hella learning of Lome’s engagement to Gloria at Gloria’s birthday party; Lomefollowing Hella to her home and their scene. (“It is only my pain—and I can takecare of it.”)Hella’s work on her book—the excruciating loneliness—the discovery of “her ownworld,” her “dates” with Lorne “as they should have been.”The publication of the book—the general fury against her—the torture scene.(“This is our wedding-night, even if such is the only form of it that I canhave.”)The walk through the woods. (“To keep moving, just to keep moving ... just totake the next step ...”) The collapse—the enraptured rededica tion. (“No, Idon’t regret it....”—the “all right, even this” answer to every past torture.)Lome joins her. (“I have not asked you to forgive me.” “To forgive you? Forwhat?”)279 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_279_r1.jpg][On January 1, 1963, AR attached the following comment to these notes:]The above notes are totally wrong for this story. The approach in them is toobroad and transforms the story into a wide-scale, social novel (by presentingthe stories of all the other types, of all the variants). This turns it into anovel about men ’s attitude toward values—and not the story of one valuer. Thesenotes may be used only as source material for the lesser characters of thesupporting cast. This is not the right statement of the theme. [After twelveyears of work on Atlas Shrugged, AR, it seems, had automatized the approach to awide-scale, social novel.] February 10, 1959New statement of theme: the art of psychological survival in a malevolent world;the art of spiritual self-sufficiency.To think over: the principles (and definitions) of how one knows what depends ononeself, and how one reacts to existential events which are not wholly dependenton oneself; what one aims to achieve as rewards; the preservation of action andgoals in the world without dependence on others (without the torture of hope)and without subjectivism.Hella as a dancer (projecting her view of man and of his relationship toexistence, the stylized and benevolent universe).The real essence of the story is to be the universe of my “tiddlywink” music, ofthe “Traviata Overture” and “Simple Confession,” of my sense of life.[“Tiddlywink” music was AR’s name for her favorite lighthearted popular tunesfrom the turn of the century.]Use the incident of Good Copy as a psychological key. [The “incident” occurredwhen Good Copy was read in a 1958 fiction-writing seminar given by AR. Some ofthe students regarded the story as philosophically superficial or meaninglessbecause it was lighthearted and cheerful; AR explained that such a criticism wasbased on the malevolent universe premise (see The Early Ayn Rand).]Lorne as the man who sacrifices values for the sake of “living on earth”—for thesake of action, motivated by a passionate pro-life premise, an unbreached(“Narcissus”-like) self-esteem, but thrown off by the wrong premise of takingaction as a primary. The “above zero ” types of value-betrayers:The idealist-aspirer: the subjectivist who holds his values only as a privatedream, only in his own consciousness, and betrays Hella because he comes to feelresentment against the possibility of values being achieved in reality. Startingwith a “Who am I to act?” attitude, he ends up with the premise (or feeling)that “if it is in reality, it is not a value.”The “Byronic” idealist who builds pain into his “despair-universe” and ends upwith the premise that “if no pain is involved, it is not a value nor an ideal;if it’s cheerful, it’s vulgar, superficial and inconsequential.” He ends up as areal “pain-worshipper.”The “glamorizer” who dares not admit to himself the existence of pain or evil inthe world, who goes on pretending to himself that everything is good, because hewants the good so desperately—and ends up by letting the good perish rather thandiscover that evil is evil.The “below-zero ” types who set the values to which all the “value-betrayers”surrender:The cynic who hates values for being values, and whose sole pleasure is indestruction.The Babbitt: the human “ballast” who has no values and doesn’t give a damn.The “Uncle Ed” type: the power-luster, who wants power for the sake of power;actually, he is after nothing at all.The “top-average ” type: the presumptuous mediocrity who wants the unearned.TEMPORARY OUTLINELorne’s note—Hella on her way to the hotel—the flashback:Hella’s love for Lome—his conflict between Hella and Gloria—Hella’s conflictwith the world (her “curse” of “seeing things as they ought to be”).Love scene between Hella and Lome—his best “passion for life.”The missed date—Gloria’s party—the announcement of Gloria’s engagement to Lorne.Hella’s walk home—Lome follows her, their scene. (“It is only my pain—and I cantake care of it.”)Hella’s struggle—the senseless dance-engagements-her excruciatingloneliness—Lome’s marriage.Hella’s practice and saving for her debut—the discovery of “her own world,” her“dates” with Lorne “as they should have been.”Lorne’s struggle with his precarious empire—the deterioration of hisrelationship with Gloria and of their marriage.Hella dancing in the dive. The stranger, who is Lorne’s uncle—their friendship.Hella’s debut—total disaster, except for the presence of Lome and of the uncle.The uncle’s death—the conditions of his will.Lorne’s trap—his conversation with the lawyer, his decision.Back to the present: the scene in the hotel room (which is the “torture scene”).Lorne’s final choice (probably in court, in connection with the will)—hisreunion with Hella, their unobstructed future.February 11, 1959Approximate text of the note:Hella,I have to see you. It is crucially urgent. If you ever loved me, you’ll come.There is nothing to fear. No one will know. I will be waiting for you at theHotel—room 503 tonight, 10:30.LomeDecember 25, 1959TO LORNE DIETERLINGThe music to be used (dance numbers):La Traviata Overture [by Giuseppe Verdi]—theme song, build the whole novel onit, in scale. First time—for the first meeting of Hella and Lome. Then—for walkthrough the forest.“Will o’ the Wisp”—for dance in the dive.“Reconciliation Polka.”“Marionetta at Midnight.”“Eva Overture” [by Franz Lehar] or “Simple Confession.”“Anima.”Possibly use “In the Shadows” and “Polichinelle” (from “La Source”).March 21, 1963The story of Atlas who did not go on strike. (The issue of “pronouncing moraljudgment,” of not sanctioning evil. Or: “how to lead a rational life in anirrational society.”)What would happen if a few key people or cultural leaders maintained a “moraltone”—instead of today’s scared, social-metaphysical, cowardly surrender to anyimmoral assertiveness (which is the policy of letting evil set the moral terms).Why are people more afraid of me than of communism? Is it that they know Idemand immediate, moral-epistemological action from them, and a long-rangestand—while communism is a threat they can evade and make unreal in their ownminds? Is it the issue of their guilt and lack of self-esteem, which makesphysical terror or disaster more “acceptable” to them thanpsycho-epistemological terror, than the immediate threat to their (pseudo)self-esteem?280 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_280_r1.jpg](On re-reading the above:) I think it’s obvious that the issue here is: Does onewant a world and a life geared to one’s best—or to one’s worst? Today’s peopleprefer to protect their own vices and weaknesses rather than fight for theirvirtues. This makes one point obvious: the “gray” people are the guiltiest androttenest of all; they make evil possible. There is no such thing as a “mixed”moral position—it is only the evil that can profit by and win in a “mixedpsychology” (or “mixed morality”)—just as in a “mixed economy.”What causes that? Lack of self-esteem and, therefore, of self-confidence. Whatis the cause of that lack? Lack of moral knowledge—but only in part; morefundamentally, it is the indulgence of emotions at the expense of reason: abasic, volitional psycho-epistemological issue which does not depend on thecontent of one’s knowledge. January 2, 1964TO LORNE DIETERLINGTheme: Loyalty to values, as a sense of life.My earlier notes are all wrong. The approach I projected is too intellectual—tooexplicit. The novel has to deal with the generalized terms of a “sense oflife”—i.e., with emotional metaphysics. The nature of the assignment (and thetrick) is to concretize the story, while keeping it abstract.This is why Hella has to be a dancer. Convey the meaning of music and dancing asthe esthetic expression of a “sense of life.”KEY POINTS OF THE STORY:Hella’s love for Lome.His engagement party to Gloria—and the scene between Hella and Lome on her wayhome.Her “private universe.”His betrayal of her (and of his values).Her career disaster.Her walk—and her triumph.TENTATIVE OUTLINE[The first part of the outline, through the deterioration of Lorne’s marriage toGloria, has been omitted here because it is the same as earlier.]Gloria and the “playboy.” Lome’s request. The “playboy‘s” murder. Hella aswitness (or suspected witness).The scene between Gloria and Lorne: her demand. Hella receives Lome’s note.Back to the present: the scene in the hotel room.Hella’s dismissal from the University (a kind of “trial scene”). Herdebut—dancing for a single man in the audience. Her walk home—Lome follows her,their final reunion. April 28, 1965TO LORNE DIETERLING (“SENSE OF LIFE ”)Emotional abstractions. An emotional abstraction consists of all those thingswhich have the power to make one experience a certain emotion. For instance: aheroic man, the New York skyline, flying in a plane, a sunlit “stylized”landscape, ecstatic music, an achievement of which one is proud. (These samethings will give an emotion of terror and guilt to a man with the wrongpremises; all except the last, which is impossible to him.) An opposite example:a humble or depraved man, an old village or ruins, “walking on the moors,” adesolate landscape, folk songs or atonal music, the failure of someone else’sachievement or ambition.(The root and common denominator in all these things is self-esteem or lack ofit; pro-man or anti-man; pro-life or anti-life.) January 1, 1966TO LORNE DIETERLINGThe two basic “sense of life” music numbers are: “Will o’ the Wisp” (as thetriumph, the achieved sense of life) and “La Traviata Overture” (as the waythere). To be used as dance numbers:“La Traviata Overture ”: the first dance described—the dance of rising, withoutever moving from one spot—done by means of her arms and body—ending on“Dominique’s statue” posture, as “higher than raised arms,” as the achieved, asthe total surrender to a vision and, simultaneously, “This is I.” (The open, thenaked, the “without armor.”) (Possibly, her first meeting with him.)“Will o’ the Wisp ”: the triumph—the tap dance and ballet combined—my totalsense of life. (Probably, danced in a low-grade dive, with Lome present.Possibly, projected as a dance, with him, much earlier, as his sense of life,too; thus, a crucial turning point in his realization of the way he is going,the wrong distance he has traveled.)“Destiny Valse”: done at the worst time of her break with him—danced alone,projecting his presence.January 2, 1966TO LORNE DIETERLINGHella MarisLome DieterlingGloria ThorntonAurelius Taylor (the professor, the spiritual “intellectual”)Bruce Beasely (the businessman, the plain brute)Frieda Baker (the flat-foot dancer)The traitorThe playboyThe town—Athens, Maine.281 [rand_9781101137215_oeb_281_r1.jpg]The notes end here.This story has obvious features in common with AR’s early fiction. Theprotagonist is a woman, as was almost always the case prior to The Fountainhead.Further, the heroine’s romantic love is unrequited, as in The Husband I Bought(see The Early Ayn Rand). And, as in The Little Street or the screenplay Ideal,the protagonist faces an “enemy world” in which most people betray their values.So AR has come full circle. She returned at the end to a problem that hadconcerned her from the beginning: how does one maintain a view of life as itcould be and ought to be, while living in a culture that is predominantlyhostile to rational values? At this stage, however, she knows the solution, andserenity has replaced her earlier bitterness. Despite the tragic aspects of ToLome Dieterling, the novel was to have an uplifting theme. AR’s purpose was toshow that Hella, as a profoundly independent person, can be affected “only downto a certain point. ” Though she suffers as a result of the moral treason ofothers, she is ultimately able to preserve the exalted sense of life that is soeloquently expressed in AR’s favorite music.AR regarded philosophy as a means to the achievement of a unique goal: thelighthearted, joyous state of existence that she had envisioned—andexperienced-from the time of her youth.
